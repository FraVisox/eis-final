The world’s richest man is joining investors behind Heliogen, the first company to concentrate sunlight to reach temperatures that are high enough to power heavy industry without carbon emissions. The technology could even reach temperatures of 1,500C to split hydrogen molecules from water to create a fossil-free gas to warm homes, fuel cars and power factories. Bill Gross, the chief executive and founder of California-based Heliogen, said the company represents a technological leap forward in tackling the emissions from industry and transport that make up 75% of the world’s carbon footprint. The company uses software to align a large array of mirrors to reflect sunlight to a target, creating a source of heat almost three times as intense as previous commercial solar systems. Gross said creating low-cost, ultra-high-temperature process heat gives the company an opportunity to make meaningful contributions to solving the climate crisis. The technology can generate temperatures high enough to manufacture cement without fossil fuels. Cement is the world’s third largest source of emissions behind oil and coal, and its production is expected to boom due to urbanisation in developing countries and economic growth. If allowed to continue unchecked, cement production would pose a major threat to the targets set by the Paris agreement, which aims to limit rising temperatures to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. Heliogen has the backing of private equity investors and entrepreneurs who believe its technology could help the most polluting industries to cut their carbon emissions. Early investors in Heliogen include Gates, the venture capital firm Neotribe and the billionaire Patrick Soon-Shiong’s Nant Capital. Gates said he was pleased to be an initial backer of a “promising development in the quest to one day replace fossil fuel”. “Today, industrial processes like those used to make cement, steel, and other materials are responsible for more than a fifth of all emissions,” he added. “These materials are everywhere in our lives but we don’t have any proven breakthroughs that will give us affordable, zero-carbon versions of them. If we’re going to get to zero carbon emissions overall, we have a lot of inventing to do.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2021/may/13/elon-musk-right-dirty-bitcoins-clean-teslas","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-13T18:31:24Z","webTitle":"Musk is right that dirty bitcoins and clean Teslas don’t sit well together","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2021/may/13/elon-musk-right-dirty-bitcoins-clean-teslas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2021/may/13/elon-musk-right-dirty-bitcoins-clean-teslas","fields":{"headline":"Musk is right that dirty bitcoins and clean Teslas don’t sit well together","bodyText":"Elon Musk moves in mysterious ways, so it would be foolish to assume that his new sceptical stance on bitcoin will last longer than his previous cheerleading. But he has now landed on the right spot: bitcoin is an environmental abomination. Researchers at the University of Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance have been chronicling as much for ages. At last count, electronic mining of the cryptocurrency was consuming the same quantity of energy as economies the size of Argentina or the Netherlands. That matters because the super-computers in China, the ones doing the bulk of the mining, are running mostly on electricity generated by coal – the point referenced by Musk. The crypto crew will counter that gold and other “stores of value” (their description-cum-hope) aren’t squeaky-clean either. True, but the difference with bitcoin is that the puzzle-solving method of discovery makes the energy consumption more intense over time. And the plea in some quarters that the computers’ vast appetites will boost the advance of low-cost solar energy is, to put it mildly, elaborate. In the here and now, bitcoin mining is a dirty business. True believers weren’t happy about Musk’s U-turn but Tesla’s shareholders ought to be delighted. The founder’s talent for publicity has saved the company a fortune in advertising, but there were clear dangers in tying his personal brand, and Tesla’s, to a single cryptocurrency. A plunge in the price of the coins would not help his popularity. Being seen to step off the rollercoaster when the price is 25% off its highs but, critically, up massively over 12 months, may prove smart timing. More importantly, dirty bitcoins and clean Teslas just don’t sit well together. That was also true in February, of course, when Tesla was a buyer of $1.5bn-worth and said it would accept payment in the tokens. Don’t expect Musk or the board to explain the about-turn, but it may be a belated recognition that bitcoin’s dire environmental record was a business risk too far for Tesla. Maverick geniuses can get away with a lot, but hypocrisy tends to take a toll in the end. All BT needs to do now is to dig BT had to be cajoled and threatened over many years, but it is finally in a defensible position on fast-fibre broadband rollout. The company will aim to reach 25m premises by the end of 2026, an upgrade on the previous promise of 20m by the mid-to-late part of this decade. The City, in its dull way, preferred to concentrate on the short-term hit to cashflows, the consequence of investing more money sooner. The shares fell 6%. Investors ought to count their blessings. BT has secured its “fair bet” on financial returns – the cause of all the wrangling – and has been gifted “super deductions” on infrastructure spending for two years. Meanwhile, the last lot of 5G licences were secured at lower-than-expected prices. The dividend is back at 7.7p a share. Even the pension fund has become slightly less heavy. The financial cherry would be joint-venture deals with infrastructure investors to fund the rollout to 5m of the 25m premises, but the chief executive, Philip Jansen, is adamant that BT can take the solo route if necessary. When the trenches have been dug and filled, BT should account for somewhere between one half and two-thirds of the UK’s fast-fibre network. The rejigged plan has tilted the odds towards the higher figure, which is surely a good thing for investors. One wonders how the directors, reportedly, find so much to quarrel over. The outlook looks clear for the next half-decade. Just dig. James Anderson’s Amazon tease is intriguing James Anderson, one of the world’s best technology investors, signed off his last set of figures as co-manager of the £15bn Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust by taking a pop at all favourite targets: the “irretrievably broken” fund management industry, media doom-mongers, and more. He’s right on all his main points, of course. The investment game changed when it became possible for companies to grow their revenues at a compound rate of 41% for over two decades, as Amazon has done. It is amazing that Scottish Mortgage’s success has not spawned more fund imitators that hunt for such “extreme upside” opportunities. But there was also a tease on Amazon as Jeff Bezos steps down as chief executive. “Amazon is now seen as good value, safe and acceptable. It no longer has a founder CEO. We fear that in his inimitable terms it is no longer Day 1 in Seattle.” From an investor who knows Bezos’s creation inside out, that’s intriguing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2021/jan/12/uk-nuclear-spacecraft-could-halve-time-of-journey-to-mars-rolls-royce","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2021-01-12T16:46:37Z","webTitle":"UK nuclear spacecraft could halve time of journey to Mars","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/jan/12/uk-nuclear-spacecraft-could-halve-time-of-journey-to-mars-rolls-royce","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2021/jan/12/uk-nuclear-spacecraft-could-halve-time-of-journey-to-mars-rolls-royce","fields":{"headline":"UK nuclear spacecraft could halve time of journey to Mars","bodyText":"British spacecraft could travel to Mars in half the time it now takes by using nuclear propulsion engines built by Rolls-Royce under a new deal with the UK Space Agency. The aerospace company hopes nuclear-powered engines could help astronauts make it to Mars in three to four months, twice as fast as the most powerful chemical engines, and unlock deeper space exploration in the decades to come. The partnership between Rolls-Royce and the UK Space Agency will bring together planetary scientists to explore how nuclear energy could be used to “revolutionise space travel”, according to the government. Dr Graham Turnock, the chief executive of the UK Space Agency, said using nuclear power in space was “a gamechanging concept that could unlock future deep-space missions that take us to Mars and beyond”. “This study will help us understand the exciting potential of atomic-powered spacecraft, and whether this nascent technology could help us travel further and faster through space than ever before,” he said. The government hopes nuclear technology could transform space travel by providing plentiful energy to power the spacecraft as they travel further from the sun and are unable to make use of solar energy. Rolls-Royce has provided the nuclear propulsion technology used to power the Royal Navy’s submarine fleet for 60 years. The company hopes to build several small modular nuclear reactors on land too, to help meet the UK’s expected growth in demand for electricity. Dave Gordon, the head of Rolls-Royce’s defence division, said the UK’s “pioneering project” into nuclear space propulsion could make use of “a real niche UK capability” by building on Britain’s existing nuclear industry and supply chain. Britain’s plan to build atomic spacecraft will not be the first. US scientists first tested nuclear spacecraft technology in the Nevada desert in the 1950s and 1960s before the programme was cancelled in 1971. The US has undertaken several nuclear space programmes in recent decades. Late last year the US government issued a new space policy directive to advance Nasa’s nuclear developments. Amanda Solloway, the UK’s science minister, said nuclear power “presents transformative possibilities for space exploration”, and could help to create jobs. The study with Rolls-Royce could help to “propel our next generation of astronauts into space faster and for longer, significantly increasing our knowledge of the universe”, she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/nov/22/chemicals-industry-pollution-emissions-climate","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-11-22T11:00:24Z","webTitle":"How the chemicals industry’s pollution slipped under the radar","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/22/chemicals-industry-pollution-emissions-climate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/nov/22/chemicals-industry-pollution-emissions-climate","fields":{"headline":"How the chemicals industry’s pollution slipped under the radar","bodyText":"It’s one of the biggest industries in the world, consumes more than 10% of fossil fuels produced globally and emits an estimated 3.3 gigatons of greenhouse gas emissions a year, more than India’s annual emissions – yet the chemicals sector has largely slipped under the radar when it comes to climate. This sprawling industry produces a huge range of products, many of which support other industries – pesticides for agriculture, acids for mining, lubricants for machinery, ingredients in cleaning agents, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals and plastics. While the industry has an important role to play in moving to low-carbon economies – providing coatings for solar panels, lightweight plastics to reduce vehicles’ energy consumption and insulating materials for buildings – it’s also hugely carbon intensive and predicted to become more so. Oil companies have been betting on chemicals as a way to remain profitable as the world pledges to turn away from fossil fuel energy. The International Energy Agency predicted that petrochemicals could account for 60% of oil demand in the next decade. The chemicals sector is the largest industrial user of oil and gas but it has the third-largest carbon footprint – behind steel and cement – because only about half of the fossil fuels that the industry consumes are burned for their energy. The rest is used as feedstock for products such as plastics with the emissions released only when these products reach the end of their lives, for example, when waste plastic packaging or an old mattress is incinerated. Lowering the industry’s emissions is possible but technically daunting. Plus this large, complex industry, which supports millions of jobs worldwide, has significant political and economic clout. “They’ve become a bit of an untouchable sector for many politicians,” said Jan-Justus Andreas, who leads industrial policy at the Norwegian environmental non-profit Bellona Europa. Yet the chemicals industry is finding itself increasingly under scrutiny – both from nations that need to meet ambitious emissions reduction targets and from researchers, scientists and campaigners calling on the industry to cut its polluting products. Moving away from dirty energy One way to lower emissions is to focus on chemical plants – improving efficiency and switching to low-carbon energy. Most of the industry’s direct carbon dioxide emissions come from burning fossil fuels to power chemical transformations, many of which take place at high temperatures and pressures. These emissions could be significantly reduced if the industry moves away from dirtier fuels such as coal. If renewable wind or solar energy is available, certain chemical processes that are already driven by electricity, such as the production of chlorine used to make other materials such as PVC pipes or solvents like chloroform, could immediately become low carbon. And chemists continue to look for ways to power traditionally heat-driven chemical transformations with electricity instead – such as the process of converting nitrogen to ammonia, mostly used for fertilizer, which requires temperatures of about 500C (932F). While chemical companies are counting on efficiency improvements and investing in renewable energy to meet their climate goals, many chemical products themselves cannot be decarbonized because they are made of carbon, said Martin Scheringer, an environmental chemist at the public research university ETH Zurich. Removing fossil fuels from the raw materials used to create carbon-based chemicals and materials is crucial, said Jonatan Kleimark of the non-profit ChemSec. Kleimark likens products made from fossil fuels – such as clothes, toys and paints – to a carbon debt, because the carbon embedded within them will only be emitted in the future. “The longer we wait to change, the larger debt we will build, and that will be very hard to do something about if we don’t start,” Kleimark said. To stop adding to this debt, chemicals and materials could be made with sources of carbon that are already above ground, such as plants. Bioplastics – made with plant materials such as sugar, corn or seaweed – are booming, for example, as companies and scientists try to remove fossil fuels from plastic production. Another idea is to turn waste products into raw materials for the chemical industry. Chemists have been using agricultural waste or waste plastics – even the ultimate waste material, carbon dioxide – as feedstocks. A Berlin-based startup, Made of Air, is attempting to create plastics from wood waste, while an Icelandic company, Carbon Recycling International, turns captured carbon dioxide emissions into methanol, used in fuels and for making other chemicals such as formaldehyde. ‘Why don’t you deal with someone else first?’ But all these ideas – especially those involving a shift in feedstocks – are very hard to implement. Technologies to turn agricultural or plastic waste into new chemicals are still unproven on a large scale and using carbon dioxide as a raw material will require vast amounts of zero-carbon energy. Manufacturers making products with plants rather than fossil fuels need to ensure that they do not create new problems through deforestation, destroying wildlife habitat, raising food prices or increasing the use of water or pesticides. Biomass resources also tend to be more spread out, whereas traditionally, chemical plants stay close to where fossil fuel resources are easily accessible. “With renewable feedstocks, you will need to reestablish new supply chains,” said Zhanyun Wang, a senior scientists at ETH Zurich. In addition to delivering a steady stream of renewable raw materials to chemical plants, the new supply chains would need to be competitive with well-established ones making products from fossil fuels at low prices, Wang said. The clean power infrastructure requirements alone are tremendous. Electrifying Europe’s chemicals sector would require 4,900 terawatts of renewable electricity, according to an estimate by the European Chemical Industry Council, almost double the total amount of electricity Europe generated in 2019. “If you are a lobbyist for the chemical sector, showing those numbers helps you to put your head down again and say, ‘Look, firstly I’m too important and valuable, and secondly, it’s really, really difficult to deal with me, so why don’t you deal with someone else first,’” Andreas said. Currently, that someone else refers to the cement and steel industries, said Andreas. The internal competition between the three industries to avoid scrutiny is unhelpful, he said, because they could benefit from developing an industrial strategy together. The exhaust gases from steel and cement plants could serve as valuable feedstocks for chemical plants. All three industries need large-scale renewable electricity or carbon capture facilities, which require significant investment. The financial risks involved in building these new facilities could be mitigated, Andreas said, if the new facilities serve multiple operations instead of a single steel mill or fertilizer plant. Governments could also help build the necessary infrastructure or help companies gain access to renewable feedstocks, said Rebecca Dell, who directs the industry program at the San Francisco-based ClimateWorks Foundation. But with less than 30 years to 2050, time is short. If there are no delays, typically, it takes about seven years for companies to get a new process up and running, Dell said. “We have to move a lot faster.” Simplifying products One important, but neglected, lever for cutting emissions from the chemical sector is to simply use and produce fewer chemicals. “That would lead very directly to a reduction in CO2 emissions and also reduce the toxification of humans and the environment,” Scheringer said. The overuse of materials such as plastics, fertilizers and other synthetic chemicals has caused devastating effects on ecosystems and human health. Plastic debris chokes waterways and wildlife, fertilizer-laden runoff from fields can cause algal blooms and create dead zones in coastal areas. These impacts have led policymakers and consumers to cut back – for instance, many cities and countries now have prohibitions on some single-use plastics. “It’s an attempt to reduce plastic itself as a pollutant in the landscape, more than concerns about greenhouse gases, but we can make simultaneous progress on more than one front,” said Dell. Studies have also found that being more precise about applying fertilizer could save farmers money and keep greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere. It is less straightforward to cut back on some of the chemicals that are used to make consumer products, but Scheringer, Wang and others have proposed a way to start. Alarmed by the dangers of some cancer-causing PFAS, also known as “forever chemicals”, researchers have suggested eliminating PFAS from their “nice-to-have” applications – such as nonstick cookware, long-lasting mascara, or water-repellent surfer shorts that don’t need the level of high performance that “forever chemicals” confer. The researchers recommend that “forever chemicals” be used only in really important products, such as protective gear or medical devices that save lives. The same philosophy could be applied to identify and eliminate other chemicals that have been unnecessarily formulated in products, such as adding antimicrobials to soaps that can already kill germs. Simplifying the chemical ingredients in products has an added benefit: they are easier to take apart or recycle when they are no longer useful. Wang points to the example of carbon black, the chemical used as a pigment in food takeout boxes. The pigment serves no technical function other than providing colour and it is used because food looks more appealing set against a black background, Wang said. But the pigment also means the takeout boxes are invisible to devices that use light to sort plastics at sorting facilities, making them impossible to recycle. The chemical sector is producing more than consumers need, Wang said: “The business model is driven by how many chemicals you sell, it’s not necessarily driven by the added societal value of the chemical.” But the “enormous demand” for products is also a big driver – and perhaps harder to address, said Kleimark. “We’re standing in front of a really, really big challenge because there we cannot rely on technologies, but on changing the way we do things today.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/jan/03/russia-ukraine-war-ukraine-says-enemy-equipment-destroyed-in-makiivka-attack-zelenskiy-warns-of-russian-campaign-of-drone-attacks-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-03T19:00:10Z","webTitle":"Zelenskiy warns of Russian drone campaign as Ukraine claims to have downed almost 500 since September – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/jan/03/russia-ukraine-war-ukraine-says-enemy-equipment-destroyed-in-makiivka-attack-zelenskiy-warns-of-russian-campaign-of-drone-attacks-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/jan/03/russia-ukraine-war-ukraine-says-enemy-equipment-destroyed-in-makiivka-attack-zelenskiy-warns-of-russian-campaign-of-drone-attacks-live","fields":{"headline":"Zelenskiy warns of Russian drone campaign as Ukraine claims to have downed almost 500 since September – as it happened","bodyText":"We’re closing this live blog down now. Thanks for reading. Here’s a summary of the day’s main news events. The UK’s prime minister, Rishi Sunak, reaffirmed his nation’s ongoing support for Ukraine during a call with the latter’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. The two men discussed further defence cooperation, separate statements said. Russia is planning a protracted campaign of attacks with Iranian drones to “exhaust” Ukraine, Zelenskiy warned in his Monday night address. Ukraine, he said, had to “act and do everything so that the terrorists fail in their aim, as all their others have failed.” On national television in Ukraine, Yuriy Ignat, spokesperson for the Ukraine air force, said nearly 500 Russian drones have been downed since September. The Ukrainian strike on a Russian base in Makiivka, Donetsk, has generated “significant criticism of Russian military leadership”, according to a recent report from the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). Several prominent Russian pro-war bloggers and commentators acknowledged the attack on Makiivka, with many suggesting the number of casualties was higher than the figures officially reported. The general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces has said up to 10 units of Russian military equipment of various types in occupied Makiivka were damaged or destroyed. Ukraine almost never publicly claims responsibility for attacks on Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine, but its military reported the Makiivka attack as “a strike on Russian manpower and military equipment”. Satellite images taken by the US-based company Planet Labs that purportedly show the aftermath of the strike on Makiivka have circulated online, showing the building that allegedly housed the Russian troops before and after it was hit. The images, dated 2 January, show a building almost completely razed to the ground. Unverified footage posted online of the aftermath of the blast also showed a huge building reduced to smoking rubble. It is unlikely Russia will achieve a significant breakthrough near Bakhmut in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region in the coming weeks, the UK Ministry of Defence has said. This is due in part to Russia likely conducting offensive operations in the area at only platoon or section level, it said. The French prime minister, Élisabeth Borne, said this morning she was more confident over the situation of French energy supplies for the next few weeks. She cited lower consumption and an increase in nuclear output capacity. Nato countries will discuss their defence spending targets in the coming months as some of them call for turning a 2% target into a minimum figure, the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, told the German news agency DPA. Ukraine and the European Union will hold a summit in Kyiv on 3 February to discuss financial and military support, Zelenskiy’s office said on Monday. Daily life continues in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, even amid power cuts and as fighting rages on in the country. In Bakhmut, the scene of heavy recent fighting, civilians have been helping out at a humanitarian aid centre that provides food, warm drink, medicine and other emergency supplies to people in need. Ukraine’s government plans to accelerate the country’s transition to clean and green energy as it tries to strengthen the national power network against Russian attacks, says the prime minister, Denys Shmyhal. Ukraine faces an energy shortage and blackouts following Russian missile and drone strikes, which Ukrainian officials say have damaged about 40% of the national energy infrastructure. Reuters quotes Shmyhal as telling a meeting of the Ukrainian government: Plans for the decarbonisation of energy and the green transformation remain relevant. The war has made these challenges even more urgent. We will use the potential of renewable energy – solar, wind, hydrogen generation, hydrogen technologies – more actively. The Russian attacks push us towards fundamental reform – building a decentralised energy system. It will be less vulnerable to enemy attacks. Shmyhal said creating the conditions to build mini-electricity stations and small generating facilities would be a priority this year. The government is also focused on repairing damage and strengthening security at energy facilities, especially at nuclear power plants, he said. Industry experts say Ukrainian solar plants see their power generation falling in winter, and that the clean power sector has experienced significant destruction during 10 months of war. The energy minister, German Galushchenko, said in October that up to about 50% of Ukraine’s solar energy facilities, and about 90% of wind farms, were out of service because they had been damaged during the war or occupied by Russian forces. Russian troops have spent weeks attempting to capture a single house in the contested Donbas city of Bakhmut, the head of the Russian Wagner mercenary group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, has said. In a grim video released over the new year, Prigozhin – an ally of Putin – was filmed visiting a basement near the eastern front filled with the bodies of his fighters, many of them convicts, who had been killed during the bitter fighting for the city, a key Russian objective since the summer. In the makeshift morgue, Prigozhin is seen being shown bodies on stretchers and in body bags. One pile of bagged bodies can be seen stacked shoulder-high in the corner of one of the rooms. Prigozhin can be heard saying: Their contract has finished, they will go home next week. These are getting ready to be sent. We all work during New Year’s Eve. Here lie Wagner fighters who died at the front. They are now being put in zinc coffins and they will return home. Zelenskiy and Sunak spoke today and discussed the UK’s ongoing support for Ukraine, as well as the provision of more supplies to help the latter in its fight against Russian invaders, Downing Street confirms. A No 10 statement released just now reads: The prime minister spoke to the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, this afternoon. The leaders discussed the abhorrent drone attacks on Ukraine in recent days, and the prime minister said the thoughts of the UK were with the Ukrainian people as they continued to live under such bombardment. The prime minister said Ukraine could count on the UK to continue to support it for the long term, as demonstrated by the recent delivery of more than 1,000 anti-air missiles. Work was also under way to provide further equipment in the coming weeks and months to secure Ukraine’s victory on the battlefield, the prime minister added. Discussing the Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) summit in Latvia last month, the prime minister thanked the president for joining virtually and said the UK and JEF partners were working closely to provide the vital equipment requested. The leaders agreed to stay in close touch in the coming weeks. In a message posted to Telegram, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said that he and the UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, have taken “concrete decisions”. Zelenskiy posted: Together with prime minister of the United Kingdom Rishi Sunak, we discussed further defence cooperation. We agreed to intensify our efforts to bring victory closer this year already. We already have concrete decisions for this. Mykhailo Podolyak, adviser to the head of the office of president of Ukraine, has restated Ukraine’s position on peace talks on social media. He has tweeted: The key thing must be kept in mind. Especially when you want to “talk about war or negotiations”. The Russian Federation came to a foreign country to kill its citizens. The Russian Federation is massively shelling Ukraine. The Russian Federation is trying to seize part of foreign territory. The Russian Federation is the only author of an unprovoked war in Europe. Russia state-owned media RIA is reporting the claims of the Russian defence ministry to have destroyed two Ukrainian Himars launchers near Kramatorsk, which is in the region of Donetsk, one of the areas of Ukraine which Russia claims to have annexed. RIA quotes a military report stating: In the course of a counter-battery fight in the area of the city of Kramatorsk, positions were opened and two launchers of the US-made HIMARS multiple launch rocket system were destroyed, from which shelling of settlements in the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) was carried out. Prior to the claim of annexation, the DPR was only recognised as a legitimate authority by three UN member states: Russia, Syria and North Korea. Young acrobats from circus schools across Ukraine dazzled audiences in Budapest this week when the city hosted a Ukrainian youth circus festival to showcase the talents of children forced by the war to train underground or without electricity. Reuters reports that, after months of practice in their home cities of Kharkiv, Kyiv, Dnipro, Odesa and Donetsk, the children aged between six and 17 years gave more than 30 performances alongside competitors from Hungary, Switzerland, Mexico and Italy at Budapest’s Capital Circus. Its director, Peter Fekete, said: As these children are training in air raid shelters by candlelight from morning to night, [we thought] there must be a place where they can show their talent and knowledge. We must give them faith that it is worth doing the work, it is worth the training, so we stopped our regular programme for two days this January and … handed over the circus to our Ukrainian friends. Circus artist Mariia Kravchenko, 13, from the eastern Ukrainian city of Dnipro, had trained for the circus festival in unheated shelters amid the Russian attacks. “I trained in the circus in Dnipro but we have the war in Ukraine and I was training with air raid sirens [on] and it was hard,” she said with a faint smile, as she prepared to perform her hula hoop show dressed in Ukrainian colours with flowers in her hair. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, reaffirmed that Ukraine “needs our support more than ever”, as he hosted Sweden’s prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, in Paris, with Sweden having taken over the rotating presidency of the European Union. Germany’s defence ministry is looking into whether it will need to extend its leadership of a Nato joint task force beyond 2023 due to delays by the UK, the next country in line to lead, according to local media reports that cite German army sources. Germany’s Bundeswehr took over command of the Very High Joint Readiness Task Force (VJTF) for 12 months, which requires the leader to be operational within 48 to 72 hours. Germany is providing up to 2,700 soldiers as lead nation. According to the sources, the UK will only be able to take over leadership in 2024, several months later than planned, the news outlet said. The VJTF was created after Russia unilaterally annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and was deployed for the first time for collective defence after Russia invaded Ukraine in February. It was not immediately clear what effect a delay in change of leadership might have on operations. The leadership position is rotated among members to share the burden that it places on the military, and brigades are bound to the VJTF for three years to help with the stand-up, stand-by and stand-down phases, meaning they are not available for other missions or international obligations. “There is nothing official I can tell you about this at the moment,” a German defence ministry spokesperson told Reuters. The UK’s defence ministry has not responded to the news agency’s request for comment. Russia is planning a protracted campaign of attacks with Iranian drones to “exhaust” Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskiy warned in his Monday night address. Ukraine, he said, had to “act and do everything so that the terrorists’ fail in their aim, as all their others have failed.” On national television in Ukraine, Yuriy Ignat, spokesperson for the air force command of the armed forces of Ukraine, has claimed that nearly 500 Russian drones have been downed since September.

This is due in part to Russia likely conducting offensive operations in the area at only platoon or section level, it said. The French prime minister, Élisabeth Borne, said this morning she was more confident over the situation of French energy supplies for the next few weeks, citing lower consumption and an increase in nuclear output capacity. Nato countries will discuss their defence spending targets in the coming months as some of them call for turning a 2% target into a minimum figure, Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg told the German news agency DPA. Ukraine and the European Union will hold a summit in Kyiv on 3 February to discuss financial and military support, Zelenskiy’s office said in a statement on Monday. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later on. I am handing you over to my colleague Kevin Rawlinson for the next few hours. Ukrinform reports that on national television in Ukraine, Yuriy Ignat, spokesperson for the air force command of the armed forces of Ukraine, has claimed that nearly 500 Russian drones have been downed since September. Ukrinform quotes him telling viewers: We will prepare. We shoot down drones. As you can see, 84 drones were shot down in two days – on New Year’s Eve and the following day. 100% were shot down by air defence forces. Such results have never been achieved before. The number of drones is already approaching 500 since September 11. That is 500 drones shot down. If you missed it overnight, there was a moment on French TV when a blast occurred behind a journalist who was doing a live two-way from Kramatorsk. Oleksiy Kuleba, the governor of Kyiv, has posted to Telegram to reiterate that residents must act if they hear air alarms. He writes: It is also important to keep safety in mind at all times, especially during the holidays. The enemy does not manage to spoil the holiday for Ukrainians. Don’t lose your vigilance. If you hear an alarm, go to safe places. He also reiterated the message that the power supply is expected to work continuously at the moment, but cautioned over consumption, saying: As of now, the Kyiv region is fully supplied with electricity. Emergency and planned blackouts are not introduced in the region. However, this situation may change. It is extremely necessary to continue economical consumption. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has posted a selection of images from the war to Telegram alongside the following message: There are no small actions in a big war. There are no unnecessary ones. Each of us is a fighter. Each of us is a front. Each of us is the basis of defence. We fight as one team – the whole country, all our regions. It is unseasonably warm in Ukraine today, and for that reason Ukrenergo has predicted that there will be no planned electricity outages before 2pm. However, Suspilne reports that Ukraine’s energy company has predicted that consumption limits will be required in the afternoon and evening as demand rises. Here is an image out of Kyiv from the last few days showing Ukrainian armed forces receiving a van from a repair shop that has been converted to doing work for the war effort. The Autocomp shop formerly specialised in collision repairs, but that changed after Russia invaded in February and volunteers reached out about preparing vehicles to send to the front. Suspilne, Ukraine’s public broadcaster, is reporting details of attacks on Kherson yesterday. It has posted to Telegram: During the day of 2 January, the Russian army shelled the Kherson region 79 times. Two people died, nine were injured, said the head of [the region, Yaroslav] Yanushevich. The Russian army attacked Kherson itself 32 times. Shells hit a car dealership, a utility company, private and apartment buildings. Reuters has a quick snap to say that the French prime minister, Élisabeth Borne, said this morning she was more confident over the situation of French energy supplies for the next few weeks, citing lower consumption and an increase in nuclear output capacity. Dmytro Zhyvytskyi, the governor of Sumy region, has also updated residents on events overnight. He claimed Russia fired at three settlements, including an attack on railway infrastructure in Krasnopillia. He gave no details of any casualties. Maksym Kozytskyi, the governor of Lviv, has posted his daily operational briefing for residents on Telegram. He says that overnight there were no air alarms in his western region of Ukraine, and that the electricity supply has no scheduled blackouts for today. The Russian state-owned media agency Tass is reporting that the drone company Filming from the Air has said it is supplying new small imaging drones to the Russian military for use in Ukraine. Tass quotes a company spokesperson saying that the drones are much cheaper than the Chinese-manufactured equivalent that Russia has been using, and that each “is equipped with a compact thermal imager capable of detecting the presence of enemy forces at any time of the day, and also has the ability to be equipped with a grenade-drop device”. Tass reports that the company first presented the model in November at an exhibition in Moscow. Nato countries will discuss their defence spending targets in the coming months as some of them call for turning a 2% target into a minimum figure, Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg told the German news agency DPA, according to a Reuters report. Some allies are strongly in favour of turning the current 2% target into a minimum,” DPA quoted Stoltenberg as saying in an interview published on Tuesday. Stoltenberg said that he would head the negotiations. We will meet, we will have ministerial meetings, we will have talks in capitals,” he said. He did not say which Nato countries were calling for a more ambitious target, according to DPA. The Nato chief said he aimed to reach an agreement no later than Nato’s next regular summit, which will be in Lithuania’s capital, Vilnius, on 11-12 July. Ukraine and the European Union will hold a summit in Kyiv on 3 February to discuss financial and military support, Zelenskiy’s office said in a statement on Monday. The parties discussed expected results of the next Ukraine-EU summit to be held on 3 February in Kyiv and agreed to intensify preparatory work,” the statement read. Zelenskiy said he also expects the first tranche of EU macro-financial aid to arrive in January after speaking to European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen on Monday. He thanked Von der Leyen for her support, adding the €18bn ($19bn) worth of financial assistance “is extremely important right now, when Russia is trying to gather new forces for aggression”. Russia is planning a protracted campaign of attacks with Iranian drones to “exhaust” Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy warned in his Monday night address. It is probably banking on exhaustion. Exhausting our people, our anti-aircraft defences, our energy.” Ukraine, he said, had to “act and do everything so that the terrorists’ fail in their aim, as all their others have failed.” Zelenskiy said the country’s forces have shot down more than 80 drones since the start of 2023. The Ukrainian military claimed to have destroyed 40 Russian drones heading for Kyiv on Sunday night alone, with 15 destroyed over neighbouring regions, three in the Kyiv region and 22 directly over the capital. It is unlikely Russia will achieve a significant breakthrough near Bakhmut in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region in the coming weeks, the UK Ministry of Defence has said. This is due in part to Russia likely conducting offensive operations in the area at only platoon or section level. “In mid-December, Russian military and Wagner proxy forces likely increased the frequency of their infantry assaults around the Donetsk town of Bakhmut. However, many of these operations were poorly supported,” the ministry noted in its latest intelligence report. “Over the last 10 days, Ukraine has committed significant reinforcements to defend the sector and the frequency of Russian assaults have likely reduced from the peak in mid-December. Both sides have suffered high casualties.” A quick snap here from the general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces, which has just released its daily operational report. The military confirmed an attack by Ukraine’s forces on 31 December on “the enemy’s life force and military equipment” in the town of Chulakivka in the Ukraine’s southern Kherson region. The enemy’s losses were about 500 soldiers wounded and killed,” the report said. In the Kherson direction, Russian forces “do not stop shelling settlements along the right bank of the Dnipro River”, the force added. The Ukrainian strike on a Russian base in Makiivka, Donetsk, has generated “significant criticism of Russian military leadership”, according to a recent report from the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). In its latest update, the US thinktank said: Russian MoD is likely attempting to deflect the blame for its poor operational security (OPSEC) on to Donetsk People’s Republic (DNR) officials and mobilised forces, but its vague acknowledgment of the strike nonetheless generated criticism towards the Russian military command. Such profound military failures will continue to complicate Putin’s efforts to appease the Russian pro-war community and retain the dominant narrative in the domestic information space.” A number of prominent Russian pro-war bloggers and commentators acknowledged the attack on Makiivka, with many suggesting the number of casualties was higher than the figures officially reported. “What happened in Makiivka is horrible,” wrote Archangel Spetznaz Z, a Russian military blogger with more than 700,000 followers on Telegram. Who came up with the idea to place personnel in large numbers in one building, where even a fool understands that even if they hit with artillery, there will be many wounded or dead?” he wrote. Commanders “couldn’t care less” about ammunition stored in disarray on the battlefield, he said. “Each mistake has a name.” The attack sparked renewed criticism among pro-invasion bloggers and some officials over the state of Russia’s military and the decision to use civilian infrastructure to house soldiers. Housing personnel in buildings instead of housing them in shelters directly aids the enemy. From the situation in Makiivka it is necessary to draw the toughest conclusions,” wrote Andrey Medvedev, an ultra-conservative journalist who is deputy chairman of Moscow’s city parliament. Bezsonov called for the punishment of “those guilty of the decision to use the facility. The Donbas has enough objects with strong infrastructure where you can house army personnel.” Vladlen Tatarsky, a military blogger whom Putin met in the Kremlin in September, called for a tribunal for the Russian military leadership, describing Moscow’s top officers as “untrained idiots”, in a post on Telegram. Russia’s acknowledgment of scores of deaths in one incident was almost without precedent. Moscow rarely releases figures for its casualties, and when it does the figures are typically low – it acknowledged just one death from among a crew of hundreds when Ukraine sank its flagship cruiser Moskva in April. Satellite images taken by US-based company Planet Labs dated 20 December and 2 January show the aftermath of Ukraine’s strike on the Russian-held city of Makiivka. The vocational school reportedly housed recently mobilised troops sent by Moscow when it was hit on 1 January. The general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces has said up to 10 units of Russian military equipment of various types in occupied Makiivka were damaged or destroyed in a statement published late on Monday. Ukraine almost never publicly claims responsibility for attacks on Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine. But its military reported the Makiivka attack as “a strike on Russian manpower and military equipment”. On December 31, up to 10 units of enemy military equipment of various types were destroyed and damaged” in the town of Makiivka in the eastern region of Donetsk. It said the human “losses” were still being established. Ukraine’s military command initially claimed up to 400 Russian soldiers were killed in the incident in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region. “Santa packed about 400 corpses in bags,” a statement from Ukraine’s department of strategic communications of the armed forces read on Sunday. Russia’s defence ministry gave a much lower figure and in a rare admission on Monday claimed 63 Russian soldiers died in the strike, the biggest loss of life reported by Moscow so far. The ministry said four US-supplied Himars missiles struck “a temporary deployment facility”. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I’ll be bringing you all the latest developments as they unfold over the next few hours. Following the deadly strike on the Russian-occupied city of Makiivka on New Year’s Day, the general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces said up to 10 units of Russian military equipment in the Donetsk city were damaged or destroyed in a statement published late on Monday. Ukraine almost never publicly claims responsibility for attacks on Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine. But its military reported the Makiivka attack as “a strike on Russian manpower and military equipment”.

Russia’s defence ministry gave a much lower figure, claiming 63 Russian soldiers died in the strike, the biggest loss of life reported by Moscow so far. The Guardian has been unable to confirm an official number of casualties. As Ukraine reels from a series of devastating strikes aimed at its key infrastructure this week, its president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has warned of further attacks to come. In his latest Monday night address, Zelenskiy said Russia plans a protracted campaign of attacks with Iranian drones to “exhaust” the war-torn country.

If you have just joined us, here are all the latest developments: The general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces said up to 10 units of Russian military equipment of various types in occupied Makiivka were damaged or destroyed. “On December 31, up to 10 units of enemy military equipment of various types were destroyed and damaged” in the town of Makiivka in the eastern region of Donetsk, the general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces said in a statement published late on Monday. It said the human “losses” were still being established. The attack on Makiivka killed dozens of recently mobilised troops sent by Moscow, in what could be one of the deadliest known incidents involving Russian conscripts so far. Ukraine’s military command said up to 400 Russian soldiers were killed in the incident in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region, but this claim was not independently verified. Russia’s defence ministry said 63 Russian soldiers died when Ukraine hit “a temporary deployment facility” with four US-supplied Himars missiles. Satellite images taken by US-based company Planet Labs that purportedly showing the aftermath of the strike on Makiivka have circulated online, showing the building that allegedly housed the Russian troops before and after it was hit. The images, dated 2 January, show a building almost completely razed to the ground. Unverified footage posted online of the aftermath of the blast also showed a huge building reduced to smoking rubble. Several waves of Russian drones targeted critical infrastructure in Ukraine’s capital Kyiv and surrounding areas early on Monday morning. Debris from a destroyed drone hit Kyiv’s northeastern Desnianskiy district, wounding a 19-year-old man who was later taken to hospital, the city’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said. Energy infrastructure facilities in the city were damaged, causing power and heating outages. Ukraine claims to have destroyed 40 Russian drones heading for Kyiv on Sunday night, with 15 destroyed over neighbouring regions, three in the Kyiv region and 22 directly over the capital.

Our teacher crouches before us, making marks in the sand to demonstrate how a paw or hoof print might be slightly turned out to indicate that the creature was looking over its shoulder in fear as it ran. My children are fascinated, learning how to spot clues to the speed, type and even sex of the animal, and join in excitedly when shown how to mimic the gait of different species: the galloping scamper of rodents, racing big cats and the slow lumber of a bear. There’s been no need to travel to the African savannah for such lessons, only a giant white yurt in a field in West Sussex, where every summer weekend, small-scale, family-friendly rewilding camps are taking place. A programme of nature and wellbeing workshops varies each week, but might include fire making, archery, plant identification, yoga and creative writing, with acoustic music at night. These Wild Weekends are run on the Chiddinglye estate near West Hoathly on a plateau in the High Weald, a rolling landscape of fields and ancient woodland between London’s unlovely southern sprawl and Brighton. Privately owned by the eco-minded Earl of Limerick, the estate comprises hundreds of acres including a working wheat, sheep and solar energy farm. Arriving on Friday night with my children, a friend and her son, we just had time to lug our stuff through the mud using trolleys helpfully waiting at the top of the parcel of fields and woodland, to build our nests and muster dinner, before bats began to whir and darkness fell. People drew their folding chairs around the communal fire to hear guitarist Magic Bird sing ditties about moons and gods into the eddying smoke. The next night’s music was livelier, as foot-stomping collective Folkadelix got everyone dancing, telling the kids they were part of the band as they gleefully rattled bells. By the time we’d finished washing up Saturday’s breakfast, our efficiently child-free tent neighbours had already completed morning yoga, a meditation session and qigong. We made our way across the dewy grass to the Foxes Den tent for “wild kids crafts”, which won out against a workshop about the secret language of birds (my preference) and bow making (vetoed on account of a £35pp surcharge). While the children rolled clay into the shape of animals and bowls, host Anu described how she lived with her three children in a horse-box van on the site, having adopted a nomadic lifestyle over a decade ago. Covid had made many more families feel ready to commit to a similar alternative lifestyle, she said, and for some this sort of event was an opportunity to explore a different, low-impact way of living. “It doesn’t have the hedonism of other sites here, you can just come to be in nature,” she said. Indeed the atmosphere was extremely chilled. There’s no alcohol for sale on the site itself – though you are free to bring some, and the estate is home to an excellent microbrewery, Missing Link, with a tap room and beer van in a field a short walk away. While campsites around the UK have added bars, DJ sets and activities this summer to tempt those who are usually festival-goers, these weekends appeal to the same market, and were created as a smaller, Covid-era alternative to a wellbeing festival Into The Wild, held on the same site, when it seemed big events wouldn’t be allowed to take place this year (the festival is now still running 27-30 August on a smaller scale than usual). Next, a brilliant falconry display. Falconer Ryan told funny tales while enticing his impressive owls, hawks and falcons to return from the site’s towering totem pole, thrilling the kids by seating them in line with their eyes closed and feel the rush of air as Arnie the Bengal eagle owl flew centimetres above their heads. The audience was more reluctant to get near Alfie, a Canadian horned owl, after hearing he’d once bitten the end of Ryan’s thumbnail off and stuck his talon right through, landing Ryan in hospital for two days with sepsis. We skipped the two-hour foraging class to take advantage of one of the best assets here – a magical glamping site, the Enchanted Glade, which occupies another part of the Chiddinglye estate. Though it’s a separate venture, Wild Weekenders can pay to stay in tipis here or, like us, for sessions at the wild spa. Descending into a mystical-feeling gully of redwoods and huge boulders, we soaked in the wood-burning hot tub, gazing at the forest, took icy outdoor showers and warmed our bones in the wood-fired sauna. I’d recommend going even without the events, and plan to return for my birthday, it’s that special. Partly it’s the otherworldly landscape that makes it so – deep wooded valleys with sandstone outcrops through which trails weave to caverns, boulders, an iron age site and mossy dells overhung with jungly ferns. Ironically, it was while exploring a section that the Earl rightly calls “the land that time forgot” that we felt most rewilded. Nature was getting into the children, capturing their focus. Unprompted, they started monitoring bug life, collecting sticks, roaming further on their own. Like anything with saintly intentions, it’s easy to point out a few inconsistencies and niggles – the fact the Badger’s Den snack bar sells Haribo and pot noodles, that evening entertainment started a bit late for kids at 8pm, some sessions were cancelled, and while delicious, the Red Moon stall’s food (aubergine curry and dal) wasn’t very child-friendly. And it was a shame there were no talks about founder Huw Williams’ project, Wilderlands, which aims to rewild an area of temperate rainforest in Scotland and the South Downs, which these events help raise money for. But this is a new concept finding its feet in a difficult year. As a whole, it was a lovely, slow-paced immersion in a beautiful environment, with enough intelligent programming to tickle the neurons in a wholesome way. We looked back on a peaceful, rewarding weekend, and only had to consider the state of the kids: relaxed, caked in mud, joy rekindled, to appreciate what it’s all about. • The trip was provided by Wild Weekends, which run until 20 September. Weekend tickets from £150 for adults, £60 kids aged 4-16, under-3s free. Saturday ticket with camping £95 for adults, £55 kids (without camping it’s £65/£40). Some weekends are adults only. Glamping at the Enchanted Glade costs from £155 a night for a tipi sleeping two adults and two children; the wild spa is £45 for two hours for six people"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2022/sep/25/flood-warnings-in-nsw-as-geelong-celebrates-10th-afl-grand-final-win-follow-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-25T07:01:26Z","webTitle":"End of fuel excise discount will be tough, Labor admits – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2022/sep/25/flood-warnings-in-nsw-as-geelong-celebrates-10th-afl-grand-final-win-follow-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2022/sep/25/flood-warnings-in-nsw-as-geelong-celebrates-10th-afl-grand-final-win-follow-live","fields":{"headline":"End of fuel excise discount will be tough, Labor admits – as it happened","bodyText":"The time has come to wrap up the blog. Here’s a summary of the day’s top stories: The ongoing flood emergency in NSW is expected to continue, with towns cut off by road and further wet weather across the state forecast in the coming days. Australia’s defence minister, Richard Marles, has condemned the latest nuclear threat from Russia and pledged long-term support for Ukraine. The South Australian premier, Peter Malinauskas, has criticised a proposal for Australia to buy nuclear submarines directly from the US. Tasmanian authorities have removed the majority of whale carcasses on Ocean Beach, in the state’s west, after a mass stranding event on Wednesday. The assistant treasurer, Stephen Jones, said the ending of the fuel excise – due on Wednesday – will be “tough on motorists”. We’ll be back bright and early tomorrow. Ciao! Australian PMs and former PMs to attend Shinzo Abe’s funeral The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, will travel to Japan on Monday to attend the state funeral of former Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe. Joining Albanese will be former prime ministers John Howard, Tony Abbott and Malcolm Turnbull, all of whom worked with Abe during his two terms in government. Abe was Japan’s longest-serving prime minister, serving between 2006 and 2007 and then again between 2012 and 2020. He was assassinated in July. Abe visited Australia five times as prime minister, the last of which was in 2018. Albanese called Abe “a reassuring figure of certainty” during a condolence motion moved in the Australian parliament in July: Our friendship with Japan is one of the central elements of Australia’s international relations. There is warmth at the heart of our friendship, there is respect and there is trust. Mr Abe embodied them all. – from AAP Police find body in North Parramatta A sad update to some news we brought you earlier: police have found the body of a man who went missing after being hit by car in western Sydney. The man’s body was found in a lake in North Parramatta by police divers. Emergency services were called to James Ruse Drive in North Parramatta about 9.40pm on Saturday after the man was struck by a sedan. The driver of the sedan stopped at the scene but the injured man ran off. As police were responding to the crash, they received reports a person was in distress at nearby Lake Parramatta Reserve. The police air wing and dog unit, officers and State Emergency Service personnel started a search on Saturday night. Those efforts were suspended but continued on Sunday morning before divers located the body at about 12.30pm. The body is yet to be formally identified but police believe it is that of the missing man. Investigations are continuing and police have urged anyone with information to come forward. – from AAP Back to football for a minute: winner winner chicken dinner. NSW election polling favours Labor The NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, concedes the next state election will be “very close”, after a Newspoll and Resolve poll released on Saturday showed NSW Labor is on track to claim government for the first time since 2011. AAP has the story. Perrottet told reporters: It’s not for me to commentate on polls … What I will say is that the next election will be a very close election. The premier urged voters to look at the government’s track record in dealing with the aftermath of droughts, bushfires, floods and the pandemic. He denied the John Barilaro New York job saga had taken some of the shine off the Coalition’s record. Perrottet acknowledged some decisions made during the coronavirus pandemic weren’t popular with people in areas such as western Sydney, who lived through some of the strictest lockdown rules in Australia: It has been a difficult time ... for every single person across our state, and we stood side by side with them during that period of time. Whilst we may have not got every decision right during the pandemic, I believe in the main that we did.” The state election is locked in for March next year. The Newspoll showed NSW Labor had 40% of the primary vote against the government on 35% and was ahead on a two-party preferred basis, at 54% to 46%. The Resolve Strategic showed Labor on 43% of the primary vote, compared to 30% for the coalition. But the Resolve also showed the Labor leader, Chris Minns, was running equal to Perrottet on the preferred premier stakes, with both on 28%. The Newspoll was conducted between September 19 and September 22 and the Resolve poll on September 18. Dead whales moved from mass stranding site The Tasmanian department of natural resources and environment has provided an update on the pilot whales that were stranded near the town of Strahan, on the state’s west coast, earlier in the week. With the assistance of local aquaculture companies, department staff have removed the majority of whale carcasses from Ocean Beach, west of Strahan. Around 230 pilot whales were found stranded at Ocean Beach on Wednesday, exactly two years after another mass stranding in the same area. The carcasses were towed out to sea today and released in deep open water, where they are expected to initially drift south and eventually sink and decompose in the Southern Ocean. Incident controller Brendon Clark said the retrieval and removal of the remaining whale carcasses from nearby Macquarie Harbour is now the authorities’ focus: Yesterday, we undertook extensive aerial surveillance of the area, before moving into this part of the operation. During that exercise we located some live whales in Macquarie Harbour and were able to refloat and release these in deep waters. This follows the successful refloating and release of about 44 live whales over the past few days. Members of the public are asked to report any sightings of whales or whale carcasses, which may wash up on local beaches in coming weeks. The whale hotline is: 0427 WHALES. It is an offense to interfere with or possess any part of the deceased animals, so people are urged to stay away from carcasses if they spot them. Thanks Christopher Knaus.

Australian government to announce new security measures for data breaches The ABC is reporting that the government will announce new security measures following the massive Optus data breach this week. The home affairs minister, Clare O’Neil, is expected to pursue reforms to speed up notification for banks and other institutions in the event of a breach, where it is relevant to their customers. The ABC reports O’Neil met with the Australian Signals Directorate and the Cyber Security Centre to discuss the Optus breach. The changes being contemplated mean banks and other institutions would be told immediately of such events in the future, allowing them to better protect customers. But as my colleague Josh Taylor points out, such changes may not have changed much in the Optus case. The company went public within a day of the breach. Australian government to give $2.3m boost to elite rugby league in PNG The Australian government will use $2.3m to boost support for high performance rugby league in Papua New Guinea. The international development minister, Pat Conroy, and the sports minister, Anika Wells, announced the government will partner with the Queensland Rugby League to support the PNG Orchids and Kumuls, the women and men’s teams, enhance opportunities for female players, and develop home-grown high performance expertise. The countries’ prime ministers, Anthony Albanese and James Marape, will attend the prime minister’s XIII rugby league matches tonight in Brisbane. Conroy: Australia is a steadfast partner and friend to Papua New Guinea, our closest neighbour. We are bound by rich historical ties, shared values and our love for rugby league, which has been a binding force in our relationship for over a half a century. The Australian Government has supported rugby league in PNG since 2013 through the community-driven League Bilong Laif program. This new investment extends our support to the high performance level for both men and women. Asked whether the government will extend the relief from the fuel excise introduced by the last government, Jones says: Labor can’t keep going around doing what the former government did, which is write billion-dollar cheques to solve every political problem ... We know that this is going to be tough on motorists. We know we’ve got to make some tough decisions. And I think Australians understand, they can expect the government to take some tough decisions that will be necessary, not only to get us through this period … Over the next few months, where inflation is going through the roof, we have got to have a process where we are working hand-in-hand with the Reserve Bank to ensure the fiscal policy and monetary policy is working hand-in-hand. But I think Australians understand that we cannot keep writing, as the former government did, billion-dollar cheques and letting the debt mount up and up and up. The fuel excise relief is due to end on Wednesday. Assistant treasurer slams opposition for ‘giving up on forming policy’ The assistant treasurer, Stephen Jones, spoke to reporters in Sydney a little earlier. He slammed the shadow finance minister, Jane Hume, for saying the opposition has no policies because it is not in government. An admission from the opposition finance spokesperson this morning that the opposition has no policies. They gave up on governing and now it appears they are giving up on forming the policy basis for a new government. If the Coalition hasn’t got any policies of its own, they should get out of the way of the government [and] limiting its policies. We have got some big challenges. Next week, Jones says the government will be introducing affordable childcare legislation, a bill for the federal integrity commission, and will be attempting to “repair the $1tn of debt and the mess in the budget that the former government has left us”. He says Australia is facing “very tough economic circumstances”. We have got the United States economy, the biggest economy in the world, in all sorts of trouble. The war in Ukraine is pushing up the prices of energy and all other goods. Europe and other economic strife. It is impossible that these things will not impact on Australia. Despite all of these changes, Labor is committed to implementing our election policies, which is to put in place repair to the budget, including dealing with a structural deficit we have inherited from the former government. Selwood mulls future after record-breaking fourth premiership appearance Geelong captain Joel Selwood will take time to contemplate his AFL future, intent on not making an emotional decision in the wake of his latest premiership. Selwood made a record-breaking 40th finals appearance in the grand final thrashing of Sydney – one more than Hawthorn legend Michael Tuck. And the resounding victory made the 34-year-old the first Cats player to feature in four flags. It would be the perfect way for Selwood to sign off, after 355 games across a decorated 16-year career. But coach Chris Scott fanned the flames of possibility on Sunday, impressed by his skipper’s influential display against the Swans. I make it a rule not to speak for our players, and certainly not for our captain, but I didn’t see any problem with the way he played yesterday. Selwood, who debuted in 2007, was the oldest player in Geelong’s grand final line-up as they fielded the oldest team in AFL/VFL history. A decision on the veteran midfielder’s playing future could be made within days. Selwood said: We’ll talk throughout the week with the club and there’s a bit to go through. I’ll speak with people who have been watching me and seeing how I’ve been going. It’s not just a decision for myself. - from AAP Victoria to expand program to help patients with disabilities leave hospital The Victorian government will expand a program helping patients leave hospital while waiting for an NDIS plan. The program is designed to reduce bed block in the state’s hospital by helping those with a disability to transition into home or “home-like” accommodation when they are deemed medically fit but are still waiting on NDIS-funded accommodation. The Victorian government piloted the program in Melbourne. It freed up 3,000 hospital bed days, according to the government. It will now be expanded into regional areas. A statement issued by the health minister, Mary-Anne Thomas, said: Following a successful pilot in metropolitan Melbourne which saw more than 3,000 hospital bed days freed up, the program will expand into regional Victoria for the first time – helping more people with a disability regain their independence and spend more time with their families. After years of NDIS neglect from the Morrison government, delayed discharge times for patients with a disability rose to an average wait of five months, with some spending as long as 600 days waiting for discharge. Australian businessman denies threatening to sell Conflict Islands to China The owner of 21 tropical islands off the coast of Papua New Guinea says he never threatened to sell them to China and his main aim is to save the turtles that nest there. Ian Gowrie-Smith, an Australian businessman and investor, bought the Conflict Islands, which lie less than 1,000km from the Australian coast, almost two decades ago. The largely uninhabited atolls are a nesting ground for critically endangered hawksbill and green turtles, whose breeding season begins within weeks. Some then migrate to the Great Barrier Reef. Gowrie-Smith had been talking about selling the islands or developing partnerships to support the conservation work for several years, and hoped the Australian government could work with PNG, or by supporting a charity, to protect the breeding grounds. The “atoll custodian” told Guardian Australia he contacted the office of the foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, in June to discuss the future of the land, but grew frustrated waiting for a response. “Here’s an opportunity to protect not only the area but the Great Barrier Reef’s conservation – that in itself should have been enough of a reason for someone to reply and say this is a pretty important site,” he said. In August that frustration led him to appear on A Current Affair, which focused on the “danger” if the islands should “fall into Chinese hands”. But Gowrie-Smith said any suggestion he was threatening to sell the islands to China was entirely wrong. “I don’t have any intention of selling these islands to the CCP,” Gowrie-Smith said. Federal Icac legislation to include public interest test for public hearings Sky News is reporting that the integrity commission legislation, set to be introduced next week, will include a public interest test to determine whether public hearings are appropriate for individual investigations. The issue of public hearings has been a key point of contention. Integrity advocates say public hearings are crucial in both promoting government transparency, deterring misconduct, and attracting witnesses and whistleblowers. But opponents say they unfairly tarnish the reputations, before any finding of wrongdoing is made. NSW’s independent commission against corruption also includes a public interest test for conducting public hearings. It’s been a bumper weekend for football, and another Australia vs New Zealand game has just begun at Eden Park – barely a day after an Australian defeat in a different code (poor, humiliated Wallabies). The Socceroos are taking on the All Whites, and you can follow live updates from my colleague Emma Kemp here: Defence minister says timeline for nuclear submarines being prepared amid reports US will expedite delivery to mid-2030s The defence minister, Richard Marles, who spoke earlier today about the war in Ukraine, has also said an interim report on Australia’s military capabilities and a timeline for nuclear submarines are being prepared. Marles says initial reports will be provided to him in November but they won’t be made public. The Wall Street Journal reported the White House is in talks to expedite the delivery of the subs to the mid-2030s by building the first ones in the US in a bid to counter China’s growing military might. A spokesperson for Marles reiterated his comments, saying: It’s important to get the capability as soon as we can. We are still doing the consultations to set out the optimal pathway for Australia to acquire the capability. Marles told Sky News the original timeline for receiving the submarines in the 2040s would have opened a military capability gap: What we’ve sought from the process that’s under way with Aukus right now is not simply to answer the question as to what platform we run with ... but how soon we can get it. Cost would also be considered in the bringing forward of any construction or acquisition, he said. – from AAP Two NSW towns are likely to be isolated for days as the NSW flood emergency continues. State Emergency Service workers performed six rescues and answered 112 calls for help between 6am on Saturday and 6am on Sunday. The towns of Warren and Wee Waa, in the state’s north, are cut off by road and expected to remain that way for days. Emergency services are using aircraft to delivery water, medicine, food and other supplies to residents. The town of Gunnedah continues to be impacted by major flooding as of Sunday morning, however water is slowly receding. The Namoi River peaked at the major flood level of 8.24 metres on Saturday and SES workers were on the ground to assess the damage as it became clear. - from AAP Cycling road race favourite Van der Poel charged with assault Dutch cyclist Mathieu van der Poel, who was the favourite going into the UCI Road World Championships elite men’s road race in Wollongong, was arrested and charged with common assault on Saturday night following an incident at his hotel. He started the race on Sunday morning but retired after less than an hour of racing. Van der Poel is understood to have gone to sleep early ahead of the race, the biggest one-day event on the annual cycling calendar, only to be repeatedly woken by two teenage girls knocking on his door at the hotel in Brighton-Le-Sands, in Sydney’s south. A spokesperson for New South Wales police told Guardian Australia that late on Saturday night, an unidentified 27-year-old man was allegedly involved in a verbal altercation at the hotel. It’s further alleged the man then pushed both teenagers, with one falling to the ground and the other being pushed into a wall, causing a minor graze to her elbow. Hotel management were notified of the incident, who then called police. Officers from St George police area command attended and arrested a 27-year-old man shortly after. The individual, understood to be Van der Poel, was taken to Kogarah police station and charged with two counts of common assault. He was granted conditional bail and is due to appear on Tuesday at the Sutherland local court. NSW premier: ‘close to 60 flood rescues’ NSW premier Dominic Perrottet says the Bureau of Meteorology and the State Emergency Service are working around the clock to support the state through the ongoing flood crisis. We have had over 800 requests for assistance and close to 60 flood rescues during this period of time. I want to continue to stress for people across our state, please follow the instructions of the SES. If there are instructions of evacuation warnings in place please get ready to evacuate, if there are evacuation orders in place, please leave immediately, and if it is flooded, forget it. We say it every time. Please do not drive through floodwaters. Australia’s golden opportunity to expand solar manufacturing Australia has a golden opportunity to expand its solar energy manufacturing capacity as the industry booms and nations scramble to cut their over-dependence on China, a report by the Australian Australian PV Institute Institute says. The country is installing 4GW of solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity a year already but meeting just 3% of that from a local supplier, Adelaide’s Tindo Solar. That annual installation tally, though, is predicted to triple by 2050, particularly if Australia becomes a major supplier of hydrogen produced by renewable energy for export. “We have a pressing need, we have the natural resources and we have a very sizeable market,” the report said. “Unless Australia gains control over the most strategic parts of the PV value chain, the development of any ‘green’ export market will be completely dependent on foreign powers.” Renate Egan, the APVI secretary and head of the Australian Centre for Advanced Photovoltaics, said China would remain an important supplier of panels to Australia but it was important to diversify supply, including by using local firms. “You can liken it to Europe’s reliance on gas from Russia,” Egan said, referring to shortages and soaring gas prices after Moscow imposed export curbs in retaliation to sanctions for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “The world is relying increasingly on solar energy generation for the energy transition [from fossil fuels],” she said. “They’re becoming aware of the risks … in that over 90% of the tech comes from China.” Indigenous Australian objects to be returned by New Zealand museum Four objects from the Warumungu people will be returned from a New Zealand museum to country in the Northern Territory. Two hooked boomerangs (wartilykirri), an adze (palya/kupija) and an axe (ngurrulumuru) were collected by well-known anthropologist Baldwin Spencer and telegraph operator James Field. In the early 1900s, the men amassed more than 6,000 items from central Australia that have since been dispersed around the world. The four objects now in the Tāmaki Paenga Hira Auckland War Memorial Museum will be returned to the Warumungu people later this year. Senior Warumungu man Michael Jones said: They been taken away before us, but we know that they belong to Warumungu people as the new generation. - from AAP Charlie King: Hawthorn racism scandal ‘the low of the low’ Gurindji man and ABC broadcaster Charlie King has spoken out about the Hawthorn racism scandal. He describes the allegations as “the low of the low point” for racism in the AFL. He told ABC’s Offsiders: I had to catch up with other First Nations people and have a bit of a chat about it to try and get my head around it and I’ve had a couple of days to think of it and I’m still reeling thinking, ‘how is this - how is this possible in 2022?’ King said Indigenous Australians of the past had learned to live with racism in the game. But now he says it’s time to draw a line in the sand. I just think we need to understand that there has got to be a place somewhere in discussion for First Nations people. They want to stand up to say, ‘we have had enough’. This has gone on in all our lives. Some of us are getting on in years and we have been children, wrote, played the game and saw racism when we were young and grew up with it and learned to deal with it. It’s a terrible thing. You stand on the ground and you hear racist comments. What do you do? This is not a sentence I thought I’d ever write: A cow has disappeared into the night with Geelong Cats player Jeremy Cameron’s premiership medal. Police search for man hit by car in Sydney New South Wales police are searching for a man who was hit by a car and then fled the scene. He was later seen in distress in a lake at North Parramatta overnight. Police say: A search will resume this morning for a man believed to have gone missing in waters at North Parramatta overnight. About 9.40pm yesterday, emergency services were called to James Ruse Drive, North Parramatta, after reports a person had been hit by a car. Police had been told a man was seen running across the road when he was hit by a sedan. The driver of the sedan stopped to render assistance, before the injured man ran from the scene on foot. As officers were responding to the crash, police were called to nearby Lake Parramatta Reserve, after reports of a person in distress in the lake. Officers from Parramatta police area command – with assistance from PolAir, the dog unit and NSW SES – commenced a search operation to locate the man. The search was suspended and will resume today, with assistance from additional resources including the marine area command and police divers. Inquiries continue. Sticking with the AFL grand final, we’ve just received the ratings from Channel 7. They say they had 3.06 million viewers nationally for the grand final. The full figures are: 3.06 million total viewers nationally; reached 4.74 million on broadcast Presentations: 2.54 million viewers; reached 3.77 million on broadcast On the ground: 2.33 million viewers Pre-match entertainment: 1.05 million viewers Post match: 351,000 viewers That’s actually down on last year, when there were 3.91 million viewers nationally, with 3.01 million in the capital cities. Cats fans celebrate grand final triumph Geelong fans are celebrating their team’s thrashing of the Sydney Swans at Kardinia Park, the Cats’ home ground, today. Looks like a good turnout for the team’s supporters day, which began at 11am. Fans will thank players, hear from the club’s chief executive, coaches, and enjoy live music and entertainment. My colleague Cait Kelly has examined the Melbourne-based Brothers of Italy candidate, Joe Cassari, who is trying to help the far right party win power by taking a vast overseas electorate that takes in Asia and Oceania. Melbourne leads fall in auction numbers Thursday’s public holiday and the AFL grand final caused a significant reduction in auctions this week, according to Corelogic. The company’s weekly property update said just 1,323 auctions were held across Australian capitals. Melbourne led the decline with a 86.9% reduction in auction activity in the Victorian capital. Corelogic says: Preliminary clearance rates across the combined capitals held above the 60% mark for the fourth consecutive week, with 60.6% of the 1,028 results collected so far recording a successful result. Last week’s preliminary clearance rate (62.5%) was revised to a final clearance rate of 60.1%, the highest since mid-May (61.3%). This time last year 80.6% of capital city auctions recorded a successful result. Littleproud backs Wong on Ukraine stance The Nationals leader David Littleproud and social services minister Amanda Rishworth were on Channel Nine a little earlier this morning. They were asked about the government’s response to the war in Ukraine and the increasingly inflammatory rhetoric from Russian president Vladimir Putin. Littleproud praised foreign minister Penny Wong for her handling of it. I think you’ve got to give credit where credit’s due. Penny Wong has handled this very well and she’s right to try and engage the global community to call out Putin, who’s becoming increasingly desperate. I mean, he’s calling up an extra 300,000 troops from civilians. I think it’s important that when we’re given the platform on the global stage to call them out and to call those influencers out that can actually hold Russia to account, hold Putin to account, I think it’s important that Penny Wong took that opportunity. She did the right thing here. And she has the support of the opposition in what she’s done and what she will continue to do in making sure that we stand up to a bully and this is what this guy is – he’s a bully. Rishworth was asked whether next month’s budget will offer support to Australians to deal with cost-of-living pressures. She said Labor was dealing with a “very difficult” set of budget circumstances and said “we do have to act responsibly”. The government’s been very clear that we are dealing with a very difficult set of circumstances. The Liberal and National party’s trillion-dollars’ worth of debt, rising interest rates and inflation presents for a very difficult circumstance. We also have in the budget, it has been revealed a whole lot of programs that should have been ongoing spending in the budget but were tricky games played by the previous government. So there’s funding cliffs as well. So we will be doing our best to make sure that we are addressing cost of living. It was interesting to see David mention childcare. It was only Labor that went to an election that actually talked about reducing the cost of childcare. And we will be implementing that election commitment along with our other election commitments as a government. So we do have to act responsibly though. We can’t act irresponsibly. And to be honest, that is what Labor is focused on. How do we get the balance right in paying down our debt, which was left for us, as well as supporting responsibly families when it comes to the cost of living and delivering on our election commitments. The defence minister and deputy prime minister Richard Marles says Australia is preparing to support Ukraine in a protracted war against Russia and will continue to provide military support. He has also condemned the nuclear threat made by Russian president Vladimir Putin as “appalling”. Marles told Sky News: What we understand is that Ukraine is going to need support over a long period of time [and] that’s very much the sense when I was in Europe and speaking to Nato countries – Germany, UK, France. All of those countries are really steeling themselves for this being an effort which needs to be undertaken over a long period of time, and that the importance of standing with Ukraine and enabling Ukraine to be empowered to resolve this on their own terms is fundamentally important. Because the Russian aggression that we have seen, and certainly the comments that we’ve seen from Vladimir Putin in the last few days, which speak to the behaviour of Russia, it cannot be allowed to stand. He said the comments made by Putin had caused “anxiety”, and described his decision to mobilise 300,000 reservists as a “step in completely the wrong direction”. They are appalling comments to make. I mean, it is clearly an appalling thing to do to place that potential on the table. Russia needs to stop and Russia needs to leave Ukraine. I think the scenes that we’ve seen from Russia over the last few days, of people seeking to leave the country, of obvious distress for those being called up and being asked to serve in the Russian forces in respect of this says everything about where public opinion is actually at within Russia. Marles said that Australia needed to “stand with Ukraine” and would continue to offer military assistance, in response to the country’s calls for more vehicles and missiles. We’re working with the Ukrainian government about how we can provide support over the long term. That didn’t take long … Road World Championships resume It’s a beautiful sunny morning in Wollongong on the final day of the 2022 UCI Road World Championships. The men’s elite road race is due to begin at 10.15am, with the peloton taking on an epic 266.9km course taking in almost 4km of elevation, from Helensburgh to central Wollongong. The race is expected to finish just before 5pm. For Australia, all eyes are on Michael Matthews. The Canberran won the under-23 road race last time the world championships were on home soil, in 2010. Since then he’s twice finished on the podium, but never been crowned elite world champion. Is today his day? Yesterday, in the women’s road race, Dutch star Annemiek van Vleuten stunned the peloton with a late solo charge to win the world champion’s rainbow jersey for the second time. It was a jaw-dropping effort from Van Vleuten, who had fractured her elbow on Wednesday. Despite animating the race at the pointy end, the Australian riders could not make the final selection and did not challenge for the medals. The best local finisher was Alexandra Manly in 15th. The shadow finance minister Jane Hume has refused to say whether she supports an extension of the cut to fuel excise, which ends on Wednesday night, during an interview on ABC Insiders. She said the Coalition’s policy when in government was to support it as a temporary measure, but it was now a decision for the Labor government. That temporary excise cut was welcomed by Australians that were feeling the pinch in their pockets. My view is that the government will make its decision. What it does need to do is address the other cost-of-living pressures that are facing Australians. She also said the Coalition was reserving its position on supporting the government’s changes to the childcare subsidy and its new federal integrity commission bill, which will come to parliament this week. On childcare, Hume said the opposition wanted to “check out” whether the measure would improve productivity and participation. On the integrity bill, she said that the opposition would support “anything that will stamp out corruption in public life”. We’ve always said we supported the introduction of a federal Icac. This is really important legislation to get right, because if you get it wrong, it has dire consequences. We haven’t seen the details of Labor’s bill yet, so we want to ask those questions. Will there be procedural fairness and natural justice? Will hearings be in public for private? When will they be one or the other? Hume said she was concerned public hearings could be weaponised and this might deter good people from entering public life. That would be a disaster. We want the best and the brightest to join, but if the risk to your professional reputation, if the risk to your bank balance, the risk to your life and livelihood is there, just because you can politicise a corruption charge, well, why would anybody enter public life? Search to resume for man seen in the water in Darling Harbour Police say they are responding to reports that a man was seen in the water off King Street wharf at Darling Harbour in Sydney in the early hours of this morning. The man had not resurfaced, according to reports to police. Police say: About 1.20am [on Sunday] emergency services were called to King Street wharf at Darling Harbour, after reports a man was seen in the water but had not resurfaced. Officers attached to Sydney city police area command, with assistance from the marine area command, commenced a search for the man. The search was suspended and is due to resume this morning, with the assistance of police divers. Inquiries into the incident are continuing. Getting integrity commission law wrong will have ‘dire consequences’ On the integrity commission, Hume is asked whether she supports the body having public hearings – a key point of contention. She says the Coalition will support “anything that will stamp out corruption in public life”. But she says she will wait to see Labor’s legislation before articulating the opposition’s position. We’ve always said we supported the introduction of a federal Icac. This is really important legislation to get right, because if you get it wrong, it has dire consequences. We haven’t seen the details of Labor’s bill yet, so we want to ask those questions: will there be procedural fairness and natural justice; will hearings be in public or private; when will they be one or the other? Hume: Coalition won’t back cut to EV taxes Hume is asked whether the opposition will support Labor’s attempt to increase childcare subsidies. She says: We do believe that childcare is a really significant cost and a really important service for many Australian families When we were in government, we did the largest reform to childcare in 40 years, and in fact reduced the cost of childcare and made sure that families were subsidised, particularly those who were working, those who were studying and volunteering. She says they will wait to see Labor’s legislation before deciding whether to offer support. But Hume is less equivocal about the plan to reduce taxes for electric vehicles. We won’t be supporting that legislation because it is really poor policy. The electric vehicles, reduction of the FBT on electric vehicles, the government couldn’t explain whether it would actually reduce emissions. The industry couldn’t explain whether it would take up the electric vehicles. It is enormously costly, runs to billions and billions of dollars and if you can’t prove the effect of a policy decision. Coalition went to ‘2019-20 budget essentially in balance’: Hume Hume is asked whether she accepts the Coalition left the budget in structural deficit. She says: Not at all. In fact, in 2019, because of the time we had been in government, we made sure there were budget offsets for new expenditures and we grew the economy. We could also decrease taxes and we went to the 2019-20 budget essentially in balance. She says they had a “credible plan back to surplus” despite a $30bn deficit. After the forward [estimates], but it was a credible plan back to surplus. Hume calls on Labor to cut fiscal spending Hume is asked about what Australia should be doing to avoid going into recession, following her leader’s prediction that the US will do so. She is asked whether the government should be cutting fiscal spending. Hume responds: Well, the Labor government came to government promising higher deficits than the Coalition. In fact, it promised $45bn of off-balance-sheet spending and $18bn more of on-balance-sheet spending. I think it’s time that the Labor government consider the priorities and whether it is a good idea to go ahead with it at a time when winding back your fiscal priorities, winding back your fiscal wish list to make sure that your fiscal policy is in line with your monetary policy would be a better solution. When we were in government, we made sure we managed expenditures and grew the economy at the same time as lowering taxes. In an interview on ABC’s Insiders, shadow finance minister Jane Hume has just made a rather interesting claim. She was being pressed on whether the Coalition supported the temporary fuel excise coming to an end. She said it was now Labor’s policy to manage. She said: We don’t have policies, we are in opposition, not in government. That will be news to many, including Insiders host David Speers, who responded: You do, you have policies on aged pension. The Tasmanian government is scaling down its operation at the site where hundreds of whales were stranded on the state’s west coast. In a statement last night, the Department of Natural Resources and Environment said its staff will continue to monitor a “small number of whales” in Macquarie Harbour following the mass stranding this week. Incident controller Brendon Clark said there were no living animals at the main stranding site. Plans to remove the carcasses were progressing well, he said. Through extensive aerial and vessel surveillance of Macquarie Harbour we have identified a small number of whales within the harbour precinct. A number of those are still free swimming. However, we do have a couple that are stranded in shallower waters. We currently have crews responding to those animals and we aim to free them and get them swimming out of the harbour throughout the course of the afternoon. The carcass disposal operation is set to start this morning, depending on the weather. The SES has warned that a new trough and associated low pressure system is forecast to enter western New South Wales on Monday. The trough will progress westwards on Tuesday and Wednesday bringing more rain and the chance of thunderstorms “in many areas”. The SES says: Given the current flooding, saturated catchments and full dams, this forecast front will likely exacerbate the current riverine flooding with multiple systems anticipated to see prolonged or renewed minor to major flooding. With catchments wet and many dams at capacity, waterways are very sensitive to rainfall, and further river rises and renewed flooding are likely for the inland catchments. Ongoing operational activity can be expected to continue in these areas. The SES will be liaising closely with the Bureau of Meteorology to determine the impact areas of the forecast weather. ‘I am pessimistic about seeing a republic achieved any time soon’ Trent Zimmerman, a longtime republican and former Liberal MP, has warned that King Charles’ accession will not make the Australian republican cause any easier. In a piece for the Guardian, he writes: I have supported Australia becoming a republic since my early 20s. For me, it’s about a simple proposition – should we have an Australian as our head of state – a head of state whose only loyalty is to our own nation. Some monarchists have tied themselves in knots arguing the monarch is not our head of state – quite treasonous of them really – but that proposition does not really pass the pub test, let alone constitutional scrutiny. Yet today, as I have been for some time, I am pessimistic about seeing a republic achieved any time soon. It will certainly not be advanced to the stage of a vote during this term of parliament and I suspect not until a future federal government is more than confident of its success. The State Emergency Service has responded to 825 requests for assistance and performed 59 flood rescues in New South Wales in the past 11 days. The SES this morning released new data on its workload in the recent flooding across the state, particularly in the central west and southern parts of the state: statewide requests for assistance: 825 flood rescues: 59 Previous 24 hours up to 6am 25 September 2022: statewide requests for assistance: 112 flood rescues: six A spokesperson said the flooding was continuing in western and southern NSW, with a number of flood warnings current. The spokesperson said Wee Waa and Warren will remain isolated for “many days” and that major flooding was still affecting Gunnedah. Many communities are experiencing continuous or repeat flooding. Currently minor to major flooding is present in several catchments across the state as flood peaks move slowly downstream. Major flooding is still impacting Gunnedah. The river peaked at 8.24 metres yesterday morning. It is expected to remain at major level for the remainder of the weekend; however, it is slowly receding. As the water recedes SES personnel will be on the ground to conduct rapid impact assessments. Wee Waa and Warren will remain isolated for many days. We are conducting numerous resupply operations to residents with essential stores such as water, food and medicines and have deployed aircraft and high clearance vehicles. My colleague Tamsin Rose has investigated the booming demand for cosmetic injectables in Australia, which has prompted experts to warn of the risks of serious mental and physical harm. You can read her piece here: The river near Gunnedah, in NSW’s north-east, peaked at 8.24 metres yesterday. Emergency services say they’ve had “a busy few days” in the area. Child dies in Melbourne fire A child has died after a fire took hold of a shed in Melbourne’s east. Emergency services were called to reports of a blaze at a home in Ringwood about 6pm on Saturday. Once firefighters had put out the blaze, the young child was found dead inside the shed at the rear of the Belle Vue Avenue property. The child is believed to be a resident of the house. The cause of the fire is yet to be determined and an investigation continues on Sunday. – from AAP ‘Considerable’ rainfall expected next week in NSW Inland New South Wales will remain on high alert for flooding, despite a short reprieve from heavy rain. Bureau of Meteorology forecasters are now turning their attention to early next week, with “considerable” falls expected on Tuesday and Wednesday in southern and central inland parts of the state. Senior meteorologist Jake Phillips told AAP: It’s a bit early to know exactly how high the flood peaks will get as a result of that rain, but it’s definitely something that our hydrology team will be checking out pretty closely over the next day or two It definitely will exacerbate some of those flood peaks and could send some of them either into prolonged major flooding, or raise them from moderate into major, potentially. Among places authorities were concerned about on Saturday was Gunnedah, where the Namoi River peaked at the major flood level of 8.24 metres in the morning. State Emergency Service spokesman Greg Nash said people downstream of places like Gunnedah on the river should keep abreast of the latest flood information. It’s anticipated that water will move downstream slowly and may isolate some areas. Wee Waa was isolated by road on Saturday, but the emergency service deployed resources to the town. Nash warned against attempting to cross floodwaters in cars, saying: We have some very resilient communities and some communities that are very much aware of their flood risk. [However] we want people to drive to the conditions, and if you find a flooded or a damaged road as a result of flooding, to stop, turn around [and] find another away – it’s not worth the risk to push on. In the 10 days to Saturday, the emergency service had fielded more than 800 requests for assistance in NSW, which included nearly 60 flood rescues. In the 24 hours to about 5.30pm on Saturday, the emergency service received 120 requests for help and five flood rescues. – from AAP We’re waking to the horrible news that a five-year-old boy has died in the NSW floods. He was separated from his family on Friday night when their car was submerged in floodwaters on McGrane Way near Tullamore, in the state’s central west. Emergency services were called to the scene late on Friday, finding two younger children and their parents, who were clinging to trees. The five-year-old was missing. Fiona Aveyard, a local farmer and Rural Fire Service member, told the ABC she had been one of the first to arrive on scene. She said: It was a miracle they even got a signal to call for help. We arrived in the dark in water that was backed up a couple of hundred metres from the crossing. The water at the low-level crossing was up about a metre and a half. They [the family members] were downstream in the creek clinging to trees – a mother, a father and two young children. The parents were able to free the two younger children from the car but the five-year-old was trapped in the car as it submerged. Police have since announced that they’d found the five-year-old’s body on Saturday afternoon. Ch Insp David Maher told the ABC: The family were very distraught in relation to the incident. The family are Sydney residents but they do have a property in Tullamore. Tullamore is a very small community, very close-knit and it’s had a major impact on the whole community. Good morning and welcome to our live blog for Sunday 25 September. We’ll keep a close eye on the flooding in New South Wales, particularly in the central west.

In 2018, however, it has already passed record levels in mid-November. In May, June and July, output was 50% above average; September and October were also good. This demonstrates the quixotic nature of British weather – but also the benefits of the flexibility of the government scheme that pays homeowners for the surplus electricity they produce. The connection to the grid provides the other side of the bargain, paying for the electricity drawn on dull days and at night. As the cost of solar panels has decreased, the government has reduced the amount it will pay for this surplus. Despite hiccups, the formula has helped solar power become a significant part of the UK’s energy mix. Now, however, there is a growing sense of betrayal in the industry because the government has proposed ending all payments for surplus electricity from newly installed domestic solar panels from next April. There have been a number of objections and the government has not made a final decision. While the proposed changes will encourage people to use as much of their own electricity as possible by installing batteries and heating water, they could kill the industry and have been likened to theft. • This article was amended on 15 November 2018, to clarify that the government’s proposal to end payments for surplus electricity is still under discussion."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2020/oct/25/feeling-the-heat-over-arctic-sea-ice","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2020-10-25T17:57:25Z","webTitle":"Feeling the heat over Arctic sea ice | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/25/feeling-the-heat-over-arctic-sea-ice","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2020/oct/25/feeling-the-heat-over-arctic-sea-ice","fields":{"headline":"Feeling the heat over Arctic sea ice","bodyText":"The delayed freeze in the Laptev Sea is consistent with the entire Arctic Ocean, which is set for the slowest recovery in the extent of sea ice this autumn, if the current daily trend continues (Alarm as Arctic sea ice not yet freezing at latest date on record, 22 October). This follows on from this summer having the second lowest minimum since 1979, with the early decades significantly above the annual trends during the last few years. Other feedback mechanisms are now starting to take hold of global heating, as current atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations are well beyond the normal Quaternary levels over the last 800,000 years – usually 170 to 280 parts per million, between ice age maximums and interglacial stages, compared with a still accelerating anthropogenic 410 ppm, coupled with the impact from a significant rise in methane and other warming gases. This is why mitigation policies are all we have left. Extinction Rebellion would be better off insulating homes, running public transport cooperatives and campaigning for major economic reforms to pay for this. Starting with taxing carbon intensity, abolishing non-dom tax status and establishing an overseas tax liability for British citizens like the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) does for US citizens wherever they are living. Even in Monaco where too many of our honoured tax exiles live. David Nowell Fellow of the Geological Society, New Barnet, Hertfordshire • Late Arctic ice formation should surprise nobody. Rising temperatures melt ice so less solar energy is reflected and darker surfaces absorb more heat. Trapped greenhouse gases escape, causing more warming and more ice to melt while fires and dying vegetation worsen matters further. Even if net emissions from human activities somehow became negligible, this positive feedback will accelerate heating. Many ideas essential to combat expected heating would make sense even if temperatures were static, fell or if a major food crop failed. Examples include restoring fish stocks, less waste, alternatives to fossil fuels, silviculture, regenerative agriculture and combining conservation with careful use. Instead if adopting such win-win policies, decades have been wasted bickering about who was right. Future generations will find this very difficult to forgive.

National Grid used a solar farm in East Sussex to help smooth overnight voltage fluctuations for the first time earlier this month, proving solar farms don’t need sunshine to help keep the lights on. Lightsource BP, the owner of the solar farm, said an inexpensive tweak to the project’s electrical equipment meant it could help balance the grid with only two seconds’ notice. Kareen Boutonnat, the company’s chief operating officer, said: “We have proven that solar plants can play a larger role across the electricity network. But this is only the beginning.” The breakthrough could mean that UK solar farms will soon help stabilise the energy grid at night, which could save £400m on grid upgrades or building new power plants. “Inverters” at the solar farm are usually used in the process of converting solar energy to electric current. But at night, when the grid is often less stable, the same equipment can adapt grid electricity to a healthier voltage. Chris Buckland, technical director of Lightsource BP, said the inverter acts like a distortion mirror by reflecting the energy network’s voltage back to the grid at a slightly different level. On blustery nights with plenty of wind power but little demand, the solar farm could help prevent the energy grid’s voltage from rising too high. It could also prevent the voltage from falling too low during still nights in winter when demand is often high. Lightsource BP will carry out a second trial next month, and it hopes to strike its first commercial deal to help balance the electricity grid with National Grid next year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/feb/23/recent-australian-emissions-cuts-likely-to-be-reversed-in-recovery-from-covid-and-drought","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-02-23T00:45:53Z","webTitle":"Recent Australian emissions cuts likely to be reversed in recovery from Covid and drought","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/feb/23/recent-australian-emissions-cuts-likely-to-be-reversed-in-recovery-from-covid-and-drought","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/feb/23/recent-australian-emissions-cuts-likely-to-be-reversed-in-recovery-from-covid-and-drought","fields":{"headline":"Recent Australian emissions cuts likely to be reversed in recovery from Covid and drought","bodyText":"Most of the reduction in Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions last year is likely to be wiped out as transport rebounds after Covid-19 lockdowns and farming recovers from the long-term-drought, according to an audit of national climate data. Scott Morrison told the National Press Club earlier this month the government was “getting on with” reducing emissions, citing official data that found emissions were down 3% in the year to June to their lowest levels since 1998. He declared “these are the facts”. An audit by Hugh Saddler, an energy consultant and honorary associate professor at ANU’s Crawford school of public policy, suggests at least some of the drop is likely to disappear. The monthly national energy emissions audit, published by the Australia Institute, found there had been about a 4.5% fall in carbon pollution over the two years to 2020. This was mostly due to a surge in solar and wind electricity, but also linked to the impact of the Covid-19 shutdown, particularly on transport, and ongoing effects from the long-term drought, which significantly reduced sheep and cattle numbers. The audit found the cuts in the latter two categories were not likely to continue. The end of lockdowns and domestic travel restrictions meant emissions from road traffic and aviation were likely to “revert to their previous steadily growing trend”. Similarly, agriculture emissions were likely to rise as drought conditions eased and herd numbers and crop production increased, in line with government projections. Nearly 80% of agricultural emissions are from livestock and cropping. Saddler said it underlined that recent national emissions reductions had largely been the result of external circumstances, not climate policy. The Morrison government does not have overarching policies to reduce emissions from transport or agriculture. He said a recent government “future fuels” discussion paper on reducing emissions from transport offered “almost nothing”, and the government had no plan to cut agriculture emissions. Several Nationals MPs have argued the sector should be excluded from climate commitments, a stance that puts them at odds with farming groups calling for a 2050 net zero emissions target. “Electricity generation emissions will continue to fall but, in the absence of any significant policy changes, reductions from this sector will be offset by steadily increasing transport emissions,” Saddler said. “Total emissions from all sectors other than electricity generation will remain almost unchanged from 2018.” The audit is consistent with official emissions projections released in December, which estimated national carbon pollution would drop by less than 7% over the next decade under current policies. The projections report suggested the Morrison government was not yet on track to meet Australia’s 2030 emissions target under the Paris climate conference (a 26% to 28% cut to 2005 levels). Instead, established policies would lead to a 22% cut over that timeframe. More than half of that was achieved before the Coalition was elected in 2013. Morrison has said the government wants Australia to reach net zero emissions as soon as possible, and preferably by 2050, through a “technology, not taxes” approach, but has not explained how its policies would achieve that. Richie Merzian, the Australia Institute’s climate and energy program director, said emissions from vehicles and farming were now almost equal to those from the entire electricity sector. “There is a real opportunity for the federal government to set the country on course to net zero emissions by 2050, if not sooner, but this requires sector-level plans for transport and agriculture,” he said. The audit looks at the change in emissions in the national electricity market, covering the five eastern states and the Australian Capital Territory, since 2008. They fell 26.5% over that time as coal-fired power plants closed and reduced their operating capacity, and wind and solar energy made up a greater share of the power supply. The spike in renewable energy investment was largely driven by the national renewable energy target – which was filled in 2019 and not extended or replaced – and aided by state targets and a rapid reduction in the cost of solar and wind energy technology. Renewable energy including rooftop solar now provides about 27% of annual electricity. Despite Covid-19 lockdowns, electricity use fell only 0.6% between February and November last year. But the amount of electricity generated by burning coal fell nearly 8% in both New South Wales and Queensland between late 2019 and late 2020. Saddler said the NSW Electricity Infrastructure Investment Act, which passed state parliament in November and promises to underwrite 12 gigawatts of new solar and wind and 2GW of long-duration storage, would be a significant development in managing the shift to variable renewable energy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2021/oct/13/k-pop-k-boom-k-cinema-k-art-south-korea-stars","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2021-10-13T05:00:12Z","webTitle":"K-boom!

How the unstoppable stars of K-pop went gunning for the art world","bodyText":"Ohnim is having a blue period, just like Picasso. Over Zoom from a gallery in Seoul, the Korean rapper Song Min-ho, better known as Mino to K-pop fans but Ohnim in the art world, shows me a painting he finished the previous evening in collaboration with artist Choi Na-ri. It depicts a blue crouched figure, like a depressed version of Rodin’s Thinker. It may be still wet but will soon be shipped to London’s Saatchi Gallery for an art fair that showcases work by three of Korea’s biggest K-pop stars. The meeting of K-pop and K-art is making the art world lick its lips. Businessman David Ciclitira, who set up the StART Art Fair at the Saatchi, says: “K-pop stars have immense reach through their social media. Guys like Mino, Henry Lau and Kang Seung-yoon, whose work will be in the show, have six to seven million followers each on Instagram. In Seoul, fans queue round the block just to see a work of art by any of them. Then they fight each other to buy. I don’t suppose it’ll be quite like that at the Saatchi Gallery, but you never know.” Ohnim and Kang Seung-yoon, both members of K-pop band Winner, and Canadian-born Henry Lau, former member of Super Junior-M, are effectively multimedia brands, combining singing, acting, making art, fashion, reality TV … and plugging products. Ohnim, for instance, endorses a German lip balm and did his first art show in collaboration with a Korean eyewear brand. He also modelled for Louis Vuitton. Stars such as Ohnim are part of what’s known as hallyu, or the “Korean wave” in culture, embracing K-pop, K-cinema (Oscar-winning Parasite), K-TV (Netflix’s Squid Game), K-tech (Samsung) and even K-philosophy. Next year, Frieze will launch a Seoul fair, while London’s Victoria and Albert Museum will showcase the popular culture of South Korea in an exhibition. And then there is the K-art diaspora, with artists such as Bath Spa University academic Young In Hong, and Korean-born American conceptual artist Anicka Yi, whose commission at Tate Modern’s Turbine Hall opened this week. Successive South Korean governments have tried to ride the Korean wave, pursuing a strategy of exporting pop culture worldwide following the Asian financial crash in the late 1990s. “Hallyu has been a deliberate tool of soft power,” argues journalist Christine Ro. “Many countries invest in cultural councils and exchanges partly to strengthen diplomatic aims. But the South Korean government’s push for cultural power has had remarkably quick success.” There is even a crossover between K-pop and K-politics. BTS, the boyband whose collaboration with Coldplay is currently No 1 in the US, were made Special Presidential Envoys for Future Generations and Culture by South Korea’s president Moon Jae-In last month. They performed a prerecorded set at the UN, and made a speech praising the younger generation’s resilience during the pandemic and urging sustainable development. As I chat to Ohnim, I notice in the corner of his painting his signature motif of a happy-looking girl. “The picture is inspired by the coronavirus pandemic,” he says. “People are depressed, and that’s what the blue figure represents. But the background and the little girl say something different. They say: ‘It’s OK. There will be happiness.’ I try to be a good influencer, you see.” This is a surprisingly upbeat message for the 28-year-old, whose public battles with his mental health have endeared him to his South Korean fanbase. Three years ago, at the height of his fame with Winner, Ohnim disclosed he had been diagnosed with panic disorder. “Many things piled on and it happened,” he said at the time. “I always need to show a good appearance to the public and always shine, but there are a lot of things I need to deal with.” Making art has helped him. He told his Instagram followers: “In this day and age I feel that language itself cannot function in its right form. I wanted to create another type of communication, where the remnants of our feelings that are buried and hidden away can be conveyed through simple and distorted shapes. The inability to have real interpersonal relationships and human touch in the world we currently live in has made me realise that I am unable to escape feelings of emptiness and hollowness.” Art, he says, is proving better than three-minute K-pop songs at allowing him to explore not just his own mental health issues but to reflect on a world gone hideously wrong. In 2018, Ohnim collaborated on an eerie immersive installation called Burning Planet. Visitors to the space in Seoul’s Seongsu-dong district walked down a long dark tunnel to a room where an old man explained that he was a gatekeeper to the Burning Planet, a world located at the edge of our solar system. Guests then proceeded through a door into a speakeasy where a giant robotic ostrich explained that on the Burning Planet, all organic life is extinct except for humans and ostriches. And then, curiously, guests were invited to eat a dessert made from ostrich eggs, before entering another space depicting human life on this planet. Feeble light installations symbolised scarce solar energy, while performers performed a dull ballet of repetitive movements. Like the Planet of the Apes, the Burning Planet was really an allegory of our own. “So many of us are burned out in a world that we’re destroying,” he explained. As Onim sips his drink, from 5,500 miles away, I study the tattoos that ring his throat. They are little circles of weather icons – cloudy, sunny and so on. “I colour one in red to show what mood I’m in.” But none are ringed today? He shrugs, possibly because he doesn’t know which mood he is in. Onim’s art expresses something the philosopher Byung-Chul Han takes as symptomatic of contemporary South Korea. In his new book, Capitalism and the Death Drive, Han notes that his homeland has the highest suicide rate in the world. In part, he argues, this is because of the IMF bailout that followed the Asian financial crisis. Like Greece, South Korea was, he claims, forcibly subjected to “radical reprogramming” – what Naomi Klein called the “shock doctrine”. “In South Korea, there is no longer any real resistance to these measures,” Han writes. “Instead, one finds high levels of conformism and consensus – together with depression and burnout. Instead of seeking to change society, people use violence against themselves. The outward aggression that might have provided the basis for revolution has instead given way to auto-aggression.” Evidence for this diagnosis was clear in last year’s Korean Eye show at the Saatchi Gallery. One piece consisted of an A4 sheet of paper attached to a wall at its lower corners, one side bearing the image of a face drawn with a marker. Artist Kwantaeck Park arranged a fan to make the sheet rise up and down as if the face was bowing endlessly. Eunha Kim made a sculpture called Bon Appetit that looked like a hamburger but was made from discarded clothes. Lee Seung Koo installed a sculpture called Compromise Between Me and Me that looked like a dystopian Jeff Koons inflatable, with a huge gun firing gas-filled balloons shaped like hearts and oversized blood corpuscles across the gallery. The show’s curator, Dimitri Ozerkov, of St Petersburg’s State Hermitage Museum, wrote in his catalogue essay that Han was right in his diagnosis: auto-aggression bleeds into contemporary Korean culture and burnout; personality disorders and attention deficit hyperactivity are behind the nation’s creative fecundity. “This new societal condition may be characterised in terms of narcissism taken to the point of religious fervour.” K-art, then, is in a vexed position, both presenting Korea to the world, and at the same acting as a grenade that, as Ozekov puts it, “could blow the well-managed collective identity sky-high.” Korean art was terra incognita for westerners (the late Nam June Paik notwithstanding) until David Ciclitira, the chairman of Parallel Media and co-founder of Sky TV, began collecting with his wife Serenella around 15 years ago. Impressed with what they saw in Seoul’s galleries, they set up a programme called Global Eye aimed at developing the county’s arts infrastructure, and arranged shows to promote the arts of Asian countries from Vietnam to Indonesia. In 2012, Ciclitira set up Live Company, an events business that toured K-pop concerts to Asia and, eventually, Europe. Since then, his business interests have combined K-pop and K-art. On the wall behind him as we talk is the most striking Zoom backdrop I’ve encountered during the pandemic, namely a 3.2m x 2m embroidery called Procession by Young In Hong. “It was the first large embroidery piece I did,” she tells me from her Bristol studio. She made Procession in 2010, a decade before her adoptive city bore witness to the toppling of slave trader Edward Colston’s statue. But Procession is a work no less political. From the English west country, Young In Hong keeps a Korean eye on her homeland, meditating on its history and struggles. Visitors to London’s Royal Academy may remember, in 2017, a group of Koreans lying in the courtyard. This was Young In Hong’s performance piece 5100: Pentagon, memorialising students who were fired on, killed, raped and beaten by government troops in 1980’s Gwangju protests against martial law. “The performance commemorates a specific event but is also a means of acting out a certain resistance toward prevailing social norms,” she says. “I’m quite a sensitive person to what’s going on around me. Probably that’s one of the reasons I came here, to get a sense of perspective on my homeland.” Young In Hong’s latest project is a 15-metre long text piece installed last month at the disused Jejin station in the demilitarised zone between North and South Korea. “I picked this sentence from a book in which a woman is explaining to a lawyer why she wants to get a divorce. It reads: “Our rhythms have been out of sync in the past.” Young In Hong repurposes the text to comment on other things out of sync: North and South Korea, train timetables, men and women, humans and their mental health. Emblazoned in huge type over the entrance to the disused station, it is hardly an example of soft power or a lucrative investment opportunity for collectors, but it is certainly part of the K-art wave breaking both at home and abroad.

Rich countries are failing on their pledge to provide $100bn a year to help poor countries cope with the climate crisis, and the way in which climate finance is organised needs urgent reform, the six academics argue in an article in the journal Nature Climate Change. They warn that the methods of accounting for climate finance are deeply flawed, and that failing to reform the system would undermine the trust of developing countries in the Paris agreement. Romain Weikmans, a co-author of the Nature comment and fellow of the Free University of Brussels, said: “There is not a clear accounting system. The definitions of what constitutes climate finance are vague, and there are many flaws and discrepancies. It is impossible for now to say whether the $100bn pledge has been met or not. The parameters are so vague that it is impossible to give a definitive answer.” The group of six experts – from the US, Europe and Bangladesh – call for clear rules on what counts as climate finance. They also suggest that the needs of developing countries should be assessed and plans drawn up for how to meet them, through a global mechanism that would provide longer-term certainty than the current system of ad hoc allocations made each year by rich countries. They say charging levies on international flights and on bunker fuels – high-carbon fuels used by ships – could provide a steady stream of climate finance to the countries that need it. Emissions from international aviation and shipping are excluded from countries’ emissions tallies under the Paris agreement, so there are limited ways at present of encouraging their reduction. The pledge that $100bn from public and private sources would flow to poor countries each year from 2020 has been a keystone of international climate talks since 2009. Last year marked the deadline for the pledge’s fulfilment, but because of a time lag in reporting finance, data on how much finance was provided in reality will not be available until next year. Multiple sources suggest the funding provided fell short of the pledge. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, told the Guardian in December that failure to meet the pledge would be a serious stumbling block to success at Cop26, the UN climate talks due to take place later this year. He urged developed countries to increase their efforts to meet the target this year and provide assurances for developing countries for the future. No formal decisions on climate finance will be made at Cop26, but countries are expected to take the first steps towards a renewed finance pledge to be made formally in 2025, which would increase the flows of investment to the poor world. Such a move is seen as essential to the continued back of the developing world for the Paris agreement. Weikmans said Cop26 would provide an opportunity for governments to discuss better mechanisms for accounting for climate finance, which should be made clear and transparent. He said the pledge on climate finance should be measured against the vast flows of finance each year that tend to increase greenhouse gas emissions, such as fossil fuel investments. “The vast majority of international finance is not climate-compatible,” he told the Guardian. “A big question is how much finance is not compatible with the Paris agreement. That whole part of the investment landscape needs to be completely transformed.” Climate finance serves two purposes: helping poor countries take action to cut their emissions, for instance through investing in renewable energy and phasing out fossil fuels; and helping them cope with the impacts of climate breakdown, which few have the infrastructure to withstand. Global emissions were on a rising trend before the Covid-19 pandemic struck, so the former is essential to meet the goals of the Paris agreement, and if poor countries are not helped to adapt to climate change, decades of progress on lifting people from poverty will be reversed. Guterres has said spending on both aims should be roughly equal, but spending on adaptation lags far behind. Adaptation measures are harder to fund, as private investors can gain a clear return from some emissions-cutting efforts, such as building wind turbines or solar energy, but the benefits to erecting flood barriers or restoring mangrove swamps are more diffuse."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/oct/31/reasons-to-be-hopeful-the-climate-solutions-available-now","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-10-31T07:00:22Z","webTitle":"Reasons to be hopeful: the climate solutions available now","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/oct/31/reasons-to-be-hopeful-the-climate-solutions-available-now","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/oct/31/reasons-to-be-hopeful-the-climate-solutions-available-now","fields":{"headline":"Reasons to be hopeful: the climate solutions available now","bodyText":"The climate emergency is the biggest threat to civilisation we have ever faced. But there is good news: we already have every tool we need to beat it. The challenge is not identifying the solutions, but rolling them out with great speed. Some key sectors are already racing ahead, such as electric cars. They are already cheaper to own and run in many places – and when the purchase prices equal those of fossil-fueled vehicles in the next few years, a runaway tipping point will be reached. Electricity from renewables is now the cheapest form of power in most places, sometimes even cheaper than continuing to run existing coal plants. There’s a long way to go to meet the world’s huge energy demand, but the plummeting costs of batteries and other storage technologies bodes well. And many big companies are realising that a failure to invest will be far more expensive as the impacts of global heating destroy economies. Even some of the biggest polluters, such as cement and steel, have seen the green writing on the wall. Buildings are big emitters but the solution – improved energy efficiency – is simple to achieve and saves the occupants money, particularly with the cost of installing technology such as heat pumps expected to fall. Stopping the razing of forests requires no technology at all, but it does require government action. While progress is poor – and Bolsonaro’s Brazil is going backwards – countries such as Indonesia have shown regulatory action can be effective. Protecting and restoring forests, particularly by empowering indigenous people, is a potent tool. Recognition of the role food and farming play in driving global heating is high, and the solutions, from alternatives to meat to regenerative farming, are starting to grow. As with fossil fuels, ending vast and harmful subsidies is key, and there are glimmers of hope here, too. In the climate crisis, every fraction of a degree matters and so every action reduces people’s suffering. Every action makes the world a cleaner and better place to live – by, for example, cutting the air pollution that ends millions of lives a year. The real fuel for the green transition is a combination of those most valuable and intangible of commodities: political will and skill. The supply is being increased by demands for action from youth strikers to chief executives, and must be used to face down powerful vested interests, such as the fossil fuel, aviation and cattle industries. The race for a sustainable, low-carbon future is on, and the upcoming Cop26 climate talks in Glasgow will show how much faster we need to go. Transport Responsible for 14-28% of global greenhouse gas emissions, transport has been slow to decarbonise, and faces particular challenges in areas such as long-haul flight. But technical solutions are available, if the will, public policy and spending are there, too. Electric cars are the most obvious: petrol and diesel vehicles will barely be produced in Europe within the decade. EV sales are accelerating everywhere, with the likes of Norway well past the tipping point, and cheaper electric vehicles coming from China have cut the fumes from buses. Meanwhile, combustion engines are ever more efficient and less polluting. Bike and scooter schemes are growing rapidly as cities around the world embrace electric micromobility. Far cleaner ships for global freight are coming. The potential of hydrogen is growing, for cleaner trains where electrification is impractical, to be followed by ships and even, one day, planes. Manufacturers expect short-haul electric aircraft much sooner. Most of all, the pandemic has shown that a world without hypermobility is possible – and that many people will accept, or even embrace, a life where they commute and travel less. Gwyn Topham Deforestation Deforestation and land use change are the second-largest source of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. The destruction of the world’s forests has continued at a relentless pace during the pandemic, with millions of hectares lost, driven by land-clearing in the Brazilian Amazon. But there are reasons for hope. The UK has put nature at the heart of its Cop26 presidency and behind the scenes, the government is pushing hard for finance and new commitments from forested nations to protect the world’s remaining carbon banks. Indonesia and Malaysia, once global hotspots of deforestation, have experienced significant falls in recent years, the result of increased restrictions on palm oil plantations. However, the 2000s soy moratorium in Brazil shows these trends are reversible. Finally, there is a growing recognition of the importance of indigenous communities to protecting the world’s forests and biodiversity. In the face of racism and targeted violence, a growing number of studies and reports show they are the best guardians of the forest. Empowering those communities will be vital to ending deforestation. Patrick Greenfield Technology Emissions from technology companies, including direct emissions, emissions from electricity use and other operations such as manufacturing, account for 0.3% of global carbon emissions, while emissions from cryptocurrencies is a huge emerging issue. Mining – the process in which a bitcoin is awarded to a computer that solves a complex series of algorithms – is a deeply energy-intensive process and only gets more energy-intensive as the algorithms grow more complex. But new mining methods are lighter, environmentally. A system called “proof of stake” has a 99% lower carbon footprint. Scrutiny of the whole sector is increasing, spearheaded by tech workers who walked out in their hundreds to join climate change marches in 2019. The companies have pledged to do better: Amazon aims to be net zero carbon by 2040 and powered with 100% renewable energy by 2025. Facebook has a target of net zero emissions for its entire supply chain by 2030 and Microsoft has pledged to become carbon negative by 2030. Apple has committed to become carbon-neutral across its whole supply chain by 2030. They’re still falling short when it comes to delivering, but employee groups continue to push. Kari Paul Business For decades Exxon Mobil has arguably been corporate America’s biggest climate change denier. But this year, the activist investor Engine No 1 won three seats on the company’s board with an agenda to force the company to finally acknowledge and confront the climate crisis. Across corporate America and all around the world there are signs of change. The Federal Reserve, the world’s most powerful central bank, is beefing up its climate team. BlackRock, the world’s biggest investor, has made environmental sustainability a core goal for the company. This isn’t about ideology: it’s about “common sense.” According to BlackRock, failure to tackle climate change is simply bad for business. The investor calculates that 58% of the US will suffer economic decline by 2060-2080 if nothing is done. Much more needs to be done, and some question whether corporate America can really solve this crisis without government action. But the days of denial are over – what matters now is action. Dom Rushe Electricity The rocketing global market price for gas has ripped through world economies, forcing factories to close, triggering blackouts in China, and threatening to cool the global economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. But it has also spelled out a clear economic case for governments to redouble their efforts in developing homegrown, low-carbon electricity systems. The good news is that renewable energy is ready to step up and play a greater role in electricity systems across the globe. The precipitous fall in the price of wind and solar energy has helped to incentivise fresh investments in electricity vehicles and energy storage technologies, such as batteries, where costs are plummeting too. Soon, wind and solar power will help to produce green hydrogen, which can be stored over long periods of time to generate electricity during days that are a little less bright or breezy. All of these advances are made possible by cheap renewables, and will help countries to use more renewable energy too. There has never been a better time to step back from gas and go green. Jillian Ambrose Buildings The built environment is one of our biggest polluters, responsible for about 40% of global carbon emissions. Over the past two decades, the carbon footprint of buildings “in use” has been greatly reduced by energy-saving technologies – better insulation, triple-glazing, and on-site renewables such as solar panels and ground-source heat pumps. Onheat pumps, the UK lags far behind: Norway, through a mixture of grants and high electricity prices, has installed more than 600 heat pumps for every 1,000 households. As national energy grids are decarbonising, the focus is shifting to reducing the “embodied energy” of materials – which can account for up to three-quarters of a building’s emissions over its lifespan – for example by reducing the amount of concrete and steel in favour of timber. There is also a growing movement to prioritise refurbishment and reuse over demolition, driven by the realisation that the most sustainable buildings are the ones that already exist. Oliver Wainwright Food and farming The hoofprint of the global livestock industry is a significant one, accounting for about 14% of total annual greenhouse gas emissions. But it is increasingly recognised and accepted by national governments. New Zealand now has a legal commitment to reduce methane emissions from agriculture by 10% by 2030, while Denmark has passed a legally binding target to reduce climate emissions from the agricultural sector by 55% by 2030. While global meat production is increasing, there is a growing shift towards fish and poultry, which have a comparatively lower emissions footprint than red meats. The food industry is also developing a range of lower-carbon products using plant-based proteins such as soy and pea, and insect and lab-grown meat alternatives. Tom Levitt Manufacturing Decarbonising the manufacturing of every product needed by a modern economy is a vast and varied task. Some sectors are well on their way. For instance, Apple, the world’s third-largest maker of mobile phones by volume, has pledged to produce net zero carbon throughout its supply chain by 2030. For many others, advances in efficiency of factories and their products will be accelerated by machine learning and other artificial intelligence technologies that are still in their infancy. There are even hopeful signs in some of the hardest sectors to decarbonise, such as plans by Volvo to replace coal with hydrogen in the steel it uses in cars. One of the greatest reasons for optimism is manufacturers’ increasing awareness of circular design principles. Making products easier to recycle from the start will help to cut emissions from fresh resource extraction– although a bigger question remains as to whether rich societies can reduce consumption, the most obvious way to cut emissions.

In a letter seen by the Guardian, energy minister Yuval Steinitz told environmental activists the ministry supported a pilot initiative in which Jordan would transfer 25 megawatts to Israel’s national grid, enough to power several thousands of households. EcoPeace, an organisation of Israeli, Jordanian, and Palestinian environmentalists, has been pushing for the project, arguing that Jordan’s access to large amounts of land and sunshine means it could sell electricity to Israel cheaper than the country could produce it. “Electricity has never crossed the Israeli border from any neighbouring country,” said Gidon Bromberg, the Israeli director of EcoPeace. “We are calling for a Middle East green deal.” The advocacy group had shared the letter with the Jordanian government in the hopes of an agreement. The kingdom already buys natural gas from Israel despite domestic opposition against deals with a former foe. Jordanian renewable businesses had also expressed interest, EcoPeace said. However, the environmentalists warn that recent Israeli threats of annexing parts of the Palestinian territories have halted progress, and could scupper their plans if they materialise. The Guardian contacted Jordan’s foreign and energy ministries for comment but received no response. In June, Israel’s energy ministry unveiled an 80bn shekel (£18bn) proposal to increase the percentage of its renewable energy to 30% by 2030, a goal seen as demanding considering the country’s lack of available free land. Despite year-round sunshine and a global reputation for hi-tech green innovation, Israel remains sorely behind other developed countries in clean energy use. At the end of last year, the country was producing about 5% of its electricity from solar energy, with the majority derived from coal and cleaner – but still a fossil fuel – natural gas. Portugal, despite its weaker economy, produces around 30% of its power from renewables. Achiam Tigger, the CEO at Negev Energy Operation and Maintenance, who runs an Israeli solar power plant, said reaching the government’s renewable energy targets would not be “a piece of cake”. Outside his office in the Negev desert, a vast sea of concave mirrors concentrate the sun’s energy into pipes of oil leading to a gigantic molten salt battery. The mirrors rotate throughout the day to capture the best sun rays, while the heated salt battery can provide energy at night. Tigger’s plant forms part of the Ashalim megaproject that also includes the world’s tallest solar tower, which at a distance appears just above the horizon like a rising second sun. On closer inspection, the 250-metre concrete pillar resembles a blinding Eye of Sauron. More than 50,000 mirrors, gathered around the base amphitheatre-style, redirect sunlight to a boiler at the top of the tower. The boiler is jet black, but the intensity of the reflected solar energy makes it too dazzling to look at directly. Inside, superheated steam is created to spin turbines at vast speeds and produce electricity. A third plot nearby uses thousands of photovoltaic (PV) panels, the types of which are seen on household roofs, converting sun rays directly to electricity. While an attention-grabbing symbol of the country’s energy ambitions, the three projects that began commercial operations last year provide just about 2% of Israel’s total energy supplies. “It’s a challenge,” said Tigger of government targets but added it would be possible for Israel to boost its solar power with cheap, PV panels that can be rolled out quickly. Recent government tenders for large-scale PV solar farms have given him hope. “We do see a lot of moving projects … but to say that it will not be challenging to meet these dates and percentage, that would not be true.” This is why EcoPeace argues a deal with Jordan could help reach targets. Bromberg, the environmentalist, said current domestic plans were “nowhere near enough to get to the 30% target.” He said businesses interested in building the power plant in Jordan are citing production prices of just three US cents per kilowatt-hour, compared with five in Israel. “That’s the cheapest daytime electricity from any source,” he said. EcoPeace believes that by bringing together Israel and Jordan on renewables, it will serve to boost the peace agreement. The group also envisions Israel selling Jordan water as part of future deals, although it acknowledges that the potential Israeli annexation has deeply soured the relationship. “The tensions and issue of annexation have held up discussions,” said Bromberg. “But we are hopeful.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/dec/05/carbon-dioxide-co2-capture-utilisation-products-vodka-jet-fuel-protein","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-12-05T12:00:01Z","webTitle":"From pollutant to product: the companies making stuff from CO2","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/05/carbon-dioxide-co2-capture-utilisation-products-vodka-jet-fuel-protein","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/dec/05/carbon-dioxide-co2-capture-utilisation-products-vodka-jet-fuel-protein","fields":{"headline":"From pollutant to product: the companies making stuff from CO2","bodyText":"In a warehouse laboratory in Berkeley, California, Nicholas Flanders stands in front of a shiny metal box about the size of a washing machine. Inside is a stack of metal plates that resemble a club sandwich – only the filling is a black polymer membrane coated with proprietary metal catalyst. “We call the membrane the black leaf,” he says. Flanders is the co-founder and CEO of Twelve, a startup founded in 2015, which received a $57m funding boost in July. It aims to take air – or, to be more precise, the carbon dioxide (CO2) in it – and transform it into something useful, as plants also do, eliminating damaging emissions in the process. Taking the unwanted gas wreaking havoc on our climate and using only water and renewable electricity, Twelve’s metal box houses a new kind of electrolyser that transforms the CO2 into synthesis gas (syngas), a mix of carbon monoxide and hydrogen that can be made into a range of familiar products usually made from fossil fuels. Oxygen is the only by-product. This August, the pilot scale equipment made the syngas that went into what Flanders claims is the world’s first carbon neutral, fossil-free jet fuel produced by electrolysing CO2. “This is a new way of moving carbon through our economy without pulling it out of the ground,” he says. Twelve is one of many companies beginning to make stuff out of CO2, captured either from industrial emissions or directly from the air. High-end goods such as vodka, diamonds and activewear, industrial materials such as concrete, plastic, foam and carbon fibre, and even food, are all beginning to be created using CO2. In addition to jet fuel, which is a partnership with the US air force, Twelve has been using its syngas to explore making parts of car interiors with Mercedes-Benz, laundry detergent ingredients with Tide and sunglasses lenses with Pangaia. Online marketplaces such as Expedition Air and SkyBaron are even springing up to sell consumer goods made with CO2 emissions. “We are at the very early end of a new carbon tech industry,” says Pat Sapinsley, of the Urban Future Lab at New York University, who oversees a new accelerator programme to help fledgling startups get a foothold. While the industry is still only emerging – most activity is only at bench or pilot scale – it is estimated by the Lab there are now about 350 startups hoping to deliver so-called carbon-to-value. Venture capital investment has sharply risen. This year, over $550m had flowed in by the end of September according to research and consulting firm Cleantech Group; that’s more than in the previous five years put together. The sector could have the potential to reduce the world’s CO2 emissions by more than 10%, according to analysis by the University of Michigan’s Global CO2 Initiative, which aims to help the sector emerge (fuels and building materials such as concrete and aggregates are considered to hold the biggest CO2 mitigation – and market – potential). That contribution, advocates argue, firmly makes carbon utilisation part of the suite of technologies we are going to need to reach the net zero commitments governments and corporations have been making and which, it is becoming clear, can’t be met by renewable electricity alone. “I don’t see a path to net zero without these kinds of technologies,” says Richard Youngman, CEO of Cleantech Group. Premium running shoe brand On – which went public this September – realised that if it was going to reach its aggressive net zero targets it would need to rethink its materials. Its vision is now that half of all its shoe bottom foam will be made not from petrochemicals but captured carbon. Last month, it announced plans to team up with US-based startup LanzaTech – an early pioneer of the sector, which uses a patented fermentation process to make ethanol out of waste carbon monoxide collected from factories which would otherwise be burnt to emit CO2 – and chemical manufacturer Borealis, which makes the foam by polymerising ethylene (to which ethanol can be converted). On is hoping to unveil its first pair of shoes made wholly from captured carbon sometime next year (it has separate arrangements to make the shoe uppers). That first pair will cost about $1m to make, says Caspar Coppetti, On’s co-founder and executive co-chairman. It’s a lab endeavour to prove viability – but, eventually, when it scales, he doesn’t expect the shoes to cost much more than a regular pair. It’s not that CO2 isn’t already used industrially (think carbonated beverages). But those uses either put the gas unchanged back into the atmosphere or, in the case of enhanced oil recovery, where injected CO2 pushes out oil and then remains underground, still perpetuates the extraction of new fossil fuels. What’s different here is that waste CO2 is chemically transformed to make new products. Some, such as building materials, eliminate emissions by locking the carbon away permanently; others, such as jet fuel, prevent new emissions by recycling already emitted carbon. Often grouped with utilisation is CO2 sequestration, which promises to store large amounts of captured CO2 permanently underground, but the two are quite different, as advocates point out. “It’s almost a sin to throw away a valuable resource,” says Volker Sick, a professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Michigan who directs the Global CO2 Initiative. “The beauty of carbon is you can make so many different things.” New York-based startup Air Company, launched in 2017, is selling CO2-made vodka and perfume, and produced hand sanitiser during the pandemic. Like Twelve, it starts with CO2, water and renewable energy but combines them in its reactor to make alcohols such as ethanol. A litre of vodka removes a pound of CO2, and it may soon even use CO2 captured from the heating systems of Manhattan office buildings (in a collaboration with capture startup CarbonQuest). But, like Twelve, Air Company has jet fuel in its sights – which can also be produced from ethanol. It is a crowded field – others pressing ahead with CO2-made jet fuel include LanzaJet, a spinoff from ethanol maker LanzaTech, and SynHelion, which uses solar energy to transform CO2 to syngas. Typically, it is small amounts – think litres per hour – of jet fuel being made at this stage, says Ian Hayton, a materials and chemicals analyst at Cleantech Group. But countries are beginning to introduce quotas for sustainable aviation fuels, which could move things forwards. And the advantage of making it from CO2, rather than biomass or waste vegetable oils, is that it uses far less land. Canadian company CarbonCure, founded in 2012, is one of the pioneers on the building materials side. Backed by investors such as Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Bill Gates’s investment firm, its technology involves injecting CO2 into concrete as it is being mixed. The injected CO2 reacts with the wet concrete and rapidly becomes permanently stored as a mineral, the same one as in limestone. CarbonCure’s business model is to license its technology to concrete manufacturers themselves. CarbonCure retrofits their systems, transforming them into carbon tech companies (the CO2 is supplied by waste emission sources in their region). It gives them a green sales advantage, but really what the concrete producers like is the economic benefit, says co-founder and CEO Robert Niven. It means less cement is needed to make the concrete – most are able to reduce their cement content by about 5% – and the addition of the CO2 also strengthens the final material. It is hard to imagine that food in the form of protein could be mass produced from CO2, but that is exactly what another subset of carbon tech companies are working on. Some, such as Solar Foods in Finland, and Air Protein in California – which uses the tagline “meat made from air” – intend their products for human consumption, while others, such as UK- and Netherlands-based Deep Branch, are focusing on animal feed ingredients. With inputs typically of CO2, water and renewable electricity along with ammonia and nutrients, their proteins are produced in bioreactors from naturally occurring microbes. The microbes grow and multiply and are then dried out to produce a protein powder with all the essential amino acids. “It is somewhere between dried meat, dried soy and dried carrot,” says Pasi Vainikka, Solar Foods co-founder and CEO, of its product Solein. Admittedly, that doesn’t sound very appetising, but, says Vainikka, the taste comes in the final product and Solein is versatile. It could replace pea and soy protein isolate in processed foods or even be used as a feed for the cultivated meat industry. Treated with heat and pressure, it can be eaten like a tasty slab of steak or tofu. Two kilograms of CO2 makes a kilogram of the product and it has been submitted to food regulators in Europe and the UK for novel food approval. Yet the field also faces many challenges to come to fruition. First, if the technology is really going to serve the climate, it has to be scaled up for mass production quickly and offer price-competitive products. “There’s no point unless we can deliver on scale,” says Allison Dring, CEO of German startup Made of Air, which is focusing on plastics replacements. Many of the companies have plans for their first commercial facilities – Twelve, for example, which has designed its equipment to be modular so it can easily be added to increase capacity, a bit like a solar farm, hopes to have its first shipping container-sized plant by next year and predicts significant commercial volume by 2023. But scaling up is capital intensive and takes time. One specific roadblock is finding customers. The startups need bigger companies to pair up with to buy their CO2-made raw materials, but it can be hard for them to break into established supply chains. A big focus of the startup accelerator programme run out of the Urban Futures Lab, called the C2V Initiative, is on making inter-industry connections but, really, more early movers like On are needed. CarbonCure is proud of the fact that 450 concrete plants have been retrofitted with its technology – accounting for virtually all the carbon utilisation project deployments to date, says Niven – but it is only a tiny fraction of the more than 100,000 concrete plants there are worldwide. “Right now, what we need is partners,” he says. Another bottleneck to scale may be providing the large and low-cost quantities of CO2 needed. While technologies are certainly established to capture CO2 from industrial sources, it is only done on a minuscule scale at present, experts note. Direct air capture is less technologically developed and more expensive. And infrastructure will be needed to move the CO2 if, for example, it is being captured in a different place from where it is being used. Massive government intervention and support are required for rapid growth, say advocates – be that by setting a carbon price, through procurement policies in government contracts that require CO2-based alternatives, or by infrastructure investment. “This needs to be exponential growth… and we need policies to support it,” says Peter Styring, an expert in carbon capture and utilisation at the University of Sheffield, who directs its Centre for Carbon Dioxide Utilisation. And while recent US efforts are welcomed – the US infrastructure bill, for example, includes over $8bn for direct air capture and CO2 transportation and storage – “there is space for governments to be braver,” says Cleantech’s Youngman. More detailed guidelines for carbon accounting might also be needed to aid consumer acceptance. Life cycle analyses for the products need to take the whole of the supply chain into account, but companies can set the boundaries in a way that excludes some processes. “We studied concrete production and, in some cases, it actually was worse than just making regular concrete,” says Sick. Both he and Styring are working on improving how companies might perform their assessments as part of an international effort. And just how controversial carbon utilisation will be remains an open question. Not everyone is gung-ho. Innovation has a role to play in curbing climate change, says Mike Childs, head of policy at the environmental campaign group Friends of the Earth, but such “wonder technologies” are “unproven” to work at the massive scale envisaged and are therefore a “huge gamble” with both people’s lives and the planet. “We know that driving down emissions at source is the best and cheapest way to limit global heating,” he says, adding that the technology also risks providing political and business leaders with justification to keep burning fossil fuels. The transition away from fossil fuels is a must, say the advocates of CO2 utilisation. But if we want modern life to go on as normal without sacrifices, we’ll need to find new ways of continuing to produce the goods fossil fuels have given us. This industry, they argue, will not only help mitigate climate change but provide the carbon-based products we will always need. “There’s a lot of ‘climate don’ts’,” says Flanders. “[But] you can actually continue to use products that you like, just made in a better way.” • This article was amended on 5 December 2021.

Joe Biden says he’s “all in” on Africa’s future after unveiling a package of investments and supports at a summit with the continent’s business leaders in Washington DC. The president says infrastructure and the climate emergency are among his top priorities for Africa, as he seeks to build closer ties and limit Russian and Chinese influence in the region. Here’s what else we’ve been watching: Survivors from mass shootings at gay nightclubs in Florida and Colorado gave harrowing testimony at a hearing of the House oversight committee looking into surging violence against the LGBTQ+ community. Democrats say Republicans have “stoked the flames of bigotry” with hundreds of anti-LGBTQ+ laws nationwide. A new poll shows voters have little appetite for a presidential election rematch in 2024 between Biden and Donald Trump. Almost two thirds of registered Democrats and Republicans say they don’t want their 2020 nominees to run again. Georgia’s secretary of state Brad Raffensperger said it was time to drop the general election runoff system that forced Democrat Raphael Warnock to beat Republican challenger Herschel Walker twice within weeks to retain his Senate seat. In a statement marking the 10th anniversary of the Sandy Hook shooting that killed 20 children and six adults, Biden said the US should have “societal guilt” at taking so long to address the problem of gun crime. Thanks for being with us! Please join us again tomorrow. North Dakota has become the latest state to ban the popular social media app TikTok from devices owned by the state government’s executive branch, the Associated Press reports. Governor Doug Burgum signed an executive order Wednesday afternoon, joining Republican colleagues from other states, including South Dakota and Texas, to have previously done so over concerns about the platform’s Chinese ownership and perceived data sharing and national security worries. In addition to prohibiting downloads of TikTok on government-issued equipment or while connected to the state’s network, it bars visiting the TikTok website. “TikTok raises multiple flags in terms of the amount of data it collects and how that data may be shared with and used by the Chinese government,” Burgum said in a statement, according to the AP. In its own statement Wednesday, TikTok said it was “disappointed that so many states are jumping on the bandwagon to enact policies based on unfounded, politically charged falsehoods”. Read more: A hair-raising moment, literally, took place on the Senate floor at lunchtime when New Jersey senator Cory Booker rose to urge colleagues to progress the Crown Act, the acronym for a bill seeking to “create a respectful and open world for natural hair”. It might sound frivolous, but the bill seeks to enshrine in federal statute a measure already passed in 19 states to prevent racial discrimination on the grounds of hair style or color. “You go to my city right now and you’ll find hairstyles of different types, locks, cornrows with braids, Bantu knots, and of course what I once had, afros,” the famously bald Booker said. “[But] there’s a decades-long problematic practice of discrimination against natural hair in this country.” He cited the case of Andrew Johnson, an 18-year-old student in 2018 whose dreadlocks were cut off on the orders of a judge at a high school wrestling match before he was allowed to compete. The episode was caught on video. “You can see the deep hurt and pain on the face of this young man,” Booker said. “It’s the pain felt by many. Traumatic at times, hurtful experiences that make you question your very belonging in a community. “The beauty of your hair, its natural style, your immutable characteristics, your cultural beliefs, your connection to your heritage. No person in America should have to deal with this pain.” Opposing Booker’s plea to advance the bill, Kentucky Republican Rand Paul said it was not necessary. The bill, he said, might compromise the safety of workers who could have the legal right to refuse to wear a helmet in the workplace because of their hair. “Using hairstyle as a pretext for racial discrimination is already illegal,” Paul claimed. The state that prolonged November’s midterms until 6 December won’t be able to do it again, if a proposal by its top election official gets approved. Brad Raffensperger, Georgia’s secretary of state, says it’s time to get rid of the runoff system that requires a revote any time that no candidate in a general election reaches 50% of the votes cast. It’s the reason incumbent Democratic senator Raphael Warnock had to beat Republican challenger Herschel Walker for the second time in a month after coming close to, but not quite reaching, the 50% threshold in November. “Georgia is one of the only states in country with a general election runoff. We’re also one of the only states that always seems to have a runoff,” Raffensperger said, according to Fox5 Atlanta. “I’m calling on the general assembly to visit the topic… and consider reforms.” He said the current system made it difficult for counties, especially those in rural areas with few staff, to handle two elections within weeks of each other, a period that includes Thanksgiving. “No one wants to be dealing with politics in the middle of their family holiday,” he said. Raffensperger was the recipient of an infamous telephone call from Donald Trump asking him to “find” enough votes in Georgia to reverse his 2020 defeat by Joe Biden. A huge part of the Biden administration’s just-announced investment in Africa’s future will be a half-billion dollar investment in infrastructure, specifically the building and maintaining of roads linking ports to interior countries. The money, Joe Biden says, will come from the Millennium Challenge Corporation, an independent government foreign aid agency with a brief to reduce global poverty. The president said that MCC had made new investments of almost $1.2bn in Africa, and expected to commit an additional $2.5bn across the continent over the next four years: This compact will invest $500m to build and maintain roads, put in place policies that reduce transportation costs, make it easier and faster for ships to ship goods from the port of Cotonou [in Benin] into neighboring landlocked countries. The climate emergency, Biden stressed, will be another top focus, with work already under way, funded by $80m in public and private finance, to replace 12 coal-fired power plants in South Africa with renewable energy sources, and to develop “cutting edge energy solutions” such as clean hydrogen. He cited a $2bn deal to build solar energy projects in Angola, and a $600m high speed communications cable linking south Asia and Europe through Egypt, and $800m to help protect African countries against cyber threats. One of the most essential resources for many entrepreneurs and small business owners who want to participate in the global economy is reliable and affordable access to the internet. So today, I’m announcing a new initiative, the digital transformation with Africa. We’re here with Congress to invest $350bn, to facilitate more than almost a half a billion dollars in financing to make sure people across Africa participate in a digital economy. Biden brought his speech to a close just before the kick-off of the France v Morocco World Cup semi-final. Joe Biden has committed to strengthening Africa’s food supplies, tackling the climate emergency and partnering with the continent’s nations to take on the rising global power in the region of China and Russia. In an address at the US Africa Business Leaders forum in Washington DC, the president says “the US is all in on Africa’s future”. He’s outlining a multi-prong approach to strengthen those ties, including the signing of a memorandum of understanding that Biden says will “unlock new opportunities for trade and investment between our countries and bring Africa and the US even closer than ever”: It’s an enormous opportunity for Africa’s future, and the US wants to help make those opportunities real. Included in the package are, he says, up to $370m from the US international development finance fund for new projects, including investing $100m for clean energy for sub-Saharan Africa. Entrepreneurship and innovation are at the top of Biden’s list, he says. And he wants $350bn from Congress for a “digital transformation” for Africa, which includes involving companies such as Microsoft to build networks and infrastructure to bring internet access to five million Africans who are currently not connected: When Africa succeeds, the United States succeeds and, quite frankly, the whole world succeeds as well,” Biden says. Joe Biden is speaking now at the US-Africa leadership summit where he’s about to announce partnerships with African nations and a pathway to better ties and business relations. But the president said he was aware of people knowing the France v Morocco World Cup game was starting at the top of the hour, and were thinking: “Make it short Biden. There’s a semi-final game coming up”. We’ll bring you the best of Biden’s comments. Earlier this month, the Guardian’s Joan E Greve travelled to Newtown, Connecticut to speak with Nicole Hockley and Mark Barden of Sandy Hook Promise, the parents of Dylan and Daniel, who were killed 10 years ago today. For the Guardian’s Politics Weekly America podcast, Joan also met teenagers from the Junior Newtown Action Alliance, who now go through terrifying lockdown drills as preparation for another shooting and who want to see more change in gun legislation, and spoke to Senator Chris Murphy, who helped draft the first significant gun control policy in the US in 30 years this year. The Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren is pressing Congress to adopt bipartisan legislation which would force crypto firms to abide by the same regulations as banks and corporations, in an attempt to crack down on money laundering through digital assets. Ed Pilkington reports… Warren is pushing for the new controls on the crypto industry in the wake of the spectacular collapse of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX. On Tuesday its founder and former CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, was charged with eight criminal counts including conspiracy to commit money laundering. Warren’s bill is being co-sponsored by the Republican senator from Kansas Roger Marshall. The Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act would essentially subject the world of crypto to the same global financial regulations to which more conventional money markets must conform. Under current systems, crypto exchanges are able to skirt around restrictions designed to stop money laundering and impose sanctions. Should the bill be enacted into law it would authorize the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCen) to reclassify crypto entities as “money service businesses” which would bring them under basic regulations laid out in the Bank Secrecy Act. In a statement to CNN, Warren said “commonsense crypto legislation” would protect US national security. “I’ve been ringing the alarm bell in the Senate on the dangers of these digital asset loopholes,” she said, adding that crypto was “under serious scrutiny across the political spectrum”. Bankman-Fried, 30, was indicted by prosecutors at the southern district of New York and is being held in custody in the Bahamas. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has also brought civil charges against him, accusing him of creating a firm that was a “house of cards” Some news out of Oregon that came later yesterday, which we wanted to record: the outgoing Democratic governor Kate Brown has commuted the sentences of all 17 of the state’s death row prisoners to life without parole. “I have long believed that justice is not advanced by taking a life, and the state should not be in the business of executing people – even if a terrible crime placed them in prison,” Brown said in a statement released by her office. “Since taking office in 2015, I have continued Oregon’s moratorium on executions because the death penalty is both dysfunctional and immoral. “Today I am commuting Oregon’s death row so that we will no longer have anyone serving a sentence of death and facing execution in this state. This is a value that many Oregonians share.” Brown’s order will also see the closure of the state’s execution chamber. Oregon’s most recent execution was in 1997, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. Governor John Kitzhaber first declared a moratorium on executions in 2011, which Brown has kept in place ever since. Full story: Voters have little appetite for a rematch between Joe Biden and Donald Trump for the presidency in 2024, a poll released Wednesday lunchtime has found. Roughly six in 10 Republicans, and the same margin in the Democratic party, don’t want their respective 2020 nominees to run again, according to the CNN poll conducted by SSRS. Support from registered Republicans for Trump, especially, has plummeted, a reflection of the former president’s burgeoning legal troubles and, perhaps, the rising star of rightwing Florida governor Ron DeSantis. In January, CNN found, 50% said they hoped Trump would be the nominee and 49% wanted someone else. By July, 44% wanted Trump to be the party’s nominee, and now, only 38% say the same. Trump announced last month his third run at the White House as a Republican. There’s slightly better news for Biden. 40% of registered Democrats want the president to run again in 2024, the poll says, up from only 25% in the summer. But both figures are a drop from the 45% support he received in January. You can read about the poll here. The former Trump campaign chair and White House counselor Kellyanne Conway has repeatedly praised the Republican National Committee on Fox News while failing to disclose that it has paid her firm more than $800,000 since last year, Media Matters reports. Eric Hananoki, an investigative reporter for the liberal media watchdog, writes: “The lack of disclosure about Conway’s financial ties goes against the ethics-challenged network’s purported policy”. He adds: A Fox News spokesperson told the Washington Post in 2019 regarding work Fox News contributor Ari Fleischer did with the RNC that ‘Fox News requires contributors to disclose ties related to any topic he or she discusses on the air in which the contributor may have a financial interest.’ The spokesperson added that such a rule would apply when talking about ‘the RNC on air.’ Elsewhere, the Daily Beast adds that “Karl Rove, another Fox News contributor with deep ties to the GOP, was allowed to keep his paid network gig while overseeing Senate Republicans’ fundraising efforts in 2020”. As Hananoki notes, the RNC and its chair, Ronna McDaniel, have faced fierce criticism since the midterm elections, in which Republicans took back the House but by a slim majority and failed to win back the Senate – a disappointing performance widely blamed on former president Donald Trump, who endorsed a string of defeated candidates. Conway, Hananoki writes, “has used her Fox News platform to praise the RNC and play defense for McDaniel”. According to Media Matters, the RNC “has paid KAConsulting $829,969.38 since 2021 for a variety of expenses. The RNC’s most recent payment was on 4 November for ‘political strategy services’. The organisation recently announced that Conway would serve on a Republican Party Advisory Council ‘to inform the Republican Party’s 2024 vision and beyond’.” Fox News did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The final witness testimony before a Q and A session at today’s House hearing into anti-LGBTQ violence was a chilling account of inside Orlando’s Pulse nightclub as a gunman murdered 49 mostly gay and transgender patrons in 2016. “There were gunshots, endless gunshots; the hair standing up on the back of my neck; the stench of blood and smoke burning the inside of my nose,” said Brandon Wolf, a survivor who lost his two best friends in the massacre, and who has now become a prominent gun control and LBGTQ+ advocate. “A nervous huddle against a wall; a girl trying desperately so hard not to scream. I could feel her trembling on the tiles underneath us. “There was a sprint to the exit, all atop this bang, bang, bang, from an assault weapon. A man filled with hate an armed with a Sig Sauer MCX charged into Pulse, an LGBTQ safe space, and murdered 49 of those we loved.” Wolf called out the bigotry and hatred of extremists who have fomented violence against the LBGTQ+ community, and spread hateful narratives that have resulted in attacks, threats and clampdowns on everything from drag shows, to donut shops to school libraries. “For years cynical politicians and greedy Grifters have joined forces with right wing extremists to pour gasoline on anti LGBTQ hysteria and terrorize our community,” he said. “My own governor Ron DeSantis has trafficked in that bigotry to feed his insatiable political ambition and propel himself toward the White House. “We have been smeared and defamed. Hundreds of bills have been filed in order to erase us; powerful figures have insisted that the greatest threats this country face are a teacher with they-them pronouns, or someone in a wig reading Red Fish, Blue Fish.” Barack Obama has called the Sandy Hook massacre “the single darkest day of my presidency”. In his own statement marking the 10th anniversary of the elementary school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, the former president also said he believed “the tide is turning” on gun violence. His administration was unable to renew a nationwide assault weapons ban, lamenting that inaction on gun safety laws was the “biggest regret” of his time in office. Here’s Obama’s statement today: The news from Sandy Hook Elementary was devastating, a visceral blow, and like so many others, I felt not just sorrow but anger at a world that could allow such things to happen. Even then we understood that mere words could only do so much to ease the burden of the families who were suffering. But in the years since, each of them has borne that weight with strength and with grace. And they’ve drawn purpose from tragedy – doing everything in their power to make sure other children and families never have to experience what they and their loved ones did. The journey hasn’t always been easy – and in a year when there hasn’t been a single week without a mass shooting somewhere in America, it’s clear our work is far from over. But of late, I’ve sensed that slowly, steadily, the tide is turning; that real change is possible. And I feel that way in no small part because of the families of Sandy Hook Elementary. Ten years ago, we all would have understood if those families had simply asked for privacy and closed themselves off from the world. But instead, they took unimaginable sorrow and channeled it into a righteous cause – setting an example of strength and resolve. They’ve made us proud. And if they were here today, I know the children and educators we lost a decade ago would be proud, too. Back at the House oversight hearing into anti-LGBTQ+ violence, Kelley Robinson, president of the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) says her group has recorded an alarming surge in hate-related killings: Over the last 10 years, the campaign has tracked over 300 incidents of fatal violence against transgender and gender non-conforming people. In 2022 so far, we’ve recorded the murder of 35 people. It’s fueled by nearly unfettered access to guns, political extremism and rhetoric that is deliberately devised to make our community less safe, less equal, and less free. Violence has become a lived reality for so many in our community. Robinson condemns “unrelenting efforts by extremist lawmakers help reinforce inflammatory narratives of our community”. In 2020 alone, she says, HRC recorded efforts to pass 344 “anti-LBGTQ+” bills in 23 states, but regardless of how many were passed “these narratives have been weaponized many times” and “encourage extremist rhetoric and to enable violence”. She calls on Congress to pass the Equality Act (which passed the House but stalled in the Senate) “to level the playing field and ensure that LGBTQ plus people are protected from discrimination”. Joe Biden has released a statement marking the 10th anniversary of the Sandy Hook school shooting, in which 20 young children and six adults were killed in Newtown, Connecticut. Ten years ago today, the president says, “our nation watched as the unthinkable happened. Twenty young children with their whole lives ahead of them. Six educators who gave their lives protecting their students. And countless survivors who still carry the wounds of that day. We should have societal guilt for taking too long to deal with this problem. We have a moral obligation to pass and enforce laws that can prevent these things from happening again. We owe it to the courageous, young survivors and to the families who lost part of their soul 10 years ago to turn their pain into purpose. A few months ago, I signed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act into law. We’ve reined in so-called ghost guns which have no serial numbers and are harder to trace. We’ve cracked down on gun trafficking and increased resources for violence prevention. Still, we must do more. I am determined to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines like those used at Sandy Hook and countless other mass shootings in America. Enough is enough. Our obligation is clear. We must eliminate these weapons that have no purpose other than to kill people in large numbers. It is within our power to do this – for the sake of not only the lives of the innocents lost, but for the survivors who still hope. Biden was vice-president to Barack Obama when Sandy Hook happened, on 14 December 2012. In the aftermath, with Democrats in Congress, the two men launched a push for meaningful gun reform – which failed. In his own statement today, Obama said the day of the shooting was “the single darkest day of my presidency. The news from Sandy Hook elementary was devastating, a visceral blow, and like so many others, I felt not just sorrow but anger at a world that could allow such things to happen.” As Biden said, some progress has been made on gun control reform this year – after the shooting deaths in May of 19 children and two adults at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas. Obama said: “I’ve sensed that slowly, steadily, the tide is turning; that real change is possible. And I feel that way in no small part because of the families of Sandy Hook elementary.” Further reading: As the House oversight panel hearing into anti-LBGTQ+ violence continues, committee chair Carolyn Maloney accuses Republicans of “fanning the flames of bigotry”. She says Democrats, meanwhile, “have remained committed to protecting and advancing the health, safety and rights of the LGBTQ+ people”. Unsurprisingly, Republican ranking member James Comer of Kentucky is having none of it. He starts by paying tribute to the Club Q victims, but veers quickly on to a rant about the hearing itself. “Democrats are using committee time and resources today to blame Republicans for this horrendous crime,” he says. “This is not an oversight hearing. This is a ‘blame Republicans so we don’t have to take responsibility for our own defund the police and soft-on-crime policies’,” he insists, without citing any. The Club Q shooter, he says, was “known to law enforcement”, and he follows up with a list of crime statistics in various cities he says shows the Biden administration is “reckless and irresponsible”. The panel is now taking a brief recess before witness testimony begins. Also facing criticism and anger for a rise in anti-LGBTQ+ hate speech online is Elon Musk, the billionaire Twitter owner and former world’s richest man accused overseeing a degradation in standards in the social media network. Maloney played a video made by Sarah Kate Ellis, chief executive of the Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD). “A new GLAAD poll found 48% of LGBTQ people and 72% of transgender respondents fear for their safety in the current political environment. Why is this happening?” Ellis wonders. She says it “starts with candidates and politicians who deliberately spread disinformation and anti LGBTQ inflammatory political messaging. It continues with media”. Ellis says Fox News aired 170 anti-transgender segments in a three week span. She accuses the New York Times of approaching transgender healthcare as a debate, not “settled medicine”. She adds: This rhetoric gets amplified on social media, where hate gets organized into action. Facebook too often refuses to act on the content that spreads lines. On Twitter New Media Matters data shows the malicious, defamatory slurs and rumors increased over 1200% from nine accounts since Elon Musk took over. This behavior is all exacerbated when bad actors have easy access to assault weapons. House oversight committee chair Carolyn Maloney is laying into Republicans for a wave of anti-LBGTQ+ legislation she says “villainizes” that community and is fueling a surge of violence against them. Her comments came at the opening of the panel’s hearing into the rise of the violence, including last month’s Club Q shooting in Colorado Springs that killed five. Maloney, a New York Democrat, said: These actions are the culmination of years of anti LGBTQ extremism that began in state houses across the country and spread to social media, boiling over into the communities where we reside. In 2018, Republicans and state governments across the country introduced 110 pieces of legislation targeting the health and safety of LGBTQI people. In the past legislative session, this number tripled, to more than 340 pieces of anti LGBTQI legislation. These bills villainized LGBTQI+ people in classroom settings, and targeted health care for LGBTQI people, and more directly threaten the freedom of LGBTQI people to live authentically and safely. She is singling out Florida’s so-called Don’t Say Gay law, and the state’s Republican governor Ron DeSantis, for special criticism: This “Don’t Say Gay or Trans” law erases the existence of LGBTQI people, and families, and muzzles our nation’s brightest educators. Within a month of Florida passing this legislation, two additional states passed similar bills. In total 48 bills in more than 20 states have considered eliminating or suppressing LGBTQI people and history in the school curriculum. The House hearing on anti-LGBTQ+ attacks is not this morning’s only event looking at the scourge of gun violence. It’s the 10th anniversary of the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting that cost 26 people their lives, including 20 six and seven-year-olds, and Connecticut senators Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal will speak on the chamber floor at 10.30am to commemorate those lost. Murphy, in particular, has become a strong gun control proponent. He issued a statement this morning ahead of his Senate speech: The nation is a different place, 10 years since 20 innocent children and six dedicated educators were senselessly killed inside Sandy Hook Elementary School. Mostly today, I will think of all the greatness and beauty that was robbed from this world, when these promising lives were cut short. Mostly, I will spend my day today sending every good thought I have to the family members who lost loved ones that day, to the survivors of the shooting, to the first responders, and to the community of Newtown that will never be the same. But also today, I will be thankful. I will be thankful for all the good that has resulted from this horror. Those parents, and the community of Newtown, have chosen to rise from that tragedy and build dozens of efforts that have changed lives for the better all over our nation. And many in Newtown have helped build the modern anti-gun violence movement, that finally this summer achieved the first federal gun safety bill in almost 30 years. Today, I’m so sad for what we lost. But I’m also so inspired and hopeful for all the grace and kindness that has grown out of tragedy, and for all that will come in the future.

But it’s not what you might think, according to Martin Pengelly: A Republican who urged the Trump White House to declare martial law to stop Joe Biden taking office has only one regret: that he misspelled “martial”. The text from Ralph Norman of South Carolina to Mark Meadows, Donald Trump’s final chief of staff, was given to the January 6 committee by Meadows and revealed by Talking Points Memo this week. On 17 January 2021, 11 days after the deadly Capitol attack and three days before Biden’s inauguration, Norman wrote: “Mark, in seeing what’s happening so quickly, and reading about the Dominion law suits attempting to stop any meaningful investigation we are at a point of no return in saving our Republic !! Our LAST HOPE is invoking Marshall Law!! PLEASE URGE TO PRESIDENT TO DO SO!!” No response from Meadows was revealed. On Tuesday, a HuffPo reporter asked Norman about the message. Norman said: “Well, I misspelled ‘martial’.” He added: “I was very frustrated then, I’m frustrated now. I was frustrated then by what was going on in the Capitol. President Biden was in his basement the whole year. Dominion was raising all kinda questions.” The reference to Biden’s basement was to the then Democratic candidate’s decision largely to stay off the campaign trail in 2020, the year of the Covid pandemic. Read the full story: While we wait for the House hearing to begin on violence against the LGBTQ+ community, here’s the report by by colleagues Lauren Gambino and David Smith on last night’s signing by Joe Biden of the landmark Respect for Marriage Act: Joe Biden on Tuesday signed into law landmark legislation protecting same-sex marriages, hailing it as a step toward building a nation where “decency, dignity and love are recognized, honored and protected”. The signing ceremony on the White House South Lawn was a celebration, with guests waving rainbow flags and performances by the Gay Men’s Chorus of Washington DC, Sam Smith and Cyndi Lauper. “This law and the love it defends strikes a blow against hate in all its forms,” Biden said, before signing the Respect for Marriage Act. The ceremony was personal for many in attendance. The transportation secretary, Pete Buttigieg, the first openly gay cabinet member, was there. Also present was Tammy Baldwin, the Democratic senator from Wisconsin, a lead sponsor of the bill and the first openly gay member of that chamber. The Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, said he was wearing the same purple tie he wore to his daughter’s wedding. Schumer’s daughter and her wife are expecting their first child next year. “Thanks to the dogged work of many of my colleagues, my grandchild will live in a world that will respect and honor their mothers’ marriage,” the New York Democrat said, his voice catching. There was sustained applause for the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi. The long-serving congresswoman from San Francisco, a prominent champion of LGBTQ+ rights, praised the crowd of advocates and activists for their “patriotism” and “impatience”. Pelosi, who will soon step down from Democratic leadership, said it was fitting that “one of my final acts as speaker” was to gavel down the vote protecting same-sex marriage last week. The historic legislation protects same-sex and interracial marriages, prohibiting federal and state governments from denying the validity of a lawfully performed union on the basis of sex, race or ethnicity. Read the full story: Survivors of last month’s Club Q attack in Colorado Springs are expected to deliver powerful testimony this morning as the House oversight committee grapples with a surge of violence against the LGBTQ+ community. Five people were killed in the shooting, and three people who were there will appear today to give evidence alongside a survivor of the 2016 attack on Orlando’s gay Pulse nightclub that killed 49. Democrats are highlighting a rise in anti-LGBTQ+ extremism and rhetoric that they say is fueled by “despicable policies that Republicans at every level of government are advancing”, according to committee chair Carolyn Maloney. The panel is looking at hundreds of pieces of anti-LGBTQ+ legislation passed in recent months, including Florida’s infamous “Don’t Say Gay” law that bans discussion of gender identity and sexual orientation in many classrooms. The Human Rights Campaign recorded a more than 400% rise in online hate talk, including branding LGBTQ+ people as “groomers” or “pedophiles”, after the Florida law was passed. Such policies, Maloney says: Attack the health and safety of LGBTQ+ people, are harming the LGBTQ+ community, and contributing to tragedies like what we saw at Club Q. Republicans on my committee and across the country will be forced to face the real-life impact of their dangerous agenda.” The hearing comes in the wake of last night’s landmark signing by Joe Biden at the White House of the Respect for Marriage Act protecting same-sex unions. “This law and the love it defends strikes a blow against hate in all its forms,” the president said. Club Q survivors Michael Anderson and James Slaugh, and the club’s co-founder Matthew Haynes, will give testimony today, along with Brandon Wolf, a gun control activist and Pulse survivor. Wolf wrote in the Guardian last month about how a rise in rightwing anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric has made such attacks inevitable. Read more: Good morning politics blog readers.

Ninety-five per cent of the £1.5bn pot provided for householders in England to make their homes less carbon intensive remains unspent due to long delays in giving out grants to householders and making payments to installers. Some householders have been waiting nearly five months for the grants to be approved and installers say they have had to lay off staff because they are owed tens of thousands of pounds by the scheme, which is run by an American global consulting firm, ICF. By 22 January, only £71m of the £1.5bn promised to householders had been given out – less than 5%. The grants have been extended to run until March 2022 because of the delays. But in a parliamentary answer, the business minister Anne-Marie Trevelyan revealed the £2bn available would not be rolled over into the next financial year from March. She was asked by Labour’s Catherine West whether any underspend in the first tranche of the £2bn green homes grant programme to March 2021 would be rolled over now that the programme was being extended into 2021-22. The minister said: “The original funding for the green homes grant voucher scheme was announced as a short-term stimulus, for use in the 2020-21 financial year only.” She indicated a far smaller amount announced by the chancellor – £320m – would be available from March this year for the green homes grant programme – effectively withdrawing hundreds of millions of pounds from the programme. The green grants were promoted by Boris Johnson as a key plank in his 10 point plan for a green recovery. The government promised the programme would support 100,000 jobs while cutting people’s energy bills and CO2 emissions. Householders can apply for vouchers of up to £5,000 or £10,000 depending on their circumstances, to help pay for installation of new heating systems and insulation. The £2bn scheme was made up of £1.5bn for householders and landlords, and another £500m for local authorities. But news that the unspent hundreds of millions of pounds would not roll over into the next financial year angered the renewable energy industry. Chris Hewett, the chief executive of the trade association Solar Energy UK, said removing the money “would be an alarming early failure of the government’s 10-point plan for a green recovery, transforming a flagship policy into something tokenistic”. The shadow business secretary, Ed Miliband, said it made a mockery of the government’s commitments on climate change and a green recovery. “It is outrageous that the government is withdrawing funding promised to help insulate people’s homes,” he said. “They are denying homeowners the energy improvements they need, denying installers the work they need and denying the country the green transition we need.” Ministers awarded the contract to run the programme to ICF, a large American consulting corporation based in Virginia. Details of the value of the government contract have not yet been published. Miliband said mismanagement of the programme meant just a fraction of the billions was now going to be spent. “Ministers must make good on their funding promise and reverse this farcical decision by rolling all the underspend over into 2021,” he said. Government figures last week showed that just over 21,000 vouchers had been issued to householders since last September, out of their target of 600,000. Hewett said the grant was a great idea that had been poorly implemented. “A year ago the chancellor put £2bn on the table and, as it stands, three-quarters of that is about to taken away by the Treasury,” he said. Removing the £2bn pot would, he said, leave the businesses who have engaged with the programme in good faith out of pocket, undermine confidence in the industry, and ultimately cost more jobs than it delivers. “The government must not pull the rug from underneath consumers and installers,” said Hewett. Philip Dunne, the Conservative chair of the environmental audit committee, criticised the way the programme was being run. He said at the current rate it would take 10 years to fulfil the government’s promise that the grants would help 600,000 householders switch to low-carbon heat alternatives. “Unless overhauled and further extended, this scheme will fail to deliver its ambition,” said Dunne. John Alker, the director of policy and places at the UK Green Building Council, said he would be extremely disappointed if the government did not roll over the £2bn funding into 2021-2. “The problems with the scheme have not been about consumer appetite, but with the scheme’s administration, with householders having to wait months in some cases, and installers having to wait similar amounts of time to get paid for works done,” he said. “Stop-start policy of this kind is extremely counterproductive for businesses looking to invest in delivering a green recovery, and it is disappointing to see that lessons that should have been learned from the fate of previous schemes appear to have been missed.” The £2bn scheme, run by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, was launched last autumn. A pot of £1.5bn was for householders and landlords and another £500m is available for local authorities to improve the energy efficiency of their stock. The government did not provide a comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2020/may/04/nsw-and-queensland-coal-industry-uses-as-much-water-as-all-sydney-households-report-finds","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2020-05-03T17:30:03Z","webTitle":"NSW and Queensland coal industry uses as much water as all Sydney households, report finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/04/nsw-and-queensland-coal-industry-uses-as-much-water-as-all-sydney-households-report-finds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2020/may/04/nsw-and-queensland-coal-industry-uses-as-much-water-as-all-sydney-households-report-finds","fields":{"headline":"NSW and Queensland coal industry uses as much water as all Sydney households, report finds","bodyText":"The coal industry in New South Wales and Queensland is using as much water as all of Sydney’s households, according to new research. A new report by University of Adelaide water resources academic Ian Overton, commissioned by the Australian Conservation Foundation, used public data to examine the impact of coalmining and coal-fired power on water resources. It finds the amount of water consumed by coalmining and coal-fired power in NSW and Queensland is about 383bn litres a year, roughly equivalent to the household water needs of 5.2 million people. The report finds the amount of freshwater withdrawn from water resources for the coal industry each year in those states is 2,383bn litres. About 1,970bn litres of this water is released back into the environment but, the report says, often it has been polluted or processed in such a way that it is harmful to fish, plants and other species. The research says the amount of water used by coal-fired power is 120 times the amount of water used by wind or solar. To produce the figures, Overton drew on water use data from 39 annual reports from 2018 for NSW coalmines to calculate an estimated total water use figure for coalmining in NSW and Queensland. For coal-fired power stations he used data from a 2009 academic report. He said one of the problems in trying to calculate the amount of water used by the coal industry was there was a lack of consistent and freely available current data. As a result some of the figures were likely to be an underestimate. One of the report’s recommendations is for improved oversight of water use by the coal industry and more transparent reporting. Overton said in NSW mining companies often only reported on “components” of their water use, not on all of it, and in Queensland “there was no data on water use in coalmines freely available”. The reports that were available often used different formats and there was no holistic oversight by a single government agency. “Research was based on available information and the evidence suggests the true impact of coal activities on Australia’s water resources is not well known and is likely underestimated due to a lack of transparency and current regulatory frameworks,” the report states. “The lack of data, in particular, is a significant challenge to understanding the true impact of coalmining and coal-fired power on Australia’s water resources.” The report highlights the fact that as Australia’s coalmining activities are concentrated in particular areas, such as NSW’s Hunter region or the Bowen Basin in Queensland, the impact of water use in these areas would be more significant. Kelly O’Shanassy, the chief executive of the Australian Conservation Foundation, said the intent of the research was to highlight the impact of the coal industry’s water use on a dry continent like Australia, and also to draw attention to gaps in data. “While farmers recover from the last devastating drought and prepare for the next, each year the coal industry uses as much freshwater as every household in Queensland or the entire population of Sydney,” she said. “When you add coal-fired electricity’s water consumption and contamination to its climate pollution, it’s clear Australia should rapidly replace coal-fired power with clean energy. “Becoming a modern renewable energy nation will enable us to weather future shocks and become a safer, more sustainable and resilient country.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2021/jan/21/john-kerry-climate-crisis-joe-biden-envoy","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2021-01-21T18:38:00Z","webTitle":"John Kerry commits US to climate crisis fight but warns world is way off pace","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/21/john-kerry-climate-crisis-joe-biden-envoy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2021/jan/21/john-kerry-climate-crisis-joe-biden-envoy","fields":{"headline":"John Kerry commits US to climate crisis fight but warns world is way off pace","bodyText":"The world is lagging behind the pace of change needed to avert catastrophic impacts from the climate crisis, John Kerry has warned in his first remarks as the US’s new climate envoy.

He said it was necessary for coal to be phased out five times faster than recent trends, the planet’s tree cover to be increased five times faster, renewable energy to be ramped up six times faster and a transition to electric vehicles to be 22 times faster than present. “We need to all move together, because today very few are on a trajectory of the steep reductions needed to meet even current goals, let alone the targets we need to avert catastrophic damage,” Kerry said. Kerry’s comments, made to business leaders at a G20 forum, are the first since he began his role as an international climate envoy in Joe Biden’s new administration. Biden, who was sworn in as US president on Wednesday, has launched a blizzard of executive actions to halt fossil fuel pipelines and drilling, protect public lands and return the US to the Paris climate agreement. Biden is expected to convene an international climate summit ahead of crucial UN talks, known as the conference of the parties (or Cop26), to be held in Glasgow later this year. The talks are aimed at escalating cuts to planet-heating emissions agreed in Paris in 2015. A recent UN report starkly outlined the inadequacy of the current targets, which would need to increase more than fivefold to avoid the planet heating up 1.5C above the pre-industrial era and causing a cascade of climate-driven disasters. “At the Cop in November, all nations must raise ambition together – or we will all fail, together,” Kerry said. “Failure is not an option.” Under Trump, the US exited the Paris deal, set about dismantling pollution limits set on power plants and vehicles and opened up vast swaths of federal land and waters to oil and gas drilling. The international community has welcomed the world’s second-largest emitter of greenhouse gases back into the fold but Kerry admitted the US was returning with “humility” due to the jarring reversals of the previous administration. “Humility because we know that the federal government of the United States, until yesterday, walked away from the table for four wasted years when we could’ve been helping to meet the challenge,” said Kerry, a Democrat who ran for president in 2004. Kerry also spoke to Alok Sharma, the UK cabinet minister who will act as president of Cop26 in Glasgow. Sharma pressed Kerry on the need for the US to submit a plan, known as a nationally determined contribution (NDC), under the Paris agreement, setting out its proposed emissions cuts between now and 2030. NDCs are fundamental to the Paris agreement, and all countries are expected to submit one as soon as possible, so that they can be evaluated by the UN ahead of Cop26. The UK’s plan, for a 68% cut in emissions by 2030, compared with 1990 levels, was submitted in December. The Guardian understands that Kerry did not give a firm answer on when the US’s NDC could be expected, but gave assurances that it was a priority. They also discussed climate finance, a crucial issue at the talks. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, told the Guardian in an interview last December that rich countries were failing to provide the promised $100bn a year in financial assistance to poor countries to help them cut emissions and cope with the impacts of climate change, and that this failure could imperil the UN talks. Kerry and Sharma are said to have agreed on the importance of climate finance, and on working together with countries that are vulnerable to climate change. The Biden administration is already facing another difficult international climate conversation after moving to block the Keystone XL pipeline, a project that would bring vast amounts of oil from Alberta, Canada, to be refined in the US. Justin Trudeau, Canada’s prime minister, supports the pipeline and is expected to bring it up with Biden during the US president’s first call with a foreign leader on Friday. There was also reason for optimism amid the challenge of tackling the climate crisis, Kerry stressed, due to the falling cost of solar energy and record investments in clean energy technology and associated jobs. “A zero-emissions future offers huge opportunity for business, for clean, green jobs and economic growth and, to use the president’s words, to ‘build back better’ from the global economic crisis,” Kerry said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/live/2023/may/24/boris-johnson-police-partygate-covid-lockdown-rishi-sunak-keir-starmer-pmqs-uk-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-24T17:04:09Z","webTitle":"Boris Johnson claims publication of Covid inquiry ruling unfairly implies he is holding back documents – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/may/24/boris-johnson-police-partygate-covid-lockdown-rishi-sunak-keir-starmer-pmqs-uk-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/live/2023/may/24/boris-johnson-police-partygate-covid-lockdown-rishi-sunak-keir-starmer-pmqs-uk-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"Boris Johnson claims publication of Covid inquiry ruling unfairly implies he is holding back documents – as it happened","bodyText":"Downing Street has denied Boris Johnson is the victim of a politically motivated stitch-up, as Rishi Sunak sought to distance himself from a fresh police investigation into further Partygate claims. Boris Johnson has severed ties with government lawyers supporting him during the Covid inquiry, with allies saying he had “lost faith” in the system after he was reported to police over fresh Partygate allegations. He has also complained about the publication today of an order by the Covid inquiry saying that his unredacted WhatsApp messages must be handed over to it, arguing that the release of this statement unfairly implies he is withholding information. (See 2.03pm.) Keir Starmer has accused the government of having “lost control of immigration”, as Labour announced a plan to change the post-Brexit migration system to boost skills and wages. Suella Braverman will remain as home secretary, after Rishi Sunak decided not to order an investigation into whether she broke the ministerial code by requesting a one-to-one speed awareness course. Paul Mason, the leftwing Labour activist and former Newsnight economics editor, has welcomed Rachel Reeves’ speech. (See 5.30pm.) These are from Jonathan Portes, an economics professor and migration specialist, and former government economist, on Labour’s new plan for work visas. (See 4.09pm.) Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, has delivered her speech on “securonomics”. (See 11.50am.) There was not any specific policy in the speech, and it would be an exaggeration to say her new term is trending on Twitter, but there was some interesting material in what she said on Labour’s broad economic thinking. The full text is here. And here are some key points. Reeves claimed that globalisation, in its old form, is dead. She said: No democratic government can be content with a lack of decent work, falling wages and the dimming of people’s hope for a better life. To do so is to betray the people we were elected to represent, and risks fanning the flames of populism, as our two countries know only too well. That’s why it is time for us to admit that globalisation, as we once knew it, is dead. We must care about where things are made and who owns them. We must foster new partnerships, between the free market and an active state and between countries across the world who share values and interests. This demands a new approach, one that I call ‘securonomics’. She said the old economic model was failing Britain. She said: Twenty years ago, the average Briton was wealthier than their European neighbour. Today, the average French family is 10 percent richer than their British peers and in Germany, that figure rises to 19 percent. The UK was both too open and too closed, she said. It is a signal achievement of Britain’s recent government that it has managed to be both too open and too closed. Too open, in letting Britain’s industrial strength hollow out. Too closed, in the barriers to trade it has erected through its chaotic Brexit deal. She said she wanted to follow the economic policies of the Biden administration. She said: I am here in Washington today because, while the old ‘Washington Consensus’ might have been swept away, a new one is emerging. At its heart is what Treasury Secretary Yellen has called “modern supply side” economics. The Biden Administration is rebuilding America’s economic security, strength and resilience. A more active state, pursuing a modern industrial strategy, is selecting the areas where America must guarantee its ability to produce what America needs whether that’s in digital technology through the Chips act, or in clean energy and industry through the Inflation Reduction Act. Reeves also criticised Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, for rejecting the Biden administration’s approach to subsidies. She said Labour would invest in critical industries. She said: Through Labour’s green prosperity plan, an initiative we first announced 18 months ago, we will make public investments in the industries that are crucial to Britain’s future success. A new national wealth fund will invest in British industries and provide a long-term return for the taxpayer. GB Energy, a new public energy company, will invest in the clean energy sources of today and tomorrow. She claimed two problems have blighted modern economic policymaking. She said: The first of these is what I consider a fundamental under-appreciation of the role of government. That error dictated that a government’s primary economic imperative should simply be to get out of the way of free enterprise … The second error flowed from the first. It was the assumption that the people and places that matter to a country’s economic success are few in number. This misconceived view held that a few dynamic cities and a few successful industries are all a nation needs to thrive. New polling by YouGov suggests 73% of Britons think it is very likely (49%) or fairly likely (24%) that Boris Johnson committed further breaches of Covid rules beyond those already investigated. Newly announced government rules to require identity checks for postal and proxy voting in UK parliamentary elections are likely to make it harder for older people to take part in elections, a leading charity has warned. Peter Walker has the story. Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary, has announced that he is commissioning an independent review of the Teesworks joint venture at the Teesside freeport. He made the announcement in a letter to Ben Houchen, the Tory Tees Valley mayor, who asked for an inquiry because he wants to quash claims that public money has been wrongly spent on the project. Gove said that the government had seen “no evidence of corruption, wrongdoing or illegality”. He went on: I recognise, however, that the continued allegation of ‘corruption’ poses a very real risk to our shared ambitions to deliver jobs and economic growth in Teesside. In this context, I understand why you want to invite further, independent scrutiny. Gove said he would not ask the National Audit Office to conduct an inquiry, because it was not the NAO’s job to audit local government bodies. Instead, he said, he would “appoint a panel, in line with established practice, to undertake an independent, external assurance review”. Labour had called for the NAO to carry out an inquiry. This is the announcement that Rishi Sunak referred to at PMQs. See 12.01pm. Neil Coyle will have the Labour whip restored following his suspension after using “abusive language with racial overtones” towards a journalist in a drunken confrontation in a Commons bar, PA Media reports. PA says: The opposition chief whip told a meeting of the PLP parliamentary committee on Wednesday that Coyle had made efforts to address his problematic drinking since the incident. Alan Campbell will continue to “closely monitor” his conduct for the foreseeable future, Labour sources said. Coyle had the whip suspended in February last year and earlier this year, after an investigation by the Commons independent expert panel, he was suspended from the Commons for five days. As promised, here are more details of the Labour new immigration policy that Keir Starmer referenced at PMQs today. (See 1.33pm.) The party sent it out in a news released headlined: “Labour to end wage discount in immigration system and boost UK workforce training.” Labour proposes five changes to the current points-based system for immigration. It says it would: 1) Scrap the 20% wage discount on the salaries businesses are required to pay for jobs on the shortage list 2) Introduce new training plans and requirements for key occupations on the shortage occupation list - including Labour’s plan for more doctors and nurses and fair pay agreements for social care 3) Reform of apprenticeship levy to support upskilling and skilling in key shortage areas including IT and engineering 4) Limit access to the immigration system for employers who fail to provide fair pay for fair work, including stronger visa penalties for those found guilty of flouting labour and minimum wage laws 5) Reform the migration advisory committee to link it to the bodies setting out industrial and skills strategy - learning from the Australian approach to ensure that where skills shortages lead to a sector remaining on the shortage occupation list, that must be tackled with a plan to upskill workers in the UK. This is what Labour says about how the 20% wage discount works for jobs on the shortage occupation list. Under current arrangements, the general immigration route for work purposes is the skilled worker visa. Lasting for up to five years, an employer can recruit from abroad using this route providing (i) the salary offered is at least £26,200 and is at least the “going rate” for the occupation; (ii) the employer is licensed as a sponsor; (iii) the occupation is at the requisite skill level, RQF3+ (approximately A-Level or above); and (iv) the individual can speak English to the requisite standard. NOTE: the “going rate” for the job is calculated by the ONS as being the 25th percentile for that occupation/skill/experience level so it is already at the lower end of the salary scale. In theory the “going rate” provision is designed to prevent undercutting, especially on pay and conditions. For jobs on the shortage occupation list the minimum salary threshold falls to a floor of £21,600 and people can be paid up to 20% less than the going rate. Visa application fees are lower (alongside other exemptions). Labour would work with business to develop a timetable for the implementation of these combined reforms to training and the points-based system, as part of Labour’s review into work-based migration led by Stephen Kinnock. This is what Labour says about why the 20% wage discount is being abused. Fresh analysis by the party reveals that some occupations such as nurses and civil engineers – have remained on the shortage occupation list for a shocking 15 years, without any concerted action to address the underlying causes, while work visas have gone up by 95% since before the pandemic. Labour’s review of the points-based system has found that there is a built-in incentive for employers to recruit from overseas in shortage occupations where they can pay 20% less than the “going rate” rather than training and recruiting in the UK. It means that for example civil engineers, who are currently paid on average £44,000 a year and where the official government “going rate” is £34,000 a year, can instead be recruited from abroad at just £28,000 a year – undermining the incentives for employers to recruit, train or improve pay and conditions at home. And this is what the migration advisory committee (MAC) said about getting rid of the 20% discount in its annual report in 2021. Decisions on which occupations to include on the SOL [shortage occupation list] are made by ministers following recommendations from the MAC. These occupations are then subject to different, more favourable, migration arrangements, enabling employers to access a wider pool of suitable workers, at a lower threshold of £20,480 or 80% of the going rate, whichever is higher. This lower threshold is the primary advantage of an occupation being listed on the SOL in the SW [skilled worker] route … The MAC has never supported lowering the salary threshold below the ‘going rate’ for an occupation. If there is a shortage in the occupation, it seems perverse that paying lower wages will address the issue. Furthermore, the ‘going rate’ thresholds are in place to prevent undercutting of resident workers and being placed on the SOL should not enable employers to avoid this constraint. In practice, few employers are using this advantage, with only 15% of applications for these select SOL occupations in the first nine months of 2021 paying below the ‘going rate’. The evidence that few are taking advantage of this suggests it is not helpful for employers either, and we would therefore recommend that the government reconsider whether SOL occupations should be allowed to pay below the ‘going rate’ for the occupation. Here is a question from BTL. What Rishi Sunak actually said was: In the past week, we have discovered that, thanks to the reforms of this Conservative government, our young people are now the best readers in the western world. According to Schools Week, on at least one measure, this is true. In its report on the PIRLS international reading league tables, it says: Literacy test and questionnaires were collected from 4,150 year 5 pupils across 162 schools in England. The country achieved an average reading score of 558, one point below the score when the tests were last held in 2016. Despite this, the country moved from joint eighth to four this year. Only Russia, Hong Kong and Singapore had higher average scores. England outperformed countries including Finland, Poland, Sweden, Bulgaria and Norway who previously either achieved similar or better scores. Jennifer Williams, the Financial Times journalist who has written at length on concerns about how public money has been spent on the Teesside freeport project, says it is not clear what Rishi Sunak meant when he talked about an inquiry going ahead (see 12.01pm), because no such inquiry has yet been announced. At its post-PMQs briefing No 10 also rejected claims that ministers or officials were involved in a politically-motivated “stitch-up” of Boris Johnson that has led to fresh evidence that he broke lockdown rules being reported to the police. (See 9.26am.) Asked about these claims, made by unnamed Tories briefing journalists, the PM’s spokesperson said they were wrong. He went on: No 10 and ministers have no involvement in this process and were only made aware after the police had been contacted. To be crystal clear, ministers were not involved in the decision at all to refer the information to the police. The spokesperson also pointed out that the Cabinet Office issued a fresh statement about this story this morning. A Cabinet Office spokesperson said: The Cabinet Office has not made any assessment or conducted any investigation of the material that has been passed to the police. Ministers played no role in deciding whether the information should be handed over to the police. The police were first contacted on 16 May prior to any minister being made aware. The decision to contact the police and the subsequent decision to share the information was not made by ministers but by officials acting in line with the civil service code. Downing Street has defended the Cabinet Office’s initial decision to refuse to supply the Covid inquiry with Boris Johnson’s unredacted WhatsApp communications and certain other documents. At a post-PMQs briefing, the PM’s spokesperson said that the government had already provided more than 55,000 documents, 24 personal witness statements and eight corporate statements to the inquiry. But the spokesperson said there was no duty to disclose “unambiguously irrelevant” material. He told reporters: The principle in question here is around disclosure of materials which are clearly irrelevant to the work of the inquiry – for example WhatsApps which are personal in nature, of no relevance to the work of the inquiry, or relate to a wholly different area of policy. It’s our position that the inquiry does not have the power to compel the government to disclose unambiguously irrelevant material, given the precedent that this would set and its potential adverse impact on policy formulation in the future. Lady Hallett, the inquiry chair, has now issued a ruling saying she has rejected the Cabinet Office submission saying the material originally requested should not be disclosed. She says the material now has to be submitted by 4pm on 30 May. The PM’s spokesperson said the government would “consider our next steps carefully” in response to this ruling. Labour has criticised the way Rishi Sunak handled the claims that Suella Braverman broke the ministerial code. At a post-PMQs briefing, a Labour spokesperson said it would have been better if Sunak had let his ethics adviser investigate, instead of resolving the matter himself. The spokesperson explained: We seem to have created this weird sort of hybrid situation where there’s a sort of conversation that doesn’t count as an investigation, which I think satisfies nobody in terms of the necessary transparency and openness. The whole point of having an independent adviser is so that these matters can be looked at thoroughly and these facts can be put in the public domain in a way that isn’t subject to political spin. Here is my colleague Peter Walker’s story about PMQs. And this is how it starts. Keir Starmer has accused the government of having “lost control of immigration”, as Labour announced a plan to change the post-Brexit migration system to boost skills and wages. In a prime minister’s questions a day before new annual net migration statistics are expected to show a record number of arrivals, Starmer said Rishi Sunak had broken the Conservatives’ manifesto promise to reduce immigration. In an announcement made as Starmer spoke, Labour said it would scrap a rule under which overseas staff brought into the UK to fill vacancies on the shortage occupation list, including health, IT and engineering workers, could be paid up to 20% less than the equivalent domestic wage. Boris Johnson tried to get Lady Hallett, the chair of the Covid inquiry, to delay by 48 hours the announcement of her order to the Cabinet Office for his WhatsApp messages and diaries entries to be disclosed. The inquiry has published a letter from Johnson to Hallett on its website, alongside a reply to Johnson from the inquiry. In his letter Johnson complains that the process is unfair towards him. Confirming that he is getting new lawyers to represent him, he says: You may be aware that I am currently instructing new solicitors to represent me in the inquiry. That process is well under way but is in the hands of the Cabinet Office to agree funding and other practical arrangements. I have no control over the timing of that process. As at today, I am unrepresented and my counsel team have been instructed not to provide me with any advice. My understanding is that your ruling affects me directly. However, I have never seen the notice, I was not party to nor have seen the Cabinet Office’s representations under s21(4), and I am not allowed to see your ruling before it is published. This is highly prejudicial to me given that I believe your ruling may directly and/or indirectly suggest that I have failed to provide documents to the inquiry. Any such suggestion or implication would be unfair and untrue. The notice was issued before the deadline had passed for me to provide material to the inquiry. I have always sought to comply with all disclosure requests from the inquiry and I have already disclosed over 5,000 pages of documents and over 300 pages of emails. The inquiry has also published on its website the original notice to the Cabinet Office telling it to release the WhatsApp messages and diary material, the reply from the Cabinet Office arguing some material should be excluded, and Hallett’s ruling saying she has rejected the government’s argument and that the material must be disclosed. The official public inquiry into the government’s handling of Covid threatened the Cabinet Office with legal action over its refusal to share Boris Johnson’s WhatsApp messages and diaries from during the pandemic without heavy redactions, Pippa Crerar reports. Labour has just announced a new policy on immigration. At first glance, it seems reasonably robust, and, if people knew what it was, it might go some way to addressing the claim – widely believed, and set out again today by Rishi Sunak – that the party does not have any firm policy in this area. Keir Starmer tried to set it out at PMQs. But as a policy announcement, it was a flop, and in that respect today’s PMQs outing for Starmer was a serious lost opportunity. Under current rules, employers who need to recruit foreign workers, because they cannot find UK staff, can pay them 20% below what is considered the “going rate” for the job if they are on the shortage occupation list. In a speech to the CBI last year Starmer said that he wanted to stop businesses being dependent on foreign labour, and get them to hire British workers instead by improving training and pay. Today he has translated that into firm policy. The 20% wage discount would no longer be allowed, the party says. It is not an outlandish idea (although employers won’t be happy). The migration advisory committee proposed this in a report in 2021. Starmer sort of announced this at PMQs. But he did not get round to it until his third question, in the cut and thrust of the exchanges it was hard to evaluate the significance of what he was saying, and given that the worker visa law is relatively complicated, it is not an easy policy to explain in the context of PMQs. The fact that a Tory MP got thrown out for some type of hooligan behaviour did not help either. Starmer said: The reason they are issuing so many visas is labour and skill shortages. And the reason there are shortages is the low-wage Tory economy. Under his government’s rules, businesses in IT, engineering, healthcare, architecture, welding can pay foreign workers 20% less than British workers for years and years on end. Does he think his policy is encouraging businesses to train people here or hire from abroad? In his next question, Starmer also suggested that the apprenticeship levy was not working. (Another part of the policy announcement is that Labour would reform this.) Starmer said: They have lost control of the economy, they have lost control of public services and now they have lost control of immigration. And if he was serious about weaning his government off the immigration lever, he would get serious about wages in Britain and get serious about skills and training. I will post more on the announcement shortly. The consequence of Starmer’s failure to properly land what he was announcing was that he let Sunak off the hook. Starmer had quite a good retort when Sunak said Labour favoured an open door policy, and he did make the point that legal migration numbers are going up because the government has allowed labour shortages to continue. But Sunak neutralised these attacks quite easily. He was not particularly comfortable on this territory, and very eager to move on to talking about the IMF and international reading league tables, but any non-partisan observer listening would not have concluded that Starmer won the argument. How could he have managed it better? First, if you are announcing marginally complicated policy, you need to roll the pitch first, so people know what’s coming. Second, if you want to land an important point, you need to repeat it; Starmer could have told Sunak that Labour would stop employers paying this 20% discount to foreign workers and challenged him, six times, to say whether or not he would do the same. And, third, he could inject some urgency into it all; publish a draft bill, wave it about at the dispatch box, and then tell Sunak that, instead of letting MPs disappear for a half-term recess tomorrow, he should make them stay in the Commons to legislate. People think Labour does not have many policies, or a clear vision for Britain. In fact, the party has a stack of policy ideas. But few, if any, have lodged in the public’s consciousness. Better salesmanship would address that. Boris Johnson is cutting his links with the government lawyers who have been representing him in dealings in relation with the Covid inquiry, Steven Swinford from the Times reports. Labour tweeted this after Keir Starmer attacked Rishi Sunak over immigration policy at PMQs. At PMQs Rishi Sunak said there was going to be an inquiry into claims public money was wrongly spent in the Teesworks project at the Teesside freeport development. (See 12.01pm.) Darren Jones, the Labour chair of the Commons business committee, which has been calling for this, says this is news to him. Karl Turner (Lab) asks why the government is spending £250,000 on legal advice for Boris Johnson to address claims he lied to parliament. Sunak says it has been the practice for many years that ministers should get help with legal costs in relation to matters related to what happened when they were in office. PMQs has now finished. David Jones (Con) asks about the Betsi Cadwaladr health board in north Wales. Sunak says he is concerned about what has happened at this hospital in Labour-run Wales. Andrew Bridgen (Reclaim) asks if the PM agrees that schools should not encourage children to transition. Sunak says he has been very clear that schools should be sensitive in how they teach these matters. The DfE is reviewing the guidance on this, he says. He says there have been cases of unacceptable responses. Peter Gibson (Con) asks about an 80-year-old constituent doing a wing-walk this Saturday to raise money for a hospice. Sunak wishes her well, and wonders whether Gibson will be joining her. Kim Johnson (Lab) asks why the government does not support free school meals for all children. Sunak claims poverty has gone down since 2010. The best support for children is to ensure they don’t grow up in a workless household, he says. Tom Hunt (Con) says there was film yesterday of the police doing nothing when eco-protesters were blocking roads in London. Does the PM agree that, if they do that, they should immediately be turfed off the road? Sunak says the government has given the police the power to deal with slow-moving demonstrations. Labour voted against, he says. Steve Brine (Con) asks about a constituent who died as a result of a food allergy, after being given a chicken burger that had been marinated in buttermilk, even though he had asked about this. Sunak says he will ensure the constituent’s family get a meeting with a minister to discuss how the law on this could be tightened. Wendy Chamberlain (Lib Dem) says she worked for the police before becoming an MP. Training is important for compliance. Given that is a problem for ministers, will the PM support her ministerial training bill? Sunak says there are processes in place for training in government. But he says the government has backed lifelong training. Stella Creasy (Lab) says Sunak backed Brexit because it would stop unelected officials in Brussels deciding UK laws. But the retained EU law bill will let unelected officials in No 10 decide British laws (because of Henry VIII powers in the bill). Sunak does not accept that. He says the government will take the decisions. Brendan Clarke-Smith (Con) asks about government investment in Bassetlaw. Sunak says levelling up partnerships are working. Vicky Foxcroft (Lab) says Windrush victims are still waiting for compensation. Will Sunak commit to ensuring they get the compensation they deserve? Sunak says more than £70m has been paid out or offered already. And the government is committed to implementing most of the recommendations from the Wendy Williams report. Anthony Browne (Con) says unions want to spread the four-day working week in the public sector, even though it pushes up costs and does not improve services. Sunak says it is disappointing that Browne’s Lib Dem-led South Cambridgeshire council is doing this. Sarah Olney (Lib Dem) says a solar energy company says the UK is the least attractive country to base itself in, because of the lack of industrial strategy. Every week, more and more businesses are leaving the UK, she says. Sunak says Olney obviously missed the comments from the IMF yesterday, and his trip to Japan, where investments worth £18bn were announced. Sunak says the government remains committed to new facilities at Torbay hospital. Sunak says hopefully energy bills will be coming down “very soon”. Matt Warman (Con) asks if the PM agrees the government needs to map the regions most affected by artifical intelligence, so it can prepare for job changes. Sunak says AI has great potential, but needs to be introduced carefully. Colum Eastwood (SDLP) asks for better pay for public sector workers. And does the PM agree the DUP should get back to work? Sunak says he wants to see power sharing restored in Northern Ireland. And he says health has been prioritised in the NI budget. Andrew Selous (Con) asks when the government will make prompt access to primary care a reality. Sunak says giving more power to pharmacies will be part of the primary care plan. Stephen Flynn, the SNP leader at Westminster, asks about price rises. Is this a cost of greed crisis? Sunak says food inflation is too high. The government is providing signficiant support with the cost of living, he says. Flynn says food inflation is close to a 45-year high. The Treasury says it might act, but after a CMA review. When will that be over? Sunak says it is for the CMA to conclude its review. He says if the SNP were to reconsider its deposit return scheme, that would reduce prices for consumers. Starmer says Sunak needs, not a speed awareness course, but a reality check. Labour is the party of working people, he says. Sunak says we just hear “empty rhetoric'” from Labour. The government has acted on strike, on protests and on stopping the boats. Labour voted against all of them, he says. Starmer says Suella Braverman wants Britons to become fruit pickers. Does the PM support this? Or does he want Braverman to have her own career change? Sunak says the IMF has backed the government’s approach. The reading results are the best in the western world, and ambulance waiting times are coming down. Starmer says if the government was serious about this, it would ensure wages are higher in the UK. He says the apprenticeship levy is not working. Sunak says young people are now the best readers in the western world. And he says he is surprised that Starmer is not quoting the IMF today. The speaker has ordered the Tory MP Paul Bristow to leave for heckling too loudly. Starmer says tomorrow the figures will be out, and people will see what an open doors policy looks like. There are shortages because so many businesses can pay foreigner workers 20% less than British workers. Sunak says Labour wants more people to come to the UK. Those are the words of a Labour frontbencher who said having a target was not sensible, and that numbers might have to go up. Starmer wants free movement back, he says. Starmer says the figures are out; it is 250,000. Sunak just does not want to say it, he says. He says Sunak stood on three manifestos promising lower migration. Why does the home secretary have such a problem with points-based systems? Sunak says the government has come up with the biggest initiative this week to reduce migration. Labour has no plans, he says. That is because it believes in an open doors migration policy. Keir Starmer asks how many work visas were issued to foreign workers last year. Sunak says new figures are out later this year. Richard Graham (Con) says Labour does not have a magic wand to solve NHS waiting lists. He cites the Labour experience in Wales. Sunak says there is more to be done. The government has a plan, he says. Sharon Hodgson (Lab) asks if Sunak agrees with Ben Houchen, the Tees Valley mayor, that the NAO should investigate the Teesworks project in the Teesside freeport. Sunak says the levelling up secretary, Michael Gove, has already announced an investigation. But it is the same old stuff from Labour, he says. The Tories are delivering for Teesside, he claims. Rishi Sunak starts with the usual spiel about having ministerial meetings today. PMQs is starting soon. Here is the list of MPs down to ask a question. In a speech in Washington later Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, is going to set out Labour’s economic vision for Britain. At the risk of being indicted for crimes against the English language, she is calling it “securonomics”. According to an extract sent out in advance, she will explain it like this. It begins by accepting that the world has changed and Britain must change with it. In our age of insecurity, we have discovered the weaknesses of our old economic model: too unambitious about the role an active state can play, too willing to believe that wealth will trickle down, and too reliant on the contribution of a few places, a few industries and a few people. Investing in the industries and technologies that will determine our future economic success, and building financial security in each and every household in Britain with good jobs, decent pay and fair working conditions to ensure that working people can contribute to our national success, and that financial security underpins our economic strength. From the ashes of the old model, securonomics emerges: building the industries that guarantee Britain’s economic security, forging resilience at home, while creating new partnerships abroad and bringing together an active state in partnership with a vibrant market. Reeves has set out more details in a pamphlet published this morning called A New Business Model for Britain. The word “securonomics” is in the press release for the pamphlet, but not in the document itself. That may be a sign that it was dreamed up at the last minute. David Cameron, the former Conservative prime minister, has urged ministers to use welfare reforms and training programmes to reduce the need for foreign labour, ahead of the release of figures yesterday expected to show record levels of net migration. In an interview with LBC, Cameron said: I think the way to think about immigration is to recognise it’s a three-sided problem. There’s what immigration controls you can put in place. There’s what welfare reforms you have, to try and make sure that people who can work, do work. Then there’s what training and apprenticeship and other schemes you have, to make sure that we are training people for the jobs that our country is delivering. In what seemed like a reference to the government’s illegal migration bill, Cameron said that “having firm policies for returning people who have no right to be here does matter”. But he went on: But if you’re not reforming welfare so we’re getting working-age people who are on out-of-work benefits back into work, and if you’re not training people for the jobs we’re making available, then you’ll never solve the problem. Cameron promised before the 2010 election that the Tories would get annual net immigration below 100,000. He never came close to achieving this, and concerns about immigration and free movement were one of the main reasons he lost the Brexit referendum in 2016, prompting his resignation. Asked about the proposal to send asylum seekers to Rwanda, Cameron did not fully endorse it, but would not criticise it either. He said: I think if you don’t have a better answer to the things that the government is doing to try and stop this illegal trade, then I think there’s no point criticising. New projections from YouGov this morning predict Labour could gain 23 seats from the SNP at the next general election, coming after recent polling suggesting a sea change in Scottish politics after Nicola Sturgeon’s resignation in February. Latest opinion polls have shown a marked fall in support for the SNP after the party’s tumultuous leadership election campaign, and the police investigation into the party’s finances. Now YouGov predicts the worst result for the SNP and best for Labour since 2010, and also suggests that the seat currently held by Scottish Conservative leader, Douglas Ross, could fall to the SNP. To make these seat projections YouGov used a statistical technique called MRP – but adds a heavy caveat that Scotland has one of the highest concentrations of marginal seats in the UK, with 22 of the 59 seats in this model having winning margins of less than 5%. The modelling suggests Labour would regain seats in former strongholds around the central belt, including the city of Glasgow, and also predicts that Labour would win the seat of Rutherglen and Hamilton West, currently held by former SNP MP Margaret Ferrier and where a highly anticipated byelection is expected in the coming months. While all this means a headache for current first minister and SNP leader, Humza Yousaf, his predecessor Nicola Sturgeon is sounding pretty relaxed this morning in her new fortnightly column for the Glasgow Times. In it she describes her new love of hill-walking and the “new perspective and different focus that comes with no longer being first minister”. She only makes a glancing reference to the “unexpected and unwelcome” developments around the ongoing police investigation, which she says she is currently not able to expand on. Thera will be will be an urgent question in the Commons after PMQs about the new visas rules for foreign students announced yesterday. Carol Monaghan, the SNP MP who tabled the UQ, wants Suella Braverman, the home secretary, to respond, but the Home Office could put up another minister. The Liberal Democrats have accused Rishi Sunak of a “cowardly cop-out” in relation to Suella Braverman. In a statement on his decision that she did not breach the ministerial code, Wendy Chamberlain, the Lib Dem chief whip, said: This is a cowardly cop-out from Rishi Sunak. With every scandal, we see the prime minister dither, delay and flip-flop - never taking decisive action. This is not the leadership the country needs during such a severe cost-of-living crisis. Sunak is too weak to even order an investigation, let alone sack his home secretary. Although Suella Braverman’s letter to Rishi Sunak is quite lengthy, it does not address the claim that her special adviser lied to a Daily Mirror journalist when he denied that she had been caught speeding. This seems to have been a breach of the code of conduct for special advisers, which says they must not “deceive or knowingly mislead ministers, parliament or others”. In the Commons on Monday Braverman refused to say whether she authorised her adviser to respond as he did to the question from the Daily Mirror. This issue is likely to come up again at PMQs. In her letter Suella Braverman also explains why she did not declare her fixed-penalty notice as something that might create a conflict of interest. Her letter implies that either Rishi Sunak, or Sir Laurie Magnus, the independent adviser on ministers’ interests, thought this was a possible issue. Braverman says she did not think this would count as an interest. But she recognises that new guidance was issued in November 2022, and she says in future she would declare a fine, or a speeding awareness course. And this is what Suella Braverman says in her letter about what she said to her officials about trying to arrange a private speed awareness course, and why. Around June 2022, while Attorney General, I was found to be speeding. I received notification that I could take a group speed awareness course or receive a fine and three points on my licence, which was clean at the time. I opted to take the course and booked a date in Autumn. After arriving at the Home Office in September as Home Secretary, I informed officials in my Home Office Private Office (PO) about the course and asked whether it was appropriate given my new role … In discussions with my Principal Private Secretary (PPS) I was advised that the Cabinet Office’s Propriety and Ethics Team (PET) would be the best source of advice on whether it was appropriate to seek to do the course in a way that protected my privacy, security, and was least disruptive to the course participants and provider. I readily agreed to this suggestion. Consequently, on 28 September 2022 my PPS discussed this with the Permanent Secretary’s Office. The Permanent Secretary’s Office, at the request of the Permanent Secretary, then asked PET for guidance (noting that their own initial view was that this was not a matter for civil servant involvement) and asked if they were aware of any precedents and for any advice. PET advised it was not an appropriate matter for civil servants to take forward. My PPS also rightly pointed out that I needed to be mindful to ensure that I did not ask a company to change their rules due to my position, which neither I, nor to the best of my knowledge anyone acting on my behalf, ever sought to do. My PPS confirmed that I could continue discussing the matter with Special Advisers, and asked them to pick up with me. I made no further requests of officials. I therefore later engaged with Special Advisers about how we would enable my participation in a way that would maintain my security and privacy. This was to determine whether there were other options possible within the overall framework and rules of the provider. My preference at this point, following consultation with my Special Advisers, was to attend a group course in person rather than online due to privacy concerns. Participation in a speed awareness course is supposed to be private, and Special Advisers raised concerns about the risk of me being covertly recorded while participating online, and the political ramifications of this. PO and the Permanent Secretary’s officials also had previously advised that participating online risked generating media interest. However, Special Advisers raised concerns about the difficulties of ensuring the appropriate security arrangements for an in-person course. Their concerns included that my protective Security team might need to join me in the room or be unable to undertake appropriate vetting of other course participants owing to third party privacy concerns. Special Advisers then contacted the course provider to better understand the range of appropriate options that might be available - and consistent with the course provider’s rules, policies and practices. Based on this further information, I concluded that none of these could satisfactorily address the aforementioned security, privacy and political concerns. I therefore opted to take the points and pay the fine, which I did in November. And here is Suella Braverman’s apology, from her letter to Rishi Sunak. She says: I am deeply committed to all the Nolan principles of public life, including honesty, integrity and openness, and I regret that these events have led some to question my commitment. I have at all times been truthful and transparent, and taken decisions guided by what I believed was right and appropriate given my office, not by any personal motivation. Another principle, of course, is leadership: ministers must hold themselves – and be seen to hold themselves – to the highest standards. I have always strived, and will continue to strive, to do this. As I say, in hindsight, or if faced with a similar situation again, I would have chosen a different course of action. I sought to explore whether bespoke arrangements were possible, given my personal circumstances as a security-protected minister. I recognise how some people have construed this as me seeking to avoid sanction – at no point was that the intention or outcome. Nonetheless, given the fundamental importance of integrity in public life, I deeply regret that my actions may have given rise to that perception, and I apologise for the distraction this has caused. Here is full text of the letter from Rishi Sunak to Suella Braverman. Thank you for your letter and for your time discussing these matters with me. Integrity, professionalism and accountability are core values of this government and it is right and proper that where issues are raised these are looked at professionally to ensure the appropriate course of action is taken. I have consulted with my independent adviser. He has advised that on this occasion further investigation is not necessary and I have accepted that advice. On the basis of your letter and our discussion, my decision is that these matters do not amount to a breach of the ministerial code. As you have recognised, a better course of action could have been taken to avoid giving rise to the perception of impropriety. Nevertheless, I am reassured you take these matters seriously. You have provided a thorough account, apologised and expressed regret. It is vital that all those in government maintain the high standards the public rightly expects. I know you share this view, just as we are committed to delivering on the issues that matter to the British people - from making our streets safer and reducing net migration to stopping the boats. The lettter from Rishi Sunak to Suella Braverman, and from Braverman to Sunak, are on the No 10 website. Rishi Sunak has decided that Suella Braverman did not breach the ministerial code, No 10 has revealed. It has issued an open letter from Sunak to Braverman in which he says he has decided that there was no breach of the ministerial code when she consulted civil servants about having a private speed awareness course and that no formal inquiry by the ethics adviser is necessary. But Sunak says that Braverman has accepted she could have handled the situation in a better way, and that she has apologised. Britain has recorded the sharpest fall in inflation since the cost of living crisis began, with a drop in the annual rate to 8.7% in April, but food prices continued to rise at the fastest pace in 45 years, Richard Partington reports. In his interviews this morning Alex Chalk also defended Rishi Sunak’s decision to take his time about deciding whether or not to ask his ethics adviser to conduct an inquiry into claims Suella Braverman broke the ministerial code by asking her officials to organise a private speed awareness course for her. The story first broke on Saturday night. Sunak has still not announced whether or not he thinks this merits an inquiry, and he has been gathering extra information himself. It is very likely that a decision will be announced at, or before, PMQs. Defending Sunak’s handling of the matter, Chalk told LBC: These things have to be taken in stages. The prime minister is absolutely on this. He’s considering it fairly. And let’s see where that goes. Chalk ended with a quote from Charles Dickens’ novel Great Expectations: “Take nothing on looks, take everything on evidence. There’s no better rule.” Lord Hayward, a Conservative peer, told Sky News this morning that he did not believe Boris Johnson’s claim that he is the victim of a stitch-up. (See 9.26am.) “I think it’s unlikely to be ‘a stitch-up’, it’s just a series of events, which have to be looked at,” he said. According to Cat Neilan from Tortoise, some Tories are talking about the possibility of a leadership challenge against Rishi Sunak. In an interview with ITV’s Good Morning Britain, Alex Chalk, the justice secretary, was asked about claims that Boris Johnson was the victim of a witch-hunt by some “malignant civil service blob”. (See 9.26am.) He did not endorse the claim, replying: I expect very high standards from my civil servants. I expect them to act with integrity, with industry and professionalism. I have detected them to be professional and hard-working. There are occasions when I completely disagree with my civil servants. What matters is how they respond to me. Do they recognise that my ministerial steer is the one that they have to take? My experience is, they have responded professionally on that. Good morning. Partygate is back in the news and, even though Rishi Sunak has tried hard to disassociate himself from Boris Johnson, the latest revelations (summarised here) still create a severe problem for the current prime minister, for two reasons. First, and most obviously, whenever Partygate is in the news, it reminds voters why they turned against this government. Some 80% of people think the country needs a fresh team of leaders. Sunak would like people to think a fresh team is in charge, but this is just a reminder that Johnson has not gone away, and his supporters are on the government benches. Second, in a bizarre development, some Tories seem to have decided that the person to blame for all of this is not Johnson himself, but Sunak. Johnson himself helped to get this theory off the ground when he released a statement suggesting that he was a victim. A spokesperson for him said: For whatever political purpose, it is plain that a last-ditch attempt is being made to lengthen the privileges committee investigation as it was coming to a conclusion and to undermine Mr Johnson. This has fuelled claims that he is the victim of a stitch-up, which are being reported sympathetically in the Tory papers this morning. In the past rightwing, Brexiter Tories have argued that Partygate, and stories like the speed awareness course revelation about Suella Braverman, are evidence that some shadowy, remainer, establishment “blob” is waging a vendetta against Johnson. But now, according to some of the journalists who follow the Conservative party most closely, some Tories have decided that Sunak is to blame for allowing these to happen. These are from the Telegraph’s Christopher Hope last night. And these are from the Times Steven Swinford this morning. Whoever is making these claims has ventured deep into unhinged, conspiracy theory territory (Sunak has no possible motive for wanting to smear Johnson – his political credibility has shrunk over the last six months, and almost no one seriously thinks he is a credible leadership challenger any more). But the very fact that people in the governing party are saying these things is extraordinary. This morning Alex Chalk, the newish justice secretary, has been doing a media round, and he tried to shoot down at least one of the theories being aired by Johnson’s supporters – that ministers were involved in a decision to pass the new information suggesting Johnson broke lockdown laws at Chequers to the police. This is what Chalk told LBC about what happened: There is a Covid inquiry taking place. In the course of that documentation has to be scrubbed or reviewed by lawyers to ensure it can be disclosed in the normal way. Material came to light which was passed to the civil service. The civil service considered that in accordance with their code, and with no ministerial intervention, I want to make that absolutely clear, that was then passed to the police. From the civil service’s point of view, if they sat on it and suppressed it, people would have criticised them. If they passed it on, that will raise questions as well. Ultimately, whether it was the right judgment to do it turns on what’s in those documents. And I’ve not seen those documents. So it’s very difficult to make a judgement so I’m afraid this has just got to take its course in the normal way. I will post more from his interviews shortly. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.45am: Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, speaks at the WSJ CEO summit in London. Noon: Rishi Sunak faces Keir Starmer at PMQs. Noon: Humza Yousaf, Scotland’s first minister, takes questions from Holyrood committee convenors. After 12.30pm: MPs debate Lords amendments to the retained EU law (revocation and reform) bill. 2pm (UK time): Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, gives a speech in Washington.

Newcastle Waters, where casino mogul James Packer worked as a jackaroo for a year when his father, Kerry, owned the 10,000 sq km property, has been earmarked for the $20bn solar farm, according to the company responsible for the project, Sun Cable. The 10 gigawatt solar farm, which will be visible from space if built, was granted major project status from the Morrison government in July and has attracted billionaire investors including Andrew Forrest and Mike Cannon-Brookes. Sun Cable’s chief executive, David Griffin, told Guardian Australia the site would take up about 12,000 hectares, and that a referral for the project has been submitted to the Northern Territory’s Environmental Protection Authority – the first stage of a lengthy approvals process that is expected to allow construction to begin in late 2023, energy production by 2026 and export by 2027. Speaking about the reasons for proposing the Newcastle Waters site, Griffin said its location was “a meeting point of a few key criteria”. “It’s on the Adelaide to Darwin rail corridor, which is brilliant for our logistics given the enormous amount of material we’ll have to transport to the site,” he said. It was also within 30km of the Stuart highway, the main highway running through the sparsely populated Northern Territory. “It’s a bit of a balancing act too, because it’s far south enough to get away from the main patch affected by the wet season, so it’s a steady solar resource throughout the year,” he said. “There’s plenty of sun and not many clouds.” Griffin also said the site was not so far south that it made the costs of transmitting the electricity to Darwin too high, and that the existing land was “really ideal for construction of a solar farm as it’s extremely flat”. Sun Cable has entered into an agreement with the current owners of Newcastle Waters, Consolidated Pastoral Company, to use the land. However, Griffin said he could not reveal the financial details of the deal. Overhead transmission lines will send the electricity generated by Sun Cable to Darwin and feed into the state’s power grid, but Griffin said two-thirds of the power would be exported to Singapore by high-voltage direct current undersea cables. There will be at least two cables, each with a diameter slightly smaller than a soccer ball, with Sun Cable able to provide about a fifth of Singapore’s electricity needs as the country looks to move away from its increasingly expensive gas-fired power system. Griffin has also said the solar farm could supply power to remote communities in the Northern Territory that currently rely on expensive diesel generators for electricity. Sun Cable expects the project will generate 1,500 direct jobs and 10,000 indirect jobs during construction, and about 350 permanent jobs once in operation. Griffin said Sun Cable was working on a training and employment opportunities plan so part of the workforce could be sourced from nearby Indigenous communities, and that supplies would be produced by local businesses. Exporting solar energy has been flagged as a way Australia can expand its energy production while significantly reducing global emissions. Australia is responsible for about 1.4% of greenhouse gas emissions, which increases by 5% if fossil fuel exports are counted."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/jan/24/saxon-church-prays-for-deliverance-from-nuclear-plant","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-01-24T09:00:41Z","webTitle":"Saxon church prays for deliverance from nuclear plant","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jan/24/saxon-church-prays-for-deliverance-from-nuclear-plant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/jan/24/saxon-church-prays-for-deliverance-from-nuclear-plant","fields":{"headline":"Saxon church prays for deliverance from nuclear plant","bodyText":"For the 55 years that Tim Fox has worshipped at St Peter-on-the-Wall, his only neighbours have been a farm and a birdwatchers’ shelter. Now, the tranquil surroundings of the salt marsh and the Essex sea wall at Bradwell-on-Sea are threatened by a new arrival: a sprawling nuclear power station, Bradwell B. If all goes to plan, the Grade I-listed St Peter-on-the-Wall, built in an abandoned Roman fort in about 660 during the Saxon settlement of Britain, will be an ideal place to watch 10,600 construction workers building the nuclear reactor. “My parents brought me here in 1965 when I was four years old and I can’t remember not coming,” Fox said. “If they build the power station, it would have a devastating effect on us – I don’t think we’d be able to survive the construction.” Fox is a member of an obscure Christian community called Othona, founded by an RAF chaplain after the second world war, and named after the Roman fort that the chapel was built on, although most of the ruins have been swallowed by the seas around the Blackwater estuary. “We have about 700 members in Essex,” Fox, Othona’s centre manager, said. “There’s no hierarchy and no restrictions. Anyone who wants to lead can take the daily service. That might be reading a bit of poetry or meditating – anything as long as it’s not inciting hatred or bigotry. It’s open to people of all faiths and none.” Although Othona is welcoming to visitors, that generosity is not extended to EDF Energy and China General Nuclear Group (CGN), the Franco-Chinese consortium behind the Bradwell B project. “I know this has to be on somebody’s doorstep, but it seems to me that nuclear power isn’t the way to go,” Fox said. “Renewable energy is getting cheaper and there are two wind farms here. This is the driest part of England – you could put a solar farm here.” Bradwell B was part of David Cameron and George Osborne’s vision of a string of six new nuclear power stations. Hinkley Point C in Somerset is under construction and in December when the government published its energy white paper, it said ministers would reach a decision on “at least one large-scale nuclear project” by 2024. Although most attention has focused on Sizewell C in Suffolk, Bradwell B could be ready for approval next year. Earlier this month the Environment Agency told CGN that it needed to make at least six changes to the reactor design. “My view, like a lot of the community, is that we shouldn’t be taking money from the Chinese government,” Fox said, citing the Hong Kong crackdown on opposition politicians and the Chinese government’s genocidal campaign against Uighur Muslims. Radiation and nuclear waste are other concerns. Further along the Blackwater estuary is Bradwell A, an old Magnox reactor that has been decommissioned. “It’s encased in some sort of cladding, and they’ll leave that there for 200 years or so for the next generations to worry about. I don’t know what they will do with the waste if they build a new one.” The Bradwell B proposal is “10 times as big as Bradwell A, and needs a hole in the earth five times the size of Wembley Stadium,” he added. “It will absolutely devastate the sanctuary of the Saxon chapel.” Electricity demand is expected to double by 2050, but that does not mean nuclear power is necessary, according to Roz Bulleid, deputy policy director at the Green Alliance. “With Hinkley Point coming online supposedly by 2025 and Sizewell C being lined up, even if we do need new nuclear, do we need this one right now?” she said. “We would prefer that the government makes a much more concerted effort to avoid the need for power and invest in more electricity storage for renewables.” Since 2016, the cost of offshore wind power has fallen by about two thirds, she said, costing about £40 per megawatt hour, compared with £90 for Hinkley Point. “Obviously, renewables are more intermittent so you don’t have a steady supply, but all sorts of other options are coming online with storage – pumped storage, batteries, compressed air storage. “And digital technologies allow us a much more sophisticated management of demand, so you can charge electric vehicles overnight when the wind is blowing but no one’s using power.” Tom Greatrex, chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, said that “all credible assessments” by bodies such as the International Energy Agency, the OECD and Climate Change Committee showed that nuclear power was needed to bolster wind and solar energy to meet the target of zero emissions by 2050. “We need to have four times the amount of clean power on our system than we do today,” Greatrex said. “Pretending it can be done without zero-carbon nuclear simply increases the reliance on burning fossil fuels, and means more carbon emissions and peril for the planet. Net zero needs nuclear.” Nuclear power is part of the government’s ‘ten point plan for a green industrial revolution’, he added. The Climate Change Committee said in 2019 that about 57% of electricity should come from renewable sources, with 38% from low carbon power such as nuclear plants or biomass plants that capture carbon dioxide emissions. The Bradwell B consortium was approached for comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2019/feb/12/solar-energy-sector-lost-jobs-2018-report","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2019-02-12T10:00:34Z","webTitle":"Solar energy sector lost 8,000 jobs in US last year, but future looks bright – report","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/12/solar-energy-sector-lost-jobs-2018-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2019/feb/12/solar-energy-sector-lost-jobs-2018-report","fields":{"headline":"Solar energy sector lost 8,000 jobs in US last year, but future looks bright – report","bodyText":"The solar energy sector lost 8,000 jobs in the US last year, the second consecutive year of declines, hit by uncertainty over the Trump administration’s energy and trade policies and a 30% tariff on imported solar panels, according to a report released on Tuesday. But according to the Solar Foundation the future is still bright for solar. Despite the two-year dip, solar employment has grown 159%, from just over 93,000 to more than 242,000 jobs in all 50 states over the past nine years and the report concludes the long-term outlook for solar energy production is positive. Solar, which currently represents about 2.4% of overall US electricity generation, already employs twice as many workers as the coal industry and almost five times as many workers as the nuclear industry. States hit hardest by the slowdown were some of those with well-established solar industries, including California, with almost 10,000 job losses, Massachusetts, North Carolina and Arizona, while 29 states – many with less established solar penetration, including Florida, Texas and Illinois – continued to see job growth. “It’s an optimistic report despite the fact we’re seeing job declines over the past two years,” said Andrea Luecke, CEO of The Solar Foundation. “That’s because the macro-picture since we first started tracking solar jobs in 2010 has exploded.” In terms of overall solar penetration, California remains in first place, with about 40% of US solar capacity and still has by far the most jobs nationwide. Florida now ranks second to California in total solar jobs, having overtaken Massachusetts. According to Luecke, the long-term prospects for the solar industry remain “extremely bright” in the US and globally. Jobs growth remains positive, having added 100,000 jobs, an increase of roughly 70% over the past five years. By comparison, US employment as a whole has only grown 9.13% over the same period. Despite the lack of support shown to the solar industry by the Trump industry, only the oil/ petroleum and natural gas industries in the energy sector have more employment than solar. But the Trump administration’s tariffs on imported solar panels and policy uncertainty, coupled with uncertainties around solar policy state-to-state, has had a pronounced impact on the willingness of large-scale utilities to invest in solar, said the study author, Ed Gilliland. “Prior to the tariffs set in January 2018, there was a lot of uncertainty in the industry, particularly among large energy utilities which delayed their projects and we saw less installation in the first three-quarters of the year.” The authors found that the 30% tariff is unlikely to slow investment in the near future because China, the world’s leading manufacturer of solar modules, has already effectively cut prices by allowing incentives to lapse and causing demand to fall. “The impact of the price of modules is no longer of real concern,” said Gilliland. “In fact we would have seen more job losses if China hadn’t scaled back on incentives.” The study also found that even the Trump administration’s support of the coal industry, which lost about 20 working mines last year, has not necessarily been to the detriment of growth in the solar energy sector. “I don’t think people believe the Trump administration’s plan to revive coal is the smartest idea out there, and we now even have leaders in fossil fuel sectors saying solar is competitive and we need to integrate renewables into our business model,” says Luecke. According to Gilliland, recent policy goals issued by states to make energy consumption 100% renewable over the next three decades will also provide an important boost the sector. In September, California’s then governor, Jerry Brown, committed California to economy-wide carbon neutrality and 100% use of zero-carbon electricity by 2045. “If people know this is where we’re going then they can begin to figure out how to get there,” Gilliland said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2021/feb/24/renewable-energy-could-render-five-of-australias-remaining-coal-plants-unviable-by-2025","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2021-02-23T16:30:33Z","webTitle":"Renewable energy could render five of Australia’s remaining coal plants unviable by 2025","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/feb/24/renewable-energy-could-render-five-of-australias-remaining-coal-plants-unviable-by-2025","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2021/feb/24/renewable-energy-could-render-five-of-australias-remaining-coal-plants-unviable-by-2025","fields":{"headline":"Renewable energy could render five of Australia’s remaining coal plants unviable by 2025","bodyText":"Up to five of Australia’s remaining 16 coal power plants could be financially unviable by 2025 due to a flood of cheap solar and wind energy entering the electricity grid, a new report suggests. An analysis by two groups – the consultants Green Energy Markets and the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (Ieefa) – found previous estimates had understated the amount of renewable energy likely to enter the national electricity market in the next five years, and its ramifications for the ageing coal fleet. Their report said it underlined the need for a national transition plan to guide the inevitable shift away from coal-fired power, which could accelerate sooner than expected. The two groups found solar and wind plants built between 2018 and 2025 would add 70,000 gigawatt hours of new electricity supply – equivalent to more than a third of what is currently used across the national grid each year. They estimated renewable energy would make up 40% and 50% of electricity by 2025. It would force output from coal and gas-fired power stations to fall by 28% and 78% respectively over the seven years. The report said at least one coal plant was likely to shut earlier than planned in addition to the scheduled closure of Liddell power station, in the Hunter Valley, in 2023. Johanna Bowyer, from Ieefa, said coal and gas would be displaced because the fuel for wind and solar energy is free, and renewable energy farms could typically sell their electricity on the market at prices “close to zero”. Tristan Edis, director with Green Energy Markets, said the “tidal wave” of new clean electricity was much greater than what government authorities or market analysts contemplated just two years ago. It meant the “days of baseload electricity are over”, he said. “It’s been cleared out of town by solar,” he said. “We need a different type of technology that can fill the gap, and duck and weave to give what we need around solar.” The findings mirror those from other electricity market experts, including Kerry Schott, the chair of the Energy Security Board, who told Guardian Australia last year coal plants were making little money and were likely to shut sooner than planned. Data last year showed there had been a fall in investment in new large-scale clean energy after the national renewable energy target was filled and not replaced in 2019. Experts had expected that would lead to a fall in solar and wind farms connecting to the grid from 2022, but Edis said that had changed due to substantial commitments by the Queensland and Victorian governments and large corporates including Amazon. Bowyer said the new analysis found the shift by 2025 would be likely to push down the average wholesale electricity price to 2015 levels. It meant revenue at coal and gas-fired plants would be hit on two fronts – they would not be able to sell as much electricity and the price of the electricity would be lower. The groups estimated revenue for individual coal plants on the wholesale spot market was likely to fall by between 44% and 67% between 2018 and 2025. Earnings before interest and tax would plummet up to 119%, they said. The hardest hit generators were likely to be the Eraring, Mount Piper and Vales Point coal plants in New South Wales, Gladstone in Queensland and Yallourn in Victoria. The five plants are currently scheduled to shut between 2029 and 2043. If one were to close early it would change the viability of those that remained as they would benefit from a short-term increase in electricity prices, but prices would be expected to reduce again – and the financial pressure to increase – as more renewable energy came online. Dylan McConnell, a research fellow at the University of Melbourne’s Climate and Energy College, said the report’s findings were consistent with what he expected given the crash in wholesale electricity prices. They were so low it was hard to justify any investment in coal power, including on basic maintenance, he said. “I think you could bring forward the closure dates of all coal plants five years [from their scheduled shut date] and it would be closer to the truth. But the specifics will be messy,” McConnell said. Edis said new flexible generation needed to replace coal could come from a number of sources, as identified by the Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo) in a blueprint for an optimal grid last year. They include batteries, pumped hydro, demand management (users being paid to reduce electricity use at peak times) and, potentially, gas. Aemo found new gas-fired power was likely to be more expensive than other options, but the Morrison government argues the fossil fuel is essential and has promised a “gas-fired recovery” from recession. It is considering building a new gas plant with taxpayer’s money, and wants to underwrite several others by instructing the government green bank, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, to support gas developments. Edis said the solution would best be driven by either a carbon price signal or a model similar to the New South Wales clean energy legislation that is designed to underwrite 12 gigawatts of new solar and wind energy and 2GW of long-duration storage. The Green Energy Markets/Ieefa report did not include the NSW laws, which will largely take effect after 2025. He urged the government not to repeat its campaign to pressure Liddell’s owner, AGL, to keep coal-fired generation open longer than necessary. “Rather than propping up these plants which are getting very old, we need new government policies that support private-sector investment in dispatchable power plants that will be viable over the long term,” Edis said. “To be viable they need to be highly flexible to work around changes in wind and solar output. And they need to be low emission if we are to deliver on our climate change obligations.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2020/dec/28/nuclear-fusion-power-climate-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2020-12-28T10:00:11Z","webTitle":"Is nuclear fusion the answer to the climate crisis?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/dec/28/nuclear-fusion-power-climate-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2020/dec/28/nuclear-fusion-power-climate-crisis","fields":{"headline":"Is nuclear fusion the answer to the climate crisis?","bodyText":"If all goes as planned, the US will eliminate all greenhouse gas emissions from its electricity sector by 2035 – an ambitious goal set by President-elect Joe Biden, relying in large part on a sharp increase in wind and solar energy generation. That plan may soon get a boost from nuclear fusion, a powerful technology that until recently had seemed far out of reach. Researchers developing a nuclear fusion reactor that can generate more energy than it consumes have shown in a series of recent papers that their design should work, restoring optimism that this clean, limitless power source will help mitigate the climate crisis. While the new reactor still remains in early development, scientists hope it will be able to start producing electricity by the end of the decade. Martin Greenwald, one of the project’s senior scientists, said a key motivation for the ambitious timeline is meeting energy requirements in a warming world. “Fusion seems like one of the possible solutions to get ourselves out of our impending climate disaster,” he said. Nuclear fusion, the physical process that powers our sun, occurs when atoms are pushed together at extremely high temperatures and pressure, causing them to release tremendous amounts of energy by merging into heavier atoms. Since it was first discovered last century, scientists have sought to harness fusion, an extremely dense form of power whose fuel – hydrogen isotopes – are abundant and replenishable. Moreover, fusion produces no greenhouse gases or carbon, and unlike fission nuclear reactors, carries no risk of meltdown. Harnessing this form of nuclear power, though, has proven extremely difficult, requiring heating a soup of subatomic particles, called plasma, to hundreds of millions of degrees – far too hot for any material container to withstand. To work around this, scientists developed a donut-shaped chamber with a strong magnetic field running through it, called a tokamak, which suspends the plasma in place. MIT scientists and a spinoff company, Commonwealth Fusion Systems, began designing the new reactor, which is more compact than its predecessors, in early 2018, and will start construction in the first half of next year. If their timeline goes as planned, the reactor, called Sparc, will be capable of producing electricity for the grid by 2030, according to researchers and company officials. This would be far faster than existing major fusion power initiatives. Existing reactor designs are too large and expensive to realistically generate electricity for consumers. Through the use of cutting-edge, ultra-strong magnets, the team at MIT and Commonwealth Fusion hope to make a tokamak reactor that is compact, efficient and scalable. “What we’ve really done is combine an existing science with new material to open up vast new possibilities,” Greenwald said Having demonstrated that the Sparc device can theoretically produce more energy than it requires to run in the research papers published in September, the next step involves building the reactor, followed by a pilot plant that will generate electricity onto the grid. Scientists and entrepreneurs have long made promises about fusion being just around the corner, only to encounter insurmountable problems. This has created reluctance to invest in it, particularly as wind, solar and other renewables — although less powerful than fusion — have become more efficient and cost effective. But the tide is changing. In Biden’s $2tn plan, he named advanced nuclear technologies as part of the decarbonization strategy, the first time the Democrats have endorsed nuclear energy since 1972. There is also significant investment coming from private sources, including some major oil and gas companies, who see fusion as a better long term pivot than wind and solar. According to Bob Mumgaard, chief executive of Commonwealth Fusion, the aim is not to use fusion to replace solar and wind, but to supplement them. “There are things that will be hard to do with only renewables, industrial scale things, like powering large cities or manufacturing,” he said. “This is where fusion can come in.” The plasma science community is generally enthusiastic about Sparc’s progress, though some question the ambitious timeline, given engineering and regulatory hurdles. Daniel Jassby, who worked as a research scientist at the Princeton Plasma Physics Lab for 25 years, is skeptical about whether a fusion reactor like SPARC will ever provide a feasible alternative source of energy. Tritium, one of the hydrogen isotopes that will be used as fuel by Sparc, is not naturally occurring and will need to be produced, he said. The team at MIT propose that this substance will be regenerated continuously by the fusion reaction itself. But Jassby believes that this will require a huge amount of electricity, which will make the reactor prohibitively expensive. “When you consider we get solar and wind energy for free, to rely on fusion reaction would be foolish,” he said. Mumgaard concedes that the challenges that lie ahead are daunting. But he remains confident. “There is a broader trend in acknowledging how important climate is and that we need all hands on deck,” he said. “We got into this problem with technology, but with fusion there are big opportunities to solve this with technology.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2020/nov/16/agl-long-duration-battery-planned-for-adelaide-marks-another-leap-for-renewables","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2020-11-16T07:41:27Z","webTitle":"AGL long-duration battery planned for Adelaide marks another leap for renewables","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/nov/16/agl-long-duration-battery-planned-for-adelaide-marks-another-leap-for-renewables","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2020/nov/16/agl-long-duration-battery-planned-for-adelaide-marks-another-leap-for-renewables","fields":{"headline":"AGL long-duration battery planned for Adelaide marks another leap for renewables","bodyText":"The announcement of a large, long-duration battery in Adelaide has been hailed as a milestone in the developing technology that is competing with fossil fuels to support wind and solar energy. The energy company AGL, which owns several coal plants and is Australia’s biggest greenhouse gas emitter, announced on Monday it would build a large-scale battery on the site of the Torrens Island gas station, which is due to shut by 2022. It said the battery would be built in stages and have an eventual power capacity of up to 250 megawatts - greater than an existing battery at Hornsdale in South Australia, but less than a 300MW facility planned for a site near Geelong. The AGL development differs markedly from existing and other proposed Australian batteries in having a storage capacity of 1,000 megawatt-hours, which equates to a duration of up to four hours. Existing batteries in Australia are used to bolster the security of the grid when something goes wrong, such as a major transmission line being taken out or a power station “tripping”. They are able to rapidly fill the gap to prevent the grid collapsing. The AGL battery would be the first in the country specifically designed to store energy generated when the sun is shining or the wind blowing and release it into the grid when electricity use reaches a peak. The company’s decision is noteworthy for having been made without government support or intervention, unlike other recent proposals for gas, battery and pumped hydro projects backed by the federal government and other states. AGL’s chief executive, Brett Redman, said the company was “getting on with the business of energy transition”. “This battery is another step in the state’s energy transition, while at the same time allowing a rapid response to changes in renewable generation when our customers and communities need it,” he said. He said the Torrens Island battery was part of a plan to build 850MW of energy storage capacity by 2023-24. Battery technology has taken off more rapidly than was predicted. An Australian Energy Market Operator forecast in 2016 suggested the country might have only 4MW of large-scale batteries by 2020, and build no more than that before 2036. A report released earlier this month said the country already had 287MW in operation or committed to construction. That does not include the Victorian government announcement of the 300MW battery near Geelong, billed as one of the biggest in the world. Simon Holmes à Court, a senior adviser to the Climate and Energy College at Melbourne University, said the Torrens Island battery was a significant milestone, as the company could have opted for a new gas-fired plant. “It is the first battery that is competing with gas generators in Australia, and it’s completely unsubsidised,” he said. “This will be moving solar from the middle of the day to the evening, when demand is at its peak.” The South Australian government said it would support the battery by granting a planning exemption. The energy minister, Dan van Holst Pellekaan, said it would help “restore the grid to strength” and meet its aspirational goal of net-100% renewable energy. South Australia has generated 57% of its electricity from renewable sources over the past year. The Morrison government argues that new gas-fired power plants are essential for the reliability and security of the national grid as variable wind and solar replaces ageing coal-fired power plants. It plans to underwrite up to five new “fast-start” gas plants and six pumped hydro plants, and has said the government-owned Snowy Hydro would build an additional gas generator in New South Wales to help replace AGL’s outgoing Liddell coal plant if the private sector has not made an equivalent commitment by April. The latter proposal was announced as part of its promised “gas-led” recovery from the economic shock caused by Covid-19. Earlier this year the market operator found additional gas-fired power was an option, but not essential, for an electricity grid increasingly based on renewable energy, and gas prices would need to stay at lower levels than expected if it was to compete with pumped hydro, batteries and other alternatives. Gas is often described as having half the emissions of coal when burned, but recent studies have suggested that underestimates its impact on the climate."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/feb/17/cut-vat-for-green-home-improvements-and-repairs-mps-urge","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-02-17T00:01:04Z","webTitle":"Cut VAT for green home improvements and repairs, MPs urge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/feb/17/cut-vat-for-green-home-improvements-and-repairs-mps-urge","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/feb/17/cut-vat-for-green-home-improvements-and-repairs-mps-urge","fields":{"headline":"Cut VAT for green home improvements and repairs, MPs urge","bodyText":"Ministers should cut VAT on repairs for electrical goods and green home improvements, to help people reduce greenhouse gas emissions in their everyday lives, an influential committee of MPs has urged. Funding for green home grants to install insulation and low-carbon heating, should also be restored to kickstart a “green recovery” in the UK, said the environmental audit committee in a report on how to “grow back better” from the coronavirus crisis. Philip Dunne, chairman of the committee, said ministers must do more to generate a green recovery. “The jury is still out [on whether the government will manage a green recovery],” he said. “Last spring was about keeping the UK economy in aspic, with emergency measures and funding. Now, there is more time to put together measures for the next phase. We need to see that aligned with the objectives of net zero emissions, and that remains to be seen.” He called for the chancellor to lay out clear plans in next month’s budget to spur low-carbon growth in the runup to the vital UN climate talks, called Cop26, in Glasgow this November. “The eyes of the world will be on us for Cop26,” he said. “Rather than just preaching to other countries, we need to be seen to be taking action.” In its report “Growing back better: putting nature and net zero at the heart of the economic recovery”, published on Wednesday, the committee said: “We recommend that the chancellor of the exchequer bring forward proposals to reduce the rate of VAT on repair services and products containing reused or recycled materials to increase the circularity and resilience of the UK economy. The government should also reduce VAT on green home upgrades to incentivise more people to install low-carbon technologies and improve the energy efficiency of new homes.” Cuts to VAT on green goods have long been advocated by green campaigners, but VAT exemptions were limited under EU rules. Since Brexit, the UK can set all of its own VAT rates, but the government has made little indication it intends to use this to meet its net zero emissions target. In October 2019, the government increased the VAT rate from 5% to 20% on installations of a range of low-carbon goods including many solar panel installations, especially those with batteries, as well as domestic wind turbine systems, heat pumps and insulation materials. The higher rate is charged where the cost of materials exceeds 60% of the installation cost, with exemptions for some cases of social need, such as care homes. The committee’s recommendation is meant to correct the disparity between the zero-VAT rate on new construction and the full rate charged on retrofitting a property. However, the committee stopped short of recommending an end to VAT on all green goods, from solar panels to bicycles, called for by some campaigners. Chris Hewett, chief executive of Solar Energy UK, a trade association, said: “Scrapping VAT for low-carbon technologies such as solar and batteries is a simple and effective way to make green home improvements more affordable for everyone. It would boost uptake, create new jobs and drive growth in Britain’s retrofitting market, which is a vital pillar in the UK’s efforts to decarbonise housing stock.” Jenny Holland of the UK Green Building Council, said: “For too long, our VAT system has incentivised new-build over retrofit and refurbishment. Rewarding the use of recycled and reused materials will also tackle the problem that producing virgin materials is currently often cheaper than recycling or reusing products.” Dunne said an overhaul of the green homes grant – a subsidy for retrofitting houses with insulation and low-carbon heating – was also a matter of urgency. The green homes grant was announced last summer, but the scheme has been dogged by problems, as the Guardian has revealed, and only about 5% of the £1.5bn allocated for the period to March 2021 has yet been spent. Last week, the government indicated that the unspent money would not be rolled over into the extension of the scheme for this year, prompting outrage. Dunne called for the unspent cash to be made available in this parliament, so that at least 600,000 homes could be retrofitted to a low-carbon standard under the scheme. Nina Skorupska, chief executive of the Association for Renewable Energy and Clean Technology, said: “The sudden removal of funding for the green homes grant would not only severely impact consumers and businesses in the short term, but would also damage confidence in future announcements. The problem with the scheme hasn’t been a lack of demand, but a combination of Covid and an administrative system which has been beset with problems.” The committee also called for the government to begin work on a carbon tax, which would create incentives for people to choose low-carbon alternatives, and carbon border adjustments – tariffs or other barriers or penalties to the import of goods that have been manufactured with high carbon emissions overseas. The MPs also said that the Bank of England should require companies seeking bailouts to disclose their climate-related risk, and called for the Bank to align its corporate investments with the Paris agreement, but stopped short of calling for stringent green conditions to be attached to loans. Caroline Lucas, the Green party MP, said: “The key message in this report is that investment in a green economy must be front-loaded. The government can’t keep putting off the critical policies and actions in the Micawber-like hope that something will just turn up. We need to see the investment now, and it must be in line with the temperature goals of the Paris agreement, and protect and restore nature. The forthcoming budget will be a key test of whether ministers intend to close the delivery gap between their fine words and real action.” A government spokesperson said: “We’re committed to building back better and greener from the pandemic. We continue to bring forward bold measures to cut emissions, with plans to invest £9bn in improving the energy efficiency of buildings forming part of our wider commitment to end our contribution to climate change by 2050.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/feb/24/texas-renewable-energy-culture-wars","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-02-24T08:00:04Z","webTitle":"Texas freeze casts renewable energy as next battle line in US culture wars","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/feb/24/texas-renewable-energy-culture-wars","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/feb/24/texas-renewable-energy-culture-wars","fields":{"headline":"Texas freeze casts renewable energy as next battle line in US culture wars","bodyText":"The frigid winter storm and power failure that left millions of people in Texas shivering in darkness has been used to stoke what is becoming a growing front in America’s culture wars – renewable energy. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (Ercot), which oversees the Texas grid, has been clear that outages of solar and wind energy were only a minor factor in blackouts which, at their peak, left 4 million Texans without electricity, with many resorting to burning furniture or using outdoor barbecues to desperately warm themselves amid the shocking blast of Arctic-like conditions. Crucially, the supply of natural gas, which supplies about half of Texas’s electricity, seized up due to frozen pipes and a lack of standby reserves. The grid failed after about a third of Ercot’s total capacity – supplied by coal, nuclear and gas – went offline as demand for heating dramatically surged. Regardless, the Republican leadership in Texas, abetted by rightwing media outlets and a proliferation of false claims on social media, has sought to pin the crisis on wind turbines and solar panels freezing when the Lone Star state needed them most. “The Green New Deal would be a deadly deal for the United States of America,” Greg Abbott, Texas’s governor, told Fox News last week, in reference to a plan to rapidly transition the US to renewable energy that currently only exists on paper. “Our wind and our solar got shut down … It just shows that fossil fuel is necessary.” Abbott subsequently walked backed these comments but others have been less hesitant to use the crisis to attack renewables. Sid Miller, Texas’s agriculture commissioner, stated that “we should never build another wind turbine in Texas” on Facebook, while Tucker Carlson, the prominent rightwing Fox News host, said “windmills” were “silly fashion accessories” prone to failure. Fox News blamed renewables for the blackouts 128 times in just a 48-hour period last week, according to Media Matters. The distortions were amplified by social media, with a picture of a helicopter de-icing a wind turbine widely shared on Twitter and Facebook, even though the photo was taken in Sweden in 2014. A YouTube live stream by the conservative commentator Steven Crowder blaming the blackouts on “the failures of green energy” has been viewed about a million times, while the Texas Public Policy Foundation used paid Facebook adverts to urge people to “thank” fossil fuels for keeping them warm while assailing “failed” wind energy. The scorn heaped on renewables has echoes of the blackouts suffered by California during devastating wildfires last year, which caused several prominent Texas Republicans such as Dan Crenshaw, a member of Congress, and Senator Ted Cruz, who last week fled his stricken home state for sunny Cancún, to mock California’s shift to cleaner energy. The expansion of wind and solar, a key policy goal of Joe Biden, is now developing into yet another cultural battle line, despite strong public support for renewables. Jesse Keenan, an expert in climate adaptation at Tulane University, said the use of “targeted disinformation” and conspiracy theories is obscuring the more pressing issue of how states like Texas cope with the challenges of extreme weather linked to the climate crisis. “There are plenty of other comparable extreme events that are going to compromise the integrity of the energy system,” Keenan said. “These events are going to increasingly resonate in the monthly power bill. The question is do ratepayers want to keep paying to clean up a mess or do they want to invest in building resilience that will save them a lot more in the future?” Keenan said that much like how the US reacted to the 9/11 attacks by escalating its national security activity, the country now needs a similar level of response to the climate crisis by first taking basic steps, like weatherizing infrastructure and keeping reserve power in store, that Texas’s free-market grid system neglected to do. America has now “reached a turning point where the costs of disasters far exceed the amortized costs of upfront investments in resilience”, Keenan said. “Part of the impetus here is an acknowledgment that the status quo is unsustainable and we need to adapt our infrastructure and our way of life.” Transforming Americans’ power supply to renewable energy while bolstering resilience in the face of an unfolding climate crisis is a daunting challenge. Wind and solar energy need to increase their current capacity by up to five times by 2050 in order to reach net-zero carbon emissions, a Princeton report found last year, requiring nearly a 10th of the contiguous US to be covered in turbines and panels and thousands of miles of new power lines and substations in a revamped grid. All of this will need to happen as wildfires, flooding and storms are set to worsen due to global heating, with scientists finding last year that extreme rainfall in Texas alone will become up to 50% more frequent by 2036 than it was in the second half of the 20th century. Storm surges along parts of the Texas coast are set to double by 2050. If infrastructure is not prepared for this “the lights will probably go out again”, said Joshua Rhodes, a power grid researcher at the University of Texas at Austin. But Texas, much like several other states, appears wilfully unprepared for this reality. “We never hear the words ‘climate change’ spoken at Ercot because of the politics. It’s a taboo subject,” Doug Lewin, an energy consultant in Austin, told the Houston Chronicle. “We’re using the past as a predictor of the future and we can’t do that. We’ve fundamentally shifted the planet’s systems, and it’s only just started.” The fallout from this political crusade against renewables will be felt heaviest among poorer communities and people of color who are already bearing the brunt of the climate crisis, heaped on top of a pandemic. “The last few days have been overwhelming,” said Nalleli Hidalgo, a Houston-based activist at the Texas Environmental Justice Advocacy Services, which has been attempting to help thousands of people lacking water, food and power. “Climate change will continue to hit coastal states like Texas the hardest, we need to invest in renewable energies and sustainable infrastructures, and create weatherized systems to prevent this from happening again.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/oct/30/is-australia-on-the-verge-of-having-too-much-solar-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-10-30T01:56:34Z","webTitle":"Is Australia on the verge of having too much solar energy? | Tristan Edis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/oct/30/is-australia-on-the-verge-of-having-too-much-solar-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/oct/30/is-australia-on-the-verge-of-having-too-much-solar-energy","fields":{"headline":"Is Australia on the verge of having too much solar energy?","bodyText":"Over the last few weeks there have been a number of reports in the media that Australia is on the verge of hitting too much solar energy. This includes claims by some electricity generators that we are heading towards a “solar peak” – a point at which “there is no point in putting any more solar power into the system” because it will just be spilled and wasted. Some are claiming it might even cause blackouts. Andrew Dillon, head of the Energy Networks Association, told the ABC’s 7.30 Report solar was likely to cause, “voltage disturbances in the system which will lead to transformers and other equipment tripping off to protect themselves from being damaged and that will cause localised blackouts.” This is all occurring within a furious battle over a recommendation by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission that by 2021 the federal government should remove the rebate provided to solar systems under the small-scale renewable energy scheme (SRES). So are we faced with a serious problem of there being too much solar which means we should scrap the rebate? Are we at risk of solar exceeding demand at an overall market level? Solar reached its peak level of penetration or market share in the national electricity market (NEM) on 10 December last year. The chart below illustrates the fuel mix of generation over each hour of that day. Solar peaked at 17% between 11am and 12.30pm and there was plenty of demand left keeping other generators busy. So what will things look like by 2021 when the ACCC has recommended scrapping of the solar rebate? According to the Australian Energy Market Operator rooftop solar will generate 85% more electricity than it did over the 2017-18 financial year. Meanwhile solar farms will supply around 5,000MW of power, up from just a few hundred megawatts in 2017-18. If we take last financial year’s data and then scale-up the solar generation levels in line with this extra amount of solar power we’d end up with an average daily time profile for the generation generation fuel mix illustrated in the chart below. This is assuming the extra solar power displaces the more expensive gas first and then less expensive black coal subsequently. Solar clearly will represent a very substantial part of our power supply, delivering a fifth of power during the daytime peak period of 9am to 5pm. But we’re hardly at risk of generating so much power from solar we’d have to spill and waste much of it. Rather it has done something very interesting. It creates a second off-peak period for power supply in the middle of the day, which replicates the kind of conditions power generators typically experience at about 2am to 5am. This is interestingly when wholesale power prices are usually at their lowest levels. Are we at risk of overloading the electricity transformers and blackouts? Solar systems, by injecting power into the network, act to lift voltages in the local area in which they are installed. But you needn’t worry about it overloading local distribution transformers, causing them to trip-off and cause blackouts. The output of solar systems is controlled by an inverter which continuously monitors the voltage of the network. In circumstances where the voltage is getting close to levels that networks deem too high, the solar system will either cycle its output or shut it off completely to prevent driving up voltage any further. But there’s something else you should be aware of: voltages on our electricity networks are being run at levels far above where they should be, which is 230 volts. University of NSW researchers, using 2,000 devices that monitor voltage in households across the states of SA, Victoria, NSW and Queensland, found that the typical voltage on the network tends to be close to 245 volts whether it’s day or night-time. They are only operating close to the standard of 230 volts for less than 1% of the time. This might be understandable in Queensland, which has only just recently adjusted its standard down to 230 volts, but for the other states this standard has been in place for a long time. In fact, Standards Australia agreed to move Australia from 240 volts to 230 volts in 1983. If the networks simply adjusted the voltage settings of their transformers to the standard they are supposed to be adhering to, then we should be able to absorb substantially greater amounts of solar capacity in the network. • Tristan Edis is the director of analysis and advisory at Green Energy Markets"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"science/2020/may/14/spacewatch-us-military-spaceplane-poised-for-liftoff","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2020-05-14T20:30:19Z","webTitle":"Spacewatch: US military spaceplane poised for liftoff","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/may/14/spacewatch-us-military-spaceplane-poised-for-liftoff","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2020/may/14/spacewatch-us-military-spaceplane-poised-for-liftoff","fields":{"headline":"Spacewatch: US military spaceplane poised for liftoff","bodyText":"The US’s uncrewed X-37B military spaceplane is expected to launch from Cape Canaveral air force station, in Florida, on 16 May.

The California Fish and Game Commission voted Tuesday to accept a petition that provides the gnarly-limbed yucca plants protected status for a year while the state conducts a study. The Joshua tree – which is not a tree but is actually a succulent called Yucca brevifolia – has graced the landscape of the Mojave desert for 2.5m years. Research has shown that amid unmitigated climate change, only .02% of the tree’s current habitat in Joshua Tree national park would remain viable. Hotter and drier conditions – like the record-high temperatures that struck the state this summer – are killing off Joshua trees, and leaving fewer young to survive. Last month, the Dome fire burned burned through more than 43,000 acres in some of the world’s densest old-growth Joshua tree forest in the Mojave national preserve. The vote made the tree a “candidate species”, meaning that for the year that the state studies and determines whether the trees should be given a “threatened” status, as the petition asks, the trees will be protected under the law, said Melissa Miller-Henson, the executive director of the California Fish and Game Commission. That means that it will no longer be legal to damage, remove or cut down a tree without a permit or special permissions. “The intent is if a species is a candidate or protected, our goal is to protect it and in the long-term, find ways to help it recover,” Miller-Henson said. Three years ago, another species was identified for protection under the California Endangered Species Act because of climate change – the American pika, a mid-altitude mountainous rodent, Miller-Henson said. “What they were finding was that this poor critter was having to go to different altitudes because of climate change,” she said. After the year study, however, the state determined that the rat was not at risk of becoming endangered. Brendan Cummings, the conservation director for the Center for Biological Diversity and author of the petition, told the Guardian last month that he hoped that the Joshua Tree “can be a model of doing climate adaptation planning to ensure that biodiversity of the state is protected”. “Right now, it’s a symbol of our utter failure as a society to address climate change,” Cummings said. “I’d like to think it can become a symbol of us coming together.” Local government officials have opposed granting additional protections to the Joshua tree, saying that more restrictions will hinder real estate development and cause economic damage. The Yucca Valley mayor has repeatedly argued on social media that while he cares for Joshua trees, more protections would bring “red tape, cost and delays” for homeowners. In the same meeting that accepted the protected status petition, the commission also voted to allow for the removal of Joshua trees at the sites of 15 solar energy projects planned in Kern and San Bernardino counties. Miller-Henson explained that those projects would go forward under strict parameters, including a census on how many trees there were and the distance between each tree. “Because those projects are intended to address climate change, one of the threats to the Joshua tree, it didn’t seem necessary to stop those projects in their tracks,” she said. This article was amended on 24 September 2020. An earlier version wrongly referred protections for the kangaroo rat rather than the American pika."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/oct/19/scottishpower-to-invest-in-solar-energy-for-the-first-time","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-10-19T15:19:11Z","webTitle":"Scottish Power to invest in solar energy for the first time","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/19/scottishpower-to-invest-in-solar-energy-for-the-first-time","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/oct/19/scottishpower-to-invest-in-solar-energy-for-the-first-time","fields":{"headline":"Scottish Power to invest in solar energy for the first time","bodyText":"Scottish Power, one of Britain’s biggest energy companies, has said it will invest in solar power for the first time as part of its move away from fossil fuels. The big six firm sold off its last gas-fired power stations to Drax Group this week to focus exclusively on renewables, which today consists of onshore and offshore windfarms. But Keith Anderson, the company’s chief executive, told the Guardian he had decided to move into solar, too. “The solar market has had difficulties over the last wee while. But you look at where the technology cost is getting to, and the possibilities of integrating it with wind … how it balances from season to season wind and solar output, and we see a good opportunity there for further investment.” Solar farms around the UK have historically been built by smaller energy firms and community groups, so the entrance of such a big player would mark a major shake-up. It could also inject life into a sector that has stalled in the face of subsidy cuts. Researchers have argued that the comparatively low wind output across Europe this summer because of hot, still weather was a reminder of why energy companies should be investing in solar as well as wind. Anderson said that Scottish Power had moved to 100% renewables because it was cheaper than other sources. “We need to invest in the cheapest forms of energy – that’s onshore wind, offshore wind, it’s going to be solar – and that will help drive down the cost of energy,” he said. The world’s need to tackle climate change also made it clear that companies needed to embrace green energy wholeheartedly, he said. “Look at the IPCC report last week. My absolute belief is that organisations need to be at the forefront of that change. We can’t be part of the problem, we have to be part of the solution.” Scottish Power would be competing in an auction next summer for a slice of £557m in government subsidies for offshore windfarms, Anderson confirmed. The firm hopes to secure a contract for its planned 1,200MW East Anglia Three project, which would be capable of powering nearly 900,000 homes and dwarf the world’s current biggest, a 659MW scheme off the Cumbrian coast. Anderson also expressed confidence that ministers were nearing a rethink on their block on subsidies for onshore windfarms, which the Conservatives barred when they came to power in 2015. “We’re closer than we’ve ever been before,” he said. A poll this week found that two thirds of people living in rural Scottish communities, which are considered to have some of the best sites for prospective sites, support onshore windfarms. But the prospect for new gas power stations – which companies including Drax and Germany’s RWE want to build – were bleak, Anderson said. “Right now the commercial signals don’t exist to build a new gas plant in the UK. That might change in the future, but it’s not something we’ll get involved in.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2021/mar/10/yallourn-close-early-victoria-australia-brown-coal-power-stations-giant-battery","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2021-03-10T03:26:11Z","webTitle":"Yallourn, one of Australia's last brown coal power stations, to close early in favour of giant battery","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/mar/10/yallourn-close-early-victoria-australia-brown-coal-power-stations-giant-battery","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2021/mar/10/yallourn-close-early-victoria-australia-brown-coal-power-stations-giant-battery","fields":{"headline":"Yallourn, one of Australia's last brown coal power stations, to close early in favour of giant battery","bodyText":"One of Australia’s dirtiest coal-fired power stations, Yallourn in Victoria’s Latrobe valley, will close four years earlier than scheduled and be replaced, in part, by a grid-scale battery. EnergyAustralia announced on Wednesday it would shut the 1970s-built, 1,480-megawatt brown coal plant in mid-2028. There have been several outages at the ageing generator in recent years and a widespread expectation that at least one coal plant would shut early due to an influx of cheap renewable energy making them financially unviable. About 500 workers at the plant and connected coalmine were told of the decision on Wednesday morning. The company’s managing director, Catherine Tanna, told a subsequent press conference that EnergyAustralia had a plan that was supported by the Victorian government and included a $10m workforce support package. Climate campaigners said the closure was inevitable, but not soon enough given the scientific evidence about what was needed, and called for a government-supported transition plan for affected Gippsland towns. Tanna said the company would built a long-duration large battery, with four hours’ storage and maximum power capacity of 350 megawatts, by 2026 to help ensure a secure energy supply when the plant shut. She said it was bigger than any battery now operating, but larger batteries were proposed elsewhere. She said the world of energy was changing rapidly, and the company was committed to ensuring storage was installed before Yallourn shut. “EnergyAustralia is determined to demonstrate that coal-fired power can exit the market in a way that supports our people and ensures customers continue to receive reliable energy,” she said. Yallourn has the capacity to supply about 20% of Victoria’s electricity and 8% of the generation in the national grid, which covers the five eastern states and the ACT. The Australia Institute said it had broken down 50 times in a little over three years. Removing it would leave just two brown coal plants in the state and cut national greenhouse gas emissions by about 3% and Victorian emissions by 13%. The conservation group Environment Victoria said the announcement highlighted the pressure on coal, and the need to move more quickly to replace it. The group’s chief exeuctive, Jono La Nauze, said avoiding the worst impacts of the climate crisis meant coal-burning power stations needed to close by 2030, and called on governments to orchestrate a faster shift to clean energy. “Just this week, the secretary general of the United Nations called on developed countries to phase out coal power by 2030,” he said. “This is the task before us, and our state and federal governments need to rise to this challenge.” The Latrobe city council mayor, Sharon Gibson, said she had heard rumours the plant could close early, but was shocked by the announcement. She said the region was yet to rebound from the comparatively abrupt closure of the Hazelwood coal plant four years ago, and urged federal and state politicians and business to meet with the community to plan a “proper transition”, warning there was no time to “stuff around”. “No politics – we need to look at what can be put in place to ensure we have a viable community coming out of this,” she said. “Can we be a recycling hub? Can we be a food manufacturing hub? These are some of the things we need to look at.” The Victorian climate change and energy minister, Lily D’Ambrosio, said the government would put workers at the heart of its response to the announcement, including creating a Yallourn workers transition and support service within the existing Latrobe Valley Authority. “The truth is we’re seeing these old, coal fired power stations creaking to a stop right around the world as countries and companies are switching to new, clean, more reliable and more efficient forms of energy,” she said. “We can’t ignore that change or pretend it’s not happening, and we owe it to these workers to build a modern energy network that creates and supports thousands of Victorian jobs.” Steve Dodds, from the Gippsland Trades and Labor Council, said many workers were relieved after the announcement as there had been speculation the plant needed major maintenance and could close by 2025. He called on the federal government to go further than it did when Hazelwood shut and match state support for the region, rather than “throwing a few pennies to pretend they’re helping”. The brown and black coal plants have faced heightened financial pressure in recent years as solar and wind have been built faster than most experts expected. A recent analysis by two groups – Green Energy Markets and the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (Ieefa) – found that, between 2018 and 2025, new solar and wind plants would add about 70,000 gigawatt hours of clean supply each year. This is equivalent to more than a third of the national grid’s usage. The result has been a slump in wholesale electricity prices, which has been good for consumers but not fossil fuel generators. The drop – up to 70% in Victoria over the past year – has put particular pressure on inflexible coal plants that are not designed to ramp up and down, and cannot compete with the massive surge of near-free solar energy in the middle of the day. Experts including Kerry Schott, the chair of the national Energy Security Board, have warned the expected early coal closures and the rise of variable renewable energy demand a major revamp of rules governing the national energy market. Its advice on the issue is due this year. The federal energy and emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, said the government understood EnergyAustralia had made a commercial decision and that the plant’s closure would bring “reliability and affordability concerns”. “As an essential service, the commonwealth government expects the market to step up to deliver enough dispatchable generation to keep the lights on and prices low once Yallourn closes,” he said. Taylor said his thoughts were with the plant’s workers, their families and local business owners who relied on the plant for their livelihoods. He said the government would model the impact of the closure “to hold industry to account” and ensure there was enough flexible capacity in the system needed to ensure electricity was affordable and reliable for consumers. The Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo) last year released a blueprint for an optimal grid that found between 6GW and 19GW of new flexible energy capacity would be needed by 2040 to support a grid that predominantly ran on solar and wind. It found this could come from batteries, pumped hydro, demand management (users being paid to reduce electricity use at peak times) and gas, but suggested new gas-fired power – the only fossil fuel on the list – was likely to be more expensive than other options. There are five large-scale batteries with a combined maximum power capacity of 260MW connected to the grid. Another 7,400MW in total power capacity is planned. An Aemo spokesperson said on Wednesday it welcomed EnergyAustralia’s announcement as it would allow a considered market response. Pressure is growing within the international community, from governments and investors, for a more rapid move away from coal. The new US climate envoy, John Kerry, has called for a faster exit from the fossil fuel as he pushes for countries to commit to more before a major climate conference in Glasgow in November."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2021/mar/03/its-radical-the-ugandan-city-built-on-solar-shea-butter-and-people-power","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2021-03-03T08:00:12Z","webTitle":"‘It's radical’: the Ugandan city built on solar, shea butter and people power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/mar/03/its-radical-the-ugandan-city-built-on-solar-shea-butter-and-people-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2021/mar/03/its-radical-the-ugandan-city-built-on-solar-shea-butter-and-people-power","fields":{"headline":"‘It's radical’: the Ugandan city built on solar, shea butter and people power","bodyText":"The village of Okere Mom-Kok was in ruins by the end of more than a decade of war in northern Uganda. Now, just outside Ojok Okello’s living-room door, final-year pupils at the early childhood centre are noisily breaking for recess and a market is clattering into life, as is the local craft brewery, as what has become Okere City begins a new day. “I think what I’m doing here is radical,” says Okello, who is behind an ambitious project to transform the destroyed village of 4,000 people into a thriving and sustainable town. Okere City began in January 2019. Its 200 hectares (500 acres) feature a school, a health clinic, a village bank and a community hall that also serves as a cinema, a church and a nightclub. Electricity is available to all, generated from solar energy – a rarity in the region – and far from the many outbreaks of cholera which were rampant years ago, there is now clean water from a borehole. Pupils at the school pay half their fees in cash, and the rest in maize, beans, sugar and firewood. The clinic lets people pay their bills in instalments. The local security man wields a spear, an unusual sight in an area where many men idle around as women shoulder most of the paid and unpaid work. Okello is funding the project from his own pocket. Last year, it cost 200 million Ugandan shillings (about £39,000). The London School of Economics graduate and development expert had worked for several international charities and NGOs but grew disillusioned seeing projects fail because, he says, communities were not involved in decisions about their own future. When he returned a few years ago to Okere Mom-Kok, hoping to meet extended family in the village he had left as a baby when his civil servant father was killed in the bush wars of the 1980s, he decided to put what he had learned into action. He wanted to create a project that was truly led by the people who lived there. Okere now generates revenue. Every project, from the school to the local bar, can fund itself, something that has been possible because the project is being built not as a charity, but as a social enterprise, Okello says. “I don’t want this project to be at the mercy of some white people,” he says. “I want us to have business conversations with partners. I want us to be responsible for shaping the destiny and the future of the project.” Translated from Lango, Okere Mom-Kok means, “a baby should not cry” and the logo for the project has a smiling baby’s face. But Okello quips that building the town has been far from all smiles. While comparisons could be made to Akon City, the futuristic smart city with its own currency being built by R&amp;B star Akon in Senegal, Okere is, in essence, the opposite, according to Amina Yasin, an expert in city planning, who works in Vancouver, Canada. “Akon City is going to be a walled city for the wealthy,” she says. “It sounds like a capitalist endeavour on the African continent. It is to benefit mostly non-indigenous Africans, unfortunately.” Okere City will pioneer green energy, but its unique selling point is its shea trees. Okello says the inspiration came to him via the Marvel blockbuster movie Black Panther, as he sat under a shea tree outside his house one afternoon in early 2020. “I looked at [the shea tree] and realised that we have this important natural resource and we were not harnessing it,” Okello says. “And I thought about Wakanda and Black Panther, they had vibranium, this shea tree could be our vibranium.” “So I am like: ‘Damn, I’m going to invest everything within my means to tap this resource, to protect [it], and to use it to emancipate my community.” In August, Okere Shea Butter arrived on the market. The whole city smells of shea butter, and Okello has advocated for the protection and regeneration of shea trees, classed as an endangered species threatened by extinction. Once a week an investment club meets in the community hall. As the sun starts to set over the city, the members assemble in a circle. The majority of the more than 100 members are women, mostly farmers, but some also run small businesses. “I got a loan from the club to buy shea seeds, which I sold at a profit,” says member Acen Olga. Members’ financial contributions are carefully recorded before being redistributed as loans to members who need them. When borrowers repay the loan, the cycle continues. This style of banking is particularly important because it’s original to Africans, Yasin says. “The way in which indigenous continental Africans have thought about money has always been outside of the central banking system,” she says. “It’s been about community and caring for each other, and patience, and long-term investments. “We’ve always known a lot earlier than the western world and other, quote, unquote, developed nations, that money was out of fashion and it was not a sustainable way to live.” Just metres from the club, past the community clinic, the supermarket is buzzing, and laughter can be heard from customers in the pub attached. Before the supermarket opened, villagers had to walk five miles (8km) for supplies. “There’s a lot of improvement,” says Wilfred Omodo, 25, who has joined Okere City kickboxing team, which was set up in November. “We have more buildings now and even the people are increasing.” Omodo started boxing while he was in a camp for people displaced by fighting in the region in the late 1990s and early 2000s. He is one of about 80 members of Okere’s boxing team, most of whom took up the sport for self-defence during the conflict. Among them is 40-year-old Nickson Akaca who coordinates the team. He is equally inspired by the progress of the project so far. “This place was basically a wilderness; there was nothing here,” he says. “And within a very short period of time, there has been a lot of change and progress. It gives us hope that maybe our passion to do kickboxing will not just go to waste.” But rural to urban development projects only work if they are created by and include the communities they are working to serve, says Yasin. “Okere City is being intentionally developed with the community in mind,” she says. “Whereas what we often see in cities across the world that do something similar is individuals who are kind of running away from larger cities and settling in smaller communities that they aren’t from.” Yasin says this leads to these cities becoming exclusionary, like Auroville, India’s experimental utopian township. “What does it look like when these utopian cities become gated cities?” Yasin asks. “Not gated communities any more, not gated neighbourhoods, but gated cities surrounded by smaller local, poorer, indigenous villages.” As night falls, the final whistle blows at the football match that had been showing on the big screen in Okere’s community hall and the room is transformed into a social club, with dancing and a small bar. Tomorrow morning, the same room will serve as a church."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2020/apr/28/climate-dangerous-documentary-planet-of-the-humans-michael-moore-taken-down","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2020-04-28T12:54:19Z","webTitle":"Climate experts call for 'dangerous' Michael Moore film to be taken down","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/28/climate-dangerous-documentary-planet-of-the-humans-michael-moore-taken-down","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2020/apr/28/climate-dangerous-documentary-planet-of-the-humans-michael-moore-taken-down","fields":{"headline":"Climate experts call for 'dangerous' Michael Moore film to be taken down","bodyText":"A new Michael Moore-produced documentary that takes aim at the supposed hypocrisy of the green movement is “dangerous, misleading and destructive” and should be removed from public viewing, according to an assortment of climate scientists and environmental campaigners. The film, Planet of the Humans, was released on the eve of Earth Day last week by its producer, Michael Moore, the baseball cap-wearing documentarian known for Fahrenheit 9/11 and Bowling for Columbine. Describing itself as a “full-frontal assault on our sacred cows”, the film argues that electric cars and solar energy are unreliable and rely upon fossil fuels to function. It also attacks figures including Al Gore for bolstering corporations that push flawed technologies over real solutions to the climate crisis. Planet of the Humans has provoked a furious reaction from scientists and campaigners, however, who have called for it be taken down. Films for Action, an online library of videos, temporarily took down the film after describing it as “full of misinformation”, though they later reinstated it, saying they did not want accusations of censorship to give the film “more power and mystique than it deserves”. A free version on YouTube has been viewed more than 3m times. A letter written by Josh Fox, who made the documentary Gasland, and signed by various scientists and activists, has urged the removal of “shockingly misleading and absurd” film for making false claims about renewable energy. Planet of the Humans “trades in debunked fossil fuel industry talking points” that question the affordability and reliability of solar and wind energy, the letter states, pointing out that these alternatives are now cheaper to run than fossil fuels such as coal. Michael Mann, a climate scientist and signatory to Fox’s letter, said the film includes “various distortions, half-truths and lies” and that the filmmakers “have done a grave disservice to us and the planet by promoting climate change inactivist tropes and talking points.” The film’s makers did not respond to questions over whether it will be pulled down. Planet of the Humans has been shown at Moore’s Traverse City film festival, where the producer said it was “perhaps the most urgent film we’ve shown in the 15-year history of our film festival”. Jeff Gibbs, who wrote and directed the film, has suggested that unrestrained economic and population growth should be the target of environmentalists’ efforts rather than technological fixes. Climate activist Bill McKibben, one of the targets for the film for allegedly being influenced by corporate money and for supporting the burning of biomass such as wood chips for energy, said the characterisations are untrue. McKibben has previously changed his views on biomass energy, which he now sees as being detrimental to climate action, and claims he has “never taken a penny in pay” from any environmental group. “I am used to ceaseless harassment and attack from the fossil fuel industry, and I’ve done my best to ignore a lifetime of death threats from rightwing extremists,” McKibben said. “It does hurt more to be attacked by others who think of themselves as environmentalists.” Renewable energy has long been portrayed as expensive and unreliably intermittent by oil and gas companies and their lobby groups, which have spent several decades questioning the veracity of climate science and undermining efforts to radically reduce planet-heating emissions. In fact, the technology used for wind and solar energy has improved markedly in recent years, while the costs have plummeted. While electric cars often require fossil fuel-generated energy to produce them and provide the electricity to fuel them, research has shown they still emit less greenhouse gas and air pollutants over their lifetime than a standard petrol or diesel car. Generating all power from renewables will take significant upgrades of grid infrastructure and storage but several researchers have declared the goal feasible, most likely with carbon-capture technology for remaining fossil fuel plants. Scientists say the world must reach net zero emissions by 2050 to head off disastrous global heating, which would likely spur worsening storms, heatwaves, sea level rise and societal unrest."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2020/aug/15/uk-firms-solar-power-breakthrough-could-make-worlds-most-efficient-panels-by-2021","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2020-08-14T23:00:26Z","webTitle":"UK firm's solar power breakthrough could make world's most efficient panels by 2021","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/aug/15/uk-firms-solar-power-breakthrough-could-make-worlds-most-efficient-panels-by-2021","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2020/aug/15/uk-firms-solar-power-breakthrough-could-make-worlds-most-efficient-panels-by-2021","fields":{"headline":"UK firm's solar power breakthrough could make world's most efficient panels by 2021","bodyText":"British rooftops could be hosting a breakthrough in new solar power technology by next summer, using a crystal first discovered more than 200 years ago to help harness more of the sun’s power. An Oxford-based solar technology firm hopes by the end of the year to begin manufacturing the world’s most efficient solar panels, and become the first to sell them to the public within the next year. Oxford PV claims that the next-generation solar panels will be able to generate almost a third more electricity than traditional silicon-based solar panels by coating the panels with a thin layer of a crystal material called perovskite. The breakthrough would offer the first major step-change in solar power generation since the technology emerged in the 1950s, and could play a major role in helping to tackle the climate crisis by increasing clean energy. By coating a traditional solar power cell with perovskite a solar panel can increase its power generation, and lower the overall costs of the clean electricity, because the crystal is able to absorb different parts of the solar spectrum than traditional silicon. Typically a silicon solar cell is able to convert up to about 22% of the available solar energy into electricity. But in June 2018, Oxford PV’s perovskite-on-silicon solar cell surpassed the best performing silicon-only solar cell by reaching a new world record of 27.3%. The perovskite-coated panels will appear different too. Instead of the blue tint usually associated with traditional silicon panels, Oxford PV’s panels will appear black and blend in better with rooftop slates. The mineral perovskite, also known as the crystal calcium titanate, was first discovered by a Russian mineralogist in the Ural mountains in 1839. In the last 10 years, scientists around the world have been locked in a race to engineer chemical compounds based upon the perovskite crystal structure but that are able to generate more renewable electricity at a lower cost. Dr Chris Case, the chief technology officer at Oxford PV, said using perovskite represents “a true change” for solar technology, which has remained relatively unchanged since the silicon-based panels developed in the 1950s. “Silicon has reached its culmination of capability,” he said. “There are residual improvements to be made, and cost of production opportunities, but from a performance standpoint it is at its efficiency limit. The perovskite material is something totally innovative for solar.” The company won £100,000 of funding from the UK government in 2010, before attracting equity investment from Norwegian oil giant Equinor, Legal &amp; General Capital and the Chinese renewables giant Goldwind. Frank Averdung, Oxford PV’s chief executive, said the company will be able to steal a march on the first commercially available solar panels which use perovskite to improve solar generation against the company’s rivals. “There are other companies working on perovskite, of course, and these other companies will eventually have a commercial focus, but none of these companies has the same focus on the combination of silicon and perovskite which we do,” he said. • This article was amended on 19 August 2020 to better describe perovskite."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2020/aug/18/canada-justin-trudeau-bill-morneau-covid-19-green-recovery","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2020-08-18T15:34:34Z","webTitle":"Canada: departure of finance minister suggests Trudeau will pursue ‘green’ recovery plan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/18/canada-justin-trudeau-bill-morneau-covid-19-green-recovery","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2020/aug/18/canada-justin-trudeau-bill-morneau-covid-19-green-recovery","fields":{"headline":"Canada: departure of finance minister suggests Trudeau will pursue ‘green’ recovery plan","bodyText":"With a projected C$343bn (US$260bn) Covid-shaped deficit, a collapsing oil and gas sector, and a province on the verge of bankruptcy over a botched energy project, Canada is at a crossroads. Does it pursue an ambitious “green” post-pandemic economic recovery plan that goes against the wishes of a number of influential and powerful industries – not to mention several provincial leaders – or does the tenuous Justin Trudeau-led minority government freeze in the headlights? The apparently acrimonious departure of the finance minister, Bill Morneau, late on Monday, suggests Trudeau has made his choice. Over his five-year tenure, Morneau was seen by many Canadians as taking a conservative approach to spending on environment – and more recently, on Covid relief. Trudeau, in contrast, made environmental promises a centerpiece of last year’s re-election campaign. It was inevitable that the two would eventually arrive at an impasse. Now, Trudeau’s right-hand woman Chrystia Freeland will take over the finance portfolio in addition to her role as deputy prime minister. As one of the key architects of the new Nafta agreement, Freeland has experience marrying economic objectives to broader social and environmental goals, making her better-positioned to carry out Trudeau’s environmental promises. But the road ahead still won’t be easy, said Bruce Lourie, the president of the environmental thinktank the Ivey Foundation as well as a member of a taskforce advocating for a green post-Covid recovery. “When you have politicians in three or four provinces that are just emerging from climate denialism, and a system of federation where the provinces at the end of the day have almost full responsibility for environmental, resource and energy decisions, it creates a virtually unmanageable country,” he said. “That’s a bigger challenge than Morneau and finance.” Canada’s post-pandemic recovery is creating a moment of reckoning, one in which Trudeau has to decide whether to pursue his ambitious green aspirations even if they come at a political cost. For years, he has been accused of talking out of both sides of his mouth when it comes to energy, investing in solar, wind and hydro but also building new pipelines. Under the Paris agreement, Canada vowed to reduce greenhouse gases by 30% below 2005 levels by 2030 – a goal that will probably be impossible to meet with so much of the economy presently relying on Alberta’s oil sands. It will be even tougher if the Trans Mountain, Coastal GasLink and Keystone XL pipelines go ahead. Kyla Tienhaara, the Canada Research Chair in economy and environment and an assistant professor in environmental studies at Queen’s University, told the Guardian that a majority of Canadians still support federal investment in green sectors such as wind and solar energy despite the country’s deficit. Further, Tienhaara said Alberta’s recent economic hardship is not purely a consequence of Covid: companies such as Shell have been leaving the region for years. “That’s because the oil there is very costly to extract, both environmentally and economically. It’s the first type of oil that is going to go in the transition, and the transition is inevitable. Renewable energy is just becoming so much more economically sensible,” she said. Lourie, meanwhile, has briefed key Liberal caucus ministers on his taskforce’s “five bold moves” to make sure Canada’s post-Covid recovery is as sustainable and resilient as possible. The reception was positive, he said, and Trudeau is “100% committed” to acting on climate change. The challenge is rounding up the cavalry – and making a decision about Morneau is essential to a strong showing, especially in Trudeau’s minority government. This is the time, said Lourie, for the Liberals to show leadership by pitching an economic model that delivers on the country’s environmental responsibilities."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/jul/16/russia-ukraine-war-air-raid-sirens-in-kyiv-as-russia-intensifies-long-range-bombardment-latest-updates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-16T23:02:50Z","webTitle":"Russian forces ‘preparing new offensive’ – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/jul/16/russia-ukraine-war-air-raid-sirens-in-kyiv-as-russia-intensifies-long-range-bombardment-latest-updates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/jul/16/russia-ukraine-war-air-raid-sirens-in-kyiv-as-russia-intensifies-long-range-bombardment-latest-updates","fields":{"headline":"Russian forces ‘preparing new offensive’ – as it happened","bodyText":"It’s 2am in Kyiv. Here’s where things stand: 7 civilians have been evacuated from Sviatohirsk Lavra in Donetsk. Among those evacuated include a family with three children and two elderly people, according to Ukraine’s defense ministry intelligence directorate. The youngest evacuee was born just a few days earlier at a monastery. The armed forces of Ukraine are advancing “confidently” towards Kherson, according to a Ukrainian military spokesperson. Natalia Hemeniuk, the head of the press center of Operation Command South, “Speaking about what is happening directly in Kherson direction, we are advancing there. Maybe we are not moving as fast as those who present positive news would like, but believe me, these steps are very confident.” The war in Ukraine “concerns the West as a whole” but at the same time must not lead to “forgetting Africa’s security” needs, France’s armed forces minister Sebastien Lecornu said Saturday. “We have a form of myopia in Europe and France, where the Ukraine war mobilises all our energy, and that is natural - it is a conflict that concerns the West as a whole,” said Lecornu in Ivory Coast after a visit to Niger. “No Russian missiles or artillery can break our unity,” Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a statement on Saturday. In an address on the anniversary of the Declaration of State Sovereignty of Ukraine, Zelenskiy added, “It should be equally obvious that it cannot be broken with lies or intimidation, fakes or conspiracy theories.” All bodies have been identified after the Vinnytsia missile strike, the region’s governor announced. According to Vinnytsia oblast governor Serhii Borzov, 68 people are currently hospitalized, 14 of them are in serious condition. Rescue operations after Russian missiles struck the west central Ukrainian city of Vinnytsia have concluded. 23 people have been killed, 202 have been injured, one person is missing and three others have been rescued, according to Ukraine’s state emergency service. Russian forces are preparing for a new offensive, the Kyiv Independent reports. According to Vadym Skibitsky, a representative of the intelligence directorate at Ukraine’s defense ministry, Russian activity signal that “undoubtedly, preparations for the next stage of offensive actions are underway.” Around 100 to 150 civilians were killed by Russian military strikes in Ukraine over the past two weeks, according to the Pentagon. In a briefing on Friday, a senior US military official said, “And I think all told over the week...we’re looking at between 100, 150, somewhere in there, civilian casualties, civilian deaths, this week in Ukraine as a result of Russian strikes.” That’s it from me, Maya Yang, as I hand the blog over to my colleagues in Australia who will bring you the latest updates. I’ll be back tomorrow, thank you. 7 civilians have been evacuated from Sviatohirsk Lavra in Donetsk, the Kyiv Independent reports. Among those evacuated include a family with three children and two elderly people, according to Ukraine’s defense ministry intelligence directorate. The youngest evacuee was born just a few days earlier at a monastery. The armed forces of Ukraine are advancing “confidently” towards Kherson, according to a Ukrainian military spokesperson. Natalia Hemeniuk, the head of the press center of Operation Command South said on Espresso TV, “Speaking about what is happening directly in Kherson direction, we are advancing there. Maybe we are not moving as fast as those who present positive news would like, but believe me, these steps are very confident. And that is why they are taken in silence and certain confidentiality – in order to gain a foothold in these territories and then announce our victories.” Hemeniuk also said that Ukrainian defenders came across an enemy armored vehicle on Friday while clearing out the territory of Potiomkyne village which the Ukrainian military liberated a few weeks ago. The vehicle turned out to not pose any threats and was transferred to the Ukrainian armed forces. “But we understand that the enemies may leave more threatening ‘surprises’ in the territories they left. Like it was with Snake Island, which the Russians continue to attack with aircraft and try to find out what is actually happening there and bomb it from time to time though failing to hit the island,” Humeniuk said. Deputies in Ukraine’s parliament have formed a new group in attempts to urge the Ukrainian parliament to approve a resolution that declares Russia’s expulsion of Circassians in 1864 an act of genocide. The war in Ukraine “concerns the West as a whole” but at the same time must not lead to “forgetting Africa’s security” needs, France’s armed forces minister Sebastien Lecornu said Saturday. Agence France-Presse reports: “We have a form of myopia in Europe and France, where the Ukraine war mobilises all our energy, and that is natural - it is a conflict that concerns the West as a whole,” said Lecornu in Ivory Coast after a visit to Niger. “Yet it should not lead to forgetting about news on security in Africa,” he argued ahead of meeting with Ivorian President Alassane Ouattara. Earlier, Lecornu had talks with Ivorian counterpart Tene Birahima Ouattara on African security, notably in the Sahel. While hailing France’s counter-terrorism efforts with Paris’ partners in the region in recent years, he said Paris had now embarked on a “new agenda” with its main friends and allies in West Africa. Earlier this year, Paris announced the withdrawal of its troops from Mali following the breakdown in relations with the ruling junta in the former French colony. That ended a nearly 10-year deployment against jihadist groups that pose a growing threat in the region. “No Russian missiles or artillery can break our unity,” Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a statement on Saturday. In an address on the anniversary of the Declaration of State Sovereignty of Ukraine, Zelenskiy added, “It should be equally obvious that it cannot be broken with lies or intimidation, fakes or conspiracy theories.” All bodies have been identified after the Vinnytsia missile strike, the region’s governor announced. According to Vinnytsia oblast governor Serhii Borzov, 68 people are currently hospitalized, 14 of them are in serious condition. Serhii Morhunov, Vinnytsia’s mayor said that the families of those killed and injured would received $1,700 and $850 in assistance, respectively. Rescue operations after Russian missiles struck the west central Ukrainian city of Vinnytsia have concluded, the Kyiv Independent reports. 23 people have been killed, 202 have been injured, one person is missing and three others have been rescued, according to Ukraine’s state emergency service. Additionally, the strikes, which hit the city center on July 14, destroyed 55 residential houses and 42 vehicles. Russian forces are preparing for a new offensive, the Kyiv Independent reports. According to Vadym Skibitsky, a representative of the intelligence directorate at Ukraine’s defense ministry, Russian activity signal that “undoubtedly, preparations for the next stage of offensive actions are underway.” He also added that the threat of an invasion from Belarus is no longer as high as it previously was prior to the start of Russia’s invasion in February. Around 100 to 150 civilians were killed by Russian military strikes in Ukraine over the past two weeks, according to the Pentagon. In a briefing on Friday, a senior US military official said: “And I think all told over the week ... we’re looking at between 100, 150, somewhere in there, civilian casualties, civilian deaths, this week in Ukraine as a result of Russian strikes. The recent increase in civilian deaths comes as Russian and Ukrainian military forces remain in a fierce battle on the frontlines of Ukraine’s eastern territories. When asked whether the war had entered a stalemate, the official said: “It’s probably too early to make a determination like that. I think, you know, again, in terms of where you are on the battlefield, I would – I have to believe that the HIMARS have had an effect. I don’t know that that’s – you know, we didn’t think that would be a silver bullet, certainly.” He went on to add: “I think what you’re seeing is ... a matchup between bad morale and strong will.” Hi everyone, this is Maya Yang and I will be taking over the blog and bringing you the latest updates. Stay tuned. On the Russian missiles hitting the city of Dnipro, which killed three people and wounded 15, a local woman who gave her name as Klavdia told Reuters: “When the blast wave hit, there were few shards because all my windows were taped up. “I have a small injury on the left of my body but the people whose windows were not protected like this, there was a lot of blood, their injuries were horrible. “I saw a small child all covered in blood. It was awful.” Russia said it had destroyed a factory in Dnipro making missile parts. US treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, has said she had productive meetings with a number of countries on the sidelines of the G20 finance leaders meeting about a proposed price cap on Russian oil. Yellen said her bilateral meetings and the overall G20 sessions in Indonesia focused on the human and economic cost of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with the US and other countries “unequivocal in condemning their [Russia’s] shameful actions”. Russia says it is engaged in a “special military operation” in Ukraine. The US treasury department said Yellen met finance leaders from Saudi Arabia, Australia, South Africa, Turkey, and Singapore. She also had dinner with Canadian finance minister, Chrystia Freeland, a treasury official said. “On energy costs, I had productive bilateral meetings with over a half dozen of my counterparts where we discussed the merits of a price cap and how it can help us achieve our goals of denying Putin revenue for his war machine, while dampening energy costs,” Yellen told reporters outside the meeting venue. She said a price cap was one of “our most powerful tools to address the high prices people are facing in America and around the world”. Yellen said she also underscored the importance of taking action at the G20 to address the global food security crisis, Reuters reports. Yellen met Saudi finance minister, Mohammed Al-Jadaan, Australian treasurer, Jim Chalmers, South African finance minister, Enoch Godongwana, the deputy prime minister of Singapore, Lawrence Wong, and the Turkish finance minister, Nureddin Nebati, the treasury said. Speaking at a summit of Arab leaders, US president Joe Biden has said the United States “will not walk away” from the Middle East and let “China, Russia or Iran” fill a power vacuum in the region. President Biden delivered his remarks at the Gulf Cooperation Council on the final leg of a four-day tour of the Middle East. Biden’s trip aimed to secure stability and a new axis of cooperation in light of growing concerns over Iran’s leadership and Russian president Vladimir Putin. It also aimed to boost the global flow of oil to bring down rising gas prices. A senior Biden administration official, who briefed reporters before the summit, said Moscow’s efforts to acquire drones from Tehran show that Russia is “effectively making a bet on Iran”. Biden said: We will not walk away and leave a vacuum to be filled by China, Russia or Iran. We will seek to build on this moment with active, principled, American leadership. Today, I’m proud to be able to say that the era of land wars in the region, wars that involved huge numbers of American forces, is not under way. Biden announced a $1 bn US aid package to tackle a worsening hunger crisis in the region, and pressed his counterparts to ensure human rights are realised, and allow their citizens to speak openly. “The future will be won by the countries that unleash the full potential of their populations,” he said, adding that people should be allowed to “question and criticise leaders without fear of reprisal”. Crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia, convened the summit and hinted that the kingdom could put out more oil than it does currently, something Biden is hoping to see when an existing production deal among OPEC+ member countries expires in September, the Associated Press reports. German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has reiterated Germany’s climate protection goals despite growing concerns about the country’s energy supply as a result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In a video published on Saturday, Scholz said: Our goal is that we will be one of the first countries to be CO2-neutral and, at the same time, globally competitive and successful as an economic nation, as an industrial country. We will make sure now that the development of renewable energies finally progresses – wind power at sea, on land solar energy, biomass ... We need all this to produce electricity and hydrogen so that we will have an industrial future without CO2 emissions. We want to accomplish this by 2045. The first cluster of corresponding laws, he added, had begun to be introduced. More laws would follow later this year so that plans could stay on schedule. The federal government, the chancellor said, had initially failed on its plan for an overarching and immediate climate programme and had only presented a strategy for transport and construction at first. He added: It’s bitter that we now have to temporarily use some power plants that we have already shut down because of Russia’s brutal attack on Ukraine. But it’s only for a very short time. Because we are really getting started now and want to do everything we can to fight the climate crisis. Scholz did not comment on energy security for the winter. IMF chief, Kristalina Georgieva, has warned officials from the G20 to take urgent action to combat inflation, warning that the “exceptionally uncertain” global economic outlook could worsen if higher prices persist. Speaking at a G20 meeting of finance officials in Indonesia, Georgieva said Russia’s intensifying war in Ukraine had increased pressure on commodity and energy prices, and that global financial conditions were tightening more than expected. At the same time, pandemic-related disruptions and renewed supply-chain bottlenecks continued to weigh on economic activity. Pressure was mounting on heavily indebted countries, and the debt situation was “deteriorating fast”, she said. In its daily update, the UK’s Ministry of Defence says Russia’s momentum has slowed in recent days, with Ukrainian forces “successful in repulsing Russian attacks since Lysychansk was ceded and the Ukrainian defensive line was shortened and straightened”. Ukraine could sue top US and EU banks over oil and gas trade with Russia that has effectively financed “war crimes”, the Financial Times reports (£). The Ukrainian government has told US and European bank bosses, including JP Morgan Chase’s Jamie Dimon and HSBC’s Noel Quinn, to stop financing companies that trade Russian oil. Oleg Ustenko, economic adviser to president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, accused the lenders of “war crimes”. He wrote to them this week asking them to cut ties with groups that trade Russian oil and sell shares in the state-backed oil and gas groups Gazprom and Rosneft. In the letters, also sent to Citigroup and Crédit Agricole, banks were accused of “prolonging” the war by providing credit to companies that ship Russian oil, and were told they would be blocked from participating in the postwar reconstruction of Ukraine. Ustenko said Ukraine’s ministry for justice intends to sue the banks at the International Criminal Court once the war ends, and that Ukraine’s security services were collecting information on financial institutions supporting Russian fossil fuels. “In my view, they are committing war crimes because they are helping the Putin regime in this specific way,” he said, arguing that Russian oil and gas revenues fund the purchase of rockets and missiles used against Ukrainians. Although the ICC cannot investigate or prosecute governments or corporations, it can do so with individuals from those organisations. The Ukrainian government is reportedly particularly angry with JP Morgan because the company published an analyst note warning that a price cap on Russian oil could drive global prices to a “stratospheric” $380 a barrel. Finance ministers of the G20 agreed on most issues, including efforts to tackle food insecurity, despite failing to reconcile differences regarding members’ views about the war in Ukraine, Indonesia said on Saturday. Hosting the meeting in Bali, Indonesia’s finance minister, Sri Mulyani Indrawati, said finance leaders also agreed to maintain the spirit of collaboration and multi-lateralism. Russian armed forces have destroyed a factory in the Ukrainian city of Dnipro that produced parts for Tochka-U ballistic missiles, the Russian defence ministry said in a statement. Russian forces have also shot down three Ukrainian airplanes and two helicopters, the ministry said. The number of people killed after a Russian missile strike on the central Ukrainian city of Vinnytsia on Thursday has risen to 24, after a woman died in hospital of her burn wounds, a Ukrainian official has told Agence France-Presse. Russia claims the strikes – hundreds of kilometres from the front lines – had targeted a meeting of Ukrainian military officials and foreign arms suppliers. Kyiv has denied these claims. UN secretary-general, António Guterres, said he was “appalled” by the attack, while the EU has condemned it as an “atrocity”. Russian energy giant Gazprom said on Saturday that it had asked German group Siemens to return a turbine it has repaired in Canada to ensure the Nord Stream gas pipeline to Europe works. Gazprom began 10 days of scheduled annual maintenance on the pipeline on Monday, with EU countries – particularly gas-reliant Germany – waiting nervously to see if the taps will be turned back on. Moscow had already wound down supplies by 60% in recent weeks, blaming the absence of the turbine. Despite western sanctions on Russia over its military operation in Ukraine, Canada has agreed to grant what it has described as a time-limited and revocable permit for Siemens Canada to allow the machine’s return, AFP reports. But Gazprom claims it has received no guarantees of it being sent back. It said in a statement: On July 15, Gazprom submitted an official request to Siemens to obtain the documents ... to allow the export of the gas turbine engine of the Portovaya station, a critical facility for the Nord Stream gas pipeline. Gazprom is counting on the Siemens group to unconditionally fulfil its obligations relating to the repair and maintenance of gas turbine engines on which the reliability of Nord Stream gas pipeline operations and natural gas deliveries to European consumers rely. The maintenance work on the gas link was scheduled long in advance, but amid hostile relations between Russia and the west, some fear Gazprom might seize the opportunity to cut the supply through the pipeline for good. US teasury secretary, Janet Yellen, told reporters on Saturday that finance officials from the G20 reached strong consensus on many issues, including the need to address a worsening food security crisis, despite differences over Russia’s war in Ukraine that prevented leaders from issuing a joint statement, the Associated Press reports. Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, has ordered Russian military units operating in Ukraine to step up their operations to prevent strikes on eastern Ukraine and other territories controlled by Russia, the ministry said in a statement on its website on Saturday. It said Shoigu “gave the necessary instructions to further increase the actions of groups in all operational areas in order to exclude the possibility of the Kyiv regime launching massive rocket and artillery strikes on civilian infrastructure and residents of settlements in Donbas and other regions,” Reuters reports. Two people were killed in Nikopol on Saturday when heavy Russian shelling hit the southern Ukrainian town, the emergency services and regional governor said. The regional governor of Dnipropetrovsk, Valentyn Reznichenko, said Russia fired 53 Grad rockets at the town, Reuters reports. The White House says Russian officials have visited an airfield in central Iran at least twice in recent weeks to view attack-capable drones for use in its war in Ukraine. Joe Biden’s administration released the intelligence information as he was due to meet leaders of six Arab Gulf countries, as well as Egypt, Jordan and Iraq, for a summit about regional missile and defence capabilities on Saturday. Biden is expected to make a “major statement” at the end of his four-day trip, aimed at “laying out clearly” his strategy for America’s engagement in the Middle East and bolstering a unified new regional axis, largely driven by shared concerns over Iran. The US believes Iran showcased the drones to Russian officials at Kashan airfield on 8 June and 15 July. The administration also released satellite imagery of Shahed-191 and Shahed-129 drones on display and in flight at the airfield while a Russian delegation plane was on the ground, the Associated Press reports. White House national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said the administration has “information that the Iranian government is preparing to provide Russia with several hundred UAVs [unmanned aerial vehicles]”. He added: We assess [that] an official Russian delegation recently received a showcase of Iranian attack-capable UAVs. We are releasing these images, captured in June, showing Iranian UAVs that the Russian government delegation saw that day. This suggests ongoing Russian interest in acquiring Iranian attack-capable UAVs. Sullivan said US officials believe the June visit “was the first time a Russian delegation has visited this airfield for such a showcase”. In a phone conversation with his Ukrainian counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba, on Friday, Iran’s foreign minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, rejected reports about exporting Iranian drones to Russia, calling them “baseless”. “This sort of claims parallel with Biden’s visit to occupied Palestine, or Israel, are in direction of political intentions and purposes,” the website of Iran’s foreign ministry quoted Amir-Abdollahian as saying. “We oppose any move that could lead to continuation and intensifying conflicts.” President Biden plans to announce on Saturday that the US is committing $1bn in food aid to the Middle East and North Africa amid rising food insecurity caused by the war in Ukraine, a senior official told reporters. The G20 will discuss post-pandemic financial stability, crypto-assets and climate-related financial risks among other topics on Saturday, but sources said the two-day meeting in Bali would probably end without a formal communiqué as Russia’s war in Ukraine continues to divide the group. Indonesia urged G20 finance leaders to stay focused on their goals for global economic recovery. Senior western officials, including US treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, and Canadian finance minister, Chrystia Freeland, condemned the war on Friday and blasted Russian officials for the economic fallout it has caused, Reuters reports. Ukraine’s finance minister, Serhiy Marchenko, who addressed the meeting virtually, called for “more severe, targeted sanctions” against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. Western countries have enforced strict sanctions on Russia and accused it of war crimes in Ukraine, which Moscow has denied. Other G20 nations, including China, India and South Africa, have been more muted in their response. “We are in a rudderless moment in the world economy with the G20 paralysed by Putin’s war and the G7 unable to lead on global public goods,” said Kevin Gallagher, director of the Global Development Policy Centre at Boston University. Indonesia’s finance minister, Sri Mulyani Indrawati, had hoped delegates would address rising commodity prices, the worsening food security crisis and the knock-on effects of the ability of low-income countries to repay debt. A Russian strike hit the north-eastern Ukrainian town of Chuhuiv in Kharkiv overnight, killing three people including a 70-year-old woman and wounding three more, the regional governor said. The strike damaged a residential block, a school and a shop, and rescuers were going through the rubble, governor Oleh Synehubov said on Telegram. Russia denies targeting civilians, Reuters reports. Moldova received about €600m in pledges at a donors conference on Friday, an official said, to help the country overcome rising inflation and the impact of Russia’s war in Ukraine. More than 500,000 refugees have fled to Moldova, which borders Ukraine, since the Russian invasion began on 24 February. The situation has put a huge strain on resources in Europe’s poorest country, which is looking to forge closer ties with the west, the Associated Press reports. Moldova is also fully dependent on Russian gas supplies – prices of which have increased four-fold in the past year – and is now contending with skyrocketing inflation. The Moldova Support Platform donor meeting was held in Romania’s capital, Bucharest, on Friday and was co-chaired by the Romanian foreign minister, Bogdan Aurescu, his German counterpart, Annalena Baerbock, and the French secretary of state for development, Chrysoula Zacharopoulou. Delegates from the G7 and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe also attended the event. Baerbock wrote online after the event: We may not have the power to stop the war in Ukraine today or tomorrow, due to Russia’s brutality. But we do have the means to help a democratic country to prevent it from being crushed by the effects of this war. I’m Jedidajah Otte and taking over this live blog for the next few hours. Russia is using Europe’s largest nuclear power plant as a base to store weapons, including “missile systems”, and shell surrounding areas in Ukraine, an official with Kyiv’s nuclear agency said. The president of the Ukrainian state nuclear agency, Energoatom, said on Friday that the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant was “extremely tense”, with up to 500 Russian soldiers controlling the plant, Agence France-Presse reports. “The occupiers bring their machinery there, including missile systems, from which they already shell the other side of the River Dnipro and the territory of Nikopol,” Pedro Kotin said in a televised interview. The nuclear plant in south-western Ukraine has been under Russian control since the early weeks of Moscow’s invasion, though it is still being operated by Ukrainian staff. The most recent attack in the Dnipro region left three dead and 15 wounded, regional governor Valentin Reznichenko said on Telegram. The threat of air raids across most of Ukraine was also raised after strikes were reported in areas far from the frontlines. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the Russian objective was to “cause maximum damage to Ukrainian cities”. Russia and Ukraine have described progress towards an agreement to lift a blockade restricting the export of Ukrainian grain. Turkey, which is mediating the talks, said a deal could be signed next week. Asked if that timeline was realistic, a senior Ukrainian official who asked not to be identified told Reuters: “We really hope so. We’re hurrying as fast as we can.” Russia’s defence ministry said an agreement was close, but Moscow’s negotiator cautioned that a grains deal would not lead to a resumption of peace talks. A deal would probably involve inspections of vessels to ensure Ukraine was not bringing in arms, as well as guarantees from western countries that Russia’s own food exports be exempt from sanctions. Moscow welcomed a written clarification from Washington on Thursday that banks, insurers and shippers would not be targeted by sanctions for facilitating shipments of Russian grain and fertiliser. Air raid sirens sounded across Kyiv on Saturday as Russia intensified its long-range bombardment of Ukrainian cities that has killed at least 34 people and wounded many more in the past three days. Late on Friday, Russian missiles hit the central city of Dnipro, killing three people and wounding 15, the regional governor, Valentyn Reznichenko, said. Rockets hit an industrial plant and a street next to it, he said on Telegram. Reuters posted footage on social media showing thick black smoke rising from buildings and burning cars. Eight people were killed and 13 were injured in a string of shellings in 10 places in the eastern region of Donetsk, governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said in a television interview. On Thursday, Kalibr cruise missiles launched from a Russian submarine in the Black Sea hit an office building in Vinnytsia, south-west of Kyiv, in a strike Ukraine said killed at least 23 people. Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s continuing coverage of the war in Ukraine. It is approaching 10am in Kyiv. Here’s a summary of the latest developments. At least three people were killed and 15 injured following a missile attack on Friday in Dnipro, central Ukraine. “The rockets hit an industrial plant and a busy street next to it,” the regional governor, Valentyn Reznichenko, said on his Facebook page. The UK said the Kremlin was “fully responsible” for the death of a British captive in eastern Ukraine. The British foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said: “I am shocked to hear reports of the death of British aid worker Paul Urey while in the custody of a Russian proxy in Ukraine. Russia must bear the full responsibility for this.” Rescue workers were still clearing debris in the wake of strikes in Vinnytsia, central Ukraine, that killed at least 23 people. A top Ukrainian official has accused Russia of deliberately escalating its deadly attacks on civilian targets. Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of Ukraine’s national security council, told the Guardian that monitoring of Russian strikes suggested an increased emphasis in recent weeks on terrorising Ukraine’s civilian population. “That’s not my emotions but what our monitoring is telling us.” A wounded soldier who returned from Russian captivity has recounted how Russian forces would threaten Ukrainian soldiers with the death penalty if they refused to cooperate. Denys Piskun, an Azov soldier, told Azov Media: “They said that if you don’t testify, if you don’t cooperate, there will be the death penalty. You all have the death penalty on trial as a Nazi terrorist organisation.” Ukrainian officials have confirmed that the US House of Representatives approved $100m in funding to train Ukrainian pilots to operate American aircraft as part of the National Defence Authorisation Act. The pilots will be trained on F-15 and F-16 jets, according to Andriy Yermak, Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s chief of staff. Ukraine’s military losses peaked in May, the defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, said in an interview on Friday. Speaking to the BBC, Reznikov said: “The biggest peak of our losses was in May,” with up to 100 soldiers being killed a day. Europe has “shot itself in the lungs” with sanctions aimed at Russia over its war in Ukraine, the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, said on Friday. Orbán, who has ruled Hungary since 2010 and frequently clashes with Brussels, has been a fierce critic of European Union sanctions on Russian oil. In an address on national radio, Orbán urged EU leaders to change the sanctions policy. Ukrainian rocket strikes have destroyed more than 30 Russian military logistics centres in recent weeks and significantly reduced Russia’s attacking potential, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s defence ministry said on Friday. The official, Oleksandr Motuzianyk, emphasised the role played by US Himars (high mobility artillery rocket systems) , one of several types of long-range weapon supplied by the west to assist Ukraine in the war. M270 long-range multiple rocket launch systems have arrived in Ukraine, the Ukrainian defence minister announced on Friday. “They will be good company for Himars on the battlefield,” Oleksii Reznikov wrote on Twitter."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2020/sep/01/music-mogul-akon-going-ahead-with-futuristic-akon-city-in-senegal","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2020-09-01T15:43:36Z","webTitle":"Music mogul Akon going ahead with futuristic 'Akon City' in Senegal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/01/music-mogul-akon-going-ahead-with-futuristic-akon-city-in-senegal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2020/sep/01/music-mogul-akon-going-ahead-with-futuristic-akon-city-in-senegal","fields":{"headline":"Music mogul Akon going ahead with futuristic 'Akon City' in Senegal","bodyText":"The US-Senegalese music mogul Akon has said he is pressing ahead with lofty plans to create a futuristic Pan-African smart city in Senegal next year, built in the mould of Wakanda - the fictional, technologically advanced African nation depicted in the Marvel blockbuster Black Panther. The 800-hectare (2,000 acre), surrealist, solar-powered “Akon City”, backed by the Senegalese government and funded by unnamed investors, was first announced by Akon in 2018. On Monday, Akon, whose real name is Aliaune Thiam, announced alongside Senegal’s minister for tourism, Alioune Sarr, that he had laid the first stone for the city in Mbodiène, a coastal village 62 miles from the capital, Dakar. The plans depict gleaming skyscrapers, shopping malls, music studios and eco-friendly tourist resorts. They envisage that “Akoin”, a cryptocurrency founded by the R&amp;B star, would be the central currency. Akon City is not the first major development announced by the singer for Africa. Previous plans and grand promises have attracted criticism on the continent and questions around transparency. Sarr hailed Akon’s launch for coming at a time when private investment in the west African country is scarce and badly needed, following the economic pain wrought by the coronavirus outbreak. Akon said the city would provide opportunities for Senegalese people and an alternative home for African Americans facing racial discrimination. “The system back home [in the US] treats them unfairly in so many different ways that you can never imagine,” he said. “And they only go through it because they feel that there is no other way. If you’re coming from America or Europe or elsewhere in the diaspora and you feel that you want to visit Africa, we want Senegal to be your first stop.” Few details of the project have been made public. Investors for the estimated $6bn scheme could not be named after signing non-disclosure agreements, but a third of the funding has been secured, Akon said. The singer has in the past dodged questions about how his cryptocurrency will be viable in the planned city, saying he would leave it to “the geeks” to work out. According to the US-based consulting and engineering firm KE International, it has been contracted to create the city, which “will define a new paradigm in design and architecture for Africa”. Plans are being considered to franchise the project to other countries in Africa, replicating smart-cities, such as the Mwale Medical and Technological City scheme in Kenya. The singer, born in the US to Senegalese parents and who grew up in Senegal, has been evangelical on the potential of African countries to redevelop and reduce dependency on western countries. In 2014, he announced “Light up Africa”, a charity initiative in partnership with the World Bank and governments to subsidise solar power and provide electricity to 600 million people in rural communities, more than half of the continent’s then population. The project claims to have helped more than 32 million people in 25 countries to gain access to basic electricity through solar energy. Questions around Akon’s operations in Africa grew when in 2015 he claimed to have manipulated African leaders. “In Africa, you’ve gotta manipulate them. You have to,” he told an Africa Day celebration at Coca-Cola, describing challenges in persuading African leaders to part-fund the projects. In 2018, he said his Akoin currency, which relies on smartphone use, would become a “stable currency alternative throughout Africa”. Yet it has faced questions around its access in low income countries where data is expensive. Only a third of people in Senegal use a smartphone, according to the Pew Research Centre. Michael Kimani, the chairman of the Blockchain Association of Kenya, dismissed the Akoin plans as “pie-in-the-sky” since it would need widespread usage across Africa to work. Work on the city is scheduled to start early next year, with completion of the first phase set for 2023. The plans say the town will initially cover 55 hectares (135 acres) but grow to 500 hectares by the end of the decade, with plans for artificial islands and a marina that can accommodate cruise ships. Sarr said he hoped the project would give the lie to “Cassandras … who always view new projects as pipe dreams” and vowed to help make sure it was completed on schedule."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2020/oct/07/offshore-wind-jobs-windfarms-scotland","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2020-10-07T08:00:32Z","webTitle":"More offshore wind is welcome, but we have to keep the jobs it creates in the UK | Chaitanya Kumar","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/07/offshore-wind-jobs-windfarms-scotland","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/07/offshore-wind-jobs-windfarms-scotland","fields":{"headline":"More offshore wind is welcome, but we have to keep the jobs it creates in the UK","bodyText":"Yesterday’s speech to the virtual Conservative party conference was classic Boris: amusing metaphors, whimsical slogans and grand rhetoric. The prime minister has pledged to usher in a “green industrial revolution” that will help us “bounce back greener” from Covid-19. One of the most significant announcements was the scaling up of the offshore wind sector. The government intends to quadruple offshore wind capacity by 2030, with a promise to power all our kettles, lights and electric cars from clean, “guilt-free” electricity. It is a bold and ambitious target, requiring the installation of one wind turbine every weekday for the next 10 years, costing almost £50bn in capital investment. If this sounds familiar, it’s because this commitment from the Tory party was already made in its 2019 election manifesto, with the full backing of the offshore wind industry. The prime minister announced £160m for ports and infrastructure in Teesside and Humber, Scotland and Wales, needed to build and service these turbines, but if these plans are to benefit communities as well as reducing emissions, the goal must be to keep the jobs and manufacturing contracts in the UK. Just last month, contracts to manufacture the platforms for 114 wind turbines off the coast of Scotland were won by a US corporation that intends to manufacture and ship them from China and the UAE, taking advantage of lower production costs in those nations. Last year, EDF awarded contracts for a significant portion of its windfarm supply chain to Indonesia, ignoring the opportunity to invest and develop local manufacturers in Fife, despite the windfarms being located just off its coast. The offshore wind sector has nonetheless set a target of 60% British content in windfarms by 2030, up from roughly 50% today. A more concerted effort from government and business alongside trade unions could help achieve that target while creating green jobs and supporting the clean growth of towns and cities across Britain’s coast. The striking omission in the prime minister’s speech was any mention of onshore wind – a technology that is currently the cheapest way to produce energy in the UK but has been crippled over almost five years through government policy. The onshore wind sector did receive a minor reprieve earlier in the year, when the government agreed to allow onshore wind to participate in competitive auctions, but rigid planning rules mean that an equally guilt-free source of electricity might miss out on powering a green industrial revolution. The Conservatives continue to harbour a misapprehension that onshore wind faces opposition from constituency voters, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. The renewable energy auctions next year will support more onshore wind, but most of it is likely to only be in Scotland. Instead, the offshore wind sector is the goose that lays the golden egg, as is evident in the prime minister’s desire to make the UK Saudi Arabia for wind energy. The success of offshore wind wasn’t merely down to a technical ability to harvest the gusts, but an important story of state-led intervention. Renewable energy targets set with the EU in 2010 provided the legal imperative to scale up wind and solar energy, while an early gamble on expensive wind projects using taxpayers’ money led to a massive innovation boom. So far in 2020, consumers have paid more than £800m to support the offshore wind industry through their energy bills. An ambitious policy initially funded by the taxpayer has now made the prime minister eat his own words when he farcically claimed, in 2013, that wind energy “couldn’t pull the skin off a rice pudding”. The sector has now come such a long way in just seven years that we are looking at the prospect of negative subsidy projects, where offshore wind will start paying consumers back over the lifetime of their generation. As the climate crisis accelerates and the government remains off track to meet its own net-zero target, offshore wind cannot remain the panacea for all our problems. A public investment-led innovation approach is now needed in sectors like transport, agriculture and industry, where emissions are harder to cut and new stakeholders need to be engaged. In many ways offshore wind is out of sight and largely out of mind for British citizens, but the next phase of rapid decarbonisation needs to happen in our homes, neighbourhoods and cities, where the changes will be more visible. The government is expected to launch Johnson’s “10-point plan” to achieve net zero in the next few weeks, trailing the runup to the major climate summit being hosted in Glasgow next November. The prime minister is clearly enamoured by hydrogen, and carbon capture and storage (CCS), calling himself an evangelist of these technologies. But, as with all announcements, whether action matches the rhetoric remains to be seen. The green agenda is right up there for No 10, and that is a good thing. Now the PM needs to back his idioms and metaphors with significant money. • Chaitanya Kumar is head of environment and green transition at the New Economics Foundation"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"australia-news/2019/aug/21/coles-signs-long-term-contract-for-electricity-from-three-new-solar-farms","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2019-08-20T18:00:47Z","webTitle":"Coles signs long-term contract for electricity from three new solar farms","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/aug/21/coles-signs-long-term-contract-for-electricity-from-three-new-solar-farms","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2019/aug/21/coles-signs-long-term-contract-for-electricity-from-three-new-solar-farms","fields":{"headline":"Coles signs long-term contract for electricity from three new solar farms","bodyText":"Supermarket giant Coles has signed a long-term contract to get electricity from three new solar farms, the latest in a series of companies that have turned to renewable energy to lower power bills. It comes as a group of 41 retailers and businesses including Bunnings, Harvey Norman, Ikea and JB Hi-Fi plan an unprecedented joint electricity purchase in a bid to reduce costs. Coles announced a 10-year deal to buy most of the electricity generated at three new solar farms to be built outside Wagga Wagga, Corowa and Junee in NSW. The plants will be operated by global clean energy company Metka EGN and are expected to provide the equivalent of 10% of Coles’ power needs from June next year. Steven Cain, Coles Group’s chief executive, said the company was committed to being the most sustainable supermarket in Australia. It had spent more than $40m on energy efficiency over two years and installed solar panels on 30 stores, with another 38 to follow this financial year. The supermarket agreement follows a similar announcement on Monday by Molycop, a manufacturer for mining and rail companies, that it had signed an 11-year-deal to take electricity from a separate solar farm near Wagga and the Sapphire wind farm in northern NSW to help it limit the impact of rising power prices. Consultants Energetics say corporate power purchase agreements have supported about 3700 megawatts of clean energy since 2016, more than 80% of which have been new developments. About half of the projects underpinned by big business have been large-scale solar, 40% wind and just under 10% a mix of the two. Companies to have signed renewable energy contracts include the Commonwealth Bank, Bluescope Steel, Telstra and zinc refiner Sun Metals. While there is uncertainty over whether the clean energy boom of the past two years will continue, Kane Thornton, chief executive of industry group the Clean Energy Council, said the falling cost of solar and wind energy suggested deals would continue to be signed. “We’re just going to see more and more businesses got it alone or join consortia to provide their power and the economics says more and more that will be renewables,” he said. The group of 41 retailers, also including Officeworks, Chemist Warehouse, Costco and Spotlight, have applied to the consumer watchdog for approval to ask for tenders to supply their power needs, which adds up to 0.5% of the total electricity drawn from the national grid. Lodged on behalf of the businesses by the Large Format Retail Association, the application to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission does not say the electricity would be renewable, but it cites two previous large-scale clean energy bulk buys, by the South Australian Chamber of Mines and Energy and the City of Melbourne, as evidence of why the application should be approved. It says the consortium could expand to include other companies, but would not make up more than 1% of electricity use, and could lead to investment in new generation while lowering power bills for member companies. Tony Wood, energy program director with thinktank the Grattan Institute, said the joint bid illustrated the frustration businesses felt about high electricity prices, which have been linked to the lack of a coherent national energy policy. Lindsay Soutar, a campaigner with Greenpeace, said the Coles deal was a “great first step” and showed companies were now leading the way on a transition to 100% renewable energy. “People have the choice to support the businesses that are doing their part in enabling a safe and healthy climate,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2020/feb/18/researchers-claim-solar-efficiency-breakthrough-for-flexible-skin","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2020-02-17T16:30:02Z","webTitle":"Researchers claim solar efficiency breakthrough for flexible 'skin'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/18/researchers-claim-solar-efficiency-breakthrough-for-flexible-skin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2020/feb/18/researchers-claim-solar-efficiency-breakthrough-for-flexible-skin","fields":{"headline":"Researchers claim solar efficiency breakthrough for flexible 'skin'","bodyText":"A flexible solar “skin” that could be used to generate power on homes, cars and phones is a step closer to development after the technology was used to break a world record for electricity conversion, researchers say. Engineers at the University of Queensland have been working with nanoparticles known as quantum dots that pass electrons and generate an electrical current when exposed to solar energy. The dots can be printed on flexible sheets that have the potential to be used as a transparent skin to power devices including mobile phones and electric vehicles, and applied to windows and other surfaces. Lianzhou Wang, an Australian Research Council laureate fellow in materials engineering, and a team of researchers have broken the world record for the conversion of solar energy into electricity using these quantum dots. The previous record efficiency for converting sunshine into electricity using quantum dot solar cells was 13.4%. The university said Wang and his team had increased that to 16.6%. It has been recognised as a record by the US National Energy Research Laboratory. Wang said the improvement of nearly 25% was a significant step towards the technology becoming commercially viable and supporting global efforts to cut carbon dioxide emissions. “It is effectively the difference between quantum dot solar cell technology being an exciting prospect and being commercially viable,” he said. Wang said advantages of the technology compared to traditional solar cell technology included it being lightweight, flexible and able to work in weaker light, such as on cloudy days or under indoor lighting. He said it could be used for a range of applications, including cars and wearable technology, and was relatively cheap to produce. His team aims to increase the conversion efficiency to 20% and scale up the printing process to produce large solar cells. “Our immediate target is to try to further break the world record in this category,” Wang said. He said they hoped to develop a product that could be brought to market for small appliances, such as a phone, within two years, and within three to five years for large-scale power compatible with rooftop solar. Simon Holmes à Court, a senior advisor to the Energy Transition Hub at the University of Melbourne, said the technology would have to be cheaper and have a smaller environmental footprint than existing solar options to be successful. “There’s always a long list of reputed benefits for this kind of thing, but 99.9% of solar from here on goes either on people’s roofs or in fields in big solar farms,” he said. The chief executive of the Smart Energy Council, John Grimes, said a lot of work had been done to try to come up with ways to make solar technology ubiquitous. He said traditional, silicon-based solar technologies were limited by being “fixed and brittle”. “There’s a huge potential market for this type of application,” he said. “At 16.6% [efficiency], that’s really exciting. The solar most people have on their roof today is 19%.” Grimes said existing silicon solar cells were already very cheap, making it a challenge for any new technology wanting to enter the market. “It’s a question of getting the economics right. If they can do that it’s a fantastic development.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2020/sep/10/uk-climate-assembly-economic-recovery-from-covid-must-tackle-global-heating","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2020-09-10T06:59:14Z","webTitle":"UK climate assembly: tax frequent flyers and ban SUVs as part of Covid recovery","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/10/uk-climate-assembly-economic-recovery-from-covid-must-tackle-global-heating","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2020/sep/10/uk-climate-assembly-economic-recovery-from-covid-must-tackle-global-heating","fields":{"headline":"UK climate assembly: tax frequent flyers and ban SUVs as part of Covid recovery","bodyText":"The first UK climate assembly made up of members of the public is calling for a tax on frequent flyers, a ban on selling SUVs and a cut in meat consumption as part of the Covid-19 economic recovery. The assembly was made up of 108 people from all walks of life, who took part in meetings to discuss reducing greenhouse gas emissions. A final report of the assembly said recovering from Covid-19 should be used as an opportunity to hit net zero carbon emissions and drive different lifestyles to tackle the climate crisis, including a frequent flyers tax and a reduction in meat and dairy consumption. A large majority, 79% of the assembly, strongly agreed, or agreed, that economic recovery after the pandemic must be designed to help drive the country to its 2050 net zero target, which was signed into law last year. These steps should include limits or conditions on investment in high carbon industries, and government encouragement for lifestyles to become more compatible with reaching net zero. The assembly, which met for 6,000 hours across six weekends over 2020, said strong and clear leadership was needed. “Leadership to forge a cross-party consensus that allows for certainty, long-term planning and a phased transition,” the report, published on Thursday, said. “This is not the time nor the issue for scoring party political points.” The assembly examined key areas which need to be addressed, with four experts guiding the members of the public in their decision-making. . It is similar to the model adopted in France by Emmanuel Macron. Key recommendations in the report included: Frequent flyer tax for individuals who fly furthest and most often. Increased government investment in low carbon buses and trains. An early shift to electric vehicles. An urgent ban on selling heavily polluting vehicles such as SUVs. Grants for people to buy low-carbon cars. A reduction in the amount we use cars by 2–5% per decade. Making wind and solar energy a key part of how the UK reaches net zero. Greater reliance on local produce and local food production. A change in diet – driven by education – to reduce meat and dairy consumption by between 20% and 40%. Parliament agreed in June 2019, when Theresa May was prime minister, to set in law a commitment to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050. But a recent report by the Institute for Government said the UK government had not yet confronted the scale of the task. “Meeting the commitment is a more difficult challenge than responding to the coronavirus crisis or getting Brexit done, and will require transformations in every sector of the UK economy, sustained investment over three decades and substantial changes to everyone’s lives,” the report said. In its final recommendations, the UK climate assembly said there were key themes for the country as it moved towards net zero. Education and information about climate change and the steps to tackle it was needed for individuals, businesses, government and others. And any measures taken to cut emissions needed to be applied fairly. “Fair to people with jobs in different sectors. Fair to people with different incomes, travel preferences and housing arrangements. Fair to people who live in different parts of the UK,” the assembly said. It also called for freedom and choice for individuals and local areas to be embedded in the solutions to cut emissions and said tackling climate change could be beneficial for local communities, high streets and local businesses and boost the economy, promote innovation, improve health and reduce pollution. Chairs of the six parliamentary select committees that commissioned the assembly report have written to the prime minister, urging him to ensure that the government acts on the recommendations of Climate Assembly UK by “showing leadership at the very highest level of government” ahead of the UK hosting the UN climate summit, COP26, in November 2021. Darren Jones MP, chair of the business, energy and industrial strategy select committee, said: “The range of voices within these pages reflect our population. The fact that assembly members have been able to arrive at clear recommendations whilst respecting each others’ values and experiences sets an example for us all. “Participants speak of their learning, how they clarified their views and their respect for each other’s perspectives, even when they didn’t agree. Their voices are front and centre, just as they should be.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2020/may/20/coronavirus-fallout-to-slow-global-growth-in-renewable-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2020-05-20T05:00:18Z","webTitle":"Coronavirus fallout to slow global growth in renewable energy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/20/coronavirus-fallout-to-slow-global-growth-in-renewable-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2020/may/20/coronavirus-fallout-to-slow-global-growth-in-renewable-energy","fields":{"headline":"Coronavirus fallout to slow global growth in renewable energy","bodyText":"The global growth of renewable energy will slow for the first time in 20 years due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, which will “hurt but not halt” the rise of clean energy. The world’s energy watchdog has warned that developers will build fewer wind farms and solar energy projects this year compared with a record roll out of renewables in 2019. But a rebound is possible in 2021, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), if critical government decisions made within the next few months support a green economic recovery from the pandemic. New figures from the IEA predict that the world will grow its capacity of renewable energy by 6% or 167 GW this year. The forecast growth is 13% less than the amount of new capacity which started up in 2019. The slowdown is likely to be more severe in Europe. The IEA expects the amount of new renewable energy rolling out this year to fall by a third to its lowest annual growth rate since 1996. “Countries are continuing to build new wind turbines and solar plants, but at a much slower pace,” said Fatih Birol, the IEA’s executive director. “Governments must not lose sight of the essential task of stepping up clean energy transitions to enable us to emerge from the crisis on a secure and sustainable path.” Birol said the resilience of the renewables industry cannot be taken for granted, and warned governments against reining in clean energy spending to weather the looming economic crisis wrought by the coronavirus. “The continued decline in renewable energy costs alone will not be enough to shelter the industry from the current crisis. In my view the role of governments is more important than ever,” he said. “The decisions they make in the next few months will be a critical factor for the future of new renewable energy capacity build.” The UK government has promised to move ahead with an auction for renewable energy subsidy contracts next spring which will include bids from onshore wind and solar projects for the first time since the government lifted a block on financial support put in place four years ago. “Many countries are now hesitating,” Birol said. “But if [support schemes] are postponed or cancelled it will be a serious hit for the growth of renewables, which we need badly to meet our climate goals.” The renewable energy industry will be the most resilient energy source through the Covid-19 pandemic, according to the IEA’s figures which predict that the impact of the virus will wipe out the growth in fossil fuel demand this year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2020/may/22/renewable-energy-may-be-switched-off-as-demand-plummets","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2020-05-22T05:21:02Z","webTitle":"Renewable energy may be switched off as demand plummets","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/22/renewable-energy-may-be-switched-off-as-demand-plummets","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2020/may/22/renewable-energy-may-be-switched-off-as-demand-plummets","fields":{"headline":"Renewable energy may be switched off as demand plummets","bodyText":"Hundreds of renewable energy projects may be asked to turn off this weekend to avoid overloading the grid as the UK’s electricity demand plummets to record lows. Britain’s demand for electricity is forecast to tumble to a fifth below normal levels due to the spring bank holiday and the shutdown of shops, bars and restaurants mandated by the coronavirus lockdown. National Grid is braced for electricity demand to fall to 15.6GW on Saturday afternoon – a level usually associated with the middle of the night – and continue to drop even lower in the early hours of Sunday morning. Meanwhile, the sunny weather is expected to generate more renewable electricity than the UK needs. “Bank holidays see reduced demand for electricity, and even more so with the current lockdown measures in place,” said Amy Weltevreden, a manager at the energy system operator. The National Grid control room plans to use a new scheme this weekend that will pay small wind turbines and solar installations to stop generating electricity if the UK’s renewable energy sources threaten to overwhelm the energy system. About 170 small-scale renewable energy generators have signed up to the scheme, with a total capacity of 2.4GW. This includes 1.5GW of wind power and 700MW of solar energy. Other companies have also signed up to boost their electricity use when demand falls too low. “If we’re anticipating the wind blowing at a given time when we’re also expecting low demand, we’re now able to instruct these smaller-scale distributed generators to reduce output to help balance the system,” Weltevreden said. “Much of the renewable electricity generated in Great Britain comes from these smaller units – what we call distributed or embedded generation. Because they’re not connected directly to our transmission system, in the past we haven’t had as much ability to control the power they’re producing to balance the grid.” National Grid warned last month that the low demand for electricity could mean that renewable energy is turned off to avoid overloading the grid with more electricity than the UK can use. Roisin Quinn, head of National Grid’s control room, said: “The assumption will be that lower demand makes it easier for us to do our job, with less power needed overall and therefore less stress on the system. In fact, as system operator, it’s just as important for us to manage lower demand for electricity as it is to manage the peaks.” Electricity demand fell to record lows of 15.2GW over the Easter weekend, well below National Grid’s forecast lows of 17.6GW for this summer."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2021/apr/19/monday-briefing-super-league","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2021-04-19T05:30:22Z","webTitle":"Monday briefing: Fury at plot to split football ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/19/monday-briefing-super-league","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2021/apr/19/monday-briefing-super-league","fields":{"headline":"Monday briefing: Fury at plot to split football ","bodyText":"Top story: ‘Walk away before irreparable damage is done’ Hello, Warren Murray here to help you get your week started. Football has been thrown into turmoil after plans were confirmed last night for the European Super League, with six English clubs – Manchester City, Manchester United, Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham – joining the breakaway competition alongside three each from Italy and Spain. Boris Johnson and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, condemned proposals that were met with widespread criticism from around the continent. Organisers have announced they want to begin the competition in August. The plan threatens not only the future of the Champions League but could have a seismic impact on the entire structure of the club game. In England the Premier League urged clubs “to walk away immediately before irreparable damage is done”. The former Manchester United and England defender Gary Neville reacted furiously on Sky Sports: “I’m disgusted with Manchester United and Liverpool the most,” he said, adding the Premier League should “deduct them all points, put them at the bottom of the league, and take their money off them”. The league would be structured around midweek fixtures with all participating clubs hoping to still compete in their respective national leagues. The big German and French clubs have so far said they they are not interested in joining.

The government-guaranteed scheme is intended to help people with small deposits on to the housing ladder. Rightmove said the average asking price jumped by 2.1% in April to a new all-time high of £327,797, an increase of £6,733 from March. The surge was driven by a shortage of houses on the market, as the pandemic drives families to search for more spacious properties away from cities where they can work from home. Some potential sellers are also holding off until they have been vaccinated, agents say. * * * Props to Mars – In a few hours Nasa is due to attempt the first powered, controlled aircraft flight on another planet. If all goes to plan the Ingenuity drone helicopter carried to Mars by the Perseverance rover mission will start its propellers, take off, hover, rotate and land again, in the first of what are planned to be several flights. Because the Mars atmosphere is just 1% as dense as Earth’s, Ingenuity’s rotor blades are four feet long and spin more rapidly than would be needed here. It has only ever been tested in Nasa’s vacuum chambers. * * * Oil giants less green than their ads – Big fossil fuel companies have used advertising to greenwash how they contribute to the climate crisis, according to files published by the environmental lawyers ClientEarth. The files compare adverts produced by ExxonMobil, Aramco, Chevron, Shell, Equinor and others with the companies’ operations and products, overall climate impact and progress toward climate-safe business models. ClientEarth is calling on policymakers to ban all fossil fuel company ads unless they come with tobacco-style health warnings about the risks of global heating. Shell and Chevron defended their climate goals, with the latter saying it engages in “honest conversations about the energy transition”. * * * Cuba after the Castros – Raúl Castro’s announcement on Friday that he is to retire and bring 62 years of Castro rule to a close caused barely a ripple on the island, even if it sent waves around the world. “I don’t think there will be any significant changes in the near future,” said one man. “Not as long as the old guard casts its shadow and influence on Cuban politics.” For Cubans, the priority remains food. Donald Trump derailed Castro’s 2016 detente with the Obama administration and even hard-nosed business people have been surprised at Joe Biden’s refusal to reverse Trump’s course. A rally against “the US blockade” took place in Havana recently. It is all but certain that Raúl Castro will be replaced as the party’s supremely powerful first secretary by Miguel Díaz Canel, the 60-year-old, white male president. * * * Retail art – Its “essential” products will include toilet roll, teabags, washing-up liquid, passata and gin – but not as we know them. England’s museums and galleries can’t reopen until after 17 May, but shops can open. So the Design Museum in London will this week reopen its shop as a supermarket, selling a range of products with packaging designed by emerging artists. Open for just five days, the redesigned shop will sell the products at similar prices to a supermarket. They include a kidney beans tin designed by Kentara Okwara (70p), a porridge oat jar by Amy Warrall (£1.10), toilet roll by Michaela Yearwood-Dan (50p), a rice box by Joey Yu (£2), and washing-up liquid by Jess Warby (£2).

Vaccines pending, much of normal life will return and the economy can recover even more quickly than predicted by the Bank of England and the Treasury’s independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility. While bedding in a Brexit deal will prove to be difficult in the weeks and months after 1 January, there is the prospect of businesses beginning to see through the fog of uncertainty that has clouded the past four years. Britain has a vibrant business culture and there are many small and medium-sized companies that want to expand, make a profit and employ more people, not least in the digital space that has widened and deepened in the past year as online purchases have replaced face-to-face transactions during the pandemic. As one of the most digitally savvy countries in the world, the UK is well placed to compete for new business across the globe, even with the crippling disadvantage of being outside the single market and customs union of our nearest trading bloc. That said, there are many restraints on Britain’s prospects. One that has been highlighted by the International Monetary Fund is the high level of debt sitting on the balance sheets of UK corporations, government – local and central – and its low-income consumers. The UK was among eight leading countries that the IMF said played host to corporations with debts that were so huge they would struggle to finance them should there ever be a major recession. The current low rate of interest within the eight countries (including the UK, US, Germany and Japan) has encouraged businesses to increase their borrowing, often to finance payouts to shareholders rather than investment, to a point where 40% of the corporate debt pile – some £15tn – would be impossible to service if there were a downturn half as serious as that of a decade ago. Government debt in the UK has also risen, mostly to support the economy during the pandemic, just when Boris Johnson and his ministers wanted to increase spending to fix many of the problems made worse by 10 years of austerity. With a bill for the pandemic that will stretch over the next few years, the government faces the prospect of the overall debt to GDP ratio increasing from the 105% predicted for this financial year to 120% and beyond if austerity is to be reversed. If this wasn’t bad enough, the pandemic has forced millions of low- and middle-income earners to borrow to keep their finances afloat. Aggregate figures for the UK disguise a widening gap between those with and without loans. Mortgage borrowing, for instance, is not at high levels historically, but is increasingly concentrated in a relatively small group of younger households while those over the age of 60, if they are not renting, own their home outright. Likewise, Bank of England figures for consumer borrowing almost disguise more than they illuminate, and a casual glance at the overall figures would leave the chancellor neither shaken nor stirred. Yet the UK’s debt charities have warned of a borrowing frenzy by those with the weakest finances, putting a ticking time bomb under the large number of households that spend every penny they earn, and are therefore crucial to the recovery of the economy. In an age of anxiety, when the threat of disease combines with a longer-term fear arising from a loss of competitiveness and skilled private sector jobs, these issues will be tricky for any government to manage. That the government should borrow extra funds to get the economy back on track is clear. That it is capable of borrowing wisely, and for a greener future, is in doubt. Tesla’s a big name now, but powerful rivals are ready to roll Tesla’s belated inclusion in the S&amp;P 500 index last week was a rubber-stamp for the electric car pioneer’s arrival in the upper echelons of the US corporate world – as if confirmation were needed for a company that has shaken the global automotive industry from its reliance on fossil fuels. Shortly before Tesla’s entry, its shares hit a high of $695 (£518), valuing the company at north of $650bn. A retreat in the week since has put that at closer to $600bn. That puts its value at more than the next seven largest carmakers combined, despite planning to produce a small fraction of the volume of vehicles its rivals churn out every year. For those looking at whether the run can continue, there are some ominous signs. Among the reasons for the shares retreating in the past week was a report that Apple, another of the S&amp;P 500’s heavyweights, was hoping to bring out an electric car in 2024. Reuters reported that Apple’s car would bring self-driving capabilities and significant battery advances. That would be quite an about-face for Tim Cook. Tesla’s brash boss, Elon Musk, says his Apple counterpart turned down the chance to buy the carmaker when it neared bankruptcy – probably in 2017. Competition from Apple is enough to give even the most bullish Tesla analyst pause. But even without that, the current sky-high Tesla valuations are based on optimism over its autonomous driving systems and solar energy business. Those are two highly competitive and fast-developing fields. Tesla has built up an undeniable lead in battery electric cars, and the impressive fundraising abilities that go with its huge valuation give it a good chance of defending its position. However, the Apple rumours point to an uncomfortable truth about electric car manufacturing: the hardware barriers to entry are much lower than before, and the software battle has barely even begun. Bond gives MGM a licence to make a killing in the content wars So it turns out that even uncompromising super-spy James Bond has his price. MGM, the Hollywood studio behind the mega-franchise, is in the market for a buyer, touting a potential price tag of $5.5bn (£4.1bn). Only a decade ago MGM, once a Hollywood superpower boasting a library of titles from Gone with the Wind and Ben Hur to the Rocky franchise, was forced into bankruptcy with a debt burden of $4bn. Fast-forward to the Netflix-propelled era of the streaming wars and content owners have become kings, able to command sky-high prices to license, or sell, their products. And the evergreen Bond franchise, now on its 25th instalment (delayed until April in the hope of avoiding pandemic restrictions), has a global fanbase few can match. MGM began to sniff out potential buyers at the beginning of the year, holding preliminary talks with Apple and Netflix, among others, before the effort fizzled out. But since then a new generation of deep-pocketed streaming competitors, from Disney+ and Apple TV+ to HBO Max, are fuelling a renewed wave of content hyper-inflation. This month, Disney said its streaming service was doing so well – racing to more than 73 million subscribers in a year, putting it behind only Amazon and Netflix – that it had moved to more than triple its subscriber target and double annual content spending to $15bn by 2024. MGM has been quietly building value, making $1bn in TV and film revenues last year. And it is broadening a perceived over-dependency on Bond, with Rocky spin-off Creed proving a film franchise success as well as TV hits such as The Handmaid’s Tale. Timing is everything: MGM is banking on now being the moment to cash in on its library of 4,000 film titles and 17,000 hours of TV programming."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2022/jun/15/ecb-meets-discuss-bond-rout-markets-tenterhooks-dollar-20-year-peak-fed-rate-decision-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-06-15T13:56:39Z","webTitle":"ECB to devise new tool to help indebted countries as markets await Fed rate rise – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2022/jun/15/ecb-meets-discuss-bond-rout-markets-tenterhooks-dollar-20-year-peak-fed-rate-decision-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2022/jun/15/ecb-meets-discuss-bond-rout-markets-tenterhooks-dollar-20-year-peak-fed-rate-decision-business-live","fields":{"headline":"ECB to devise new tool to help indebted countries as markets await Fed rate rise – as it happened","bodyText":"European stock markets are rallying and Italian, Spanish and Greek bond yields fell sharply, as the European Central Bank announced it would skew reinvestments of maturing debt to help more indebted countries. It will also devise a new instrument to tackle “fragmentation” of the bond market. Wall Street also opened higher, ahead of the eagerly-awaited rate decision from the US Federal Reserve at 7pm BST, followed by a press conference with Fed president Jerome Powell. America’s central bank is expected to raise rates from 1% by at least 0.50 percentage points, or even 0.75 percentage points (which would be the biggest rate hike since 1994), to tackle soaring inflation, although there are also fears that the economy could tip into recession. Today’s other main stories: Network Rail said there was “no real hope” of avoiding the biggest railway strike in 30 years next week, as it told passengers to plan ahead and only travel if necessary. The full timetable will be published on Friday but operators including Southern, Northern, TransPennine and Transport for Wales have already told passengers not to attempt to travel on strike days. The Japanese owner of the British chip designer Arm is reportedly planning to float some of the company’s shares in London, in a sign the government’s efforts to lobby for a UK listing of the Cambridge-based company may have succeeded. SoftBank, which bought the chip company for $32bn in 2016, is said to be reconsidering earlier plans to only list shares on the US market. The “bloodbath” in the cryptocurrency sector may claim another victim, with the co-founder of multibillion dollar hedge fund Three Arrows Capital using Twitter in an attempt to battle rumours that the company is insolvent following the market collapse. Customers of the collapsed fast fashion retailer Missguided will not receive refunds for returns, administrators of the business have confirmed. It comes after the Manchester-based company fell into insolvency last month after racking up millions of pounds in outstanding payments to creditors. Bloomsbury has reported a record year for sales, as the Harry Potter publisher said the increase in reading during the pandemic had become “permanent” after lockdowns eased. The company benefited substantially from Covid restrictions when homebound consumers turned to new hobbies, including reading, to pass the time. Moments after he was announced as the government’s new “cost of living business tsar”, David Buttress, the multimillionaire co-founder and former chief executive of takeaway app company Just Eat, went out into his garden and inspected one of his chickens’ bottom. “Long busy day with some great meetings,” Buttress tweeted on Monday night. “But always great to get home to the real world and ‘dad the chicken isn’t well can you go and check it’s [sic] bum’… keeping it real.” Australia’s main wholesale electricity market has been suspended by regulators in the latest sign that the crisis threatening the stability of energy supplies is deepening. The Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo) took the drastic step of suspending the entire national electricity market for the first time in its history on Wednesday. Temporary silos will be built along the Ukraine border, including in Poland, in an attempt to help export more grain from the country and avert a global food crisis, Joe Biden has announced. The US president told a Philadelphia union convention on Tuesday that he was working with European governments on the plan “to help bring down food prices”. Global fossil fuel company BP has bought 40.5% of a renewable energy hub in the Pilbara, billed as having potential to become one of the biggest suppliers of green hydrogen in the world. The company will also operate the Asian Renewable Energy Hub, which has plans to generate up to 26GW of wind and solar energy – about a third of the electricity generated in Australia today. My colleague in the US, Dominic Rushe, will cover the US rate decision tonight. Thank you for reading. We’ll be back tomorrow. Bye! Here’s some reaction to the surprise 0.3% drop in US retail sales in May. Andrew Hunter, senior US economist at Capital Economics, said: The 0.3% m/m fall in retail sales in May and downward revisions to previous months’ gains suggest that surging prices might finally be taking their toll on real consumption. But with the latter still on course for solid growth of 3% annualised in the second quarter, that won’t stop the Fed from accelerating the pace of policy tightening later today. Headline retail sales were dragged lower by a 3.5% m/m slump in auto sales last month, but that drop reflects the impact of China’s zero-covid lockdowns on Asian manufacturers rather than weakening demand. That decline was partly offset by the price-related 4% rise in nominal gasoline station sales. Factoring in the surge in prices last month, the data suggest that overall real consumption edged slightly lower in May and, with prices likely to see another strong rise in June, a rebound in real spending looks unlikely. That suggests second-quarter real consumption growth will be closer to 3% annualised, rather than the 4% we had previously pencilled in. But 3% real growth is still a respectable performance, and a long way from the collapse being predicted by the usual bearish suspects. The upshot is that there is little to stop the Fed taking more aggressive action to tackle rampant inflation over the next few months. Wall Street has opened higher ahead of the Federal Reserve’s rate decision. The Fed is expected to hike rates from 1% by at least 0.50 percentage points, possibly even by 0.75 percentage points. Dow Jones up 206 points, or 0.7%, to 30,570 S&amp;P 500 up 28 points, or 0.8%, at 3,746 Nasdaq up 140 points, or 1.3%, at 10,968 The European markets have rallied today, boosted by the European Central Bank’s surprise meeting to discuss ways of calming bond markets, and helping more indebted nations like Italy, Spain and Greece. UK’s FTSE 100 up 103 points, or 1.4%, at 7,291 Germany’s Dax up 216 points, or 1.6%, at 13,520 France’s CAC up 86 points, or 1.46%, at 6,036 Italy’s FTSE MiB up 650 points, or nearly 3%, at 22,496 In the US, retail sales fell unexpectedly last month, dragged down by a decline in car purchases. Sales were down 0.3% in May from April, disappointing economists who had expected a small rise of 0.1% or 0.2%, and following a downwardly revised gain of 0.7% in April. The European Central Bank said after a rare unscheduled meeting that it will tilt reinvestments of maturing debt to help more indebted countries, and will devise a new instrument to tackle “fragmentation” of the bond market. Government bond yields have soared across the 19-country currency bloc, especially in southern nations like Italy, Spain and Greece, raising government borrowing costs, since the ECB set out plans last Thursday to raise interest rates in July and September to tame soaring inflation. Here is the full statement: Today the Governing Council met to exchange views on the current market situation. Since the gradual process of policy normalisation was initiated in December 2021, the Governing Council has pledged to act against resurgent fragmentation risks. The pandemic has left lasting vulnerabilities in the euro area economy which are indeed contributing to the uneven transmission of the normalisation of our monetary policy across jurisdictions. Based on this assessment, the Governing Council decided that it will apply flexibility in reinvesting redemptions coming due in the PEPP portfolio, with a view to preserving the functioning of the monetary policy transmission mechanism, a precondition for the ECB to be able to deliver on its price stability mandate. In addition, the Governing Council decided to mandate the relevant Eurosystem Committees together with the ECB services to accelerate the completion of the design of a new anti-fragmentation instrument for consideration by the Governing Council. The pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) was launched in March 2020 and ended recently. Italian 10-year bond yields surged to 4.27% on Tuesday, the highest since early 2014, putting them 250 basis points above 10-year German government bonds, but fell back below 4% today ahead of the ECB meeting. The Italian 10-year bond yield has fallen back even more, and is now down 31 basis points on the day at 3.91%, as the ECB is holding an impromptu meeting to discuss possible action to calm bond markets. Time for a lunchtime summary. European stock markets are rallying as the European Central Bank’s governing council is holding an unscheduled two-hour meeting in Frankfurt to discuss the turmoil in bond markets. Government bonds sold off in recent days, driving yields higher, thereby making it more expensive for governments to borrow, especially in Italy and other southern, more indebted countries. The Italian stock market led the rally, up 2.6%, while the UK and German indices rose more than 1% and the French market was up 0.9%. There was relief in bond markets, with the yield on the Italian 10-year bond falling 26 basis points to 3.95%, down from eight-year highs. The question is what the ECB can do. Analysts think the ECB will use an existing tool, for example reinvesting maturing bonds, to stabilise bond markets, rather than announcing a new tool. Spanish and Portuguese bond yields fell by around 13 basis points while Greek yields declined by 25bps to 4.4% in their biggest daily fall since March 2020. The euro rose 0.67% to $1.0482 against the dollar, while the pound also recovered after falling below $1.20 yesterday for the first time since March 2020. Sterling is trading 0.85% higher at $1.2095 at the moment. Investors are also awaiting the US Federal Reserve interest rate decision, to be announced at 7pm BST. The Fed has signalled that it will raise rates again from their current level of 1%; the question is by how much -- 0.50 percentage points or 0.75 percentage points ? To tackle sky-high inflation. Global oil demand is set to rise by 2% to a record high of 101.6m barrels per day in 2023, surpassing pre-pandemic levels, the Paris-based International Energy Agency forecast today -- although it also warned that high oil prices (Brent crude is currently at $120 a barrel) and a weaker economic outlook would weigh on oil demand in coming months. Economic fears persist, as various international institutions have recently released downbeat outlooks. Similarly, tightening central bank policy, the impact of a soaring US dollar and rising interest rates on the purchasing power of emerging economies mean the risks to our outlook are concentrated on the downside. Bert Colijn, senior eurozone economist at ING, said: As we await the outcome of the European Central Bank’s unscheduled meeting to discuss ‘current market conditions’, we take in some of the latest data on the economy. The ECB has committed to hikes in July and September to stave off high inflation, but the eurozone economy itself remains weak at best at the moment. Industrial production data for April confirms this as the increase of 0.4% leaves production below the first quarter average. The small increase was driven by most of the larger countries with Germany, Spain, Italy, and the Netherlands all seeing production grow faster than average. France saw a small decline of -0.1%. Across production categories, only capital goods production shrank a little while most of the others improved. Overall, the environment for industry remains lacklustre. It is still dealing with large amounts of backlogs that guarantee production for the months ahead, but supply chain problems continue to cause delays for certain product groups. At the same time, demand is weakening as new orders are falling according to the most recent surveys on eurozone industry. Input price inflation, which is barely abating, adds to the squeeze that manufacturing businesses find themselves in for now. In addition to industry data, trade data has also just been released. The trade in goods balance dropped much more than expected to -31.7 billion on a seasonally adjusted basis. The trade balance has deteriorated quickly thanks to high energy prices due to the war and this adds to euro weakness right now. Returning to the European Central Bank’s surprise meeting (which was due to start at 11am local time in Frankfurt and last two hours) to discuss the recent sell-off in bond markets... Analysts at Daiwa said: To give a flavour as to what to expect from the Governing Council today, yesterday evening the Executive Board’s key hawk Isabel Schnabel echoed recent comments by [president] Christine Lagarde that the ECB has “no limits” to tackle bond market fragmentation risks. She also insisted that the ECB “will not tolerate changes in financing conditions that go beyond fundamental factors”, and “monetary policy can and should respond to a disorderly repricing of risk premia that impairs the transmission of monetary policy”. But she added “How we ultimately react… will firmly depend on the situation we are facing”, suggesting no willingness to give any information about its reaction function in advance. So, expect a similar message to Schnabel’s to be endorsed by the whole Governing Council today. That might provide a modicum of reassurance to markets. But no new policy tool will be unveiled. Indeed, the Governing Council will reportedly focus discussions on the mechanics of how PEPP [pandemic emergency purchase programme] reinvestments – a relatively modest instrument – can be deployed to support strained markets, while leaving the door open to the possibility that new tools can be developed flexibly in future if necessary. So, the markets will be left in the dark as to whether, for example, any substantive conditionality would be attached to any new ECB support – additional to reinvestments – for strained sovereigns. And markets should also assume that any support forthcoming would be concentrated largely at the shorter end of the yield curve, which is most relevant for the monetary transmssion mechanism, rather than at the longer end. (Christine Lagarde is also currently scheduled to talk publicly this evening, but it remains to be seen whether that appointment will be fulfilled.) The ECB will certainly not adjust its commitment to raise rates by 25bps in July and probably more in September. However, it could try to push back somewhat against expectations that aggressive tightening is likely in Q4 and beyond, which a lower trajectory for rates seeming appropriate if the ECB now sees a greater risk that Fed tightening will push the US (and perhaps the world economy) into recession next year. The eurozone’s trade deficit with the rest of the world almost doubled in April from the previous month, after a record expansion in March, while industrial production expanded, official figures show. The 19 countries sharing the euro ran up a trade deficit of €32.4bn in April, up sharply from €16.4bn in March, according to the EU’s statistics office Eurostat. It compares with a surplus of €14.9bn in April 2021. Exports rose 12.6% from a year earlier but imports jumped 39.4%, driven by a surge in energy imports. Meanwhile, industrial production in the eurozone rose 0.4% in April from March, a modest rise. Whitbread is among the main risers on the FTSE 100, after the owner of Premier Inn and pub restaurants traded ahead of expectations in the UK and Germany. The shares rose 4.7%. Premier Inn is the UK’s biggest budget hotel chain and competes mainly with Travelodge. It is struggling to recruit more staff, and is investing up to £30m in pay rises, IT and hotel refurbishments this year. Chief executive Alison Brittain said: The strength of Premier Inn’s recovery in the UK continues to be ahead of expectations with a particularly strong first-quarter performance that is well ahead of pre-pandemic levels and we continue to significantly outperform the market. Labour supply remains tight across the hospitality sector and assuming that consumer demand and occupancy remain strong, we expect some additional costs due to targeted pay increases. We are also taking the opportunity to bring forward our investment in refurbishments and maintenance projects as well as accelerate some additional IT spend that will underpin our market leading position and drive future earnings. WH Smith is similarly upbeat, as its third-quarter revenues rose above pre-pandemic levels for the first time, with more people travelling to work and a surge in tourism. The UK retailer, which has stores on high streets, at airports and railway stations, and sells a wide range of items -- from stationery, books, magazines and sandwiches to Bluetooth headphones -- expects its full-year performance to hit the higher end of analysts’ forecasts. Revenues in the 15 weeks to 11 June were ahead of 2019 levels for the first time at 107%. Neil Shah, director of research at Edison Group, said: This is a solid and promising trading update from WHSmith, with the retailer trading ahead of 2019 revenue with a particularly strong performance from its travel division, reflective of the lifting of Covid-19 restrictions. As passenger numbers recover around the world, WHSmith will look to enhance its ranges in health and beauty and technology to capitalise on post-lockdown opportunities. In other news, Bloomsbury has reported a record year for sales, as the Harry Potter publisher said the pandemic rise in reading had become “permanent” after lockdown measures eased. The company benefited substantially from Covid restrictions when homebound consumers turned to new hobbies, including reading, to pass the time, reports my colleague Kalyeena Makortoff. Bloomsbury’s chief executive, Nigel Newton, said it was clear that people who picked up a reading habit during the pandemic were continuing to buy books, helping to push annual sales up 24% to record highs of £230m for the year to the end of February. The International Energy Agency has warned that higher oil prices and recession fears will hold back global demand for oil -- while predicting that demand will recover to pre-pandemic levels next year as China’s economy bounces back. The Paris-based agency said in its monthly report: Economic fears persist, as various international institutions have recently released downbeat outlooks. Similarly, tightening central bank policy, the impact of a soaring US dollar and rising interest rates on the purchasing power of emerging economies mean the risks to our outlook are concentrated on the downside. Higher oil prices and a weaker economic outlook continue to temper our oil demand growth expectations. But in 2023, a resurgent China will boost non-OECD demand growth, offsetting a slowdown in the OECD. World oil demand is forecast to reach 101.6m barrels per day in 2023, surpassing pre-pandemic levels. Wilson added: The ECB is kind of stealing the thunder from the Fed today but the US central bank is still the major market event. A lot of banks have changed their forecasts to a 75bps hike and market pricing has move aggressively in that direction. However, I still prefer a 50bps move with the Fed maintaining optionality to do more 50bps hikes for the rest of the year – a strong signal for one in September. Ahead of the meeting the US 10-year yield rose to almost 3.5%, its highest in 11 years, whilst the 2-year yield climbed to 3.45%, a 15-year high. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, said about the ECB’s surprise meeting to discuss the recent sell-off in government bond markets: Given there was a scheduled meeting last week, it smacks of panic and a lack of control, but the market is happy to see it happen. European bank shares rose and the euro also rallied, whilst Italian yields came back down. The ECB is clearly worried that ‘peripheral’ bond yields are rising too much...but this is all a bit of a mess coming so soon after the scheduled meeting last week. Here we get to the fragmentation risk and a possible new tool we thought they might signal last week, but didn’t. The spread between Italian and German 10-year yields has widened to more than 240 basis points, the widest since March 2020 as the Italian 10-year BTP climbed over 4%. Italian yields have fallen back sharply on the ECB update this morning, however. Italian stocks rallied handsomely, too. What could the ECB do? That is the big question. The ECB could probably first reassure the market that it will do ‘whatever it takes’ to prevent fragmentation, but given this meeting has been called abruptly then it might actually feel that it needs to intervene with a new tool – perhaps a yield spread cap of some sort. Or it could reinvest cash from maturing bonds into those sovereign bond markets that need it. This would undoubtedly introduce political risk and would be challenged in the German courts, as would any new tool. Or it could just QE forever... tricky when you are supposed to be tightening financial conditions. For today it might be enough to tell the market it is working on a new tool/plan in this regard – the lack of detail last week means the Governing Council has not discussed this much and so it might be too early for a specific tool/policy to be announced – plus it has the political and legal dimension to consider too. ECB policymaker Isabel Schnabel said: “Our commitment to the euro is our anti-fragmentation tool. This commitment has no limits.” For a second time, [ECB president Christine] Lagarde has to make sure the market knows the ECB is here to close ze spreads. The fact the ECB didn’t bother with this last week is mystery and shows it is still far too complacent and unwilling to get ahead of the curve. On the commodity markets, gas prices are rising while crude oil prices are little changed. British wholesale gas for day-ahead delivery has risen more than 8% to 180p per therm. Yesterday, Russia’s state monopoly Gazprom said it was cutting natural gas supplies to Europe via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline by 40%, according to Interfax. It said its capacity to supply gas was constrained by the delayed return of equipment that had been sent for repair by Siemens Energy. Gazprom said: Due to the delayed return of gas pumping units by Siemens from repair, testing of the service life of the GPUs [gas pumping units] and identified technical malfunctions of the engines, only three GPUs can now be used at the ‘Portova’ compressor station. This has prompted Gazprom to reduce gas supplies to up to 100m cubic metres instead of the usual 167m cm. Gazprom no longer exports gas westwards through Poland via the Yamal-Europe pipeline following Russian sanctions against EuRoPol Gaz, which owns the Polish section. Flows via Yamal-Europe continue eastwards from Germany to Poland. There are also fears of liquefied natural gas shortages, after Freeport LNG, operator of one of the largest US export plants producing LNG, said it would shut for at least three weeks after an explosion at its Texas Gulf coast facility last week. Schmieding goes on to say: Mind the fundamentals: Some spread widening amid an overall rise in yields is normal. As long as it remains consistent with the inflation backdrop and the pace of nominal growth, it should not present an imminent risk even for fiscally challenged Italy. We expect inflation to settle around 2.5% eventually. Adjusting for such an inflation forecast, the real financing costs of Italy are still quite bearable. Inflation lifts tax receipts and reduces the real value of outstanding debt. Walking a tightrope to a soft landing: Engineering a soft landing for economies battered by external shocks and facing the highest inflation in decades will be as hard as it sounds for all major central banks. The extra challenge for the ECB is that its policies affect borrowing costs in 19 economies with different fundamentals. The ECB seems to believe that it can deter excessive “fragmentation” through “constructive ambiguity”, that is by simply warning markets that it may step in under unspecified circumstances. But markets hate uncertainty. They may want to test the ECB’s resolve. To contain the risk of further turmoil that may hurt confidence and economic performance across the Eurozone, the ECB needs to answer two key questions: 1) exactly what tool would it use to prevent excessive fragmentation; and 2) what is the threshold for using it? If the ECB pulls that off, it will have an easier time pursuing its ultimate goal of returning Eurozone inflation to a sustainable rate while running a lower risk of serious economic damage in doing so. Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank, explains: Periphery under pressure: Even before the European Central Bank (ECB) has hiked rates, Italian, Greek, Spanish and Portuguese spreads versus German bunds are widening amid a broad-based tightening of financial conditions across the Eurozone. With memories of the European debt crisis still fresh, investors are asking how and under what circumstances ECB president Christine Lagarde would deliver on the promise she made in her blog from 23 May to act against “excessive fragmentation” if required after the end of net asset purchases. Markets sold off after the ECB’s monetary policy statement last Thursday referred only vaguely to a “flexible” use of instruments to safeguard the transmission of monetary policy. In an emergency meeting today, the ECB may finally reveal its hand. Still far off euro crisis 2.0: The situation today is different from the euro crisis a little more than a decade ago. 1) The ECB has turned into a proper lender of last resort with a tool called “OMT” to intervene heavily for countries that are granted support from the ESM [European Stability Mechanism]. 2) Many economies have improved their trend growth through reforms. For example, Greece and Portugal are consistently outperforming the eurozone average with real GDP in Q1 2022 surpassing the pre-pandemic level Q4 2019 by 3.0% and 1.2% respectively, well ahead of the Eurozone as a whole (0.8%) and a still largely unreformed Italy (0.0%). 3) NextGenEU grants of between 5% (Italy) and 9% (Greece) of annual GDP will support public investment and growth over the next four years. 4) Italy’s spread remains well below previous crisis levels. Italian bond yields have fallen back on the news that the European Central Bank’s rate-setting governing council will hold an unscheduled meeting this morning to discuss the recent sell-off in government bonds, which had pushed yields sharply higher. Investors breathed a sigh of relief, after government borrowing costs across the eurozone jumped to multi-year highs this week -- amid growing expectations of an aggressive US interest rate hike later today, and concern about the lack of an ECB plan to tackle signs of strain in eurozone bond markets. The yield on Italy’s 10-year bond fell 20 basis points to 4%, down from eight-year highs hit this week. Spanish, Portuguese and Greek bond yields were also down sharply in early London trade. The euro rose on the news and is currently trading 0.6% higher at $1.0477 against the dollar. Frederik Ducrozet, head of macroeconomic research at Pictet Wealth Management, told Reuters: We should get a statement along the lines reflecting a willingness to act and then maybe they will also task committees to work on options, this is what was missing from last week [when the ECB had a scheduled meeting]. ECB board member Isabel Schnabel, the head of the central bank’s market operations, said yesterday that the ECB was “closely” monitoring the situation and was ready to deploy both existing and new tools if it found that the market moves were “disorderly”. And we’re off. European shares have notched up some decent gains at the open, following increases in several Asian markets (Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1% while Japan’s Nikkei edged down 0.1%). UK’s FTSE 100 up 58 points, or 0.8%, to 7,425 Germany’s Dax up 1.3% France’s CAC up 1.3% Spain’s Ibex up 1.5% Italy’s FTSE MiB up 650 points, or 2.9%, at 22,495 Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the world economy and the financial markets. Markets are on tenterhooks, and the dollar hit a 20-year peak ahead of the interest rate decision from the US Federal Reserve later today. Investors are waiting to see how aggressive America’s central bank will be in raising rates, with fears that a bigger hike could tip the economy into recession. The question is whether the Fed will raise its main interest rate, currently at 1%, by 0.50 or 0.75 percentage points to tackle soaring inflation. The latter would be the biggest increase since 1994. The dollar hit a 20-year high against a basket of currencies, and rose to 135.60 against the yen, the highest since 1998. The European Central Bank is to hold an unscheduled meeting this morning to discuss the recent sell-off in government bond markets. Bond yields have risen sharply since the ECB promised a series of rate rises last Thursday and the spread between the yields of German bonds and those of more indebted southern nations, particularly Italy, soared to the highest in more than two years. Stock markets have been plunging in recent days, and on Wall Street the benchmark S&amp;P 500 fell almost 4% into bear territory on Monday. Analysts at Goldman Sachs said: Against a backdrop of sky-high inflation, rising rates and growing recession concerns, the S&amp;P 500 has had its worst start to the year since 1962. A likely coming peak in inflation is probably not sufficient to see the bottom, and in the past similar drawdowns have only ended when the Fed has shifted towards easier policy. The pound fell yesterday to its lowest level against the dollar since the onset of the Covid pandemic amid growing concern over the strength of the British economy. It traded below $1.20 for the first time since March 2020, as the dollar strengthened, but is back above $1.20 this morning. The Bank of England is expected to raise interest rates by 0.25 percentage points on Thursday, lifting its base rate to 1.25%. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: A responsible Fed would look to wrestle back the narrative and do what it said it would do, which means we need to see 50 basis points today, with a hawkish pivot at the very least, especially if it wants to be taken seriously when it comes to future guidance. It’s also not apparent what a pivot to 75bps would achieve when the Fed could simply deliver a 50bps hike today and then throw the prospect of 75bps into the hat for July, as well as September. Given that market pricing had been for a possible pause in September that is still a hawkish pivot, and guidance tends to be half the battle when it comes to policy adjustments. As such it seems more likely we’ll see a 50bps move today, along with hawkish guidance for 75bps in July, as well as September, but very much dependant on the data. There was some good news out of China, where the economy showed signs of recovery, as industrial output grew 0.7% in May from a year earlier, after falling 2.9% in April, according to official figures released today. China’s exports grew in double digits last month, as factories cranked up again following the easing of Covid restrictions. However, consumer spending remains weak because of China’s zero-Covid policy, with full or partial lockdowns in dozens of cities in March and April. Retail sales fell 6.7% in May, an improvement from April’s 11.1% slump. Iris Pang, chief China economist at ING, said: Activity data paints an economic recovery picture in May, but only a slow one. The government is likely to respond to this economic weakness by delivering more fiscal stimulus. In Asia, stocks were mixed and European markets are expected to open slightly firmer after the better-than-expected Chinese data.

Britain has climbed the rankings of a biannual global survey of investors to take the sixth spot in EY’s “attractiveness index” for renewable energy ahead of a major clean energy auction next year. The auditing giant said the government’s decision to include onshore wind and solar energy projects in the auction had helped the UK climb one rung on the rankings list, to just below Germany, Australia, France, China and the US. The US topped the rankings for the first time since 2016 – in spite of the federal government’s ongoing support for fossil fuels – in large part due to plans to invest $57bn (£47bn) to install up to 30GW of offshore wind by 2030. China has fallen from the top of the rankings to second place as Beijing looks to wean the market off subsidies, and the coronavirus pandemic cut its growing appetite for energy. “Certainly, renewable energy is not immune to the economic disruption being wrought,” said Ben Warren, the author of EY’s report. “But many of these effects are likely to be short-term. Already, manufacturers in China and Europe are restarting production. Utilities have worked hard to keep generation going in difficult circumstances. And power demand will rebound as economies get back to work.” He said investors remain confident in “the long-term picture for clean energy”. “The need, after the pandemic, to ensure greater economic and social resilience will work in favour of distributed power sources, such as wind and solar, and the applications offered by battery storage,” he said. The UK’s decision to remove a block against onshore wind projects earlier this year followed a government pledge to cut emissions to virtually zero by 2050 – a feat that its official climate advisers believe will require a tripling of the UK’s onshore wind-power capacity in the next 15 years. Renewable energy developers are working towards the 2021 auction, despite the uncertainty created by the coronavirus pandemic, to help spur a green economic recovery once lockdown measures are lifted. Luke Clark, of RenewableUK, said EY’s report is right to highlight the economic opportunity offered by renewables after the pandemic. “Our sector’s plans to invest tens of billions of pounds in vital new energy infrastructure all over the country have not changed, and the government is supporting our work as it remains committed to reaching its legally-binding target of net zero emissions,” he said. “The UK’s low-carbon economy will stimulate new growth, boost productivity and support tens of thousands of jobs as we work on projects at home and secure new export opportunities around the world.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2019/jul/29/how-we-met-she-gave-me-what-i-call-the-electric-hug-i-felt-my-hair-stand-up","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2019-07-29T10:58:54Z","webTitle":"How we met: ‘She gave me what I call the electric hug.

She and Sue had reached the highest point on one of the highest motorable roads in the world, in the Ladakh region of northern India, and were alone for the first time. “It’s a tough bike ride to do – it’s not just a gravel path, they are like boulders,” says Kate. “So the adrenaline was flowing, but I was also chuffed because I was on my own with Sue. I was like a teenager.” They had met at a hotel in Delhi 10 days earlier, in July 2015, where nine of them had gathered for an all-women motorcycle trip. Neither made much of an impression on each other – they just got on with the trip, riding all day and meeting at hotels and camps in the evening. It was in Leh, northern India, where they had stopped for a couple of days before the final, highest leg of the journey, that Sue and Kate got talking. “We had more time to hang out, have a beer, get to know each other,” says Kate. “That was the point at which I started to think: ‘Oh bugger, I think I fancy her.’” She laughs. “Sue was adventurous, keen on biking, gorgeous. Also, she can be a bit of a tough cookie, initially, and I like a bit of a challenge. I found that mysterious and appealing. When we started chatting, she was great fun.” Sue hadn’t thought of Kate in that way, except to mention to a single friend on the trip that Kate was also single and attractive. “She is adventurous, travel-loving, smart, and she has that wonderful British wit,” says Sue, who is from the US. “And I thought she was cute.” Although it was romantic up there on that road alone – they slid down snowbanks and threw snowballs at each other – Kate didn’t make a move. “I knew Sue was single, but she hadn’t given any indicators that she was looking for anyone, or interested in me. We had started to get on really well, but I assumed that those feelings were one-sided – and if they weren’t going to be reciprocated, I didn’t want to risk spoiling the trip.” A few days later, everyone was hugging goodbye at the hotel in Delhi. Kate says: “I stood next to her thinking: ‘That can’t be the last hug – I need to do that again.’” Sue continues: “I was about to walk out the door and she comes back over and gives me what I call the electric hug. I felt the hair stand up on my head. It was such an intimate moment that I looked around thinking: ‘Did anyone see that?’ I spent the entire trip back to the airport thinking: ‘Oh my God, I think I’m attracted to Kate and I left her in India.’” Sue headed back to the US and Kate came home to the UK. They messaged each other for a couple of weeks, then started video calling; soon they were talking for several hours a day. In December 2015, Kate flew out to the US. “We’d already decided that we were going to give it a go at being a couple,” says Sue. When she picked up Kate at the airport, the feeling “was instant”, she says. Kate adds: “From that point on, it was perfect.” They had agreed that airport arrivals was not a suitably memorable place for their first kiss. “So we walked out to my car hand in hand,” Sue remembers. “And then I couldn’t wait any longer.” Kate stayed for nine days, then they began a two-year long-distance relationship, meeting up every eight weeks. When Kate left her job, she spent a couple of months in the US, where they got engaged, then applied for a visa. “After two years, I needed to know what was happening,” says Sue. “We needed to be together or starting the process of getting together, because it was just too hard.” Last year, they were married by one of the women on their motorcycle trip; another friend from the trip was maid of honour, as was Sue’s adult daughter. They are planning lots more motorcycle adventures. Want to share your story?

Here’s what we learned: Thousands gathered to commemorate the contribution of Australian defence personnel at Anzac Day dawn services across the country, with events held in major cities, suburban centres and country towns. More than 1,600 Australians attended the dawn service at Anzac Cove in Gallipoli, Türkiye – the biggest crowd of Australians at the ceremony since the Anzac centenary, according to Matt Keogh, the minister for veterans affairs and defence personnel. Work has been halted on Australia’s largest renewable energy project after a fatal truck rollover. A man aged in his 50s was behind the wheel of a Snowy 2.0 project truck when it rolled on Monday afternoon on the Snowy Mountains Highway at Dry Plain. Defence minister Richard Marles pushed back at comments from China’s foreign ministry overnight that Australia should not “hype up the so-called China threat narrative”. Marles also said the timing of the release of the defence strategic review on the day before Anzac Day was coincidental. A US citizen has faced court on customs charges after allegedly being caught with an unregistered gold-plated handgun in her luggage at Sydney airport. The Indigenous Australians minister, Linda Burney, told a crowd at the Anzac Day ceremony that Australians should not to forget the frontier wars committed against Indigenous communities during Britain’s colonisation. The independent senator Lidia Thorpe claims Australian federal police warned her she was “potentially a target” for abuse when she went out in public. Collingwood triumphed 90-77 in the traditional Anzac Day AFL match against Essendon at the MCG, while in the NRL the Sydney Roosters claimed a nail-biting 27-26 victory over St George Illawarra. We’ll be back with you bright and early tomorrow morning. Look after yourselves. Collingwood take the Anzac Day AFL match And Collingwood have won the Anzac Day AFL match at the MCG, coming back from 28 points down at three-quarter time to beat Essendon by 13 points, with the last goal kicked at the final siren. Final scores: Collingwood 90 (13 goals, 12 behinds) to Essendon 77 (11 goals, 11 behinds). A man has died after being caught up in a collision at the Olympic Dam mining site in South Australia, AAP reports. The man, 25, from Two Wells, which is north of Adelaide, died at the scene about 5.30am on Tuesday, SA police said. “The crash occurred within the boundaries of the mines,” they said in a statement. Police described the man as a pedestrian and did not provide further details of the collision. The BHP-owned Olympic Dam mines copper and other minerals, about 550km from Adelaide. Major crash investigators are making inquiries and SafeWork SA has been notified as police prepare a report for the coroner. Father Bob Maguire to receive state funeral An offer of a state funeral made to the family of Father Bob Maguire, who died last week at age 88, has been accepted. The details - including the date and location for the service - have yet to be announced, but the Victorian government has confirmed the beloved social justice advocate and Catholic priest will be honoured at a state funeral. Victorian premier Daniel Andrews said: Victorians will be invited to celebrate the life of Father Bob Maguire at a state funeral, honouring the people’s priest’s generosity, kindness, humour and service to the state. Arrangements are currently being made with Maguire’s family and his foundation. Independent senator Lidia Thorpe claims she had been told by federal police to take care when she goes out in public, alleging in a new interview that authorities had said she was “potentially a target” for abuse. The senator has opened up on her controversial altercation outside a Melbourne strip club last week, making further claims that provocation by a man was the cause of the highly-publicised incident. Thorpe spoke to activist and YouTuber Tom Tanuki about the incident. In an hour-long interview published on Tuesday, she said she had rarely gone out in public in recent times, before attending a friend’s birthday party at the Melbourne club. Thorpe said in the interview she had concerns about her safety when going out in public: I have been advised a number of times by the Australian Federal Police that I need to watch where I go, that I’m potentially a target. Thorpe claimed that a man “started verbally attacking me” once her group was outside the venue. She alleged the man had been “quite derogatory at me”: This person could not help himself but to have a shot at me. Thorpe said she described the man as “small penis” because she alleged the man had waited until she was outside the venue and with “all [his] mates” to criticise her. In a message to media outlets and politicians she characterised as critics of hers, Thorpe said “they need to know I’m not going away”: I do want to bring this nation together, and sometimes that involves some really hard truths about what has happened and what continues to happen in this country to First Nations people. Football update, third quarter OK, so it pains me to inform you that the score at three-quarter time at the Anzac Day AFL game – Collingwood v Essendon – has Essendon in the lead by 28 points. The Bombers are at 74 (11 goals, 8 points) while the Pies are sitting on 46 (6 goals, 10 behinds). Poor crocodile: my colleague Khaled Al Khawaldeh has this story about a mysteriously decapitated 4m saltie in Far North Queensland. A little warning, the pics are quite graphic in this one. Indigenous veterans commemoration service concludes Our correspondent at the Redfern commemoration of Indigenous veterans has captured the final moments of the ceremony: The aristocrat living in the Australian city of Wangaratta The only Australian to play an official role in the coronation of King Charles III lives in the small Victorian town of Wangaratta – but most in the town have never heard of him. Simon Abney-Hastings, the 15th Earl of Loudon, is one of 13 people appointed to play a ceremonial role at the 6 May ceremony. In a statement provided to some media outlets, his private secretary, Terence Guthridge, said Abney-Hastings was “delighted” to have been invited to be the bearer of the great golden spurs, a part of the ceremony dating back to the coronation of Richard I (Richard the Lionheart), in 1189. The mayor of the rural city of Wangaratta, Dean Rees, learned of Abney-Hastings only recently from media reports. Journalists from Melbourne have been scouting around the town trying to catch a glimpse of the royal, and his face was on the front page of the local independent newspaper, the Wangaratta Chronicle, on Friday. Rees told Guardian Australia: We certainly did not know that we had an earl – what is he, the 15th Earl of Loudon? He keeps a very low profile. Read the full story here: Linda Burney and Tanya Plibersek are laying wreaths as part of the Indigenous veterans Anzac Day events in Redfern park. Football update An important football update: Collingwood leads by two points at half time against Essendon at the MCG, with the score currently 37 (5 goals, 7 behind) to 35 (5 goals, 5 behinds). Linda Burney, the federal minister for Indigenous affairs, has addressed the crowd gathered at Redfern Park in an Anzac Day ceremony commemorating Indigenous veterans. She urged Australians not to forget the frontier wars committed against Indigenous communities during Britain’s colonisation: I think the most important thing is that we come together, all of us, as people sharing this planet, to recognise what is a very significant day. It is a day where we remind ourselves of the men and women that went to other places to fight war on behalf of this country. But it would be wrong for me not to also recognise the frontier wars that have been part of the story of this country, because they were going to tell the truth. That is a part of the truth of our shared history in this country. It gives me great honour to be here … as someone who shares a history of this as well. But most importantly, thank you all for coming along today to pay homage to recognise and most importantly, to remember. Lest we forget. If you haven’t yet read this review from Nick Buckley of possibly the most bizarre Smashing Pumpkins gig in without a doubt the kitschiest tourist attraction in western Victoria, I highly recommend you do. Today’s cartoon from Fiona Katauskas takes on the rental crisis. Statue of governor Lachlan Macquarie vandalised before dawn service A statue of Lachlan Macquarie in the Sydney suburb of Windsor has been vandalised apparently overnight, before this morning’s dawn service. The statue of the fifth governor of colonial New South Wales was splashed with red paint and spraypainted with the words: “Here stands a mass murderer who ordered the genocide” and “no pride in genocide”. According to the Australian Museum, Macquarie “effectively declared war on the Aboriginal peoples of New South Wales”: He authorised a campaign of “terror” against those “hostile natives” who didn’t submit to colonial rule: permitting them to be killed, and their bodies hung up in the trees as grisly warnings, or taken hostages as “prisoners of war”. The mayor of Hawkesbury, Sarah McMahon, has described the vandalism as “appalling”, telling News.com.au: There’s a RAAF base nearby and we are a military community, our community is very angry about the level of damage and the completely inappropriate choice of day to do it. I understand people have strong views and feelings on issues, but this is not the appropriate way to express that. NSW police are investigating. More from the Redfern veterans’ march: Essingdon v Collingwood kicks off The classic Anzac Day triumph by Collingwood – ahem – I mean, clash between Essendon and Collingwood kicked off at the MCG about 12 minutes ago. I’m not going to bring you regular score updates this arvo but the Bombers are currently a goal ahead in a rather low-scoring first quarter. My colleague Rafqa Touma is at the Redfern march to commemorate Indigenous veterans. ‘Urgent action’ needed to overhaul Sydney’s cemeteries One in three Sydney cemetery workers has quit in the past year as government indecision and systemic bullying plague the troubled sector, a review has found. An independent review of OneCrown, the organisation that runs Sydney’s crown cemeteries found urgent action was needed to address “considerable” gaps in its governance framework. OneCrown launched by the Berejiklian government in 2021 in a bid to merge NSW’s five large crown cemetery operators and ward off financial collapse. But indecision on the project’s future has left each operator having to maintain separate finance, HR, and payroll systems, heightened staff uncertainty and halted key investment decisions, according to the review. The review said: Delay will further inhibit the ability of OneCrown to realise its strategic objectives and potentially increase the risk that the Crown may not be able to adequately provide for the burial needs of residents of Sydney and surrounding areas into the future. There are key investment and organisational decisions that cannot be taken in the absence of a government decision. The operators – northern metropolitan cemeteries, Rookwood general cemeteries, Rookwood necropolis and southern metropolitan cemeteries – held collective debts of more than $300m in 2021. Since then, OneCrown has taken numerous steps to amalgamate operations, including moving investment funds to other government entities and creating a single strategy. - AAP Thanks for your attention today! Stephanie Convery has the blog. Tanya Plibersek: First Nations diggers were not treated the same as other soldiers The minister for the environment, Tanya Plibersek, has also addressed the crowd at Redfern. She gave a shoutout to the federal minister for Indigenous affairs, Linda Burney, and the NSW state minister for Aboriginal affairs and treaty, David Harris. Both are in the audience at Redfern Community Centre today. I want to today extend my respect to all the Indigenous service personnel who have served, and their families who’ve made such sacrifices as well. When you hear their stories, you hear the same … moments of great courage, the same bursts of terror, the same intense camaraderie and the same periods of boredom broken by the same wicked humour. You find the same complex feelings of pain and trauma and loss. [But] the experience of First Nations diggers wasn’t the same as other soldiers. Not really, because … when soldiers came home historically they were not treated the same. Other soldiers weren’t turned away from the local pub. Other soldiers weren’t denied settlement assistance because of their skin colour. Other soldiers weren’t robbed of their proper pensions or left out at the national census. It was to our great shame should that was true until well after the second world war. When Indigenous soldiers were asked to sacrifice so much and receive so little in return. But one of the thing that makes me proud is that there is a generation of fighters of activists who have changed that story. In the last parliament, we saw five amazing speeches from five new Indigenous MPs in the Australian Labor party. NSW governor: absence of same recognition to Indigenous veterans is effectively ‘a denial of their service’ The governor of NSW, Margaret Beazley, has just addressed the crowd gathered outside Redfern community centre in commemoration of Indigenous veterans on Anzac Day: The coloured diggers march commemoration service is about pride and honor. There hasn’t been a single external war in which Australia has engaged in which our First Australians have not offered their service. But there are stories of unequal treatment at their return. The absence of the same recognition as their comrades … [amounts] in effect to a denial of their service. That this happened must remain part of our national consciousness. Without that national consciousness, we’re never going to be able to deal with ourselves as a people together. Peter Dutton calls for better recognition of Vietnam and Korean war veterans The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, says the service of Australians in both the Vietnam and Korean wars deserve better recognition. This year marks 50 years since the end of Australia’s involvement in Vietnam and 70 years since the end of the Korean war. Dutton has made a video paying tribute to the Australians who severed in those conflicts this Anzac Day: To this day, the Korean war can appear as a mere blip on the historical radar, receiving less attention than it should given the proximate storm of the second world war. To this day, narratives of shame and controversy continue to colour the Vietnam War. Such was the enduring influence of the anti-war sentiment and protests at the time. But our veterans deserve much better. Our long dead deserve much better. In the case of Korea and Vietnam, let us never forget this: Australians fought in foreign lands to defend those who desired self-determination and liberty. The minister for Indigenous Australians, Linda Burney, and chef Kylie Kwong are among the crowd at the commemorations for First Nations veterans in Sydney: Assistant veterans affairs minister begins Anzac dawn service address The assistant minister for veterans affairs, Matt Thistlethwaite, has stepped up in to deliver the first commemorative address at the Villers-Bretonneux Anzac dawn service. Thistlethwaite begins sharing his personal connection to the village: In 1918 at home in Botany in Sydney, Jesse Hickson received a knock on the door. The clergyman delivered the news that every parent of the time dreaded – Jesse’s son had been killed in action in the great war. Private Warwick Hickson was an organ builder who became a soldier in June 1916. He lived around the corner from the home my wife and I lived in when we married. In 1917 he was here in France, an infantryman in the 20th Battalion. On 9 July 1918, he was killed in fighting outside Villers-Bretonneux. He was just 24 years old. One of 46,000 Australians to die on the western front. His mates buried him outside of Villers-Bretonneux. A good many others were buried close by and we place a cross on the grave of each and every one. Anzac ‘Soccer Ashes’ trophy found after 69 years After vanishing 69 years ago, an Australian sporting treasure has been discovered in mint condition in a suburban garage. The unlikely find of the Anzac “Soccer Ashes” trophy has sparked calls for the long-lost prize to be used for future trans-Tasman football clashes. The small wooden trophy – housing a silver-plated razor case carried at Gallipoli – was contested by the Socceroos and New Zealand’s All Whites until it mysteriously disappeared in 1954. Inside it are ashes of cigars smoked by the Socceroos captain Alex Gibb and the All Whites skipper George Campbell after the first trans-Tasman match on Australian soil in June 1923. Relatives of the former Australian Soccer Football Association chair Sydney Storey found the item packed away in a garage while clearing out his estate. Read the full story from AAP here: French town Villers-Bretonneux remembers Anzacs in dawn service As night turns to day on the European continent, an Anzac dawn service has also begun in northern France. On 24 April 1918, as Germans troops advanced towards Amiens they seized the village of Villers-Bretonneux. However, that night, Australian soldiers counterattacked and encircled it, and by the evening of 25 April – Anzac Day – the Germans had been driven out. Each year, the town remembers the role Australians played in protecting their home. This year’s service at the Australian National Memorial at Villers-Bretonneux began with Cpl Tarryn Roach of the Royal Australian air force, a Worimi man from the Port Stephens, playing didgeridoo before the dawn. The last post concludes service at Gallipoli As rosy-fingered dawn rises at Gallipoli, the last post followed by the reveille has wrung out from the bugle, concluding the service. Van driver has lucky escape after crash with train in Victoria More than 100 passengers have survived a nasty train crash in regional Victoria, escaping without injuries. Emergency services were called to a collision between a V/Line train and delivery van in Yarragon at 8.20am on Tuesday, AAP reports. A Victoria police spokesperson said the driver of the van was lucky to escape with minor injuries and taken to hospital for assessment. But the van sustained significant damage, its contents sprawled across the railway crossing. Police are investigating the circumstances surrounding the collision and have called on anyone who saw the smash or had footage of it to contact Crime Stoppers. A march commemorating Indigenous veterans has begun down Sydney’s Redfern Street. A US citizen has faced court on customs charges after allegedly being caught with an unregistered gold-plated handgun in her luggage at Sydney airport, AAP reports. The woman, 28, was charged after Australian Border Force (ABF) officers allegedly found the undeclared 24-carat gold-plated handgun on Sunday, the agency said in a statement. The gun was allegedly unregistered and authorities claim the woman, whom they say travelled from Los Angeles, did not hold an Australian permit for it. ABF officers charged the woman with breaches of the Customs Act that carry a maximum term of 10 years in prison, the border protection agency said. ABF commander Justin Bathurst said the agency’s team, helped by sophisticated detection technology, were able to stop the gun reaching the community: We have seen just how good ABF officers are at targeting and stopping illegal, and highly dangerous, goods from crossing Australia’s border. The traveller fronted Downing Centre local court on Monday and was granted bail, according to the ABF statement. The ABF said the woman remained subject to visa cancellation and removal from Australia, depending on the outcome of the court proceedings. ‘Cruel’ if Labor restores single-parent payment only until children reach high school, advocates say Advocates have warned the Albanese government against adopting a “half measure” of restoring single-parent payments only until children reach high school age. The women’s economic equality taskforce recently recommended reversing a Gillard government-era decision that reduced the age of children whose parents qualify for single-parent payments from 16 to eight. Under the current scheme, single parents, most of whom are women, receive about $961 a fortnight, but are shifted to jobseeker when their child turns eight, receiving about $176 less a fortnight. The Albanese government has promised to support the most vulnerable and is understood to be preparing to raise the eligibility age, although the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, has said it “can’t do everything at once”, hinting the changes may be phased in or the threshold restored to an intermediate age. The chair of the taskforce, Sam Mostyn, has said such a move would see “families falling back into poverty”, while the chief executive of Single Mothers Australia, Terese Edwards, has said it would be “cruel and demeaning” to reduce payments once children reach 12 years old.

Marles plays down cuts to infantry fighting vehicles in defence overhaul The defence minister, Richard Marles, has played down criticism over cuts to infantry fighting vehicles, insisting that the government wants to “reshape the army” to have a greater ability to project power. The army had planned to acquire up to 450 infantry fighting vehicles, at a cost of up to $27bn, to replace Australia’s Vietnam war-era armoured personnel carriers. But in line with a recommendation from yesterday’s defence strategic review, the government has cut this number to just 129 vehicles, enough for one mechanised battalion. Instead, the government plans to accelerate and expand numerous other projects, including a land-based anti-ship missile system and new landing craft for the army. The shadow defence minister, Andrew Hastie, said yesterday the army would be “diminished by the review” because “without infantry fighting vehicles we go back to a light infantry army”. When asked by 2GB to respond to this criticism, Marles said he wanted to acknowledge Hastie’s service as “a very brave soldier in his time in the defence force”. Marles also referenced Anzac Day, saying he was “obviously mindful of the day and the dignity of the day so I’m keen not to get into a contest”. But Marles added: I’d simply say it’s only one category of fighting vehicle. What we are seeking to do is to reshape the army so that we have a greater ability to project. What we announced yesterday involved not just providing the army with longer range strike capability missiles, but also a greater capability to operate in a littoral environment – that is around coasts – which means we are trying to reimagine an army which is more mobile and can project. And that’s really in the context of a set of very challenging circumstances which we see in the world today. ‘We are all one’: Australians of different backgrounds attend Anzac march For Phoebe Alexander, who is part of the Taiwanese diaspora community in Australia, attending Sydney’s Anzac Day March is “our way of being part of Australia”. She is part of a volunteer group from the Global Federation of Chinese Business Women. The group are raising funds with the Rotary International BBQ in Sydney’s CBD as the Anzac march continues towards Hyde Park. My father was part of the veterans from the second world war against the Japanese. She says she hopes to see more Chinese people contribute to Anzac Day. This is an important day for our association to help with the volunteering and to be part of Anzac Day. This is our way of being part of Australia. She is glad to see people from different backgrounds applaud the March along Elizabeth St. It’s wonderful because it reminds us we are all Australian. We are all one. Richard Marles was also asked about the defence strategic review, given that the government chose to release it yesterday, the day before Anzac Day. At a few points in various interviews today Marles tried to avoid getting dragged into a political back and forth, saying he was “very mindful of the day”. The 3AW host, Neil Mitchell, asked why the government had decided to release it yesterday. Marles replied: We said quite a while ago, actually, that we were going to release the report in the first part of the year, and it was two months ago that I said it would be released in April. So, that it was going to happen in this week has been really on the cards for quite a while, and that’s the reason why. Mitchell asked whether that meant the timing was “coincidental”. Yeah, it is. And I think it’s possible to do that work on Monday and I’ll be doing it again tomorrow and through the week, whilst at the same time taking today to honour those who have engaged in the sacrifice of our nation. On 3AW, Richard Marles pushed back at comments from China’s foreign ministry overnight that Australia should not “hype up the so-called China threat narrative”. Asked for his reaction, the deputy prime minister said: Well, obviously, that’s not what we’re seeking to do. As we spoke about Australia’s posture going forward and the mission of the Australian Defence Force in the future, at the heart of it is providing or making our contribution, along with our partners, to the collective security of our region, of the Indo-Pacific. And that’s really where Australia is coming from. What we want to do as a nation is to provide and to make our contribution to the collective security of our region, understanding that that’s really where the defence of Australia lies. The interviewer, Neil Mitchell, asked Marles a very direct question: Do Australians have to come to terms with the possibility of another war? Marles replied: I’m not going to speculate about that. I’m certainly not going to do it today. But even if you ask me that question tomorrow, I wouldn’t be speculating about that. I think really what we need to be doing is just making sure that we have a defence force which provides for the greatest strategic space for our country and which also provides for the collective security of our region. And our focus as a government is to achieve that. (The then defence minister, Peter Dutton, attracted attention for saying on Anzac Day last year that “the only way you can preserve peace is to prepare for war”.) In pictures – Brisbane’s Anzac Day parade Defence minister Richard Marles reflects on his grandfather’s service The defence minister, Richard Marles, who attended the dawn service in Geelong, has done a round of radio interviews reflecting on Anzac Day. Marles said his grandfather, Percy Pearce, was awarded a Military Cross for exemplary gallantry in the Battle of Pozieres in France in the first world war but never really spoke about the experience. Marles told 3AW: I think he was greatly affected by the experience of being at Pozières. I knew my grandfather, he died when I was about 14. I can absolutely remember watching the cricket with Grandpa. But it’s only later in life, really doing what I’m doing now, that I understand the meaning of what he did. He actually won a Military Cross at Pozières, which is a huge honour, but I, to be honest, had no appreciation of that growing up. Last year I had the completely astonishing experience of being taken to the very spot where he won the Military Cross. He’s mentioned in Bean’s history of the first world war. And so it’s actually possible to locate where he was. And that was a hugely moving experience for me. Sydney march moves to War Memorial What is Anzac Day two-up all about? Following on from that last post (no pun intended), you might ask: what is two-up? As Bruce Moore, a history professor at the Australian National University, explained in the Conversation last year: Two-up is an Australian gambling game in which two coins are placed on a small piece of wood called a “kip” and tossed into the air. Bets are laid as to whether both coins will fall with heads or tails uppermost. It is one of the core activities of Anzac Day celebrations - and a beloved tradition. How did it become associated with Anzac Day? From the very early period of the first world war, two-up assumed great importance among the Australian troops. Soldiers reported that two-up was played on the battlefield during the Gallipoli campaign, even when under shellfire. As the war dragged on, numerous stories were told about Australian soldiers’ obsession with playing it. Moore explains that the game is associated with the Anzac qualities including mateship, larrikinism, anti-authoritarianism and egalitarianism: Two-up was always illegal, because the game is an unregulated form of gambling (although from the 1980s it became legal in most Australian states on Anzac Day). But in spite of the illegality, it was widely regarded as the fairest of gambling games, and at the time of the first world war the verbal command for the coins to be spun was not “come in spinner” (as it is now) but “fair go”. Big lines at popular Sydney pubs for Anzac Day two-up Sydneysiders like to play two-up on Anzac Day – and the Clovelly Hotel seems to be the place to be. There is a queue stretching more than 100 metres down Clovelly Road of people waiting to play two-up. ‘It should be at least 14’: Victoria raising criminal age to 12 criticised by Indigenous leader Last week the Victorian government decided to raise the age of criminal responsibility to 12, defying advice from the United Nations, human rights and children’s advocates and Indigenous organisations who have all pushed for it to be raised to 14. Aunty Geraldine Atkinson, a Bangerang and Wiradjuri elder and co-chair of the First Peoples’ Assembly of Victoria, says the decision is “heartbreaking”. I have very mixed emotions, I’m trying to focus on the positive that the increase is a slight improvement of the barbaric practice of sending 10-year-old children to prison, but 12 is not something to celebrate, it’s not a welcome move. All the experts say it should be at least 14. First Peoples, we’ve been very consistent in saying it needs to be at least 14. We know too well the damage that is inflicted when our children are removed from community. We have a Voice in Victoria and we’ve been using it – we’ve consistently and clearly urged the government to raise the age to at least 14 years of age. Instead they’ve gone with the worse standard permitted under international law. The Age is today reporting that according to a senior government source who spoke on the condition of anonymity, the attorney-general Jaclyn Symes will tell her counterparts on Friday that Victoria will raise the age of criminal responsibility to 12, with a view to raising it to 14 in 2027. Back in Sydney … Roy Mundoy, who fought in Vietnam during his 38 years serving in the infantry, says: It’s always good to see all the people turn out, especially young people. Today is a very important day. It reminds us about all those people who went before us. They shouldn’t be forgotten. He looks forward to bumping into friends from his time serving at the march in Sydney today. “When you’re in there you become great friends in the war, and after.” Before arriving today, Mundoy received messages with news of the deaths of friends he served with. We were always enjoying one another’s company. It’s sad when some people go. The only thing in life you can be sure of is you’re going to die. Work has been halted on Australia’s largest renewable energy project after a fatal truck rollover, AAP reports. A man aged in his 50s was behind the wheel of a Snowy 2.0 project truck when it rolled on Monday afternoon on the Snowy Mountains Highway at Dry Plain. He was trapped inside the vehicle and died at the scene, police said. Snowy Hydro chief executive Dennis Barnes described the incident as “incredibly distressing” and said the welfare of the project’s workers was the immediate priority. This is a tragic event and we are supporting our Snowy 2.0 Principal Contractor, Future Generation Joint Venture, our teams and all those impacted in the community at this very sad and difficult time. Project operations have ceased until the night shift on Tuesday. Federal ministers Chris Bowen and Katy Gallagher said the government expected the highest standards of safety on all worksites. They said in a joint statement: Everyone deserves to come home safe from work. The government expects the highest standards of safety at Snowy 2.0 and all worksites and will engage closely with SHL and unions in the aftermath of this tragic incident. Police have forensically examined the crash scene and are investigating the circumstances surrounding the crash. Snowy Hydro 2.0 will connect two dams in southern NSW via 27km of tunnels and a new underground power station. The $6bn project will effectively operate as a natural battery by using excess wind and solar energy to pump water uphill before releasing it during peak periods to provide power to the national electricity grid. Concerns have been raised, however, about budget blowouts, environmental hiccups and workplace health and safety issues. As mentioned earlier, the minister for defence industry and the Pacific, Pat Conroy, has attended the dawn service in Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea. The service was held at the Bomana War Cemetery, which has more Australian war graves than any other cemetery in the world with more than 3,300 service personnel buried there. Speaking to the Today Show, Conroy paid tribute to the Papuans who fought alongside Australians, and said “it was incredibly moving” see how close the relationship between the two countries still is. Most people have heard of the fuzzy wuzzy angels. They transported Australian soldiers who were wounded. But Papuans New Guineans fought side by side. There are 40 buried here. I had the privilege of meeting a 92-year-old veteran who joined up when he was 13 and lay a wreath … This small frail gentleman, who was still very mobile, I just … thinking about what I was doing when I was 13. This gentleman joined up when he was 13 years old to fight alongside Australia in what was the battle for Australia and a battle for Papua New Guinea. I had the privilege of going up to Kokoda last year for the 80th anniversary. To witness the landscape that Australians and Papua New Guineaians fought through was remarkable. It will live with me to the day I die. Meanwhile in Sydney, the Anzac Day march is still going strong: Anzac legacy ‘in who we are and who we aspire to be as Australians’, Hurley says Speaking of the Anzac legacy, Hurley says Australians show its characteristics in times of war and natural disaster: There is another intangible link. Australian servicemen and women are custodians of a legacy that began more than 100 years ago. Regardless of when or where service occurred, whether it was you who wore the uniform or a loved one, or if you simply acknowledge what service of others has meant our country, all Australians own and are part of the same legacy, the Anzac legacy. Indeed, many of my soldiers before we deployed when talking with them, when you ask them what were they most concerned about, it wasn’t about them, it was about whether they would be good enough to uphold the legacy that had been passed to them. Anzac Day brings that legacy into focus and the effect of that legacy goes beyond military service, though. It’s apparent in who we are and who we aspire to be as Australians. We see the characteristics we ascribe to the Anzac legacy – mateship, sacrifice, courage and endurance – expressed across our communities. As a nation, we have seen examples of that legacy in the way we responded to cyclones, floods, the pandemic, fire and drought. ‘Each generation learns from those who have served before’: governor general Hurley reflects on the intergenerational links which have always tied the country’s servicemen and women: In the first platoon I commanded after graduation, my platoon sergeant and section commanders were all veterans of the Vietnam war. Like many others at the time, I was fortunate to be schooled by those with deep military and combat experience. Each generation learns from those who have served before. Just as the Vietnam generation learned from those who served in the second world war, Korea and the Malay Peninsula. We are also linked by the shared experience of serving together. Perhaps that emotion we refer to as mateship, marching with your mates is one of the most satisfying of life’s experiences. The mix of feelings I have today would be common to all veterans. The pleasure of seeing old friends and colleagues, pride in the job undertaken for Australia in difficult circumstances, and in the shared and private moments of reflection on our service and of those no longer with us. Hurley pays tribute to those who have served in Vietnam and Somalia This year marks the 50th anniversary of the end of Australia’s involvement in the Vietnam war. Today I particularly want to acknowledge the service of more than 60,000 Australians who served in that conflict. The 523 men who gave their lives in the service of our nation, the impact of that service and loss on their loved ones, and the physical and mental trauma that many carried and many still carry. There is a second anniversary being marked today. Earlier, I had the great privilege of leading the contingent marching to mark the 30th anniversary of Australia’s commitment to Somalia. Vietnam and Somalian operations were different in scale, duration and intensity, but they were very strongly linked. They were linked because it was Vietnam veterans who taught the Somalia generation of servicemen and women our military skills and what it means to wear your country’s uniform. The governor general, David Hurley, has stepped up to deliver his Anzac Day address in Canberra. He acknowledges Ngunnawal elders “for looking after this country for us for generation after generation.” He also acknowledges the guests in attendance at the national ceremony including US ambassador Caroline Kennedy, former prime minister Tony Abbott, defence force chief General Angus Campbell and Australian War Memorial council chair Kim Beazley. Hurley says: On Anzac Day, we come together to honour those who have served, those who continue to serve, and importantly, the families that support them. We reflect on their collective sacrifices and what their service has meant to this nation. More scenes from the Sydney Anzac Day March: If you haven’t read Aaron Smith’s piece on the growing calls for Australia’s frontier wars to be remembered on Anzac Day, Gimuy Walubara Yidinji elder Theresa Dewar has told him: It is very important for us to meet on that day to remember what went on in the war that was in this country first. It involved our ancestors, it involved the early settlers, and it was on both sides. Read the full story here: Pictures from Indigenous veterans’ ceremony in Canberra Earlier this morning, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Veterans Association commemorative ceremony was held at the War Memorial in Canberra. Here are some of the images from that event: The veterans’ march has started in Canberra, with the governor general marching for the first time in the event’s history. The MC of the National Anzac Day ceremony tells the audience: The reviewing officer for today’s march will be the governor general of the commonwealth of Australia, his excellency, General the honourable David Hurley. Now, in a first here at the memorial, the governor general will also march this morning alongside the many veterans who have gathered in Canberra to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the Australian defence force operations in Somalia. The Anzac Day march has begun in Sydney’s CBD. Here are some of the scenes: Doctors v pharmacists: who benefits from Australia’s turf war over prescriptions? The You Deserve More campaign from the Australian Medical Association has an alarming message: allowing pharmacists to prescribe a wider range of medicines is a threat to patient safety and undermines the health system. Queensland now allows pharmacists to prescribe medicines for uncomplicated urinary tract infections after a successful pilot and other states including New South Wales and Victoria are developing their own pilots so pharmacists can administer medicines such as health and travel vaccinations and prescribe drugs for UTIs, skin ailments, ear infections and birth control. Unique audio of first world war soldier speaks across the years I also got the chance to speak with the Australian War Memorial this year about a really fascinating item in their collection – what is believed to be the oldest surviving recording in the world of an ordinary soldier in wartime. Henry Miller Lanser, a 24-year-old Australian soldier, found himself far from his family in Sydney at Christmas 1914. His 1st Battalion had arrived in Egypt in early December for training at Mena military camp before deployment in the first months of the Great War. There, Lanser found a way back home to Chatswood through a “talking-machine shop” in Cairo: This is rather a novelty to come to Australia this way. But here I am, can’t see and can’t be seen, or welcomed in the usual way with a hug and a kiss. You can listen to the full recording and read more here: Anzac Day events in Sydney Attendees from across the generations have gathered in Martin Place this morning: Earthquake off Sumatra poses no tsunami threat to Australia, BoM says You may have already seen there is breaking news of a magnitude 7.3 earthquake that has struck west of Indonesia’s Sumatra Island, triggering a tsunami warning. The Bureau of Meteorology says the tsunami warning poses no threat to Australia. Thousands at Sydney’s cenotaph AAP have more details on the dawn service at Martin Place, where thousands of people packed into the centre of Sydney for what is NSW’s longest-running dawn service. Governor Margaret Beazley and premier Chris Minns were among those to lay wreaths at the cenotaph in Martin Place before daylight. First held unofficially in 1927 by a handful of returned soldiers and an elderly woman, the service is the forerunner to services run by 320 RSL sub-branches across the state. Glenda Rixon wore the medals of her late father Henry “Harry” Rixon, a Korean War infantryman, and was touched that the 70th anniversary of the Korean armistice agreement was noted in the Martin Place service. She told AAP: Usually they don’t say anything – it’s like it’s the forgotten war. I’m really proud of my father, he passed away eight years ago. It’s a special day, we used to always watch him march. He didn’t speak much about his 13 months abroad but she recalled the warmth and mutual understanding that flowed through Anzac Day reunions. He’d say ‘we were like brothers’ ... they had to rely on each other. People gather in Sydney CBD for Anzac Day events My colleague Rafqa Touma is on the ground in Martin Place where people in Sydney gathered for the dawn service and the Anzac march to Hyde Park, which will start at 9am AEST. She’s spoken to Diane Wilson and Tammie West who have been at Martin Place since the 4:30am dawn service. West said: I’ve never seen that many people in a Martin Place dawn service. That tradition and the importance of the day is being reflected through many. Release of defence strategic review on Monday not tied to Anzac Day, minister says Keogh says the timing of the releasing the defence strategic review yesterday was about getting it out before the budget, not a deliberate move on the government’s part to link it to Anzac Day. Patricia Karvelas: There was the release of the strategic review on the eve of Anzac Day. Was that a deliberate decision by the government to try to link these two issues? Keogh: The timing was really about – as we said – that we’re committed to releasing this before we got to the budget, which is only a few weeks away now. Keogh says the humanity of all sides in a conflict has to be front of mind when any government makes decisions about national security: Certainly, I think one of the great things about the way in which we’re able to commemorate Anzac Day in Turkey, for example, which was the country we were in conflict, that are now friends with and they support us and being able to hold these commemorations, highlights the way in which these commemorations are focused on the shared humanity that we have. That at the end of the day, no matter what side people found themselves on, they were doing the service of their nation, and they are human, they are people and they have families and they have made that sacrifice on behalf of their nation and they’ve come to foreign shores, recognising that humanity is a critical part about these commemorations. I think that is something that has always got to be front of mind, for any government in any decisions that they need to make in any area of national security. Making sure that we think about those things and how they’re going to impact on our nation and that’s why you would have seen in the defence strategic review of statecraft is such a fundamental part of our what we need to do as a nation. Government needs to do more to help veterans, minister says Matt Keogh is asked about the ex-servicemen who come back to Australia broken and the thousands who are currently homeless are facing homelessness. Certainly we have a possibility to look after our veterans whether they’ve served overseas, whether they come with injury or mental illness from from that, or service in Australia. We’re doing everything we can to do that. But there’s absolutely more to do and I acknowledge that of course and the apology that I delivered last year to our veterans’ community for not governments of all sides, not living up to that obligation in various ways. And that’s why we’re trying to do better with processing through the claims backlog. That’s why we’ve brought on additional staff at the Department of Veterans Affairs. It’s why we are now looking at reforming the legislation that underpins our veterans entitlement system and that’s why we’ve brought forward legislation like the housing Australia future funding, as part of that will include funding, not just to provide housing to our veteran community where they need it but also the wraparound support that they need to get them into more permanent accommodation as well. Pent-up interest in attending the dawn service at Gallipoli has led to the biggest crowd of Australians at the ceremony since the Anzac centenary, according to Matt Keogh, the minister for veterans affairs and defence personnel. Keogh, in Gallipoli along with more than 1,600 Australians, told ABC Radio: It’s great to see that not only do we have more than three times as many people that were able to attend last year, as we were sort of coming out of Covid - but in fact, it’s the biggest numbers we’ve seen since the centenary of Anzac. …There’s an element of people who were very interested to be able to come over the last few years and haven’t been able to attend and so there’s a bit of pent-up interest there. I think what we really see is that people have seen the service that’s been rendered by our defence force personnel – not just way back in the first world war – but all the way through to recent conflicts as well as the assistance is provided through peacekeeping and humanitarian effort. And so people are interested in supporting our defence force and recognising that sacrifice. Also from people I’ve been speaking to here, Australians who are trying to connect with their own family history, and they’ve got going great-great-uncles or relatives that did fought here or fought in other places, connected to the first world war in particular that wanted to come and show their respects and to commemorate that service and reconnect with that family history of their own. End of Korean War in focus as Victorians mark Anzac Day Tens of thousands have gathered across Victoria for Anzac Day dawn services, with a special focus on commemorating the sacrifice of Australians during the Korean War, AAP reports. This year marks the 70th anniversary of the end of the Korean War – often referred to as the forgotten war – where over 17,000 Australians served and more than 300 were killed. Master of ceremonies at the Melbourne dawn service Justin Smith said the Korean War would only be forgotten if Australians let that happen. And with Australians continuing to serve in the DMZ (demilitarised zone) between North and South Korea - still the deadliest strip of land in the world - the conflict has not ended. Lieutenant Governor James Angus said the service was an opportunity to make amends to those who served and died in Korea after they had been largely overlooked. He told the crowd: Every Anzac Day is both historic and tragic. Historic because each year marks the anniversary of another war, another battle. Tragic because of the terrible price paid by young Australians … to create our history. Symbolic sea burial held at Gold Coast dawn service At the Anzac Day dawn service at Currumbin on the Gold Coast, the local surf life-saving club held a symbolic burial at sea. Each year the club launches surf boats to spread the ashes of servicemen and women who have passed within the past year. An estimated 20,000 people gathered this year at the picturesque Elephant Rock and extended south down the Currumbin beach. Former US navy vice admiral William Hilarides will lead the short sharp review of the combat service fleet flagged yesterday. Asked whether an American leading the review means Australia is looking towards even closer ties between the navies of our two countries, Conroy says: Our two countries already work closely together. William has had a long association with Australia. He’s the chair of our naval expert advisory panel that’s already providing advice on our naval acquisitions, and even when he was a serving officer in the US navy, he provided a critical role, he played a critical role in supporting our efforts, for example, he was instrumental in improving the Collins Class submarine to make it the best diesel-powered submarine in the world. …We do have Australians involved with that review. It will be a short, sharp review, just to check that we got the right structure of our surface fleet to complement the acquisition of nuclear-powered submarines. Pat Conroy says Pacific a priority area in defence strategic review Pat Conroy will today speak with his ministerial counterparts in Papua New Guinea, which comes the day after the Australian government released the defence strategic review. The bilateral security treaty which prime ministers James Marape and Anthony Albanese agreed to sign in January will be the subject of Conroy’s bilateral talks today. Conroy says: I have already engaged with my counterparts before the announcement of the defence strategic review [DSR] and one of the six priority areas the DSR was increasing our engagement particularly the Pacific. Papua New Guinea is one of our dearest friends and closest neighbours. When I was here in January with Prime Minister Albanese, Prime Minister Albanese and Prime Minister Marape committed to signing a bilateral security treaty. That will be the subject of my conversation today with my ministerial counterparts. The security of the Pacific has to be driven by Pacific nations and where there’s a gap, in one nation’s security, the obligation is on the rest of the Pacific to step up and it’s Australia’s position and that’s reflected in the defence strategic review. You can’t but think about and be reminded about our close proximity at events like this where in world war two we stood soldier-to-shoulder to save not just Australia, but Papua New Guinea, and the DSR signals further regional engagement as we step up for a safe, secure and prosperous Pacific. Pat Conroy attends dawn service in PNG The minister for defence industry and the Pacific, Pat Conroy, has attended the dawn service in Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea. Conroy said it was “incredibly moving” to attend the service at the Bomana War Cemetery, which has more Australian war graves than any other cemetery in the world with more than 3,300 service personnel buried there. He tells ABC News Breakfast: Across the three war cemeteries in Papua New Guinea, there are around 8,000 Australians who made the ultimate sacrifice and are buried there. So nearly 8% of all Australian’s war dead are buried in Papua New Guinea, showing the ferocity of the fighting and how critical this theatre was to the battle for Australia during world war two. Albanese delivers commemorative Anzac Day address Anthony Albanese has delivered his first commemorative Anzac Day address as prime minister. He told the dawn service in Canberra: Every loss, every death at Gallipoli, was like a sapling torn out of the earth, leaving a hole where a tree should have eventually stood. While so much has changed in warfare since, the great character of Australians at war has not, yet it must be acknowledged that we have not always honoured those who have fought in our name as well as we should. Likewise, we must acknowledge the truth that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who donned the khaki fought harder for Australia than Australia was sometimes willing to fight for them. Yet we learn and we keep stuck taking steps forward together. Australians have gone overseas for us. They have gone because there is so much to fight for and what we have created as Australians and nurtured over generations is something we must never take for granted. Good morning! Natasha May reporting for blog duty. New Zealanders remember Anzac sacrifices First light in New Zealand has brought new reflections on the sacrifices of armed forces, past and present, on Anzac Day. Across the country, thousands have spent their morning at dozens of dawn services, from Kaitaia in the north to Invercargill in the frosty south. Prime minister Chris Hipkins, commemorating his first Anzac Day as New Zealand’s leader, spent his morning at his local dawn service in Wellington’s north. He said he would keep his two grandfathers in his thoughts: My mum’s dad was a signalman in the air force. And my dad’s dad had a very long period away from home from Greece to Italy to J Force [the NZ forces in occupied Japan] during the second world war. The lifelong impact that had on both of my grandfathers is something that I’ve never underestimated. I think about them on Anzac Day. I think a lot of Kiwis will feel the same. They’ll be thinking about their grandparents or great grandparents and the enormous sacrifices that they made for us to enjoy the freedoms that we do on a day-to-day basis. Serving New Zealand defence force personnel will also mark the day in a number of stations around the globe. In Lebanon and South Sudan, New Zealanders are serving on UN missions, and will commemorate with Australian colleagues. Dozens of New Zealanders serving in the UK helping to train Ukraine forces will also mark the day. There will also be NZDF commemorations in the Middle East, Japan, Korea, and, of course, Turkey. Defence minister Andrew Little and NZDF Chief Air Marshal Kevin Short are leading a delegation to Gallipoli, where New Zealand and Australian forces landed 108 years ago. Thousands have gathered to commemorate the contribution of Australian defence personnel at Anzac Day dawn services across the country, AAP reports. Events have been held in major cities, suburban centres and country towns honouring men and women who served in past conflicts and those serving today. At the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, Anthony Albanese led tributes on the 108th anniversary of the Gallipoli landings during the first world war: Every Anzac Day, from the greatest memorial to the simplest cenotaph, we honour all who have served in our name and all who serve today. It is a collective act of remembrance, reflection and gratitude – one carried out by multiple generations of Australians and devoted to multiple generations. The Canberra dawn service started with the sounds of a didgeridoo played by Sub-Lieutenant Jordon Bradshaw. Wreaths were laid by governor general David Hurley and New Zealand high commissioner Annette King. Ceremonial lanterns, which were placed in the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier last night, were carried by veterans and serving members into the war memorial as the reveille was played by a lone bugler. Albanese said it was important to remember the contribution of defence personnel who did not make it home: As we gather here, in towns and suburbs across the country, and in former battlefields across the world, we are surrounded by their names and the places that made their final claim on them, laid out in an atlas of grief. If we are to truly honour our veterans, we owe them something more than just gratitude. Just as they stepped for us, we must step up for them. The prime minister said it was also important to acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who donned the khaki “fought harder for Australia than Australia was sometimes willing to fight for them”. Principal air chaplain James Cox said the Anzacs at Gallipoli had established traditions of selfless service: Let us therefore dedicate ourselves to taking up the burdens of the fallen and, with the same high courage and steadfastness with which they went into battle. At the Sydney dawn service, Rear Admiral Christopher Smith said it was important to acknowledge the sacrifice of servicemen and women: We gather today not to glorify war, but to remember ourselves, that we value who we are and the freedoms we possess. Opposition leader Peter Dutton said Anzac Day was one of the most meaningful dates on the national calendar: The values for which we stand are more enduring than any conflict, as long as we have – like our forebears – the courage and commitment to defend them always. The Anzac Day march in Canberra will mark 30 years of peacekeeping efforts in Somalia, featuring 120 veterans who served as part of Operation Solace, including the governor general, who commanded the 1RAR battalion. This year marks 50 years since the end of Australian involvement during the Vietnam war, during which more than 500 Australians died and more than 3,000 were injured. Services will also take place to mark Anzac Day in France, Papua New Guinea and Turkey. Australia’s Antarctic icebreaker returns to Hobart Australia’s $529m Antarctic icebreaker is set to return to duty after maintenance issues kept it sidelined for summer, AAP reports. The RSV Nuyina arrived in Hobart yesterday after repairs in Singapore to fix problems with couplings connecting the vessel’s propulsion shafts with the clutches. It arrived in Singapore last April for routine maintenance that was delayed when spare parts couldn’t be sourced. The cargo ship Happy Diamond chartered to replace Nuyina in summer ran into several problems. It was forced to turn back from an Antarctic resupply voyage in November due to mechanical problems and in February briefly ran aground off Mawson Station. The Australian Antarctic Division says Nuyina will prepare for a “complex” trip to sub-Antarctic Macquarie Island in May. It will deliver hundreds of tonnes of cargo, including barges, to the outpost and transport scientists undertaking ecological, ocean and atmospheric research. Nuyina will return to Australia before heading south again to the Southern Ocean where further tests will be conducted on the vessel as part of its commissioning. Tests will then be carried out on the ship’s 150 science systems, including its moon pool, echosounders and winches. Plans for the 2023-24 summer include multiple voyages to Antarctica to resupply stations and conduct marine research. The AAD describes Nuyina, which replaced the Aurora Australis, as one of the most complex scientific icebreakers in the world. Nuyina first arrived in Hobart in October 2021 after delays in construction and delivery. Its maiden voyage south was pushed back after issues with the ship’s alarm and monitoring system. Good morning and welcome to our rolling news coverage of this Anzac Day. I’m Martin Farrer and while the dawn services have already taken place, my colleague Natasha May will have lots of updates as the commemorations continue through the day. In the meantime, here are some of our top stories. The Chinese government has urged countries not to “hype up the so-called China threat narrative” after a spokesperson in Beijing was asked about Australia’s strategic defence review and how it had criticised its activities in the South China Sea. With rallies and commemorations being staged across the country, calls are growing for the Indigenous people killed in Australia’s frontier wars to be remembered on Anzac Day. And we’ve got the fascinating story of how an Anzac made what is believed to be the world’s oldest recording of a soldier at war. In sport, Collingwood and Essendon meet at the MCG later today with more hanging on this traditional Anzac Day fixture than at any time for 20 years, while the Dragons take on the Roosters in NRL. The Australian Medical Association has launched a campaign against pharmacists being allowed to prescribe a wider range of medicines, warning it is a threat to patient safety. With a pilot scheme in Queensland having been made permanent, and with Victoria and NSW to begin similar trials, doctors are concerned pharmacists are being allowed to administer medicines such as health and travel vaccinations and prescribe drugs for UTIs, skin ailments, ear infections and birth control. With all that, let’s get going."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2020/jul/27/ehighways-could-slash-uk-road-freight-emissions-says-study","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2020-07-27T05:00:44Z","webTitle":"'E-highways' could slash UK road freight emissions, says study","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jul/27/ehighways-could-slash-uk-road-freight-emissions-says-study","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2020/jul/27/ehighways-could-slash-uk-road-freight-emissions-says-study","fields":{"headline":"'E-highways' could slash UK road freight emissions, says study","bodyText":"The UK could eliminate the majority of the carbon dioxide emissions from road freight by installing overhead charging cables for electric lorries on “e-highways” across the country, a report by government-funded academics suggests. The plan for a so-called electric road system would cost £19.3bn and put all but the most remote parts of the UK within reach of the trucks by the late 2030s, with the potential for the investment to pay for itself within 15 years, according to the report by the Centre for Sustainable Road Freight. The centre is backed by government research grants and industry partners including Tesco, Sainsbury’s and John Lewis. The catenary cables, powered by the national electricity grid, would link to lorries driving in the inside lanes on 4,300 miles (7,000km) of UK roads through an extendable rig known as a pantograph – similar to those on the top of electric trains. The electricity would power the lorry’s electric motor, as well as recharging an onboard electric battery that would power them to their destinations beyond the electrified roads. The engineering company Siemens and the lorrymaker Scania have already carried out extensive tests of e-highway electric road systems in Germany, Sweden and the US. Officials from the UK’s Department for Transport were scheduled to visit the test sites in Germany in March, but the trip was postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic. The road freight sector is a large contributor to the climate crisis, accounting for 5% of the UK’s carbon dioxide emissions in 2018, according to government figures, as well as pollutants from diesel engines that harm human health. Road transport was the sector with the largest increase in global greenhouse gas emissions over the last decade, according to the Committee on Climate Change, which recommended on-road charging for lorries in its latest report to parliament. Battery-powered electric lorries and vans are already viable options for the short-range deliveries in urban areas that make up about a third of road freight usage. However, the other two-thirds – long-haul deliveries by lorries – are difficult to decarbonise because of range and weight requirements. The lithium ion batteries used in electric cars do not currently have a high enough energy density to be viable for long-distance haulage, meaning trucks such as Tesla’s planned Semi could require tonnes of batteries, denting their efficiency and raising their cost. In contrast, a lorry fitted for electric roads would only require a battery of similar size to an existing Tesla car to be able to cover the vast majority of the UK, according to David Cebon, a professor of mechanical engineering at Cambridge University who co-authored the study. Multiple lorrymakers are developing lorries running on hydrogen fuel cells, but the authors of the study argue that “green” hydrogen trucks would use three times more energy than an electric road system. This is because energy is lost at every conversion: using solar energy to make hydrogen and then a fuel cell to generate electricity again. The electric road system would also have a major advantage over alternatives in that it would be possible to tax the electricity used by lorries, enabling the government to easily replace revenues lost from taxing diesel fuel, the report said. “If you have an inefficient energy system, you build fundamental inefficiencies into your economy, which puts the country at a competitive disadvantage,” said Cebon. “You create efficiencies [by using the ERS] that give you financial headroom. The government can generate tax revenues through this scheme because it is efficient.” The report suggests that a first phase of building work on the busiest roads could take two years, costing £5.6bn. However, electrifying those most popular routes alone would cover almost a third of the miles travelled by heavy goods vehicles in the UK. Later stages would bring the total cost to £19.3bn. Lower energy costs are predicted to pay back vehicle operators for the investment in new vehicles within 18 months, while electrification infrastructure could pay back its investors – either government or private – within 15 years, the report said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2020/sep/23/the-governments-tech-roadmap-is-a-strategy-based-on-an-old-and-discredited-argument","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2020-09-23T06:04:18Z","webTitle":"The Coalition's tech roadmap is a strategy based on an old and discredited argument | Tristan Edis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/23/the-governments-tech-roadmap-is-a-strategy-based-on-an-old-and-discredited-argument","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/23/the-governments-tech-roadmap-is-a-strategy-based-on-an-old-and-discredited-argument","fields":{"headline":"The Coalition's tech roadmap is a strategy based on an old and discredited argument","bodyText":"Stationed here in Victoria under Covid lockdown and working from home day after day it can begin to feel a bit like groundhog day. But when the Morrison government unveiled its low-emission technology roadmap – outlining its plan for how technology, not taxes, will lower our climate change emissions – I never thought I’d be reliving the same day from 2006. Back in January 2006 then prime minister John Howard and US president George W Bush launched what they labelled the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate. Don’t remember it? That’s understandable because it didn’t achieve much and seemed to be best defined by what it wasn’t. It wasn’t about setting clear, legally enforced targets for reducing emissions. Also it definitely wasn’t about putting any kind of price on carbon or some other mandate or financial incentive for businesses to deploy abatement technologies in the near term. As part of the launch of this partnership the Howard government released economic analysis from a Dr Brian Fisher and also his long-time collaborator Anna Matysek, who were both employees at the time of a government agency called Abare. This report asserted that the Asia-Pacific Partnership could substantially reduce emissions. How would it do this? Well, the authors warned that this shouldn’t be done through a carbon price or other policy measure that created demand to deploy low-emission technologies until “the necessary technologies to substantially reduce emissions actually exist”. Instead the government should focus its efforts on research and development of new technologies which would then deliver miraculous cost reductions such that they could be rolled out en masse some time in the future. In Fisher and Matysek’s analysis they envisaged that growth of wind and solar would be pretty much inconsequential in the globe’s future energy supplies. Instead major breakthroughs would be achieved in capturing and storing emissions (often referred to by the acronym CCS) from coal and gas power plants. This would then lead to their widespread deployment from 2015 across Australia, the US and Japan and from 2020 for China, India and Korea. By 2050, these authors projected, CCS would have been fitted to 60% of coal-fired generation and 70% of gas generators. Yet over the subsequent months the Howard government came under increasing criticism from a range of stakeholders across both industry and environmental groups that this “technology, not taxes” approach was not sensible. Instead, a carbon price was required. Fisher and Matysek leapt to the government’s defence, arguing in the Australian Financial Review that a carbon price would just punish consumers because options to decarbonise energy, like renewable energy, were too expensive. The Howard Coalition government echoed the same argument until a few months later it eventually agreed that yes, a carbon price was a sensible idea. Fast-forward to today – we are being told by a subsequent Liberal-National Coalition government that we shouldn’t put in place a carbon price or some other kind of incentive to deploy renewable energy to replace emitting fossil fuels. Except apparently the reason now is because these technologies are so cheap. At the same time they are still saying we must focus on research of technologies that aren’t capable of affordably reducing emissions in the near term but might help in 10 years time. And again they are pointing at cleaning up fossil fuels via CCS rather than getting rid of them altogether as our best option. Yet something has become very obvious over the intervening almost 15 years. Policy instruments that have driven widespread deployment and immediate emission reductions, not research, have delivered us the breakthroughs in the cost and scale of wind and solar energy. Meanwhile the assorted programs focused on directing funding to hand-picked research and demonstration projects in carbon capture and storage have achieved very little. Except perhaps to confirm the technology is extremely expensive (this is actually quite a useful outcome). Fisher and Matysek were clearly wrong on both policy and technology choices. Yet it seems the government still thinks they should be guiding our approach to lowering emissions. As recently as the 2019 election Angus Taylor was telling us that Labor’s plan to use an emissions trading mechanism to reduce emissions and achieve 50% renewables would drive electricity prices through the roof. His primary support for this claim was a paper authored by Fisher. Yet just a few months later Taylor himself was inadvertently making the point that Fisher was wrong. Taylor proudly proclaimed that Australia was on track to reducing its emissions in line with its 2030 emissions target and it would also lower electricity prices while doing so. Yet this claim was based on his department’s emission projections which also showed Australia was going to achieve 50% renewables. Meanwhile, Matysek has been appointed to the board overseeing the Australian Renewable Energy Agency. This is one of the primary agencies charged with implementing the government’s low-emission technology roadmap. It’s worth pointing out there are many useful elements within the government’s recent climate change policy announcements. However, the best way to get progress on emission reduction technologies is to provide a clear financial incentive made available to anyone who can manage to deliver emission reductions, irrespective of the technology they might use. It isn’t about trying to pick technological winners. And certainly not picking emission reduction winners based on the advice of people who don’t seem to have been much good at it. • Tristan Edis is director of analysis and advisory at Green Energy Markets"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/live/2022/sep/01/liz-truss-rishi-sunak-boris-johnson-tory-leadership-keir-starmer-bills-conservatives-labour-uk-politics-live-latest-updates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-01T16:03:27Z","webTitle":"More rail strikes announced for September after talks with RMT and operators fail – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2022/sep/01/liz-truss-rishi-sunak-boris-johnson-tory-leadership-keir-starmer-bills-conservatives-labour-uk-politics-live-latest-updates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/live/2022/sep/01/liz-truss-rishi-sunak-boris-johnson-tory-leadership-keir-starmer-bills-conservatives-labour-uk-politics-live-latest-updates","fields":{"headline":"More rail strikes announced for September after talks with RMT and operators fail – as it happened","bodyText":"Here is a round-up of all of today’s top news stories from Westminster: Tens of thousands of railway workers will stage fresh strikes in a long-running dispute over pay, jobs and conditions, PA Media has reported. The Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) said its members at Network Rail and 14 train operators will strike on 15 and 17 September. The union said more than 40,000 members would take action, which would “effectively shut down” the rail network. Keir Starmer has denied that Labour’s energy policy amounts to “kicking the can down the road”, but acknowledged that something will have to be done early next year to tackle the crisis in the longer term. During a Q&amp;A on BBC Radio 5 Live, the Labour leader was quizzed on his plans to tackle soaring energy bills beyond the middle of next year, PA Media reported. One listener told him: “The public is more leftwing than the Labour party at the moment.” Starmer replied: “I don’t accept that is kicking the can down the road.” Boris Johnson has vowed to give his full support to the next prime minister, but could not resist using his penultimate speech to take a potshot at Liz Truss’s energy plans. In an attempt to shore up his legacy just days before he leaves No 10, the outgoing Conservative leader hailed the government’s “accelerated, long-overdue reforms” to make the UK more energy independent and announced £700m for the Sizewell C nuclear plant. Johnson also said that “only time will tell” what kind of ex-prime minister he will be, and he reiterated that he will give his “full and unqualified support” to his successor. He will leave 10 Downing Street next week when he is likely to be replaced as prime minister by the current foreign secretary, Liz Truss, who leads the former chancellor Rishi Sunak in polling. The chancellor, Nadhim Zahawi, has said energy supplies should not be cut off if people cannot afford their bills, as the Treasury examines a range of options to help consumers cope with the cost of living crisis. Zahawi promised that the government would expand on the £37bn package of aid announced earlier this year to help households tackle soaring energy costs. He told Sky News: “No one should be cut off because they can’t afford their bills.” Michael Gove has urged Liz Truss to reconsider energy rationing for businesses this winter, after she rejected the idea at Wednesday’s final Tory leadership hustings. Gove said the UK should follow other European countries in urging companies to show restraint in their use of electricity and gas. Michael Gove dismissed speculation he intends to quit politics, saying he is “definitely planning to stay in parliament”. Sacked by Boris Johnson as the levelling up and housing secretary after privately advising the prime minister to stand down, Gove laughed off suggestions he could become a newspaper editor. The energy crisis is hitting UK household budgets harder than any country in western Europe, according to analysis by the International Monetary Fund. The difference between the cost burden on poor and rich households is also far more unequal in the UK than other countries. The reason is the UK’s heavy reliance on gas to heat homes and produce electricity at a time when Russia’s war in Ukraine has sent gas prices soaring. In addition, the UK has the least energy efficient homes in western Europe. The foreign secretary, Liz Truss, vowed to continue to put pressure on Beijing to end its policies against Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang, following a blistering report by the outgoing UN human rights commissioner, Michelle Bachelet, who accused China of “serious human rights violations” that may amount to crimes against humanity. Keir Starmer told listeners to his BBC Radio 5 Live phone-in this morning that he knows what it is like to not be able to pay bills, amid rising concerns over the cost of living crisis. The Labour leader spoke about his own childhood as he was pressed on how his party would help struggling families. Dozens of charities have demanded the government provide urgent financial support to households dealing with the cost of living crisis and have warned of a “tsunami of need” in the UK. The open letter, signed by 48 charity leaders, warns that an “economic crisis of a magnitude not experienced for decades” will push many formerly comfortable households into poverty and desperation. Ambulance handover times is the “No 1 priority” for the NHS in England this winter, the health secretary, Steve Barclay, said in a speech this afternoon. Speaking at the rightwing Policy Exchange thinktank, Barclay said just a small number of hospital trusts accounted for almost half of ambulance delays. That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, for today. Thanks for following along. I’ll be back tomorrow morning to continue bringing you all the latest UK politics news. Tens of thousands of railway workers will stage fresh strikes in a long-running dispute over pay, jobs and conditions, PA Media has reported. The Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) said its members at Network Rail and 14 train operators will strike on 15 and 17 September. The union said more than 40,000 of its members would take action, warning it woud “effectively shut down” the rail network. Talks between the union and rail industry have been ongoing but there has been no breakthrough or new offers from either Network Rail or the operators, the union said. The RMT general secretary, Mick Lynch, said: Our members have no choice but to continue this strike action. Network Rail and the train operating companies have shown little interest this past few weeks in offering our members anything new in order for us to be able to come to a negotiated settlement. Grant Shapps continues his dereliction of duty by staying in his bunker and shackling the rail industry from making a deal with us. We will continue to negotiate in good faith, but the employers and government need to understand our industrial campaign will continue for as long as it takes. The news follows announcements by Aslef and the Transport Salaried Staffs Association of strikes by their members in the coming weeks. Foreign secretary Liz Truss vowed to continue to put pressure on Beijing to end its policies in Xinjiang, following a blistering report by the outgoing UN human rights commissioner, Michelle Bachelet, who accused China of “serious human rights violations” against Uyghur Muslims that may amount to crimes against humanity. Truss said in a statement that the UN’s long-awaited report provided new evidence of “the appalling extent of China’s efforts to silence and repress Uyghurs and other minorities in Xinjiang”. She also said London would continue to act with international partners to “bring about a change in China’s actions, and immediately end its appalling human rights violations in Xinjiang”. The UN’s 45-page report concluded: “The extent of arbitrary and discriminatory detention of members of Uyghur and other predominantly Muslim groups, pursuant to law and policy, in context of restrictions and deprivation more generally of fundamental rights enjoyed individually and collectively, may constitute international crimes, in particular crimes against humanity.” The damming report was welcomed by rights activists and families of the victims in China’s Xinjiang region. But they also called on governments around the world to establish formal and independent investigations into the matter. Steve Barclay also said NHS trusts needed to prioritise the three cancers that account for two-thirds of the diagnosis backlog – skin, prostate and gastrointestinal. He said integrated health trusts should prioritise “new cancer pathways”, such as pharmacy and community referrals. He said: Alongside ambulance delays, the second dominant health issue is clearing the Covid waiting list backlog. Over the summer, the two-year waiting lists were virtually eliminated with a final 2,000 cases set to be resolved by the end of September. The health secretary added that patients “need to be able to exercise choice at the very start of their care”. He said the NHS needed to make better use of its app for patients to make appointments. The health secretary wants to “stimulate a conversation” about backroom staffing in the NHS, he said in a Policy Exchange speech about preparing for the winter. Steve Barclay claimed there were 53,000 staff in organisations across the NHS in England, “where the majority are not providing direct patient care”, in addition to hospital and GP management. He added: My point is this is not just an issue of cost. It is also about effectiveness. Because too much management can be a distraction to the front line. Staff at the centre need to streamline the administrative burden of those on the front line and not risk adding to it. If we are to reprioritise back office costs to the front line, there needs to be more transparency. Barclay added he had ordered a digital assessment of staffing in the NHS, telling the audience: It will stimulate, I hope, a conversation within the NHS about how priorities and resourcing is best aligned. Ambulance handover times is the “number one priority” for the NHS in England this winter, the health secretary, Steve Barclay, has said in a speech this afternoon. Speaking at the rightwing Policy Exchange thinktank, Barclay said that just a small number of hospital trusts accounted for almost half of ambulance delays. He said: Targeted help over the summer has been focused on these trusts, including building capacity in emergency departments, introducing pre and post cohorting and observation areas, supporting emergency department triaging and the risk assessment across the hospital as a whole. However, he said that not all of the issues were in the control of the hospitals and instead sat with ambulance trusts, integrated care boards, care homes and NHS England itself. He added: We currently have over 12,000 beds occupied by patients who are medically fit to discharge. This is also resulting in poor patient outcomes, in particular with the frail and elderly because patients often deteriorate if left in a hospital bed for too long. Boris Johnson has promised a £700m investment package if Sizewell C nuclear plant is to be built. He said it would be “madness” not to go ahead with the project, claiming that, if the plant was operational now, it would slash national fuel bills by £3bn. The GMB union national secretary Andy Prendergast has welcome Boris Johnson’s promise of funding for Sizewell C as a “belated step in the right direction”. “With energy prices going through the roof and all bar one of our nuclear power stations due to go off line by the end of the decade, this does at least provide some assurance on our energy security,” he said in comments reported by PA Media. “Years of political failure to make the right decision on new nuclear means we are woefully unprepared for the energy crisis facing us today. This same inertia has resulted in a failure to secure our domestic gas supply. The real-world consequences of this lack of political courage are higher bills and risk of blackouts this winter.” Dozens of charities have demanded the government provide urgent financial support to households dealing with the cost of living crisis and have warned of a “tsunami of need” in the UK. The open letter, signed by 48 charity leaders, warns that an “economic crisis of a magnitude not experienced for decades” will push many formerly comfortable households into poverty and desperation. Describing the challenges facing support organisations, the letter says food banks are “working flat out”, community centres are planning to provide winter “warm hubs”, and disability charities are providing cash to those who can no longer wait. But it warns many support organisations will close as charities cannot afford to keep building open. The letter was organised by the Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations and signatories include the National Children’s Bureau, National Voices and Disability Rights UK. It further warns of crises in mental health provision and increased suicide rates while predicting more children will enter care and that animal charities will struggle to cope with abandoned pets. “We are calling on the government to urgently deliver meaningful financial support to those in the greatest need, directly to households and through the benefits systems that already exist to provide support.” Liz Truss, the favourite to become the UK’s next prime minister, has said a damning UN report that Beijing had committed “serious human rights violations” against Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang province “shames China”. The report by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) said: “The extent of arbitrary and discriminatory detention of members of Uyghur and other predominantly Muslim groups, pursuant to law and policy, in context of restrictions and deprivation more generally of fundamental rights enjoyed individually and collectively, may constitute international crimes, in particular crimes against humanity.” Truss, in her role as foreign secretary, said the report “provides new evidence of the appalling extent of China’s efforts to silence and repress Uyghurs and other minorities in Xinjiang”. “It includes harrowing evidence, including first-hand accounts from victims, that shames China in the eyes of the international community, including actions that may amount to crimes against humanity. “This includes credible evidence of arbitrary and discriminatory detention, torture, sexual and gender-based violence, violations of reproductive rights, and the destruction of religious sites.” She said UN members now needed the chance to consider the report fully. The Chinese government, which attempted until the last moment to stop the publication of the report, said in an official response that it was “based on the disinformation and lies fabricated by anti-China forces” and that it “wantonly smears and slanders” China and interferes in the country’s internal affairs. Victims and human rights groups have said governments around the world should establish formal independent investigations into human rights abuses in Xinjiang. This is Tom Bryant picking up the UK politics live blog for an hour from Tom Ambrose Boris Johnson has vowed to give his total support to the next prime minister, but could not resist using his penultimate speech to take a potshot at Liz Truss’s energy plans. In an attempt to shore up his legacy just days before he leaves No 10, the outgoing Conservative leader hailed the government’s “accelerated, long-overdue reforms” to make the UK more energy independent and announced £700m for the Sizewell C nuclear plant. But he disparaged fracking, which Truss has pledged to lift the ban on, and hydrocarbons, another energy source his likely successor wants to exploit through further drilling in the North Sea. “If we could frack effectively and cheaply in this country, that would be possibly a very beneficial thing. I’m just, I have to say, slightly dubious that it will prove to be a panacea,” Johnson said on Thursday. “I would much rather that we focused on the things where we are brilliant, and where the environmental damage is really minimal.” Johnson later added: “Tell everybody who thinks hydrocarbons are the only answer and we should get fracking and all that: offshore wind is now the cheapest form of electricity in this country … Of course it’s entirely clean and green.” The chancellor, Nadhim Zahawi, has said households should not be cut off if they cannot afford their energy bills, as the Treasury examines a range of options to help consumers cope with the cost of living crisis. Zahawi promised that the government would expand on the £37bn package of aid announced earlier this year to help households tackle soaring energy costs. He told Sky News: “No one should be cut off because they can’t afford their bills. “I am working with the [energy] companies ... to make sure those people who are really struggling get that help both financially and personally.” Consumers are not automatically cut off if they do not pay energy bills, but UK charities have warned a group urging consumers not to pay this winter that there could be serious consequences. Zahawi said he was “deeply concerned” about vulnerable people living in freezing conditions this winter because they cannot afford to turn their heating on. Greenpeace UK’s chief scientist, Doug Parr, said the £700m announced for Sizewell C “could insulate huge numbers of draughty homes, and cut next year’s bills, instead of being thrown on to the slow-burning financial bonfire that is EDF, to increase our bills for decades”. He added: The contrast between these lumbering white elephants and the dynamic, cost-cutting, innovative technologies in the renewables sector could barely be more striking. While this down-payment on failure shows the government hasn’t noticed, the market has, and investors have fled the nuclear sector. To get Sizewell done, the government would have to step in and add the enormous costs of building reactors to the enormous costs consumers are already paying for their electricity. The “Boris bill” would be the prime minister’s legacy, he added. Michael Gove has urged Liz Truss to reconsider energy rationing for businesses this winter, after she rejected the idea at Wednesday’s final Tory leadership hustings. Gove said the UK should follow other European countries in urging companies to show restraint in their use of electricity and gas. While he admitted it was “not something that would come naturally to me or any Conservative”, he said Truss, who is expected to win the leadership contest and become prime minister next week, should prioritise ensuring there is enough energy for households during the worsening cost of living crisis. Truss has been under pressure for a week to reveal what extra support will be offered to people who will struggle to pay their bills after it was announced that the energy price cap will jump by 80% in October. Further rises are expected in January and April. It comes as health experts warned that cold homes will damage children’s lungs and brain development and lead to deaths as part of a “significant humanitarian crisis” this winter. Unless the next prime minister curbs soaring fuel bills, children face a wave of respiratory illness with long-term consequences, according to a review by Sir Michael Marmot, the director of University College London’s Institute of Health Equity, and Prof Ian Sinha, a respiratory consultant at Liverpool’s Alder Hey children’s hospital. Sinha said he had “no doubt” that cold homes would cost children’s lives this winter, although they could not predict how many, with damage done to young lungs leading to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), emphysema and bronchitis for others in adulthood. Johnson finishes his speech by saying he disagrees with those who oppose the government’s nuclear plans, adding that there “will always be dissenters”. And, with that, he leaves the podium and the speech – one of his last as prime minister – comes to a close. Boris Johnson has said he is not “morally” opposed to fracking, but claimed to be “dubious” it will prove to be a “panacea”. Taking questions from the media after his speech at Sizewell, the prime minister was asked about his position on fracking. He said: On fracking, you know, I am not intellectually, morally opposed to this at all. I think that if we could, you know, frack effectively and cheaply in this country, that would be a positive and beneficial thing. I have to say, I am just slightly dubious it will prove to be a panacea. I would much rather that we focused on the things where we are brilliant and where the environmental damage is really minimal, like offshore wind. Did you pick up just now, can I ask you if you can remember how much cheaper is offshore wind than gas? Nine times cheaper. So, you know, I cannot rest my case. We are brilliant at offshore wind, we need to put in sustainable baseload in the form of nuclear. Of course, we need a diversified policy where local communities want different solutions, they should be allowed to go for different solutions. But I don’t think that particular solution is going to be the panacea that some people suggest. Johnson also said that “only time will tell” what kind of ex-prime minister he will be, and he reiterated that he will give his “full and unqualified support” to his successor. He will leave 10 Downing Street next week when he is likely to be replaced a prime minister by the current foreign secretary, Liz Truss, who leads the former chancellor Rishi Sunak in polling. He said: I think only time will tell is my answer on that one. But my intention and what I certainly will do is give my full and unqualified support to whoever takes over from me. Otherwise, really to get on with life. The outgoing prime minister Boris Johnson says families in the UK are going to face a “very tough winter” and that “we just have to accept that” during a speech at Sizewell this afternoon. He says: Families up and down this country are going to face a very tough winter and we just have to accept that. What I would say to people is that the government really, really understands the difficulties you are facing. We totally get it. He adds that he wants to get over to people the “better future” that he believes is on the horizon once we are through it. He says: Out of this catastrophe of Putin’s war, I think good is going to come. Johnson is asked whether, with the benefit of hindsight, he would have ordered a second national lockdown in the UK during the Covid pandemic. He says that it is important that people remember what the measures to restrict the transmission of coronavirus were trying to do. He adds: We had at the peak of the pandemic, 40,000 people or more in NHS beds and we knew if you had another 20,000, 30,000 more – and it could have easily happened mathematically – in the NHS, then the system would have been overwhelmed. What would have happened then is that all those cases … of people who didn’t get help with their cardiac, concerns with their cancer diagnoses, all those other conditions would have been pushed out even further. The NHS would have been in an even worse position now. Johnson, who is now taking questions from the media, is asked about coming support for households and whether he had spoken to either Liz Truss or Rishi Sunak about plans to protect households. Johnson reiterated the support the government had already provided but said it was “clear that come the new administration, there is going to be a further package”. He says: We have the fiscal firepower to sort it out. We do have a robust employment situation, we have the revenues coming to the exchequer to enable us to help people. That gives us the strength to continue to support people. The outgoing prime minister suggested that nuclear energy was one of “medium and long-term” options. Johnson said he expects “substantial sums” of cost of living help to be provided by his successor. Speaking at Sizewell in Suffolk, the prime minister said: We’re helping people now with the cost of living and of course there will be more cash to come, whoever takes over from me, in the months ahead - substantial sums, that’s absolutely clear. He added that offshore wind was now nine times cheaper than gas because of the “insanity of what Putin has done”. Johnson says the Russian leader believes the west will “flinch”. Johnson says he is wrong about the resolve of both the British people and European governments. He will fail, says Johnson. Boris Johnson has claimed that if Hinkley Point C had already been built, it would have slashed fuel bills by £3bn. He already said it would be “madness” not go ahead with the Sizewell C nuclear plant. He went on: That’s why we need to pull our national finger out and get on with Sizewell C. That’s why we’re putting £700m into the deal, just part of the £1.7bn of government funding available for developing a large-scale nuclear project to final investment stage FID (final investment decision) in this parliament. And in the course of the next few weeks, I am absolutely confident that it will get over the line, and we will get it over the line because it would be absolute madness not to. The outgoing prime minister says the main opposition to new nuclear reactors being built is “nimbyism”. He says he has diagnosed the problem as “myopia” and “short-termism”. Johnson adds: It is a chronic case of politicians not being able to see beyond the political cycle. For 13 years, the previous Labour government did absolutely nothing to develop this country’s nuclear industry. They said it didn’t make economic sense, they even said that in their manifesto. Well, thanks a bunch Tony and thanks a bunch, Gordon. Tell that to British industries that are now desperately short of affordable and reliable electricity. Tell that to families struggling with the cost of heat and light this winter. He also goes on to blame Nick Clegg for saying the UK shouldn’t build more nuclear power stations like Sizewell C in the run-up to the 2010 general election because “it wouldn’t even be completed until 2021 or 2022”. As per usual, there is little acknowledgement of the fact the Tories have been in power for 12 years and that he has been prime minister for the past three years… Speaking from Sizewell in east Suffolk, Boris Johnson begins by talking about a “much-thumbed” Ladybird book he owned as a child, which was called The Story of Nuclear Power. He says he was “enthralled” to read how UK scientists split the atom for the first time at the Cavendish laboratories in Cambridge. He said he noted how the world’s first civilian nuclear power station was built in Cumbria. He continues: I look back at the optimism in the pages of that book and I look at what has happened since and at the short-termism of successive British governments and their failure to do justice to our pioneering nuclear history … and I feel like one of those beautifully drawn illustrations of that Ladybird book of what happens in a nuclear pile. The graphite rods are taken out at the wrong moments and my blood starts to boil and steam starts coming out of my ears and I think I’m going to meltdown. I ask myself the question: ‘What happened to us?’. He asks if we have lost the “gumption and dynamism of our parents and grandparents”. The outgoing prime minister Boris Johnson is due to make a speech on energy at midday. It is understood that he is set to predict the UK will enjoy a future involving “cheap, clean, reliable and plentiful” energy, amid reports he will confirm the sign-off for a new nuclear power station. The speech will take place during a visit to Suffolk – one of his last as prime minister – and we will bring you all the top news lines from it here shortly. The energy crisis is hitting UK household budgets harder than any country in western Europe, according to analysis by the International Monetary Fund. The difference between the cost burden on poor and rich households is also far more unequal in the UK compared with other countries. The reason is the UK’s heavy reliance on gas to heat homes and produce electricity at a time when Russia’s war in Ukraine has sent gas prices soaring. In addition, the UK has the least energy efficient homes in western Europe. There is widespread agreement from energy experts on the best solutions: a large-scale and rapid insulation programme and a faster roll-out of wind and solar energy, which produce electricity that is currently about nine times cheaper than that from gas, as well as short-term financial support for bill payers. The government has consistently failed over the past decade to deliver major insulation programmes and has effectively banned onshore wind. The IMF analysis assessed the impact of the energy crisis expected over the whole of 2022, based on forward fossil fuel prices in May, since when prices have risen. It found that the average UK household is expected to lose 8.3% of its total spending power in 2022, as a result of having to pay higher energy bills. The figure in Germany and Spain is 4%, while only Estonian and Czech households face higher impacts than the UK in the whole of Europe. Keir Starmer told listeners to his BBC Radio 5 Live phone-in this morning that he knows what it is like not being able to pay bills, amid rising concerns over the cost of living crisis. The Labour leader spoke about his own childhood as he was pressed on how his party would help struggling families. He said: I actually do know what it is like to sit around the kitchen table not being able to pay your bills. It comes as UK households will see spending power cut by an average £3,000 by the end of next year unless the new government acts to counter the biggest drop in living standards in at least a century, research has indicated. The Resolution Foundation thinktank said soaring energy bills would cut household incomes by 10% and push an extra 3 million people into poverty. Starmer said he remembered the phone being cut off for “months at a time”, adding that he was not claiming “great poverty” but he said there were times his family could not pay for utilities. He added: Millions of people will be having that anxious conversation as we speak now. Michael Gove has dismissed speculation he intends to quit politics, saying he is “definitely planning to stay in parliament”. Gove, sacked by Boris Johnson as levelling up and housing secretary after privately advising the prime minister to stand down, laughed off suggestions he could become a newspaper editor. Of his relationship with the prime minister, he dismissed suggestions he had been sacked in revenge for turning on Johnson in 2016. He said Johnson wanted to “stand and fight and in order to do so he needed to show he was reconstructing his government”. He said: “I have both a reservoir of affection for Boris and great respect for what he did in office as well.” Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Gove, who is backing the former chancellor Rishi Sunak to be the next prime minister, said the frontrunner, Liz Truss, had “moved more on to the territory” staked out by Sunak over tackling the cost of living crisis during the course of the Conservative leadership campaign. He said Truss had acknowledged she needed to flesh out some of her earlier points. The Labour leader was also quizzed on how his party would deal with the Northern Ireland protocol during a Q&amp;A on BBC Radio 5 Live. Keir Starmer told a Belfast listener there could not be a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, adding: “We have got the protocol in place and we should build on that, not rip it up.” Asked by presenter Nicky Campbell why the UK couldn’t just “tweak it”, he said: The government has said it is going to rip it up - that is what is destroying our reputation internationally. Starmer said that a veterinary agreement between the UK and the EU would make a “massive difference”. “The EU has got to give and take as well”, he stressed. Keir Starmer has denied that Labour’s energy policy amounts to “kicking the can down the road”, but acknowledged that something will have to be done early next year to tackle the crisis in the longer term. During a Q&amp;A on BBC Radio 5 Live, the Labour leader was quizzed on his plans to tackle soaring energy bills going beyond the middle of next year, the Press Association reported. One listener told him: “The public is more leftwing than the Labour party at the moment.” Starmer replied: “I don’t accept that is kicking the can down the road.” He said his party’s plan is “meeting the concerns of millions of people”. He added that he understood the scale of the challenge facing households, adding that “many people listening and watching this will be saying: ‘I can’t afford that”’. Pressed on his longer-term plans, he pointed to his party’s call for a national mission on home insulation. “On the question of what we do long term, I am completely up for that challenge,” he told the programme. “I accept the challenge that something has got to be done in April.” Meanwhile, the former Tory cabinet minister Michael Gove has said he will carry on as an MP. He has previously said he does not expect to be in government again. It comes as the Liberal Democrats move to confirm a candidate for Gove’s Surrey seat amid speculation he is considering quitting parliament, which would spark a byelection. Lib Dem officials are planning for a possibly imminent campaign in which the party would fight on issues including the state of local hospitals and plans to drill for gas locally. Gove told Times Radio: I’m going to stay on as an MP. I’m going to make arguments for the vital importance of carrying on with the levelling up mission that Boris [Johnson] started. I’m going to be arguing very strongly for a focus on education, on the environment, on prison reform, that is compassionate, and progressive, and in the best traditions of the Conservative party. And I’ll be doing that as the majority of Conservative MPs do, from the backbenches. I’ll also be looking out for my constituents in Surrey Heath and making sure that I’m representing them effectively. The chancellor’s assertion that “nothing is off the table” came as the Conservative leadership frontrunner, Liz Truss, ruled out energy rationing this winter as she clashed over the cost of living crisis with her rival, Rishi Sunak, at the final hustings in London last night. The foreign secretary rejected the proposal, despite it being a key fall-back measure in the government’s “worst case” contingency planning. However, Sunak said “we shouldn’t rule anything out” after the French government warned it may have to ration energy, urging company bosses to take steps to curb consumption. As he made his final pitch to party members, the former chancellor added: The challenges we face with this crisis are significant. Many European countries are looking at how we can all optimise our energy usage, that is a sensible thing for us to be doing as a country. Asked by the LBC broadcaster Nick Ferrari at the last hustings before voting closes on Friday whether she could rule out energy rationing, Truss replied: I do rule that out. Yes. Under the government’s latest “reasonable worst case scenario”, published in August, businesses and even consumers could face blackouts this winter as concerns grow over power supplies. Officials believe that without energy rationing, the UK could experience blackouts for several days in January if cold weather combines with gas shortages to leave the country short of power. Good morning and welcome to the UK politics live blog. As the race to become the next Conservative leader and next prime minister enters the final furlong, we will be bringing you all the news and reaction from last night’s hustings. But we start with comments from the chancellor, Nadhim Zahawi, who probably hasn’t even bothered unpacking at No 11 Downing Street and is likely to be out of a job by Monday. He said this morning that said “of course” the current level of support offered by government to deal with rising energy prices will not be enough, but that his team is looking at options for the next administration. Speaking to Sky News, Zahawi said: My pledge to your viewers is more help beyond the £37bn will also be coming. At the moment we’re midway of spending about £37bn. Asked whether it went far enough, he replied: Of course it’s not, which is why the moment I walked in to the Treasury on 5 July I gathered my leadership team, I said: ‘One, how are we doing on delivering the help?’ Because it’s one thing to announce it, very different to get it into people’s accounts. And there was a big focus on that. But equally importantly I said we need to prepare options for the incoming prime minister. The chancellor also said that “there’s nothing off the table” in terms of options the government is assessing for how to deal with rising energy prices. He said: There’s nothing off the table. We are looking at all the options. Everything from the chief executive of Scottish Power talking about help where we need to maybe create some sort of a fund for companies to be able to continue to help their customers. All the way through to making sure we target the help to both households and small and medium-size businesses and probably some larger businesses, because one of my concerns is the scarring effect on the economy if perfectly viable businesses in hospitality, in leisure, in high-energy use businesses would actually suffer or no longer exist because of Putin’s use of energy as a weapon."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2020/jul/22/china-hackers-sought-to-steal-coronavirus-vaccine-research-says-us","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2020-07-22T00:36:31Z","webTitle":"China hackers sought to steal coronavirus vaccine research, says US","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/22/china-hackers-sought-to-steal-coronavirus-vaccine-research-says-us","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2020/jul/22/china-hackers-sought-to-steal-coronavirus-vaccine-research-says-us","fields":{"headline":"China hackers sought to steal coronavirus vaccine research, says US","bodyText":"Two Chinese nationals have been indicted for seeking to steal Covid-19 vaccine research and hacking hundreds of companies in the US and abroad, including defence contractors, the US Justice Department said on Tuesday. Li Xiaoyu, 34, and Dong Jiazhi, 33, also targeted human rights activists in the US, China and Hong Kong, assistant attorney general John Demers alleged. Li and Dong, who are believed to be in China, acted in some instances “for their own personal gain” and in others for the benefit of China’s Ministry of State Security, Demers said. “China has now taken its place, alongside Russia, Iran, and North Korea, in that shameful club of nations that provide a safe haven for cyber criminals,” Demers said. Hours after the US indictment, China’s UK ambassador, Liu Xiaoming, rejected claims by the west that China was stealing research data as “groundless”. He tweeted: “Such accusations constitute disrespect for Chinese scientists &amp; their achievements; they could also undermine international cooperation on R&amp;D. The world must strongly oppose and reject such groundless claims.” The move comes amid rising tensions between the global superpowers fuelled by the coronavirus pandemic, which President Donald Trump blames on China. The Justice Department said Li and Dong, who were classmates at an electrical engineering college in Chengdu, have been engaged in a computer hacking campaign for the past 10 years. They have targeted companies in the US, Australia, Belgium, Germany, Japan, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Spain, South Korea, Sweden, and Britain, it said. “Targeted industries included, among others, high tech manufacturing; medical device, civil, and industrial engineering; business, educational, and gaming software; solar energy; pharmaceuticals; defence,” it said. “More recently, the defendants probed for vulnerabilities in computer networks of companies developing Covid-19 vaccines, testing technology, and treatments.” Justice Department officials said Li and Dong targeted biotech companies in California, Maryland, Massachusetts and elsewhere but did not appear to have actually compromised any Covid-19 research. They also targeted “non-governmental organisations, and individual dissidents, clergy, and democratic and human rights activists in the United States and abroad, including Hong Kong and China”, the department said. According to the indictment, Li and Dong supplied the Ministry of State Security with passwords for personal email accounts belonging to Chinese dissidents, a Hong Kong community organiser, the pastor of a Christian church in Xian and a former Tiananmen Square protester. Among the material allegedly stolen were emails between a dissident and the Dalai Lama’s office. The pair were accused of stealing source code from software companies, information about drugs under development from pharmaceutical firms and weapons designs and testing data from defense contractors. Targeted foreign companies were not identified by name. But according to the indictment they included a Dutch electronics firm, a Swedish gaming company, a Lithuanian gaming company, a German software engineering firm, a Belgian engineering software company, an Australian defence contractor, a South Korean shipbuilding firm, a Spanish electronics and defence firm and a British artificial intelligence and cancer research company. Li and Dong allegedly stole information from defence contractors regarding military satellite programs, military wireless networks and communications systems and microwave and laser systems. The indictment was returned by a grand jury in the Eastern District of Washington state on 7 July but was only unsealed on Tuesday. Li and Dong were charged with conspiracy to commit computer fraud, conspiracy to commit theft of trade secrets, wire fraud, unauthorised access of a computer and identity theft. China accused the US last month of smearing Beijing following allegations that Chinese hackers were attempting to steal coronavirus research. The claims exacerbated tensions between the two countries, which have traded barbs over the origin of the pandemic that has killed more than 600,000 people since it emerged in China late last year. “China expresses strong dissatisfaction and firm opposition to such smearing,” foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said. “Judging from past records, the US has carried out the largest cybertheft operations worldwide.” Agence France-Presse contributed to this report"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2020/sep/10/bhp-announces-plan-to-slash-emissions-by-30-over-next-decade-but-stops-short-of-quitting-coal-and-oil","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2020-09-10T09:35:45Z","webTitle":"BHP announces plan to slash emissions by 30% over next decade but stops short of quitting coal and oil","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/sep/10/bhp-announces-plan-to-slash-emissions-by-30-over-next-decade-but-stops-short-of-quitting-coal-and-oil","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2020/sep/10/bhp-announces-plan-to-slash-emissions-by-30-over-next-decade-but-stops-short-of-quitting-coal-and-oil","fields":{"headline":"BHP announces plan to slash emissions by 30% over next decade but stops short of quitting coal and oil","bodyText":"BHP would benefit from soaring demand for metals if the world decarbonises and heats by less than 1.5C, the mining giant’s chief executive, Mike Henry, has said. The company on Thursday announced plans for dramatic cuts in emissions from its operations and those of customers, as well as details of how executive pay would be linked to the miner’s environmental performance. However, the company has stopped short of quitting coal and oil entirely. It plans to continue to mine coking coal, which is used to make steel, as well as oil and gas, although it expects demand for hydrocarbon fuels to decline as transportation moves to electric power. BHP’s commitments come a year after Henry’s predecessor, Andrew Mackenzie, declared that global heating was indisputable and fighting it would require “the biggest global mobilisation since world war two”. Henry on Thursday said limiting heating to 1.5C, in line with the Paris agreement, provided the best outcome for BHP of four scenarios tested by the company. “Of the scenarios we have assessed, those that envision stronger global climate action also deliver greater value for BHP,” he said. “That’s because we are major providers of the commodities that will enable a green transition.” Under a less-than-1.5C scenario, BHP predicts demand for steel will almost double. “If we want to keep pace with the development of renewable technologies such as electric vehicles and solar energy, then copper production will have to double over the next 30 years,” Henry said. “And nickel production will have to increase nearly four-fold to power the next generation of battery technology.” But the world would “still need oil and gas to power mobility and everyday modern life on the pathway to decarbonisation”, the chief executive said. As part of a plan to tackle global heating, BHP would slash emissions from its own operations by 30% over the next decade, Henry said. That would be a way station to the company’s previously announced commitment to achieve net-zero emissions from operations by 2050. He said that would be done on a like-for-like basis, so that BHP got no “free pass” by divesting highly emitting operations, such as the Mount Arthur coal mine in NSW, which is for sale following pressure from investors. BHP also planned to reduce scope-three emissions – those made by customers – by reducing emissions from steelmaking by 30% by 2030. Over the same time period, it planned to slash emissions from its shipping by 40% by moving from ships running on highly polluting bunker fuel to ones powered by lower-emission natural gas. It would also link 10% of executive pay to environmental performance. Henry said the world was “not currently on track” to meet the internationally agreed Paris target of limiting global heating to less than 2C. “Neither the current aggregate commitments of nations, nor progress against those commitments, is sufficient,” he said. “The world will need to increase action if it is to achieve the ambitions of Paris.” BHP’s announcement received mixed reviews from environment groups. The Investor Group on Climate Change chief executive, Emma Herd, said it was “pleasing to see further progress in BHP’s climate response”. “Importantly, BHP’s analysis shows that large diversified miners can generate significant shareholder value under rapid decarbonisation pathways that are consistent with the Paris agreement goals,” she said. “We also note the significant work BHP has put into understanding its scope-three emissions, the new medium-term targets across all emissions scopes and the link to executive remuneration. Investors want climate risk analysis to inform core business decisions and look forward to continuing to engage with BHP to ensure continued momentum on this front.” However, the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility said BHP needed to “go back to the drawing board on its new climate change targets”. “Despite promising the world, BHP fails to deliver any meaningful outcomes in terms of actual emissions reduction,” the centre’s director of climate and environment, Dan Gocher, said. “It needs to try harder. BHP should be aiming for a 40-60% reduction in all of its emissions by 2030. “BHP may have finally given up on thermal coal but it and its industry associations are still betting heavily on gas, which is proven to have the same – if not worse – emissions than coal once fugitive methane emissions are factored in. “BHP continues to rely on unproven and horribly expensive carbon capture and storage to decarbonise its scope-three emissions, rather than simply leaving fossil fuels in the ground.” Market Forces, which is run by environmental group Friends of the Earth, said BHP’s announcement “set the bar for its diversified mining competitors”. “However, setting the bar at 30% below 2020 levels by 2030 is clearly choosing to fall short of the Paris agreement’s ultimate goal of holding global warming to less than 1.5C,” the Market Forces executive director, Julien Vincent, said. “On scope-three emissions, BHP has been generous with the hope but stingy with its delivery. The prospect of reducing emissions from steel production by 30% over the next decade is a tantalising start, but doesn’t count for much if all BHP is going to do is work with customers to find pathways for reducing emissions.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2020/sep/03/tory-peer-sandip-verma-accused-of-breaching-ministerial-code-with-uganda-deal","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2020-09-03T12:01:28Z","webTitle":"Tory peer accused of breaching ministerial code with Uganda deals","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/sep/03/tory-peer-sandip-verma-accused-of-breaching-ministerial-code-with-uganda-deal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2020/sep/03/tory-peer-sandip-verma-accused-of-breaching-ministerial-code-with-uganda-deal","fields":{"headline":"Tory peer accused of breaching ministerial code with Uganda deals","bodyText":"A Conservative peer has been accused of breaching the ministerial code after her family firm signed multimillion-pound deals to supply Uganda’s government with solar power equipment. Sandip Verma’s company, Nexus Green, has signed two deals worth more than £88m after meetings with the sub-Saharan country’s notoriously homophobic president, Yoweri Museveni. Lady Verma appears to have broken ministerial rules after joining the company as chair and director without informing the advisory committee on business appointments (Acoba). She was present when Nexus Green signed an £8m deal to provide the Ugandan military with solar power, eight months after leaving her job as a junior development minister. According to rules to ensure transparency, ministers are supposed to declare all roles and jobs for up to two years after leaving office. The deals have surprised other suppliers in the African solar power market. Verma and her son Rikki are the only directors, they have no previous experience in the industry, and the company does not have a website. The Ugandan government also signed an agreement with the firm last September to build a factory to make solar equipment. According to the agreement, most of it would be financed by applying for a loan worth more than £80m from UK Export Finance (UKEF), which is an export credit agency and a government department. Preet Kaur Gill, the shadow development secretary, called for Boris Johnson to launch an inquiry, saying: “The guidance on accepting an appointment after leaving ministerial office is clear. “The prime minister must immediately instigate a full investigation to confirm whether Baroness Verma broke the high standards expected of ministers by both the ministerial code and the public. “Ministers cannot be allowed to abuse their position for personal gain and if she is found to have broken the code then the prime minister must act to reassure the public that he will not tolerate such violations.” Verma, 61, a former parliamentary candidate who was made a life peer in 2006, was a junior minister in the Department of Energy and Climate Change from 2012 to 2015, and then for International Development (DfID) from May 2015 to July 2016. She stood last year to become mayor of her home city of Leicester, many of whose residents were forced to leave Uganda in the 1970s. Contacted by the Guardian, Verma said she believed she did not break the rules on declarations of interest because Nexus Green was an energy firm and not connected to her last role in DfID. “If it relates to a ministerial position then you have got to declare it. “I did not have to declare this because I had left energy many years earlier,” she said. Museveni, Uganda’s leader since 1986, has been internationally condemned for refusing to relinquish power, intimidating, torturing and jailing political opponents and for introducing anti-LGBT laws that punish gay sex with long prison sentences. The former soldier, who was involved in toppling previous leaders Idi Amin and Milton Obote, has met Verma, on at least three occasions. In an hour-long New Year’s Day speech in 2018 he mentioned Nexus Green’s plans to supply solar equipment. Verma, whose Twitter account displays a rainbow flag flying above parliament and describes herself as an “activist for equal opportunities, diversity and inclusion”, said she did not raise Uganda’s anti-LGBT legislation when she met Museveni. “I go there for whatever purposes I am going for and I am not raising that issue [of gay rights] at this moment in time,” she said. Verma met Ugandan government officials on at least one occasion while she was a minister – on 12 September 2015 in London, at a convention to discuss investment opportunities in sectors such as energy. The following month Rikki became director of Nexus Green, a company based in a building in Leicester jointly owned by his parents. Rikki, who sometimes uses the title “honourable” because he is the son of a peer, has been described as the chief executive of the company, while his mother is the chair. The £8m agreement with the Ugandan government to provide its military facilities with off-the-grid solar energy infrastructure was signed in February 2017 and was witnessed by Museveni and Verma. In January this year, as part of a push to strike deals outside the EU, DfIT announced 27 deals across Africa, including Nexus Green’s plan to export £80m of solar-powered water pumping systems for irrigation in Uganda. The Ugandan parliament’s national economy committee has written (pdf) that Nexus Green plans to establish a factory in Uganda to make solar-powered irrigation equipment and install the systems. Last September, the committee signed off a proposal to try to borrow up to £90m from UKEF for the development of solar-powered irrigation. It is understood that an application for a loan has been received but has not been approved. A UKEF spokeswoman said she could not comment on speculation about potential transactions for reasons of commercial confidentiality. “UKEF undertakes rigorous due diligence including checks against financial crime, bribery and corruption, prior to any support being provided.” A spokesperson on behalf of Verma said there had been no impropriety in the activities of Nexus Green. “Baroness Verma has never lobbied the UK government on their behalf and has never sought to inappropriately use her ministerial career for the company’s benefit. Any suggestion Baroness Verma has is farcical, not least because when in office her ministerial brief did not cover Uganda,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2023/apr/01/australia-news-live-polls-aston-victoria-byelection-liberal-party-roshena-campbell-labor-party-mary-doyle-peter-dutton-anthony-albanese","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-01T11:41:45Z","webTitle":"Labor claims Aston win, throwing Dutton’s Liberal leadership into question – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2023/apr/01/australia-news-live-polls-aston-victoria-byelection-liberal-party-roshena-campbell-labor-party-mary-doyle-peter-dutton-anthony-albanese","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2023/apr/01/australia-news-live-polls-aston-victoria-byelection-liberal-party-roshena-campbell-labor-party-mary-doyle-peter-dutton-anthony-albanese","fields":{"headline":"Labor claims Aston win, throwing Dutton’s Liberal leadership into question – as it happened","bodyText":"Thank you for following along with us tonight, on what ended up being a historic win for the Labor party. We will have more news and comment for you very soon, with our chief political corro, Paul Karp, working away as we speak. We will have more on the fallout tomorrow, so make sure you tune in. And most importantly – take care of you. (And a reminder, daylight saving ends in the early hours of Sunday morning –so enjoy your extra hour!) There are non-stop rumours that Scott Morrison is going to pull the pin very soon, which would mean another byelection in Cook. NSW is not as big an issue for the Liberal party as Victoria, so there are not quite the same concerns. But there are concerns about what this means for the Liberal party at large. There are those who point to 2007, when the Liberals were smashed at the polls – and how the Liberals turned that around in two elections. But this is different. The next big election test is not until October 2024 when Queensland will go to the polls. The Palaszczuk government is weighed down by controversy and how long it is in power, but so far the LNP are not looking like they will be guaranteed a win. And that is worrying LNP strategists even at this early stage. There are rumours that Anthony Albanese will move to capitalise on the Liberals’ issues and go to an early election next year, in order to get a mandate on the stage-three tax cuts. That is just scuttlebutt, but it is growing stronger. This byelection is going to have ramifications. For Peter Dutton’s leadership (although there doesn’t seem to be any move for a spill, because as more than one Liberal MP said to me tonight “who else would we pick?”), for the voice – Dutton’s soft no doesn’t look like it has electoral support, and for the Liberal party moving forward. And possibly, if it was smart, the Labor party. Which could take it as a “keep doing what you’re doing” result or, if it showed some forethought, as a push to be a little bolder and braver when it comes to the policies it is offering up. The electorate is listening. And watching very closely. It would be a brave leader indeed who ignored that. Tony Barry lays out the problem for the Liberal party moving forward, given that voters born after 1980 are not falling their way and are unlikely to, on current indications. My concern is gen Y and gen Z, voting for Labor and the Greens becomes habit-forming. Because of the housing ownership crisis, that generation are reaching historical milestones for conservatism at later ages. It happens in your 30s as opposed to your 20s, if at all. When you have something to conserve, you become conservative by nature. My concern is this democratic bulge is happening and the Liberal party will not be competitive for a very long time to come. (On the demographics, I have been arguing that for sometime – because you see your friends struggling, you are struggling, you don’t see anything getting better, and people start looking for answers elsewhere.) The Liberal party strategist Tony Barry speaks a little more plainly here on the ABC panel: My concern is we have always called Victoria the Massachusetts of the south, and there was always the little oddity in the seat of Melbourne, where the Greens used to give him a big run for his money but he used to win, and then the Greens won and started performing better in other seats. And at the last election they won three seats in Queensland. As a Queenslander, I am concerned that Victoria is not the Massachusetts of the south, it’s just the leader of the curve, and what we’re seeing in Melbourne demographically … that’s coming out across the rest of the country. Peter Dutton is not doing a postmortem. He seems a lot more reflective – and is jumping ahead to his own leadership. This is not quite Scott Morrison ‘I saw an eagle and knew God was sending me a message’ (nothing ever will be), but it is very much ‘I know how to fight’. I can tell you this, I have been tenacious from the time I got into politics. I have won in marginal seats for the last 22 years, I don’t give up, and I will make sure that we build this party, particularly here in Victoria, into an election machine by the time we have the 2025 general election, and we will do that for the sake of our country because there are many Australians who are hurting at the moment, many Australians who have been let down by Labor. And the government is in its honeymoon, but they have two-and-a-half years to govern and I believe very strongly we will be in an election-winning position by 2025. I am very grateful for the support of my colleagues; I have a fantastic team. Nights like tonight are always difficult for all of us and for the Liberal family, for our support base, but the positives that we take away is we will regather and rededicate ourselves and double down on our determination to win the next election for the sake of our country. Australian voters ‘don’t swing on the fringes’: Liberal strategist’s stark warning after Aston loss The Liberal party strategist Tony Barry knows the numbers, knows the tracking and knows what the party is facing. He is being much more realistic about the issues the Liberal party is facing compared to the MPs we have heard from tonight. This is not a Victorian thing, as Peter Dutton tried to paint it, it is not a Scott Morrison hangover thing, it’s not a negative campaign thing, it is not even a Peter Dutton as leader thing. It is a generational issue which the Liberal party at large has not cottoned on to as yet. Younger voters control the vote now. Millennials have eclipsed boomers as the biggest generation. They don’t have the same wealth and property to protect as previous generations – in fact, Australia’s most educated generation is about to be the first to not do better than their parents in terms of wealth building – and so, they aren’t getting more conservative as they age, like their parents and grandparents (in the aggregate) did. They are getting more progressive. They are not rusted on voters either, they go by issue. And they understand tactical voting in a way other voters haven’t. Millennials and Gen Z are motivated, engaged and fed up with the state of the world. They don’t rely on messaging, they rely on what they know about the issues. And so far, the Liberal party hasn’t given them anything to hold on to. And so they are turning away from the culture wars and the targeting of marginal communities and fear campaigns. With a more progressive electorate, there is no such thing as a safe seat. The same is true for Labor, but it pivoted in time. That same electorate will judge if it is enough at the next election. But the Liberals cannot win with what they are doing. Barry knows it: I know a lot of the commentary will focus on Peter. But I will say it is actually more about the problem with the Liberal party, the problem the Liberal party has with the quiet Australians. The middle Australians out there, quite empathetic, they have moderate views when it comes to social issues, they don’t swing on the fringes, they find all that type of politics quite weird, and the Liberal party has spent the last five, 10 years basically not talking to them. That was not a speech Mary Doyle expected to be delivering, so she switched that up in the last couple of hours. But I think we learned a little about Doyle there – she thinks of herself as a suburban mum, she loves her music and she gets emotional about her team and her family. Oops, no, the people of Aston get the final thank you. I would like to thank the good people of Aston for putting their trust in me, electing me as their representative, and I want to say I hope I won’t let you down … I promise to do as well as I can for you. Thank you so much. Once the party thank yous are done, Mary Doyle turns to the volunteers and starts to get emotional. This is the really big one. I can never say thank you enough to our excellent volunteers, who gave up so much of their time, their labour and patience to make sure this area is not taken for granted by the Liberal party. I am so grateful to every ... single person here tonight, especially Russell and Jackie, they have become like family to me. And then she turns to her children. And that is where the tears start coming. And to my beautiful kids and great-niece, when I see the things you are doing and the people you are becoming I feel so positive about the future, I really do. You are three great young people, and the whole family, whether they are here, watching from above, I’m incredibly proud of who you all are, and thank you. Anthony Albanese gets the final thank you. Finally ... finally, I want to thank the bloke who, like me, was raised Catholic and grew up in public housing and also like me has excellent taste in music, the 31st prime minister of Australia, Anthony Albanese. Anthony leads a government ... that Australians can truly be proud of, a government that has hit the ground running, trying to fix a decade of problems and neglect and scheming and rorting from the Coalition. A bloke who I am proud to have made over 100 years of history with. Mary Doyle: And about an hour ago or so ago, Roshena Campbell did call me and she wished me all the best in my role as the next member for Aston, and she was very gracious and I thank her for that and I wish her all the best. Doyle moves on to thank her team, Victorian Labor and the federal Labor MPs who have helped her. I think even our most optimistic true believers knew that I was the underdog this campaign. Even after the excellent result we had at the election last year. What we were trying to do hadn’t been done for 100 years. And Aston has been Liberal since Sinead O’Connor’s Nothing Compares 2 U was top of the charts way back in 1990, when I was just a slip of a girl at 19. We were the underdogs, but boy have we shown that we have a big bite. This is an extraordinary endorsement of the Albanese government’s positive plans for the country and a credit to all your hard work. And, as I said, the support I received over the past couple of months has just blown me away. I even had Billy Bragg in one of my T-shirts. He then introduces the newest Labor MP, Mary Doyle. Thank you so much, Richard. What an excellent deputy prime minister. Victoria thanks you. You guys, wow. I’m Mary Doyle. I like to be humble still. I’m a suburban mum and I’ve lived in the outer eastern suburbs for more than 35 years and as of tonight, I guess I’ll be your next member for Aston! Richard Marles thanks the Victorian Labor team and volunteers for, among other things, knocking on “deer” (he means doors, but it’s been a big day for Marles and I don’t think his nervous system is used to so much adrenaline). Of course, tonight is a huge endorsement of our prime minister, Anthony Albanese. ... Albo is a great guy. I know it, but the Australian people know as well. And it is my great honour as his deputy to see each and every day it up close, and have one thing on his mind and that is how can he advance the interests of the Australian people. That is the inspiration for every one of us who are a member of his government. And we are so lucky to have the opportunity to serve the Australian people as members of the Albanese Labor government. Richard Marles turns to Mary Doyle’s win: There are ... precious few moments where you get to be in the presence of history. So soak it up. Not since the 1920 Kalgoorlie byelection has a sitting government won a seat from an opposition in a byelection. But tonight Mary Doyle has done just that. Can I acknowledge Roshena Campbell. It is a great honour to represent a major party in contesting the federal seat and Roshena has done that with dignity. There is applause. “We bloody did it,” yells a supporter as Mary Doyle steps up on the stage with Richard Marles. Marles opens on the voice: Can I start by acknowledging the traditional owners of the land on which we meet to pay my respects to elders past and present. And say that I and Mary are deeply proud to be a part of a government which is committed to introducing the Uluru statement from the heart. We are going to work ... tirelessly to see recognition of our First Nations people through a voice to parliament referendum later this year and when that happens it will be one of the great unifying moments for our nation. Mary Doyle has entered the Aston byelection party alone and to massive cheers. She looks a little shellshocked. Roshena Campbell thanks her friends in the Liberal party and the campaign, as well as her volunteers, before moving to her family. I want to ... thank my husband James [Campbell, of the Herald Sun]. It’s not easy being married to a candidate but it is the greatest privilege to walk through this life with him. To my parents, whose sacrifice has always been extraordinary but particularly over these past weeks, and my children, James, Beatrix and Alexandra. Like so many, I put my hand up to serve because I want to make this country better for you, and all of our children. I will always be proud to be a Liberal and always be proud to be Australian because we live in the greatest country in the world. Tonight, I congratulate Mary and I congratulate the Labor party, but for me, and our party, the Liberal party, there is only one thing to do – we will fight on. Roshena Campbell thanks the other candidates and Peter Dutton as well as her Victorian team. She is clear-eyed and strong-voiced. I want to thank the other candidates, Mary, Angelica, Maya and Owen, and their supporters, because we are incredibly lucky to live in this country where we have a strong democracy, and we can always rely on fair and free elections, which is not the reality of much of the world today. Because of that, we must respect the electorate’s decision, so shortly before I called Mary Doyle to congratulate her for being successful tonight and having the privilege of being the next member for Aston. I want to give my profound thanks to the people of Aston, for the past five weeks I have had the privilege of listening to them and hearing their stories. Tonight was not our night. But our democracy needs a strong opposition, and the time will come, I think soon, when this country needs a strong Liberal government. Peter Dutton has arrived at the Aston headquarters with Roshena Campbell. He says it is time to rebuild: Firstly I want you to congratulate an amazing candidate in Roshena Campbell. I am incredibly proud to be here with you tonight. I want to say thank you to all of our workers. It’s a tough night for the Liberal party and our family here in Victoria – not the first of those tough nights – we have been out of government 20 of the past 24 years. A lot of work ahead of us to listen to the messages sent to us today from the people of Aston, but listen to them we will and we will grow stronger from this experience and work towards the next election to make sure we are in a much better and stronger position by the time of the next general election. I want to congratulate Mary Doyle and the Labor party for their success tonight. Thank you to Roshena and her family – a tough day for any candidate, but for Roshena Campbell and your family, you have given us everything. I have been incredibly proud to see the work that Roshena Campbell has done on the ground, worked fabulously, gathered, as you can see tonight and as we have seen over the course of the last month, a group and a network of volunteers who have done our party proud. So thank you very much for being here, what you have done over the course of the campaign. Thank you very much to Andrew Hirst, Simon Badger and the campaign team, they have given day and night over the course of the campaign to put us in the best possible position– we gather together now, we rebuild and I promise you we will never give in. You may remember at Tuesday’s joint partyroom meeting, Peter Dutton was telling the room that the Victorian Moira Deeming issue was hurting the Aston byelection. Liberal insiders are now saying the track polling showed the seat was in trouble and those comments were preparing the party for the loss. Love a bit of hindsight, huh? Pre-polls are in – Labor is ahead. Labor will win this with about a 6% swing. The Liberals I have been speaking to tonight are not expecting a spill for Peter Dutton’s leadership. Mostly because they don’t think there is anyone else with the numbers. The Liberals now hold just seven of Victoria’s 39 seats. Roshena Campbell has rung Mary Doyle to concede. It is done. Albanese congratulates Doyle on ‘historic win’ in byelection Anthony Albanese is in Tasmania, so he won’t be at the Aston party, but he has called Labor’s Mary Doyle and congratulated her on her “historic win”. He’ll be on a very early flight to Melbourne tomorrow to join her for her victory lap. The Liberals lost the federal election, the Victorian state election, the NSW election and now, almost certainly, a byelection in safe Liberal territory. Is the Liberal brand in decline? Jane Hume, still looking very peaceful, says no, of course not. No, the Liberal party is not in terminal decline. Obviously we had an election loss last year, a review into that election and we look at all the factors that played into that. Some of those still continue on through this byelection today, but the Liberal party is an 80-year-old party, it has been in government for two-thirds of the time of that 80 years and has been fundamental to some of the best policy decisions, the most periods of prosperity that this country has seen and it will be around for many decades to come. The question for us now is how to make sure those Liberal party values that are so dear to us – choice, personal responsibility and reward for effort, aspiration, the importance of small business and the centrality of families in whatever form they take, the social fabric in Australia, all of those things – we need to make sure those values and principles are embedded in us and they better reflect the society we want to represent. The Liberal senator Jane Hume is asked why, given the positive qualities of Roshena Campbell as a candidate, the Liberal party suffered such a large swing against it tonight. She replies: There are always a number of issues that come into play in a byelection in particular. A retiring member who was quite popular – he took the margin up to be under 10%, and it came down at the last election, and probably swung back even more than the national average – but he was still a popular local member. So we have a new candidate with no name recognition, she had to start from scratch, behind the eight ball. Mary Doyle was already out there from the last election so she had higher name recognition, she had already spoken to a number of electors, so that played a big part. And a government is still in its honeymoon period and that still is playing out. People want to make sure that the choice they made at the last election is vindicated in some way so they like to give governments, new governments in particular, a chance. Hume says Aston result ‘very sad’ for Liberals but hails Campbell as ‘extraordinary candidate’ The Liberal senator Jane Hume is taking the peaceful and conciliatory road tonight. No doubt that this is a very sad result, particularly because Roshena Campbell is, was, is such an extraordinary candidate – a professional woman who has a migrant background, articulate, empathetic, and just exactly the kind of person we want to run for the Liberal party. This was not our night, that’s a terrible shame, but I don’t lose all hope, and in fact when I was out on the polling booths today and in pre-poll in the lead-up to today, there were not baseball bats out for the opposition, certainly not baseball bats out for the government either, but I don’t think that these cost-of-living pressures, which were the number one issue we were hearing about when we were out there speaking to the residents of Aston, I don’t think people are associating the cost-of-living pressures they’re feeling with the Albanese government. The deputy prime minister and Victorian Labor MP Richard Marles says: However it plays out, in terms of which side of the line it falls, it’s obviously not been the night for Peter Dutton, but, as you say, it has been a night which is an endorsement of the direction that the government has been taking, and what we will continue to do is work day in, day out for the Australian people, making sure that their issues are front and centre and we focus on the bread-and-butter issues which are of concern to them – the cost of living, inflation pressures – and we will just keep doing what we have been doing, making sure that we are doing that in a serious way. One of the things we have really felt over the past 10 months is that after a 10-year period of drift in this country we have a government which has got adults in charge and is trying to think about the way in which we go about our business in the interests of the Australian people, and we will continue doing that. With 33 of 36 booths counted, along with preferences, Labor has a 6.2% swing towards it. Marles says Aston count is vindication for Albanese leadership It is hard to see that the Liberal candidate, Roshena Campbell, will be delivering anything other than a concession speech when she steps up to the stage at Liberal HQ. The deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, is smiling like they have just named one of the SSN-Aukus submarines after him. Firstly, we are being cautious, as you would expect us to be, so we’re not calling it yet, but it is a remarkable night. Whatever else we see tonight, what is really clear is that by rights we should have had no points in this election – this is a safe Liberal seat – and in fact what we have got here is a result where the predicted swing you may have expected to the opposition just has not occurred, and this is a vindication for Anthony Albanese’s leadership and a very difficult day for Peter Dutton. Does Keith Wolahan think the Liberals should stick with Peter Dutton? Does he think Dutton could win a general election? I think he can, and I know I will get ridiculed on Twitter for that, but I really do. I think he is a good leader, and I saw good and bad leaders in the most trying of circumstances, and he has all the qualities of a good leader. Keith Wolahan, the member for Menzies, named for the man seen as the father of the modern Liberal party, which was practically birthed in Victoria, is now having to explain why that same party is struggling to hold any relevance in Victoria. I come from a party that is driven by values and principles over power and, yes, tonight is a tough night, but we should always be guided by our values and principles. The AEC is about to finish the count on the 36 polling booths on first preferences. Labor is still well ahead. The Greens preferences are flowing to Labor. Even if pre-poll has a slight break to the Liberals here, there is just no real coming back. They would need to have almost every vote bend their way. No matter what happens from here, this is going to be a very, very, very interesting interview. Mary Doyle is just an hour or so away from knowing whether she has made history as the first government candidate to win a byelection from the opposition in more than a century. She is not expected at the Labor party function until after 9pm, but the mood there is ELECTRIC I am told. Antony Green says if the Liberal party wins from here, it would be the biggest turnaround he has ever seen. He says every pre-poll would have to go the Liberals’ way. But the numbers are not with them. With 31 of the 36 polling booths reporting first preferences, Labor’s Mary Doyle is still ahead. Antony Green is calling it for Labor. Does Keith Wolahan think the “Noalition” policy of saying no to legislation and dealing itself out of Senate negotiations has hurt the Liberal party? I don’t think so because they are bad legislation and whatever has happened tonight, and we don’t know what has happened tonight, we have a good idea, but I don’t think that suddenly means our analysis of a particular bill is flawed. We look at those carefully and had party room deliberations on those, and they are flawed legislation, and that does not change that. Whether the messaging was made clear or not, that is something we will have to look at. Keith Wolahan, the Liberal MP for Menzies, is having an existential crisis in real time on the ABC’s coverage. Asked if the Liberal brand is “toxic” in Victoria, he says: I wouldn’t use the word toxic, but it’s not good. I think ... I don’t know what word to use. … If we lose Aston tonight, to have two federal Liberal seats in a city of 5 million, that will in the next decade be Australia’s largest, that is not just bad for my party, but also our democracy – and on a state level to have in a quarter of a century, one term of a Liberal government – anyone watching this, that takes joy in that, I would say what does that mean for us as a democracy, and we need help as a party, and many more people in our party. Pauline Hanson said she wasn’t running a candidate to help the Liberal party. This could be a very costly decision for the Liberal party. There is currently a 6% swing towards the Labor party with 27 of the 36 polling booth’s first preferences counted. Pretty much all the pre-polls would have to go the Liberals way for Roshena Campbell to win this. Stranger things have happened, but it is looking increasingly likely Mary Doyle could make history here. For those asking why Peter Dutton’s leadership may be a little uncomfortable right now, given it has only been a year or so since the election, Anthony Albanese found himself in the same position about a year into his leadership of the Labor party, with the Eden-Monaro byelection. That was a close result, but was expected to be a close result. This was expected to be a close result, but not this close. Certainly, a Labor win wasn’t expected in a seat the Liberals have held since the 80s. It is a suburban seat, where Dutton was expected to have appeal. If it was an inner-city seat, people would have expected the Liberals to struggle, but Dutton is supposed to be popular in the suburbs. It makes all of this so far very uncomfortable fort Dutton. With 16 of those 36 booths reporting a preference count, Mary Doyle so far has a 9.1% swing towards her for the Labor party. That, I don’t need to tell you, is pretty big for this point of the night. Postals won’t be counted until tomorrow. But we will start getting pre-polls tonight. The first preference count is in for 30 booths now (six more to go): Labor – 53% Liberal – 47% Antony Green has just said: “This is starting to look serious for the Liberal party.” That is quite serious talk for Green. But given that the whole byelection campaign was built around the cost of living, what does that say? Dan Tehan says: We always knew when it came to cost of living that the Australian people were going to give the Labor party, the new government, a chance to see what they could do to address that, and what we have to do is demonstrate that the policies that they have put in place are not helping. The Australian people, when there is a new government, always want to give that new government a chance, and we have seen them do that. We have to obviously make the case as to why those policies are continuing to drive up cost of living, they are not helping when it comes to putting downward pressure on interest rates, so we know that that is the work that we have to do between now and the next general election. We will continue to do that. We have to remember we are only 10 months into this new government, it takes time to make your case, and we will continue to make our case, and build it and in the lead-up to the next election, which could be the end of next year, or the year after. Here is a little more from what Dan Tehan had to say a little earlier: I am not going to start doing a postmortem now. Obviously we want to wait and see what the final outcome is, and then there will be time to look and see, OK, what other lessons that we can learn. We have learned the lesson from what happened in 2022, and obviously we will wait and see what the outcome is here, though, of course, from every election, from every byelection, you have to look at the outcome and obviously assess, and work out where you need to go from here, and we will do that no matter what the outcome is. The ABC’s Antony Green has updated his outcome to ‘ALP likely’. It is still too early to say for certain, but Labor’s count here is higher than even the most optimistic Labor sources thought. The Liberal party is not giving up as yet, but there is a lot of nail-biting going on at the moment. A lot. The AEC is reporting 25 of 36 booths have returned results (10 of those have returned preferences) and Labor is still ahead. Mary Doyle – 53% Roshena Campbell – 47% Labor’s count watchers are reminding us that the early swings are from the booths in the north of the electorate, where there is a large Chinese-Australian voting population. That swing could be calmed down by some of the southern booth counts. Pauline Hanson’s One Nation aren’t running a candidate. If this comes down to preferences, that could prove a costly decision for the Liberal party. Nineteen booths have reported to the AEC and Labor is still ahead. Mary Doyle – 54% Roshena Campbell – 46% Dan Tehan, a Victorian Liberal, is trying to keep the light burning. He tells the ABC: I think it is still too early, we obviously want to see pre-poll, postal and we want to get a sense from booths right across the electorate, and I think we really need to wait and see. We always knew this would be close, but until we get a good sense of all the votes from all the booths I think it is too early to tell. We are at the stage of the night where Antony Green is looking slightly fevered. Which for the ABC election expert speaks at the speed of light. Because at the moment, Labor is on track to WIN the seat of Aston, which would break more than 100 years of tradition. So far just four of the 16 booths have reported a preference count along with first preferences. But results are starting to roll in very fast now: 52.5% to Mary Doyle to 47.5% to Roshena Campbell. Thank you to those sending us messages of how they are spending this byelection Saturday. We are particularly jealous of the Doritos and red wine. With 14 of 36 booths reporting (not all have gone into preferences yet, so still too early), the projected 2pp is 52.2% Labor to 48.8% Liberal. With 10 booths counted, Labor’s Mary Doyle has a very slight lead over Liberal Roshena Campbell – 50.06% to 49.96%. Now Labor is being a bit freer with the information when it comes to the vote. Labor’s interpretation of the Wantirna South booth is it has a large Chinese-Australian population. Mary Doyle was campaigning there with the multicultural affairs minister, Andrew Giles, this morning. Labor is making note of this, because in previous elections, people with Chinese heritage tended to fall behind Alan Tudge. That was one of the booths Labor had its eye on this byelection and it has come in Labor’s way. Again, that is one booth and this early in the count you can’t draw conclusions. With three booths reporting, Labor has pulled ahead with a 9.53% swing – but there are still not enough booths or votes which have come in to make any sort of commentary about what it means. From the first booth, the Liberals have 304 votes, while Labor has won 240 votes. That is a small swing to Labor. But it is also ONE booth. You can not extrapolate anything from one booth from 36. OK, I know this is a bit of a slow start (byelections always are) but we should start getting concrete results from the booth counting very soon. Byelections tend to be like falling asleep – just staring at a wall, a flood of anxiety and then sweet relief (or maybe that is just me). We should start to get some results from the smaller booths very soon. All votes cast today will be counted by the Australian Electoral Commission. The majority of pre-poll votes will also be able to be counted. Postal votes though won’t be counted until Sunday morning. A close result may mean there will be no winner called for some time – that tends to be rare though – you usually know by the end of the night. Labor has been pushing the line that this byelection “is a test for Peter Dutton”. Dutton says it is not and it is a referendum on local issues. Readers may remember a reversal of those lines – the Eden-Monaro byelection following Mike Kelly’s retirement from federal politics. That was set up by the then prime minister Scott Morrison as a comment on Anthony Albanese’s leadership of the Labor party in 2020. Labor ended up holding on to the seat – just, when there was a swing in postal and pre-poll votes to Labor. Kristy McBain, the now local government minister, increased her margin at the 2022 election. It’s amazing how quickly the message changes when the shoe is on the other foot. During the last week of the campaign, internal Labor polling ‘somehow’ found its way into the hands of the Sky News political editor, Andrew Clennell. If you didn’t see it during the week, you will be SHOCKED to learn that it was negative for Peter Dutton, and found he was a drain on the vote. Now keep in mind this is Labor’s internal polling. Asked about it yesterday, Dutton said: You’re talking about self-serving Labor polling that’s been released. I think the fact is that if you have a look at the latest Newspoll, my figure is exactly the same in net favourability terms as was Anthony Albanese eight days out from the 2022 election. Dutton says Aston voters can ‘send Labor a message’ Peter Dutton, in his sixth visit to the the electorate to campaign with Roshena Campbell, said that Aston voters could “send Labor a message”. He told the media on Friday: It’s also an important message for Labor to hear in relation to the cost-of-living pressures that families are experiencing. Every decision that Labor has taken economically over the course of the last 10 months has driven up the cost-of-living pressures on families and on small businesses. We’re seeing it in the last 24 hours where they are talking about now a disruption to gas supply, which would be a terrible outcome for families, particularly over winter, a terrible outcome for small businesses, and you’re seeing an inevitable increase in gas prices, in power prices under Labor as a result of the bill they brought through the parliament with the support of the Greens this week. So there is an opportunity here in Aston to send a message to Labor that it’s just not good enough that the cost-of-living pressures continue to go up and up and Labor’s policies, which are inflationary, feeds an increase in interest rates and families are paying that through their mortgages each month. Albanese admits winning Aston a tough ask Anthony Albanese campaigned with Mary Doyle this morning in Aston, where he admitted it was a tough ask for Labor to win the seat: Oppositions generally get swings. When Labor was in government, the byelection swings have been between 5 and 6% towards the opposition. And no government has won a seat off the opposition in a byelection for over 100 years. But we’re giving it a crack today. And I want to really thank Mary for the work that she’s done. And all the volunteers who are out here at the polling booths right around the electorate of Aston. And just remind people, voting is compulsory. The truth is the vote is down substantially, the pre-poll voting. And people need to get out there and have their democratic say today. No matter who they’re voting for, people should vote. It’s a very important principle in our democracy that has served our nation well. The Labor candidate, Mary Doyle, cut down Alan Tudge’s lead from 10.1% to 2.8%. That was when there was A LOT of anger over the Morrison government. That anger has dissipated, given the government has changed. Plus, a government hasn’t won a byelection from an opposition in more than 100 years. Cost of living has been the major issue this election, and Aston is one of the mortgage-belt seats. Polls close in the Aston byelection The polls are closed! Booths are going to start rolling in in about 45 minutes or so. Having had a chat to both sides through the afternoon, no one is thinking that Labor is going to win the seat, but it is being described as closer than it should be. Alan Tudge had a large personal following, something Roshena Campbell doesn’t have. Good evening! Thank you to Nino for this afternoon – you have Amy Remeikis for the rest of this night as we take in the results from the Aston by election. Why is this one so important? Well, it’s not going to change the government. But it certainly could change the opposition leader depending on how close this result is. We’ll take you through the evening. Polls are about to close, so enjoy this small lull. That’s it from me, thanks for reading. Amy Remeikis is sliding into the chair to bring you all things Aston byelection. Stay kind! Menindee farmers scramble for stock water after latest mass fish kill Farmers near Menindee in western New South Wales have to make the choice between spending hours carting untreated water for their stock or allowing them to drink water containing “potentially toxic algae”, after a mass fish kill contaminated the Darling-Baaka River. Plans to flush the river to remove the sludge of millions of dead fish have been criticised because they involve releasing water earmarked for environmental flows. Residents within the town of Menindee, population 550, have repeatedly been told that water processed at the town treatment plant is safe to drink. You can read more on that story here: If you’re settling in for a night in front of the blog (where we will bring you live Aston byelection updates), you should warm up with this long read on the current state of the Liberal party: Wonder if the PM asked Billy to make a trip down to a booth in Ferntree Gully today for the Aston byelection? Less than an hour until polls close in Aston, and the Australian Electoral Commission will be hoping that PLENTY of people cast a ballot today, given its warnings earlier in the week about low pre-poll numbers. As of the end of Monday, only 14,233 people had voted early, compared with 18,540 votes cast in Aston at the same stage in the 2022 federal election. The Tasmanian government is investigating a possible data breach. According to a statement issued late on Friday, the technology minister, Madeleine Ogilvie, said a breach of a third-party file transfer service “may have resulted in the loss of data held by the government”. Ogilvie said: We are currently working closely with forensic specialists to ascertain the extent of the breach, and we will keep Tasmanians updated as this progresses. The timing of the possible breach disclosure has been criticised. The ABC reported that the government declined to provide further detail on which transfer service had been breached, how many Tasmanians could be affected or what sort of data may have been exposed, with a spokeswoman saying the government was “not in a position” to do so. Jen Butler, from the Labor opposition, criticised the government’s response, telling the ABC: Given the valuable information held by the government on all Tasmanians – including driver’s licence details, births, deaths and marriages data, and medical records, it is vital that Tasmanians know their personal information could be at risk. There’s more here on the news from earlier that Labor will be unable to form a majority government in New South Wales: Two hours until polls close in the Aston byelection. Here’s a great piece from yesterday about the race to replace Alan Tudge: Here’s a full story on news we brought you earlier about an unrepentant Mark Latham: The Australian Bureau of Statistics, known comedic geniuses, have also got in on the April Fools’ Day gags. And with that, I leave the blog in the hands of Nino Bucci. Thanks for reading. Australia’s high commissioner to UK to visit Julian Assange in prison AAP is reporting that the high commissioner to the UK Stephen Smith is to visit jailed Australian, Julian Assange, in custody. The Wikileaks founder continues to face espionage charges in the US and remains in London’s Belmarsh prison, held there since 2019 while fighting extradition proceedings. It will be the first time since November that year he has accepted a consular visit and the first time a high commissioner has met with the Australian behind bars. Assange’s father John Shipton has welcomed the news in a statement: It will provide an opportunity for the high commissioner to see the appalling conditions Julian is kept in and the terrible toll that his ongoing incarceration is having on his health and on his family. His son’s long-running ordeal had been especially heartbreaking for his daughter-in-law Stella and two young grandchildren Gabriel and Max, Shipton said. The glimmers of hope followed by bitter disappointments. The humiliation of body searches by uniformed guards and frightening dog searches just to visit their husband and father for a precious short time. It could and should end right now. Assange campaign spokesperson Greg Barns SC called the development significant. It’s the first time in over a decade of detention that a senior Australian government official has visited Australian publisher Julian Assange. The UK government could end this injustice today. All it has to do is say ‘no’ to the US extradition. Barns said once Smith had seen Assange, they would urge him to speak with his British counterparts as it was in their power to deny the extradition and free him from “the nightmare he has endured for over 13 years”. Liberals narrowly win two seats with Ryde too close to call Nine and the SMH have also called the seats of Terrigal and Holsworthy for the Liberals, while still reporting that Ryde is too close to call. With 79.53% counted, the western Sydney seat of Holsworthy has been called with only 1,328 votes separating Labor candidate Mick Maroney from Tina Ayyad, amid a 2.93% swing against the Liberals. Nine also called Terrigal earlier today with 83.17% of the votes counted. The Liberals have held onto the seat by the skin of their teeth, weathering a 11.65% swing against them. With just under 85% of the vote counted, the inner-city seat of Ryde is still too close to call, with just over 200 votes separating ALP candidate Lyndal Howison from Liberal candidate Jordan Lane. In breaking news, the ABC has called the NSW seats of Terrigal and Holsworthy, ending Labor’s hopes of a majority. The ABC’s chief election analyst, Antony Green, has called both Terrigal and Holsworthy for the Liberals today, leaving Labor on 45 seats, two shy of the necessary 47 to form a majority. Green said Terrigal was won by only 1,258 votes, with postal votes pushing Liberal candidate Adam Crouch over the line. Meanwhile, Green also called Holsworthy for Liberal candidate Tina Ayyad, who was ahead by 600 votes earlier today and had postal votes trending towards her. Andrew Giles says Aston is a chance to ‘send a message’ to Dutton Immigration minister Andrew Giles has weighed into the Aston byelection, saying opposition leader Peter Dutton is “out of touch” with voters in Melbourne. Giles told Sky News that the byelection was an opportunity for voters to “send a message” to the opposition leader: People here are keen to send a message to Peter Dutton. Now this is a seat that had a 55% Liberal primary vote only four years ago and here something extraordinary is happening. It’s a very tight race, it’s a tight race because of Mary’s campaign and also because Peter Dutton and the Liberals are just out of touch with the values of voters in the suburbs of Melbourne. That’s something I’ve heard time and time again as I’ve been out here with Mary. New Victorian road cameras to catch phone use New traffic cameras in Victoria will be able to detect mobile phones and seatbelts, amid the state government’s move to reduce road traumas. In a statement, Victorian police minister Anthony Carbine announced that more than $33m had been spent on the AI-enabled cameras that he says are estimated to prevent 95 crashes a year. The plan is to roll out the cameras from the middle of the year, with 200 locations across rural and metropolitan locations earmarked. Carbine said the cameras would detect a range of different devices: Using mobile phones behind the wheel puts lives at risk and can result in tragedy. We’re deterring this type of risky behaviour on our roads with new phone- and seatbelt-detection technology. AAP is reporting that Sydney land earmarked for new housing development will be turned into a national park after koalas were discovered living in the area. “Today is about one thing and one thing only and that is that we need to get on and save koalas in the wild,” new environment minister Penny Sharpe told reporters at Wedderburn, in the city’s south-west, on Saturday. They’re on track to be extinct by 2050. We’ve got a 28-year window to turn this around. One week on from the NSW election, Sharpe has directed the National Parks and Wildlife Service to take control of nearby land owned by Sydney Water, at Woronora Heights near Heathcote, and turn it into a protected corridor. While the tract is relatively small, a new population of koalas had been discovered there and protecting the population was vital, Sharpe stressed. This is extremely important. Sydney Water was planning to put housing into this very important corridor where there are koalas, and then they were going to flog it off. This is also about not privatising public land. Koalas were listed as an endangered species in NSW last year and a NSW parliamentary report found the marsupials were on track for extinction before 2050 unless the government intervened to stop habitat loss and other threats. Dutton says Labor’s road funding cuts in Aston ‘a disaster’ Out of hiding and into the open, opposition leader Peter Dutton has been seen on the campaign trail in Aston today. Campaigning alongside Liberal candidate Roshena Campbell, Dutton used the opportunity to tell reporters what he thinks of the government’s decision to scrap road upgrades in the area: [Labor] haven’t explained to the people of Aston why it is that they cut road funding as the first act in government, and it’s quite remarkable. It’s a disaster for locals and people realise that the first act of the Albanese government was to cut road funding here in Aston … They’ve never apologised for it, they never explained why. Dutton went on to point to the rising cost of living as incentive for votes to ensure the Liberals hold on to the seat: There are a lot of Australian families who have heard Anthony Albanese promise before the last election on 97 occasions that he would reduce your power to $275. That was a promise he made before the election, he’s never mentioned it since, not once. So cost of living pressures are real for families and the opportunity in the election today is to send a very clear message to Labor that they shouldn’t be cutting local road funding, and they shouldn’t be abandoning this community. PM says Liberals’ negativity will cost them in Aston I just wanted to return to the prime minister’s comments in Aston this morning, and more specifically, what he thought the result of the byelection could mean for the Liberals. Albanese said he was “very hopeful” that Labor could put a dent in the seat, and more interestingly, said that the current negativity of the opposition would work against them: At the moment it is just a cultural problem that they have, of just pretending that they didn’t have the result that they did in last year’s election. They continue to just say no to everything. It is very predictable what their response is. They block and say no to absolutely everything in the parliament. They are very negative in the way that they approach everything and I think Australians deserve better. Australians deserve, in our major party system, an alternative government that puts up alternatives. The current Liberal party don’t put up amendments, they just say no. What I have done is run a government that is a mature government, that functions properly, that says what we will do and then does it. That is what today’s byelection is about – it is not about personalities, it is about the country, and that is why I will continue to promote an optimistic view, to seize the opportunities that are there. Australians charged up to $6bn for unused car spaces, study finds AAP is reporting that Australians are being overcharged up to $6bn for car spaces they don’t use, worsening housing affordability and parking availability. A new study from RMIT University has found unbundling parking from new apartments could save people who don’t own cars tens of thousands of dollars and free-up parking spots for those who do. The lead researcher, Dr Chris De Gruyter, said one in five households were paying for parking they didn’t use while 14% of households did not have enough. A single parking space could drive up the cost of a Sydney apartment by more than $100,000. The problem derived from apartments being sold or leased with parking spots as part of a bundle, regardless of whether the new resident needed it. De Gruyter said: People don’t get a say on how many car parking spaces they want or need. It’s already allocated for them. He called on local and state governments to allow for parking to be unbundled from new apartment builds in planning policy. That would give prospective buyers or renters the ability to choose the parking right for them and more effectively allocate parking supply from those who didn’t need it to those who did. The growth in build-to-rent housing, in which a development is designed specifically for renting rather than sale, promised to boost the popularity of unbundled parking. People who used public transport saved money and tended to be healthier and more active. Greater public transport use resulted in less pollution, noise and congestion and more space available for pedestrians. De Gruyter also recommends removing minimum parking requirements for new developments or even legislating parking maximums, which have proven successful in transport-rich, walkable cities like London. De Gruyter said policy change had been stalled by unfounded community fears that removing minimum parking requirements would reduce the availability of on-street parking. But research indicated it was actually residents in detached homes who were the greatest users of street parking. De Gruyter said: If you speak to anyone in the transport industry, they all say we should be unbundling car parking and we shouldn’t have minimum parking requirements. What we’ve got has been around for so many years and it’s really becoming outdated. It appears Queensland police have jumped onto the April Fools bandwagon (or they really will use paddleboarding, you just can’t be sure these days): The PM was asked a series of questions by assembled journalists, including one on whether the rising cost of living will hurt Labor’s chances of winning the seat: It was pleasing the results, the trend, going in the right direction this week with the figures, but we know cost of living pressures are there. That is why we have done measures like the reduction in costs of pharmaceuticals and cheaper childcare. That is why we support people on the minimum wage not continuing to go backwards. During the federal election campaign a year ago, when I said that if the Fair Work Commission granted a pay increase of a dollar an hour to people on the minimum wage, then I would welcome that. The opposition, the then-government, the Liberal party, said that the sky would fall in. It is no wonder they don’t support solar energy because they are always saying that the sky will fall in. Anthony Albanese held a door-stop in Aston just now, beginning by saying today’s byelection is an opportunity to “send the Liberal party a message”. The PM also sang the praises of Labor candidate Mary Doyle, saying she is a local, a single mum who knows the pains of the cost of living crisis, and is a cancer survivor. I have been here now, this is my fifth visit to the area, and on every one of them I have been impressed by the work that Mary has done, following on from the work that she did in the last election campaign. It is about time that the opposition recognised that they need to do more than just say no to everything. When I was the leader of the Labor party in opposition, I put forward constructive ideas – cheaper childcare was a commitment that we made. Action on climate change, the National Reconstruction Fund, manufacturing jobs were all commitments that I made very early on in my leadership of the party. The opposition, under Peter Dutton, just are sitting there saying no. They have become the observers rather than the participants in our national parliament and that is why I want Mary Doyle to be elected today. It is tough, oppositions generally get swing. When Labor was in government, the byelection swings have been between 5-6% towards the opposition. No government has won a seat off the opposition in a byelection for over 100 years. We are giving it a crack today. Western Australia’s hospitals have recorded an uptick in preventable serious incidents including medication errors and bungled surgeries, AAP is reporting. Data released by WA Health highlights an increase in sentinel events – serious and wholly preventable clinical incidents that caused or could have caused serious harm or a patient’s death. There were 26 sentinel events resulting in two patient deaths in 2021/22, up from 19 events and six deaths the previous year. Both deaths in the most recent year were linked to medication errors, while a further 12 medication-related incidents resulted in serious harm. There were five instances where a patient had surgical or other invasive procedures performed on the wrong site, two of which caused serious harm. Other serious incidents involved the wrong procedure being performed on a patient and the “unintended retention of a foreign object in a patient” after surgery or other invasive procedure. Sentinel events are included in the total number of “SAC 1” events – clinical incidents attributable to healthcare provision, or lack thereof, that could have caused serious harm or death. There were 574 SAC 1 incidents in 2021/22, a 2% decrease from the previous year. Of those, 139 resulted in death, compared with 147 in the prior financial year. Those outcomes may have been influenced by “multiple contributing factors” including complex medical conditions, WA Health said. Health service providers recorded a 3.6% increase in inpatient activity as measured by hospital bed days. The chief medical officer, Simon Towler, said other indicators of patient safety highlighted improvements in the health system, including a drop in hospital-acquired complication rates for patients in recent years. WA Health continues to be committed to improving patient safety by reviewing incidents or potential incidents and developing clinical strategies to prevent these occurring in the future. Almost two-thirds of confirmed clinical incidents ... had a patient outcome of no harm. However, we need to consider every potential incident as an opportunity to examine where we can improve. Mark Latham doubles down on homophobic tweet Sticking with NSW this morning, One Nation senator Mark Latham has doubled down on his homophobic tweet, saying “boo-hoo Alex Greenwich”. In a statement published by the Saturday Telegraph, Latham appears unrepentant after tweeting a homophobic insult directed towards Greenwich, an independent NSW MP. Latham’s comments come after he was called a “disgusting human being” when violence erupted last week outside a church in Belfield where Latham was speaking. Latham, it appears, has dug his heels in: Sometimes in public life when you throw out insults they come back at you harder and truer … So boo-hoo Alex Greenwich. When he calls someone a disgusting human being for attending a meeting in a church hall, maybe attention will turn to some of his habits. Greenwich goes into schools talking to kids about being gay. I didn’t want to be accused of anything similar, leaving that kind of content on my socials. NSW premier signals pay rises to essential workers above 3% The new premier of NSW, Chris Minns, has given another indication the government will give pay rises to essential workers above 3% this financial year and the next. Speaking to The Weekend Australian, the premier said he would negotiate with the unions “in good faith” and would consider the rising cost of living in any agreement. That is a floor, not a ceiling, and obviously we are not going to go below that [3%]. It needs to be done by mediation and negotiation but we are confident, having heard from union leadership since the election campaign, that we can get a landing on these issues. Unions have got a right to sit down with the government and negotiate on these things – that’s what we promised in the election campaign. The private sector is running in front of the public sector when it comes to wage increases in NSW. So that should be seen in context. Secondly, we have to make sure there is help for small business. That’s one of the reasons why we are going to implement our rebate for small businesses with $315 to cope with rising energy bills. Good morning everyone, and welcome to this Saturday’s live blog. We begin in Victoria, where the Aston byelection could make or break Peter Dutton’s leadership of the opposition. Liberal candidate Roshena Campbell is still expected to narrowly hold on to the seat, in Melbourne’s south-east, but Labor’s Mary Doyle is pushing hard. The seat, vacated by scandal-plagued former minister Alan Tudge, offers voters a chance to weigh in on Dutton’s leadership, and we will see how things play out. Elsewhere, One Nation senator Mark Latham has spoken out for the first time after he posted a homophobic tweet earlier this week that sparked widespread condemnation. The senator, whom NSW premier Chris Minns labelled a “bigot”, tweeted last night, saying “never apologise, never explain”. It comes as experts say that a sacking is “unlikely” but that Latham could face a vilification complaint for his tweet. Counting continues in NSW after last week’s election, with Labor’s majority under threat. AAP is reporting that three seats, Ryde, Terrigal and Holsworthy all remain in the balance, with Labor on 45 seats and needing two more to form majority. All eyes will be on when the count ends. Finally, it is April Fools’ Day today, so any and all jokes/pranks are welcome to be sent in. We will keep an eye out for any that stand out, as well as everything else that’s happening across the country."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2019/oct/21/renewable-energy-to-expand-by-50-in-next-five-years-report","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2019-10-21T05:00:23Z","webTitle":"Renewable energy to expand by 50% in next five years - report","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/21/renewable-energy-to-expand-by-50-in-next-five-years-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2019/oct/21/renewable-energy-to-expand-by-50-in-next-five-years-report","fields":{"headline":"Renewable energy to expand by 50% in next five years - report","bodyText":"Global supplies of renewable electricity are growing faster than expected and could expand by 50% in the next five years, powered by a resurgence in solar energy. The International Energy Agency (IEA) found that solar, wind and hydropower projects are rolling out at their fastest rate in four years. Its latest report predicts that by 2024 a new dawn for cheap solar power could see the world’s solar capacity grow by 600GW, almost double the installed total electricity capacity of Japan. Overall, renewable electricity is expected to grow by 1,200GW in the next five years, the equivalent of the total electricity capacity of the US. “This is a pivotal time for renewable energy,” said the IEA’s executive director, Fatih Birol. “Technologies such as solar photovoltaics (PV) and wind are at the heart of transformations taking place across the global energy system. Their increasing deployment is crucial for efforts to tackle greenhouse gas emissions, reduce air pollution, and expand energy access.” The Guardian reported earlier this month that a renewable energy revolution could end the world’s rising demand for oil and coal in the 2020s, decades ahead of forecasts from oil and mining companies. Renewable energy sources make up 26% of the world’s electricity today, but according to the IEA its share is expected to reach 30% by 2024. The resurgence follows a global slowdown last year, due to falling technology costs and rising environmental concerns. However, Birol warned that the role of renewables in the global energy system would need to grow even faster if the world hopes to meet its climate targets. The report said growing climate ambitions in the European Union and the US played the biggest role in driving the IEA’s forecasts higher, but it will be China which leads the way in rolling out wind and solar energy projects. The IEA expects solar energy to play the biggest role in jumpstarting fresh growth in global renewable energy because falling costs are already below retail electricity prices in most countries. The cost of solar power is expected to decline by a further 15% to 35% by 2024, spurring further growth over the second half of the decade. The appetite of energy-hungry businesses and factories is expected to be the biggest driver of the solar power boom as company bosses exploit falling costs to help cut their energy bills. But the number of home solar panels is also expected to more than double to reach around 100m rooftops by 2024, with the strongest per capita growth in Australia, Belgium, California, the Netherlands and Austria. Even after the “spectacular” growth expected for solar over the next five years, panels will cover only 6% of the world’s available rooftops, leaving room for further growth. “Renewables are already the world’s second largest source of electricity, but their deployment still needs to accelerate if we are to achieve long-term climate, air quality and energy access goals,” Birol said. He warned that although the potential for solar power was “breathtaking” the rapid rollout could disrupt electricity markets unless regulators and utilities adapt."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2020/jul/22/hackers-linked-to-china-allegedly-stole-data-from-australian-defence-contractor","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2020-07-22T08:16:11Z","webTitle":"Hackers linked to China allegedly stole data from Australian defence contractor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jul/22/hackers-linked-to-china-allegedly-stole-data-from-australian-defence-contractor","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2020/jul/22/hackers-linked-to-china-allegedly-stole-data-from-australian-defence-contractor","fields":{"headline":"Hackers linked to China allegedly stole data from Australian defence contractor","bodyText":"Hackers linked to China allegedly stole more than 300 gigabytes of data from an Australian defence contractor including technical information, according to an indictment unsealed by the US justice department. The Australian government said on Wednesday it was concerned by the alleged intrusions and welcomed “actions designed to hold malicious cyber actors to account” after the US announced a raft of charges against two Chinese nationals. But the opposition argued the government was not doing enough to safeguard critical infrastructure and businesses from cyber threats. Li Xiaoyu, 34, and Dong Jiazhi, 33, are accused of targeting an Australian defence contractor and an Australian solar business, as part of “a sweeping global computer intrusion campaign” that in some cases allegedly included helping China’s Ministry of State Security (MSS). The Australian defence contractor – known as “Victim 21” but not named – was allegedly targeted between April and June 2019. The hackers allegedly stole about 320GB of documents including source code for the company’s products, engineering schematics and technical manuals. The other Australian victim was said to have been targeted more recently. The network of “Victim 23” – described in the indictment as an Australian solar energy engineering concern – was allegedly compromised in January 2020, with the hackers also conducting “additional network reconnaissance”, the document said. The Morrison government issued a statement raising concern about the cyber intrusions without naming China directly. The statement – issued by four agencies including the Australian Signals Directorate – urged “all countries” not to breach their international commitments. It pointed to allegations by the assistant US attorney general, John Demers, that the hackers also targeted human rights activists in the US, China and Hong Kong. “Of particular concern, these individuals also reportedly targeted Covid-19 researchers as well as political dissidents, religious minorities and human rights advocates,” said the statement, which was also signed by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of Home Affairs. “We welcome actions designed to hold malicious cyber actors to account.” The Australian Cyber Security Centre – the fourth agency to issue the joint statement – said it was “working closely with organisations across Australia to help build their resilience to cyber compromises and is engaging with victims of malicious cyber incidents to offer cybersecurity advice and assistance”. Guardian Australia is seeking further details from the government on what steps it may have taken to check whether Australian defence technology or equipment has been compromised. But Tim Watts, the opposition’s shadow assistant minister for cybersecurity, urged the government to work more proactively with Australian businesses “to ensure they are not exposed to cybersecurity threats during the first recession in three decades”. He also called for the appointment of a dedicated cybersecurity minister. “We should expect the government to be safeguarding our critical infrastructure and businesses with the best available measures,” Watts said. “Sadly that is just not happening and has the potential to put at risk the lives and livelihoods of Australians.” The Australian federal police commissioner, Reece Kershaw, told the National Press Club on Wednesday that malicious cyber activity against Australia’s national and economic interests was “increasing in frequency, scale, sophistication and impact”. The comments follow a media conference in June when the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said a wide range of the nation’s public and private sector organisations were “currently being targeted by a sophisticated state-based cyber actor” – without naming the country. The Australian government has said it will earmark $1.35bn towards boosting Australia’s cybersecurity capabilities, with the 2020 Cyber Security Strategy due to be “delivered in coming months”. The previous four-year strategy expired in April. The US Attorney’s office for the eastern district of Washington painted a mixed picture of the alleged motivations in the newly unsealed case, saying the defendants “in some instances acted for their own personal financial gain, and in others for the benefit of the MSS or other Chinese government agencies”. Relations between Australia and China have come under repeated strain this year, but tensions boiled over last month when Beijing accused Canberra of engaging in a campaign of “cyber espionage, spying and surveillance on foreign governments, companies and individuals”. This week, an industry panel advising the Australian government on cybersecurity urged it to adopt a more “forward-leaning posture” on naming the countries behind cyber-attacks – including working with close partners to jointly attribute responsibility. The Australian government declared last week its support for a joint cybersecurity advisory issued by the US, UK and China “which details malicious cyber activity by Russian actors targeting organisations involved in Covid-19 vaccine development”. In that case, however, Australia named Russia – calling on it “to cease immediately any cyber activity, or support for such activity, which is inconsistent with their international commitments”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2020/may/17/bp-chief-says-covid-has-deepened-commitment-to-net-zero-emissions","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2020-05-17T12:55:35Z","webTitle":"BP chief says Covid has deepened commitment to net-zero emissions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/17/bp-chief-says-covid-has-deepened-commitment-to-net-zero-emissions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2020/may/17/bp-chief-says-covid-has-deepened-commitment-to-net-zero-emissions","fields":{"headline":"BP chief says Covid has deepened commitment to net-zero emissions","bodyText":"BP’s new chief executive said the impact of the coronavirus pandemic has deepened his commitment to shrinking the oil giant’s carbon footprint to zero. Bernard Looney, who took the helm of the oil firm in February, said he was “more convinced than ever” that BP must embrace the energy transition following the collapse of global oil markets. He told the Guardian that his commitment to steering BP towards its net-zero carbon ambitions, set out earlier this year, is “deeper” due to the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak. “I am more convinced than ever that this is the right thing to do, and we need to crack on with it,” he said. “The pandemic only adds to the challenge that already exists for oil in the medium to long term.” Some energy economists believe demand for oil may never recover to its levels before the pandemic if changes to business travel and commuting remain after the lockdown ends. This raises serious questions over the business models of major oil companies, which are already under pressure due to tougher climate action and the rise of renewable energy. “We’re all living and working differently right now. Not all of that will stick, but some of it will stick for sure. The question I have is whether consumers will consume less, and I think there is a possibility that they will,” Looney said. The world’s oil demand has fallen to 25-year lows following the outbreak of Covid-19, which has severely limited demand for transport fuels, causing global oil prices to fall by two-thirds. The oil market crisis has wiped billions from major oil companies, including BP which reported a loss for the first quarter of this year. “I think this will remind people of the fragility of the ecosystem that we work in; people are looking up at the skies and seeing less pollution, and I do hope that there will be an even greater appreciation for nature as we move forward, which should keep the climate at the forefront of public debate,” he added. Looney began his tenure as BP boss by promising that the oil company would invest more in clean energy and less in fossil fuels over the next three decades as part of an ambition to become a carbon neutral business by 2050. The plan will use carbon offsets, such as tree-planting and emissions capture technology, to mitigate the fossil fuels it will continue to produce by the middle of the century. “Do the near-term issues cause us to be able to invest a little less than I would have liked in these next couple of years? Possibly,” he said. “But I do believe that we will remain true to what we said on 12 February; that over time, we will invest more into non-carbon businesses and less into hydrocarbon businesses.” The pressure facing oil producers has increased as investors begin to turn their backs on fossil fuels in favour of green energy, which is cheaper and offers more predictable returns. This year, US oil prices plunged below zero for the first time, while BP’s solar energy business, Lightsource, struck new US solar power contracts totaling 400MW, Looney said, which underlines the resilience of the business. “This is a sector which continues to attract investment and I think that’s because it is what society wants,” Looney said. “These are the reasons why my commitment [to net zero] remains as deep, if not deeper than it has been.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2022/oct/09/australia-news-live-floods-nsw-evacuation-insiders-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-politics-tax-cuts","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-09T07:11:05Z","webTitle":"Extinction Rebellion protesters glue hands to prized Picasso – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2022/oct/09/australia-news-live-floods-nsw-evacuation-insiders-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-politics-tax-cuts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2022/oct/09/australia-news-live-floods-nsw-evacuation-insiders-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-politics-tax-cuts","fields":{"headline":"Extinction Rebellion protesters glue hands to prized Picasso – as it happened","bodyText":"That’s it from me Graham Readfearn and for our live news coverage for today. Thanks to Royce Kurmelovs for his work for the bulk of this Sunday. Here’s what happened: Ten places in NSW have been given advice to evacuate as most rivers in regional areas are under flood warnings. Forecasters say more rain will hit already bulging rivers in NSW later this week. Police in Western Australia are looking for a 4WD driver after an elderly man on his electric bike was hit and killed near Perth. Two Extinction Rebellion activists were arrested at the National Gallery of Victoria after they glued themselves to Pablo Picasso’s Massacre in Korea. The protesters were not charged and XR says the painting was not harmed. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, stressed his government’s position on the stage-three tax cuts “hadn’t changed”. Former NT chief minister Michael Gunner, who resigned in May, has taken a role with mining magnate Andrew Forrest’s clean industry and hydrogen venture Fortescue Future Industries. Opposition leader Peter Dutton said he did not agree with calls for his party’s vice-president, Teena McQueen, to resign. McQueen had said party members should “rejoice” at the defeat of some of the party’s moderates in the last federal election. Thanks for being here, and if you’re anywhere threatened with flooding then please stay on top of the warnings from the SES and the Bureau of Meteorology. Stay safe. Someone in Dubbo took their dog out in a kayak to look at the flooding. Just four paramedics on standby at Indonesian football disaster, says official Only four paramedics were on standby inside the football stadium in Indonesia where 131 people were killed in a crowd crush, with a further 12 nearby, the head of the local public health office has said, promising a thorough evaluation of the response. The match was not considered to be a high-risk event because only fans of Arema, the home side, were present, said Wiyanto Wijoyo, the head of Malang regency public health office. Supporters of the opposing team, Persebaya Surabaya, who won the match, had been banned as a precaution to prevent violence between rival fans. Anyone in inland NSW can stay up to date with the many flood warnings here at the Bureau of Meteorology’s summary page of warnings. The NSW SES have issued another evacuation request along the Hawkesbury River, this time for areas in the town of Richmond north-west of Sydney. The evacuation alert affects parts of Cornwallis and eastern part of Richmond Lowlands. People on the Hawkesbury River bounded by Kurrajong Road, the back of Francis Street, the back of Dight Street, Percival Street and Rickabys Creek are being asked to evacuate before 11.45pm. This includes Bensons Lane; Cornwallis Road; Cornwells Lane; Cupritts Lane; Gow Lane; Ingolds Lane; Old Kurrajong Road; Onus Lane; Percival Street; Powells Lane; Ridges Lane; and Triangle Lane. The SES says if people cannot find alternative accommodation they should go to the evacuation centre set up at Castle Hill RSL. The river level at Windsor could go above moderate flood levels this evening, reaching 8.1 metres on Monday afternoon. PM rides Perth’s first airport train In amongst pushing away questions about tax cuts and the nuclear threat from the Ukraine conflict, prime minister Anthony Albanese squeezed on a train for a selfie with WA premier Mark McGowan and the state’s transport minister Rita Saffioti. Albanese rode the first train of the new $1.86bn Metronet airport line when it pulled out of High Wycombe station this morning, alongside 40 “lucky” lottery winners. The new airport line goes underneath the Swan River and Perth airport and adds 8.5km to the city’s rail network. The Guardian’s live coverage of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in ongoing, with reports that at least 17 people have been killed in shelling in the city of Zaporizhzhia. The NSW SES says people living in an area of Sackville should evacuate before 11.45pm tonight as the Hawkesbury River rises. The agency says properties near the intersection of Sackville Road and Tizzana Road should evacuate with dangerous flooding expected. Anyone who can’t find alternative accommodation with family or friends should go to the evacuation facility at the North Richmond Community Centre. A route along Sackville Road and then Kurmond Road should be taken, as some roads could also flood tonight. The evacuation request for the locality is the eighth to have been issued across the state since yesterday. Police in Western Australia are looking for the driver of a four-wheel drive involved in a fatal crash that killed an 86-year-old man riding an electric bike, AAP reports. The man was hit on the Mitchell Freeway, near Perth, just before 5am today near the Hepburn Avenue exit. Police believe a silver Mitsubishi four-wheel drive struck the man but did not stop. The man died at the scene from critical injuries. The car involved would have significant front end damage, particularly on the left-hand passenger side, police said. An Extinction Rebellion spokesperson has told Guardian Australia that a Picasso painting in Melbourne had not been damaged when two activists glued themselves to it. The spokesperson said the Picasso painting, Massacre in Korea, at Melbourne’s NGV was “perfectly OK”. Only the clear plastic covering over the painting had been damaged, the spokesperson said. We’ve heard about flooding in New South Wales, a new green job for former NT chief minister and two activists have glued themselves to a Picasso. Here’s a summary of what’s been happening today. Most inland rivers in NSW are under flood warnings after torrential rain overnight. River heights are still rising in many places with a forecast of more heavy rain from Wednesday. Residents across the state have been asked to be vigilant, not to drive through flood waters and stay across SES warnings. Two Extinction Rebellion activists were arrested at the National Gallery of Victoria after they glued themselves to Pablo Picasso’s Massacre in Korea. The painting had a protective cover. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, stressed his government’s position on the stage-three tax cuts “hasn’t changed” during a press conference in Perth. Former NT chief minister Michael Gunner, who resigned in May, has taken a role with mining magnate Andrew Forrest’s clean industry and hydrogen venture Fortescue Future Industries. Opposition leader Peter Dutton said he did not agree with calls for his party’s vice-president, Teena McQueen, to resign. McQueen had said party members should “rejoice” at the defeat of some of the party’s moderates in the last federal election. On we go. Thanks to Royce Kurmelovs for guiding us through our live news coverage. I’m Graham Readfearn and I’ll be keeping things going for the rest of the day. If you’re travelling in regional parts of New South Wales, be careful on those flooded roads. Man in stable condition following shark attack A man in his 30s who suffered serious injuries to his arm from a shark bite remains in a stable condition in the Royal Perth hospital. Early reports suggested the man had been spear fishing near Port Hedland yesterday morning when he was bitten by an unknown species of shark. A Royal Flying Doctors service spokesperson said yesterday the man’s left arm had been almost severed by the shark. The hospital confirmed the man was still in a stable condition. Fox News reports that 22 out of 28 cars have either been off track or been involved in some sort of incident during the Bathurst 1000. Whether it’s bushfire smoke or torrential rain, the moment is a good reminder of how climate change threatens the future of sport. Two Extinction Rebellion activists have glued themselves to a Pablo Picasso work at the National Gallery of Victoria. Photos posted to social media show two protesters glued to Picasso’s Massacre in Korea – a 1951 anti-war expressionist painting – in the gallery on Sunday afternoon. A spokesperson for Extinction Rebellion told Guardian Australia the two protesters had been arrested and taken to a police station in Southbank. The spokesperson said a conservator from the gallery used acetone to remove the superglue used by the protesters. The climate activist group said it targeted the high-profile painting to urge all governments, corporations and institutions to take action on the environmental crisis. A Victoria police spokesperson said they believed three protesters entered the gallery on the ground level before a man and a woman glued themselves to the protective covering of the Picasso painting. The spokesperson said a 49-year-old NSW woman and a 59-year old Footscray man were removed from the painting just after 2pm. The pair and a 49-year-old Williamstown man have been arrested and are assisting police with their enquiries. ‘It is a dangerous time’: PM on risk of nuclear escalation in Ukraine The prime minister will not be drawn over concerns about the growing risk of nuclear escalation in Ukraine saying: “It is a dangerous time.” What we know is that this is a dangerous time. One of the pressures on the budget of course is defence expenditure. We do not think that there would be a land war in Europe like we are seeing with the Russian invasion of Ukraine. We hoped that was something we had put in the past. After speaking of his time in Ukraine meeting president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Albanese said the situation could be resolved if Russia withdrew from Ukraine. They’re fighting for the international rule of law and they’re fighting to uphold the principle that nation states’ borders should be respected. President Putin can fix this by just withdrawing. By withdrawing from this aggressive act that is totally against international law. His comments echo those of Finnish prime minister Sanna Marin who said Russia “leaving Ukraine” was the only way the conflict would end. Albanese is attempting to water down speculation over which way his government will go on the future of stage-three tax cuts ahead of the 25 October budget saying: “Our position hasn’t changed.” Albanese has repeated the line several times while also preparing Australians for potential cuts: We are triaging a budget where there is a trillion dollars of debt and frankly not much to show for it. Federal government ready to offer flood assistance to NSW Prime minister Anthony Albanese says the federal government is ready to offer assistance to the New South Wales government if required following the floods across the state. Speaking from Perth, Albanese said the government has been preparing since Friday to ensure it is able to help. Virtual elder care in SA to free up emergency departments Thousands of elderly South Australians will avoid unnecessary trips to hospital following the expansion of a virtual health service trial. Following a successful test run, SA’s Virtual Care Service is being rolled out at more than 150 residential care facilities, which are home to more than 11,000 residents. The program will also help reduce demand on the state’s under-fire ambulance service and emergency departments, the health minister Chris Picton said. The trial, undertaken at 11 Eldercare aged care homes, found about 80% of patients treated by the service could receive care within the home, avoiding the need for hospital and an unnecessary triple-zero call. The service provides direct access to specialist medical, nursing and paramedic clinicians. Facilities can instead organise video link consultations to assess, monitor and determine care options, which can often be provided in-house. Approximately 35 SA aged care residents are taken to metropolitan emergency departments each day. Due to their age and sometimes complex needs, they often end up admitted to hospital unnecessarily. Picton said on Sunday that the service will ensure older South Australians and vulnerable patients can receive “the care they need outside of hospital”. It will deliver better care for more residents and their families in a comfortable and familiar setting, freeing up emergency resources across the health system. The service is expected to receive approximately 18 referrals per day – calls that would otherwise have resulted in an ambulance call-out. It is estimated every aged care resident who avoids a trip to the ED frees up at least six hours there and two hours for the state’s ambulance service. SA’s most serious emergency cases increased by more than 6% in September compared with the same time a year ago. There was also a 2.3% jump in these cases compared with August. – from AAP Australia to form new supercontinent – in 300m years Australia will merge to form a new supercontinent about 300m years from now, according to research by two Perth-based scientists. Curtin University’s Dr Chuan Huang and Prof Zheng-Xiang Li estimate the configuration of “Amasia” will form as the Pacific Ocean closes in roughly 200m to 300m years from now. Using a supercomputer to simulate the scenario, they found that because Earth has been cooling for billions of years, the thickness and strength of undersea plates reduce with time. This would make it difficult for the next supercontinent to assemble by closing “young” oceans like the Atlantic or Indian. Australia is expected to play an important role, first colliding with Asia and then connecting it to America. “By simulating how the Earth’s tectonic plates are expected to evolve ... we were able to show that in less than 300m years it is likely to be the Pacific Ocean that will close, allowing for the formation of Amasia, debunking some previous scientific theories,” Huang said. Still covering 30% of the planet’s surface, the Pacific Ocean is what is left of the Panthalassa super ocean that started forming 700m years ago when the previous supercontinent started breaking apart. Currently open to a dimension of about 10,000km, it’s been shrinking since the time of the dinosaurs at a rate of a few centimetres a year. Li says the presence of a single continental mass will dramatically alter Earth’s ecosystem and environment. “The sea level is expected to be lower and the vast interior of the supercontinent will be very arid with high daily temperature ranges,” he said. “Currently, Earth consists of seven continents with widely different ecosystems and human cultures, so it would be fascinating to think what the world might look like in 200m to 300m years.” – with AAP First Australian Crankworx concludes in Cairns The first-ever Australian leg of Crankworx, the leading global mountain biking competition, concludes today in Cairns. The multi-day event ends with the dual slalom races, as two riders battle side-by-side against each other and the clock. Australian riders have already enjoyed a strong Crankworx, with Canberra’s Harriet Burbidge-Smith winning gold in the speed and style final on Thursday. Burbidge-Smith was a BMX world champion before switching to mountain biking in her early 20s. “Haz” is on a mission to get more women into the sport. Cooke: NSW government to ‘press on’ with plans to raise dam wall Cooke is back and asked whether the state government needs to reconsider development plans for low-lying areas in the flood plain. “The NSW government is taking these matters very seriously,” the emergency services minister says. She says the government has accepted all recommendations of a recent inquiry and will “press on” with plans to raise the wall of the Warragamba dam. York is also asked what the state of the wall of dam is, given it has been under pressure for a significant period of time. She says that is a question better directed to Water NSW. ‘All floods are dangerous’: York York says that “all floods are dangerous”: Some floods are slower moving and some in western parts of New South Wales, you can get little warning time. It does not mean there is any more time to avoid flash floods and that is what we’re really concerned about. The water will build up and create a flash flood. And it will cut off roads. It will cut off or raise the risk for livestock as well. York: people who stay may put emergency staff at risk York is asked about people who chose to stay making the circumstances more difficult for first responders, and she says it does, particularly coming out of “two, three” years of drought. It is a completely different picture across New South Wales. It is saturated and there is nowhere for the water to go except across the land and to any properties on its way. York: I would caution people who make that decision who think to stay safe in their homes, it is much better to move out when you have time and that is not traffic on the road. You can get to safety and higher ground and go back to the house when it is high and dry and call at two o’clock in the morning when we may not be able to get there, depending on how many calls for assistance [we have]. And the weather conditions, if it is raining, it makes things very difficult. [We] can’t get helicopters up and you are putting emergency service personnel lives at risk. We try to give as much notice as possible so they can evacuate in an orderly fashion and get somewhere safe. SES warns NSW residents to evacuate early The NSW State Emergency Service has issued 94 warnings issues across the state, with the commissioner Carlene York warning residents to evacuate early and take extra precautions. It is very dangerous out there on our roads. We are seeing a lot of flash flooding and as we have said the rivers are still rising. York asked people to pay attention to evacuation orders and said evacuation centres have been opened to accomodate them. When you ask people, if you have to evacuate or are planning to evacuate, reach out to family and friends first and if you can’t do that, we will make sure of the right evacuation centres you can go to. BoM: Low pressure system moves off the coast Jane Golding from the Bureau of Meteorology says several regions are being monitored, including Gunnedah. In summary, from this recent rain we’ve seen over the last week, it looks like the low pressure system that caused the rain over last night has now moved off the coast. Though Golding said the rain has stopped, flooding will continue through the week. Now we’re turning our eyes towards the next system. ‘Completely saturated landscape’: NSW emergency services minister The New South Wales emergency services minister Steph Cooke is giving an update now on the situation facing the state. Cooke says the state has a “completely saturated landscape” with the risk of trees falling in strong winds and landslips as the state’s dams fill to capacity. We know that in our inland New South Wales regions, the flood waters will continue to be a problem for communities not just for the weeks ahead, but for months. Flood warnings for rain-soaked parts of NSW The Bureau of Meteorology says areas hit by heavy rain are expected to reach major or near major flood levels over the coming days. Those areas include: Warren on the Macquarie River Nanami, Cottons Weir, Jemalong, Euabalong, Forbes on the Lachlan River Gundagai on the Murrumbidgee River Weilmoringle on the Culgoa River Tilpa on the Darling River The bureau also advised some catchments east of the divide were experiencing new flooding, including the Hawkesbury and Nepean. Rain will ease throughout the rest of Sunday with no significant rainfalls expected for the next few days but conditions will worsen again from Wednesday to Friday. Speaking of wet conditions… Three cars have been totalled and ruled out of the race in a chaotic start to the Bathurst 1000 at Mount Panorama. The safety car was deployed twice within the opening five laps on Sunday. James Moffat lost pole immediately off the start to a surging Lee Holdsworth and when the pack rounded turn one, Jamie Whincup and Jack Perkins were spun around. Zak Best’s car 55 was the mountain’s first casualty and towed off the circuit after veering into the barriers. When the race restarted on lap five, Zane Goddard left the track attempting an overtake and lost control rejoining the tarmac. He veered across the track and was smashed into by Dale Wood in the R&amp;J Batteries entry, with Matt Campbell joined the pile-up. All three cars were totalled. Campbell reported a sore ankle, groin, neck and wrists while Wood and Goddard walked away unscathed. Racing in his 20th Bathurst, 2103 champion Mark Winterbottom got tangled up and spun out but narrowly avoided any major damage in the incident. Wood was seen crying back in pit lane after the incident, with only one of Brad Jones Racing’s cars left in the race. Dry track conditions and fine weather prevailed as the Bathurst 1000 got under way, with the majority of teams opting for their co-drivers to begin the 1,000km race. The only main driver among the top 10 starters was retirement-bound Holdsworth, who held the early lead. – from AAP Michael Gunner ‘finally seeing the light’, say campaigners Environmentalists have congratulated the Northern Territory’s former chief minister Michael Gunner “for finally seeing the light” after he revealed earlier today he had taken a role with mining magnate Andrew Forrest’s clean industry company. Gunner, who resigned as chief minister in May, will lead a new northern Australia team at Fortescue Future Industries. Co-director of the Environment Centre NT Kirsty Howey said Gunner’s new role was in contrast to his support for fossil fuels during his time as chief minister that had left behind “a legacy of climate-wrecking projects”. Howey said: The Environment Centre NT congratulates former chief minister Michael Gunner for finally seeing the light on climate and looks forward to working with him in his new role with Fortescue Future Industries. However, Territorians can’t forget the devastating legacy of climate-wrecking projects that the former chief minister leaves behind. No one has pushed harder for new fossil fuel development in the Territory than Mr Gunner. Howey said during Gunner’s tenure, the territory government had approved fracking in the Beetaloo Basin, supported Santos’s Barossa gas project and pushed for a petrochemicals precinct. It’s well past time for the Northern Territory Fyles government and the Albanese government to abandon plans for the three new mega gas projects in the Northern Territory: the Beetaloo Basin, the Barossa gas project and the petrochemicals precinct at Middle Arm, including the billions in federal subsidies thrown at these projects. Madeleine King: ‘no plans’ to change stage-three tax cuts The prime minister Anthony Albanese is likely to be asked about the fate of the stage-three tax cuts later today amid growing expectations the government will stop short of making changes in this month’s budget. Albanese is due to appear in public in Western Australia about 10.30am Perth time (1.30pm AEDT), followed by a press conference at 2.15pm AEDT. Ahead of his press conference, no one has disputed reports from Sky News and the ABC that the government is highly unlikely to make changes to the stage-three tax cuts in the budget due to be handed down on 25 October. That does not close off the possibility of changes in the next budget in May. Albanese said on Friday that the government’s position had not changed but did not rule out amendments, following a week of debate fuelled by the treasurer Jim Chalmers saying the government would be prepared to make tough decisions reflecting the economic times. In an interview recorded late in the week but broadcast on Sky News this morning, the resources minister Madeleine King said the government had “no plans” to change the stage-three tax cuts but there was a “conversation going in the community”. King added that it was “OK to have an open conversation” about tax and budget issues. Michael Gunner joins Andrew Forrest’s green energy firm The Northern Territory’s former chief minister Michael Gunner has landed a new job with a green energy company owned by mining billionaire Andrew Forrest. The former NT Labor leader has been hired to head up the northern Australia team at Fortescue Future Industries as the company looks to develop new projects in the territory and across Western Australia’s north-west. Gunner said in a statement that he looked forward to working on projects aimed at addressing climate change and said he made the move “for the kids”. The pitch from Dr Forrest and FFI was simple and straight to the heart – do it for the kids. By going hard commercially at real zero, at FFI we help make the genuine impacts on climate change that the world needs. My message is clear: FFI is committed to aggressively reducing emissions and FFI is here now. Forrest said in a statement that Gunner’s experience “working hand-in-hand with the people of northern Australia” would make the new hire a “valuable asset to FFI”. We see enormous potential in the Northern Territory, with abundant wind and solar energy, and a community enthusiastic to embrace renewable energy and the employment-intensive industries that come with it. The industry-leading decarbonisation strategy we unveiled in New York in September provided clear evidence that Fortescue is leading the world in its transition to a global, green renewable and resources company. Gunner is not the only former Labor leader to pick up a new gig with Forrest. The former South Australian premier Jay Weatherill has been appointed as chief executive of the mining billionaire’s charity, the Minderoo Foundation. Bathurst 1000 under way amid fine weather Dry track conditions and fine weather prevailed as the Bathurst 1000 got under way, with the majority of teams opting for their co-drivers to begin the 1,000km race. After three days of rain and overcast conditions, the sun finally arrived over Mount Panorama on Sunday with the weather set to be favourable throughout the day. Australia’s biggest domestic motorsport prize is up for grabs and the Tickford Racing pair of Cam Waters and co-driver James Moffat started from pole following the cancellation of Saturday’s top-10 shootout. Waters qualified fastest in Friday’s first qualifying for his second Bathurst pole, but it was Moffat who got first crack at the mountain. The pair were looking to go one better after consecutive second-placed finishes in the race in the previous two years. Moffat was one of 19 co-drivers who started, with nine of the grid’s top 10 all co-drivers. The only lead driver among the top 10 starters was retirement-bound Lee Holdsworth in his 19th consecutive Great Race. Fans swarmed the grid for Bathurst’s first maximum-capacity event since the pandemic began. Motorsport officials notified drivers in the two-minute warning that the circuit was still wet on the exit of turn one. – from AAP More rain for western and southern NSW Bad news for those living in western and southern New South Wales – more rain on the way later in the week. Fifth-highest September rainfall in NSW since 1900 New South Wales has experienced the fifth-highest September rainfall since records began in 1900, according to the Bureau of Meteorology. Some regions recorded their highest September daily rainfall ever on the 18th or the 16th, when strong cold fronts moved across the state, or on the 3rd, 22nd, 23rd, 24th, or 29th, following offshore low pressure systems. Political fundraisers axed ahead of budget Political fundraisers at Parliament House are due to be canned in the lead-up to the federal budget, AAP reports. The prime minister Anthony Albanese wrote to the parliament’s speaker and president asking for the ban. It’s understood the House or Representatives speaker Milton Dick and Senate president Sue Lines agreed and it will come into effect on 17 October, a week ahead of the federal budget. The shadow treasurer Angus Taylor told Sky News on Sunday he was yet to see the detail but branded the move “a political stunt”. Political fundraising is part of our system. It’s how it works. [The Coalition] don’t have the ability to rely on the unions the way Labor does. So for us, it’s actually about going out to hardworking Australians and getting their support. And we have to do that all the time. Frankston to be boom gate free by 2029 if Labor government re-elected The Andrews government has pledged to make Melbourne’s Frankston boom gate free by 2029 by removing seven level crossings. The Victorian premier Daniel Andrews made the announcement on Sunday morning. As part of the project, there will be two road closures and new stations built at Highett, Mordialloc, Aspendale and Seaford. Andrews said the pledge would ease road congestion and improve safety: To be level crossing free means you can run more trains more often. It’s safer and of course the road network is improved with people not being held up. New South Wales state emergency services conducted 21 flood rescues overnight with the majority involving people who became stuck while attempting to drive through flood waters. Speaking to ABC News this morning SES assistant commissioner Dean Storey urged residents of NSW to be cautious as rain eases across the state especially as conditions may be “deceptive”. Know the sun may be out in some locations, the rivers are still on the rise in many areas. [We’re] happy to see that the rain eased across much of the state, but that flooding risk remains in play. A lot of water on the ground across roads. So [we’re] urging people who are out on the roads in the coming days to be vigilant of that fact. Drive to conditions. Storey said the SES is working with community members to help support them as they grappled with a “widespread flooding event”. We know there’s been major flooding and will continue to be major flooding in inland NSW and the west and the south for the coming days, weeks and months. Labor opposition promises overhaul to labour laws if elected in NSW The NSW Labor party has vowed to modernise the state’s employment law to better protect gig economy workers, if it is elected in March next year. NSW Labor leader Chris Minns announced on Sunday that the party would introduce worker’s compensation and what it called “a portable entitlement scheme” for gig workers and others in insecure employment. They would also amend the Industrial Relations Act so that workers in the transport industry and food delivery services could access minimum rates and conditions, and establish enforceable codes of conduct for WHS work performed by on-demand platforms, among other measures. In a statement, NSW Labor said the laws were designed to prevent more workers falling foul of “an out-of-date workers compensation system” that denied the families of four food delivery riders who died in NSW in 2020 any statutory compensation, as they were not hired as employees by the companies they worked for. The policies would also assist workers in the disability, community and care sectors, Labor said. Minns said in a statement: The rise of the gig economy has revolutionised the way people can access work. But that shouldn’t mean workers should be left more vulnerable. Every single worker in New South Wales has the right to feel safe and supported at work. Shadow industrial relations and workplace safety minister Sophie Cotsis said: After 12 years of this Liberal and National government we have seen an erosion of basic rights and entitlements of a growing segment of the working population, particularly women in these key care sectors. For many have felt abandoned by this government which has created employment insecurity and hardship and feel deprived of basic entitlements which affects their ability to get a loan, secure rental accommodation and support their families. NSW Labor’s policy provides security, dignity and acknowledges the significant contribution of these workers to our society. NSW Labor’s election pledge comes in the wake of the federal Labor government promising to establish minimum pay and conditions for gig workers, saying they would legislate to give the Fair Work Commission the power to set minimum standards and allow them to bargain collectively for entitlements. More rain and high winds are predicted for Sunday. Residents of Gronos Point have been told to leave ahead of flooding. On that last question, for those who missed what happened during the week it is worth reading the full story by Guardian Australia political reporter Josh Butler. Dutton on the stoush between Tina McQueen and Simon Birmingham Following comments by McQueen that the party should “rejoice” that the party’s moderates were defeated at the last election. Dutton: There is a desire here to win the next election. We will only do that with discipline and the party that I lead is frankly having grown up under John Howard and Peter Costello and that’s the approach that I take. A winner-takes-all approach in the Liberal party or Labor party doesn’t work on a broad range of views. Speers asks Dutton about the comments by Birmingham that McQueen should resigned. No, I don’t agree with that. She has expressed a view, she has made a mistake. I’ve made it clear it won’t happen again. Did McQueen apologise? That’s what I expect on both sides. Speers then asks whether McQueen should apologise. I’m not going into internal matters beyond that. Dutton on whether Essendon should reinstate Andrew Thorburn Andrew Thorburn resigned over his links to a church that is anti-abortion and considers homosexuality a sin. After backing in Thorburn who Dutton said “distanced” himself from the comments of his pastor, Speers asks: Should organisations be able to hire and fire based on someone’s sexuality? Dutton: Well, I don’t support discrimination on any basis, to be honest. Speers: So religious schools shouldn’t sack a gay teacher? Dutton: Again, we’ve had these debates over the last couple of years and... Speers: What do you think? Dutton: Go into Chris Bowen’s electorate, obviously a lot of comment from local mayors there this week about different issues. Islamic schools, Jewish schools, Christian schools in our country who want to teach their faith and they should be free to do so. If they have children enrolled in that school by their parents, the parents expect that there will be an adherence to that doctrine... Speers: So you don’t support discrimination on any basis, except for religious schools and gay teachers? Dutton: Again, David, if you are a person of a Jewish faith and you are sending your child to that school, it is for a reason. You’ve made a decision to send your child there to receive religious as part of a more general education and that should be unhindered, so any thought that somebody could be discriminated as in the circumstance of Mr Thorburn is completely unacceptable. Bringing children home presents a security risk: Dutton Dutton says there is a chance “indoctrination has occurred”. He is then asked why it was OK for the Morrison government to bring a child home but not Labor – and his own track record on this issue. Dutton: As much as I feel for those families, those kids, they are horrible scenes, and the fact that someone has taken their children or wife or family member into that theatre of war is tragic, but I’ve also got to think about the safety and security of other toddlers and families here, and if we think the threat has gone away, that they couldn’t act out, that there wouldn’t be an explosion in our country, that is a naive approach to what is a very difficult situation. Dutton on whether bringing home families of Islamic State fighters is a security risk Dutton is now asked on the plan to bring home the family’s of Islamic State fighters who are stuck in refugee camps in Syria. He is specifically asked about whether he was told that bringing these family’s back to Australia would be a security risk. It’s built on what I received when I was in the National Security Committee not that long ago, and it is clear to me that on what I know and what I’ve read and what I’ve heard and been informed on, that we can’t provide the level of surety to the Australian public. Now, is it a terrible situation for the families? Absolutely. Dutton goes on to express empathy but then highlights the cost of security. If you are a parent or grandparent of a daughter … in that situation, of course you would want to bring them back home. Any person would have that feeling or emotion, that’s perfectly logical, but we have to be careful of children and people in that setting, and mixing with people of terrorist attacks over a period of time. It costs $3.8m a year and 300 police officers to 24/7 monitor one individual. Labor’s instinct on economy is ‘always the wrong one’: Dutton Dutton is again challenged to see if there’s room to negotiation, but it seems he’s leaving no room to negotiate at all in this interview – it’s the Coalition’s way or no way at all. On taxation, on economic policy is all wrong. This is the problem. Governments have to deal with events as they come along. Labor’s instinct on the economy and on the budget is always the wrong one. Dutton on his answer to filling the gap should stage-three tax cuts go through Dutton: If you look at even post lockdowns on a month by month basis, you can see months where we’ve gone back into surplus, so the settings we have in government, our instinct as Liberals, as a Coalition when it comes to budget management are vindicated. When you look at where we are with a 50-year low unemployment, when you look at the strength of the underlying indicators here in Australia, that is a very significant contrast to where the UK or US budget is, and this government inherited a very strong position after nine years of Coalition management. PM needs to ‘honour his commitment’ to Australians: Dutton Speers asks Dutton about whether he would provide any support to pare back the stage-three tax cuts. Dutton: David, we went to the last election with a promise and I’m not in the business of breaking promises. The prime minister can contemplate it. He looked the Australian public in the eye and it seems he wasn’t so genuine and that he was prepared to make that statement. Speers tries to knock Dutton off his messaging and pin him down to an answer by asking whether, if the tax cuts were pared back, the Coalition would see it all returned. Dutton: I want to see the prime minister honour his commitment and not lie to the Australian people. Opposition leader Peter Dutton is speaking on ABC Insiders now answering questions on the subject of – you guessed it – stage-three tax cuts. Dutton is working hard to reframe the debate not one about the future of the stage-three tax cuts or how much funding for services may be lost and about whether Australians can trust Anthony Albanese. What we’ve seen this week is a real split between the prime minister and treasurer and the treasurer has demonstrated his inexperience. He is obviously close to Wayne Swan and studied Paul Keating very closely. He has been out there purring a particular argument and the prime minister I think sensibly has abandoned that. He might be instinctive to abandon, but this is not about tax cuts, but whether you can trust Anthony Albanese and the Labor party […] I think most Australians would be astounded that Anthony Albanese was on the cusp of betraying them or may do in the next budget or the one after. Growing number of Australians want stage-three tax cuts scrapped, poll shows Public support for the stage-three tax cuts continues to fall, with polling showing increased support for scrapping the $243bn plan. The last stage of the Morrison government tax reform is not legislated to come into effect until July 2024, but a downturn in the economy has put increased pressure on the Labor government to make a decision on whether it will keep the cuts in place. The Australia Institute’s most recent poll, conducted between 4-7 October, found support for repealing the stage three cuts jumped 7% from the previous month. Support for repealing the tax cuts now sits at 48%, with those opposed to the move unchanged at 22%. Those who were unsure or didn’t know about the tax cuts had fallen from 37% to 30%. For more on the results of this poll read the full story by Guardian Australia’s political reporter Amy Remeikis. The ABC is now also reporting that it is highly unlikely that the Albanese government will change the stage-three tax cuts in this month’s budget. The government had always maintained that its position had not changed – but the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, had allowed a debate to run in public about whether changes might be needed. The ABC Insiders host, David Speers, reported today that no final decision had been made but he had been told it was now highly unlikely there would be any change, “at least not the budget to be delivered in just over two weeks”. Sky News had a similar report this morning. We are chasing confirmation but the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is likely to speak in Western Australia later today. ABC Insiders host David Speers has opened his program saying the government is “highly unlikely” to abandon the stage-three tax cuts in the upcoming budget. After a week of intense debate, it now looks like the stage-three tax cuts will remain untouched – for now, anyway. This morning I can reveal the prime minister is likely to stick with his promise and keep the tax cuts in this month’s budget. This is the same talking point that’s been repeated across multiple media outlets this morning – suggesting someone has been busy. Scrapping stage-three tax cuts would be a ‘war on aspiration’: Angus Taylor The shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor, has welcomed a Sky News report today that the government is unlikely to unveil changes to the stage-three tax cuts in this month’s budget – but has called on the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, to confirm this. (The government has allowed this debate to run the past week, but it has never been a sure thing that such changes would be made in this budget, given that there is still a while under the tax cuts are due to come into effect.) Appearing on Sky News, Taylor said scrapping stage-three tax cuts would be a “war on aspiration”. Taylor welcomed the report that such changes were unlikely in this budget was encouraging – but said it “doesn’t count” until Albanese stands up in public and rules it out: It’s very clear it’s in Labor’s DNA to tax Australians more. ‘No plans’ to change stage-three tax cuts: King Resources minister, Madeleine King, has reiterated that the government has “no plans” to change the stage-three tax cuts. She stuck closely to the government line in her Sky News interview, noting that the tax cuts were already legislated. But she said there was a “conversation going in the community” and it was “OK to have an open conversation” about tax and budget issues. Government prepared to intervene if gas prices don’t come down The resources minister, Madeleine King, has put gas producers on notice that she is prepared to intervene if gas prices don’t come down. King last month announced a deal with the three major gas exporters on the east coast aiming to ensure sufficient supplies of the fossil fuel are available to avoid a potential shortfall next year. During an interview with Sky News broadcast this morning, King was asked about the effect on prices. She said gas prices would “continue to fluctuate” but the gas agreement should deliver “downward pressure” on prices. King said if prices did not come down “there will be more for the government to do in that regard”: If they fail to do that, the government always has other levers. More broadly, the resources minister denied she working at cross purposes to Chris Bowen, the climate minister: Not at all – we’re working together to the same ends. King said the previous government “probably did” have too many fossil fuel subsidies. She said of new coal and gas fields: If they’re not financially able to stand on their own two feet, there shouldn’t be government injection of cash into them – that does not make sense, especially in these constrained times. And welcome to another Sunday morning Guardian live blog. New South Wales state emergency service have carried out 21 rescues and responded to more than 343 calls for help overnight as residents in some parts of the state have woken up to evacuation orders. Rising flood waters have forced residents in Gronos Point and western Plane Tourist Park in Dubbo to be evacuated with Australia Defence Force personnel are on standby. Speculation over the fate of the stage-three tax cuts continues ahead of the 25 October budget as the Labor government tests the waters on whether to carry them through. Faced with the prospect to carry them through in full, pare them back or scrap them entirely it is expected the government will make its position known ahead of the budget. I’m Royce Kurmelovs, taking the blog through the day. With so much going on out there, it’s easy to miss stuff, so if you spot something happening in Australia and think it should be on the blog, you can find me on Twitter at @RoyceRk2 where my DMs are open.

The project near Manchester, UK, will use spare green energy to compress air into a liquid and store it. When demand is higher, the liquid air is released back into a gas, powering a turbine that puts the green energy back into the grid. A big expansion of wind and solar energy is vital to tackle the climate emergency but they are not always available. Storage is therefore key and the new project will be the largest in the world outside of pumped hydro schemes, which require a mountain reservoir to store water. The new liquid air battery, being developed by Highview Power, is due to be operational in 2022 and will be able to power up to 200,000 homes for five hours, and store power for many weeks. Chemical batteries are also needed for the transition to a zero-carbon world and are plummeting in price, but can only store relatively small amounts of electricity for short periods. Liquid air batteries can be constructed anywhere, said Highview’s chief executive, Javier Cavada: “Air is everywhere in the world. The main competitor is really not other storage technologies but fossil fuels, as people still want to continue building gas and coal-fired plants today, strangely enough,” he said. The UK government has supported the project with a £10m grant. The energy and clean growth minister, Kwasi Kwarteng, said: “This revolutionary new facility will form a key part of our push towards net zero, bringing greater flexibility to Britain’s electricity grid and creating green-collar jobs in Greater Manchester. “Projects like these will help us realise the full value of our world-class renewables, ensuring homes and businesses can still be powered by green energy, even when the sun is not shining and the wind not blowing,” he said. The UK government is being urged to make the economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic a green one. “We owe it to future generations to build back better,” said the prime minister, Boris Johnson, recently, while the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is reported to be planning a “green industrial revolution”. Alex Buckman, an energy storage expert at the Energy Systems Catapult group, said polluting gas power plants were the main way the UK electricity grid was balanced. But a net zero carbon system would need more than the 30% renewable energy of today and therefore more storage. “There is likely going to be a need for one or more of the medium-to-long duration electricity storage technologies to fill a gap in the market, and liquid air energy storage (LAES) is right up there as an option,” he said. Pumped hydro is limited by the need for a mountain reservoir, while gravity storage – where you raise a weight and then let it drop to power a generator – is less developed, as is large-scale production of hydrogen fuel from green energy. “The combination of being more developed and more scalable provides LAES with an opportunity to be competitive, if they can prove that they can reduce costs with increased scale,” Buckman said. The Highview battery will store 250MWh of energy, almost double the amount stored by the biggest chemical battery, built by Tesla in South Australia. The new project is sited at the Trafford Energy Park, also home to the Carrington gas-powered energy plant and a closed coal power station. The project will cost £85m, and Highview received £35m of investment from the Japanese machinery giant Sumitomo in February. The liquid air battery is creating 200 jobs, mainly in construction, and employing former oil and gas engineers, with a few dozen in the continuing operation. The plant’s lifetime is expected to be 30-40 years. “It will pass to the next generation,” said Cavada. Highview is developing other sites in the UK, continental Europe and the US, including in Vermont, but the Manchester project will be the first. “The first one is definitely the most important and this is why we really value the UK government’s bold move to use UK technology to solve UK problems and afterwards export the tech globally,” said Cavada."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/mar/20/our-biggest-challenge-lack-of-imagination-the-scientists-turning-the-desert-green","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-03-20T12:00:25Z","webTitle":"‘Our biggest challenge?

Lack of imagination’: the scientists turning the desert green","bodyText":"Flying into Egypt in early February to make the most important presentation of his life, Ties van der Hoeven prepared by listening to the podcast 13 Minutes To The Moon – the story of how Nasa accomplished the lunar landings. The mission he was discussing with the Egyptian government was more earthbound in nature, but every bit as ambitious. It could even represent a giant leap for mankind. Van der Hoeven is a co-founder of the Weather Makers, a Dutch firm of “holistic engineers” with a plan to regreen the Sinai peninsula – the small triangle of land that connects Egypt to Asia. Within a couple of decades, the Weather Makers believe, the Sinai could be transformed from a hot, dry, barren desert into a green haven teeming with life: forests, wetlands, farming land, wild flora and fauna. A regreened Sinai would alter local weather patterns and even change the direction of the winds, bringing more rain, the Weather Makers believe – hence their name. “If anybody doubts that the Sinai can be regreened,” Van der Hoeven told the Egyptian delegates, an assortment of academics, representatives of ministers and military top brass, “then you have to understand that landing on the moon was once thought unrealistic. They didn’t lay out a full, detailed roadmap when they started, but they had the vision. And step by step they made it happen.” Van der Hoeven is nothing if not persuasive. Voluble, energetic and down-to-earth, the 40-year-old engineer’s train of thought runs through disciplines from morphology to esoteric mysticism, often threatening to jump the tracks. But he is keenly focused on the future. “This world is ready for regenerative change,” he says. “It’s going to be a complete change of our behaviour as a species in the longer term. It is going to be a step as big as fire was for humanity.” It sounds impossibly far-fetched, but not only is the Weather Makers’ plan perfectly feasible, they insist, it is precisely the type of project humanity should be getting its head around right now. In recent years, discussion about the climate crisis has predominantly focused on fossil fuels and greenhouse gases; now, we’re coming to realise that the other side of that coin is protecting and replenishing the natural world. There is no better mechanism for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than nature, but in the past 5,000 years, human activity has reduced the Earth’s total biomass by an estimated 50%, and destroyed or degraded 70% of the world’s forests. As UN secretary general António Guterres put it last year: “Human activities are at the root of our descent toward chaos. But that means human action can help to solve it.” The Weather Makers know this very well: their origins are in dredging, one of the heaviest industries there is. Over the past few centuries, dredging has helped humans alter the face of the planet on ever-greater scales. Trained as a morphological engineer, Van der Hoeven has spent the past decade in the industry, working on projects across the world, including the artificial islands of Dubai, whose creation involved large-scale dredging and land reclamation. He got sucked into the expat lifestyle there, he admits: drinking, eating, partying, “I lost a little bit of my soul.” Returning to the Netherlands in 2008, he began to reexamine his own profession: “What I could see is that the dredging industry had so much potential; we were just misusing it.” Working for the Belgian company Deme, he devised a new method of dredging that was both more eco-friendly and more efficient. He used inexpensive sensors to model maritime conditions in real time – waves, currents, tides – so as to determine more precisely where and when it was safe to work. Trialling the system, he won over sceptical colleagues by living on the vessel with them, even cooking meals. Head office was also convinced when his technique saved a small fortune. In January 2016, Van der Hoeven was contacted by Deme’s Egyptian representative, Malik Boukebbous, who had been asked by the Egyptian government to look into restoring Lake Bardawil, a lagoon on the north coast of the Sinai. The lake was once 20 to 40 metres deep, but today is just a few metres deep. Dredging the lake and cutting channels to allow more water in from the Mediterranean would make it deeper, cooler and less salty – all of which would boost fish stocks. But Van der Hoeven did not want to stop there. “If I feel I’m on the right track, it’s difficult for people to distract me,” he says. He began looking at the Sinai peninsula in more detail: its history, weather patterns, geology, tides, plant and animal life, even religious texts. He took himself off other projects and spent long hours in his apartment surrounded by charts, maps, books, sketched diagrams. “People were afraid for me because I was forgetting myself. My friends were cooking for me.” The deeper he looked, the more potential he saw. There is evidence that the Sinai once was green – as recently as 4,500 to 8,000 years ago. Cave paintings found there depict trees and plants. Records in the 1,500-year-old Saint Catherine’s monastery, near Mount Sinai, tally harvests of wood. Satellite images reveal a network of rivers flowing from the mountains in the south towards the Mediterranean. What turned the Sinai into a desert was, most likely, human activity. Wherever they settle, humans tend to chop down trees and clear land. This loss of vegetation affects the land’s ability to retain moisture. Grazing animals trample and consume plants when they try to grow back. The soil loses its structure and is washed away – hence the silt in Lake Bardawil. Van der Hoeven calculated the lake contained about 2.5bn cubic metres of silt. If one were to restore the Sinai, this vast reserve of nutrient-rich material was exactly what would be needed. “It became clear we had a massive opportunity,” he says. “It wasn’t the solution to a single problem; it was the solution to all the problems.” By this stage, Van der Hoeven and Deme agreed that he would be best off working as a separate entity, so in 2017 he founded the Weather Makers with two friends: Gijs Bosman and Maddie Akkermans. Both appear to be steadying influences. Bosman, a project manager at Dutch engineering firm Royal HaskoningDHV and a friend since student days, had the ability to translate Van der Hoeven’s grand vision into actionable technical detail. Akkermans has a background in finance and economics. “Ties said, ‘I’m too chaotic. So I can’t do this alone,’” she says. “Having someone like me who could tell him the truth and keep him on track gave him the confidence to start a company.” They consulted with experts across disciplines, in particular a handful of veterans who have been ploughing the eco-restoration furrow for decades. Van der Hoeven calls them his “Jedi”. The first of these is John D Liu, a Chinese-American ecologist with a background in broadcasting. Restoring a landscape as large and as degraded as the Sinai sounds like science fiction, but it has been done before. While Van der Hoeven was immersed in his research, a friend implored him to watch a documentary called Green Gold, which Liu had made for Dutch television in 2012. It chronicles the story of the Loess plateau, an area of northern China almost the size of France. In 1994, Liu, who was working as a television journalist in Beijing, was asked by the World Bank to film the start of an ambitious restoration project, led by a pioneering Chinese scientist, Li Rui. At that time, the Loess plateau was much like the Sinai: a dry, barren, heavily eroded landscape. The soil was washing away and silting up the Yellow river. Farmers could barely grow any crops. The plan to restore it was huge in scale but relatively low tech: planting trees on the hilltops; terracing the steep slopes (by hand); adding organic material to the soil; controlling grazing animals; retaining water. The transformation has been astonishing. Within 20 years, the deserts of the Loess plateau became green valleys and productive farmland, as Green Gold documents. “I watched it 35 times in a row,” says Van der Hoeven. “Seeing that, I thought, ‘Let’s go for it!’” The Loess plateau project was also a turning point for Liu, he says – away from broadcasting and towards ecosystem restoration: “You start to see that everything is connected. It’s almost like you’re in the Matrix.” Despite his Jedi status, 68-year-old Liu is easygoing and conversational, more midwestern ex-hippy than cryptic Zen master. Since 2009, he has been an ambassador for Commonland, a Dutch nonprofit, and an adviser to Ecosystem Restoration Camps – a global network of hands-on, volunteer communities. After watching Green Gold, the Weather Makers practically burst into Commonland’s Amsterdam headquarters to share their plans. “They were not going to be denied!” Liu recalls. “I said, ‘We have to work with these people, because this is the most audacious thesis I’ve ever seen.’” Liu brought Van der Hoeven to China to see the Loess plateau first-hand. “To be in a place that had been essentially a desert where now it’s raining cats and dogs, and it’s not flooding, because it’s being infiltrated and retained in the system – it was all just so impressive to him.” Through Liu, Van der Hoeven met another Jedi: Prof Millán Millán, a Spanish meteorologist. In the 1990s, Millán began investigating the disappearance of summer storms in eastern Spain for the European commission. “What I found is that the loss is directly linked to the building up of coastal areas,” he says. Rainfall in the region comes almost entirely from Mediterranean sea breezes. However, the breeze alone doesn’t carry enough water vapour to create a storm inland; it needs to pick up extra moisture, which it used to do from the marshes and wetlands along the coast. Over the past two centuries, however, these wetlands have been built on or converted to farming land. No additional moisture; no more storms. “Once you take too much vegetation out, it leads to desertification very quickly,” says Millán. Such changes do not just affect the weather at a local level, Millán discovered: “The water vapour that doesn’t precipitate over the mountains goes back to the Mediterranean and accumulates in layers for about four or five days, and then it goes somewhere else: central Europe.” In other words, building on the Spanish coast was creating floods in Germany. Millán’s findings have gone largely unheeded by the European commission, he says. Now 79 and retired, he speaks with the gentle weariness of a long-ignored expert: “My criticism to them was: the old township barber would pull your teeth with pliers. It hurt, but it was effective. You’re still using those procedures, but you could save all your teeth.” Millán’s research and Liu’s experience in the Loess plateau arrived at essentially the same conclusion. Chop down the trees, destroy the ecosystem, and the rains disappear; restore the ecosystem, make a wetter landscape, and the rains come back. Millán distilled his work down to a simple maxim: “Water begets water, soil is the womb, vegetation is the midwife.” Regreening the Sinai is to some extent a question of restarting that “water begets water” feedback loop. After restoring Lake Bardawil, the second phase is to expand and restore the wetlands around it so as to evaporate more moisture and increase biodiversity. The Sinai coast is already a major global crossing point for migratory birds; restored wetlands would encourage more birds, which would add fertility and new plant species. When it comes to restoring inland areas of the Sinai, there is another challenge: fresh water. This is where another Jedi came into play: John Todd, a mild-mannered marine biologist and a pioneer in ecological design. In the 1970s, frustrated by the narrowness of academia, Todd established the New Alchemy Institute, an alternative research community in Massachusetts dedicated to sustainable living. One of his innovations was the “eco machine” – a low-tech installation consisting of clear-sided water barrels covered by a greenhouse. “An eco machine is basically a living technology,” Todd explains. The principle is that water flows from one barrel to the next, and each barrel contains a mini ecosystem: algae, plants, bacteria, fungi, worms, insects, fish; like a series of manmade ponds. As the water flows, it becomes cleaner and cleaner. “You could design one that would treat toxic waste or sewage, or you could design one to grow food. They are solar-driven, and have within them a very large amount of biodiversity – in a sense, they reflect the aggregate experience of life on Earth over the last 3.5bn years.” In the Sinai, eco machines would be used to grow plants and to produce fresh water. Last autumn, the Weather Makers built their own eco machine on a pig farm on the outskirts of the Dutch city of s’-Hertogenbosch, where they are based. For the first step in a plan to change the world, it is not exactly prepossessing. It looks like a standard agricultural polytunnel. On a cold, drizzly day, Weather Maker Pieter van Hout gives me a virtual tour. Inside the greenhouse are six clear-sided barrels filled with water of various shades of green and brown. In some of the tanks is leaf litter and dead plant material. Van Hout points out the brown algae growing on the sides: phytoplankton, the basis of the food web, which feeds life further up the chain: insects, snails and, in one tank, fish (in the Sinai these would be edible tilapia). Some water evaporates from the barrels and condenses on the inside skin of the greenhouse, where it is collected by a system of gutters. Even on a cold day in the Netherlands, there is a constant trickle into a container on the ground. In the heat of the Sinai, the cycle would run much faster, says Van Hout. The water feeding the eco machine would be salt water, but the water that condenses inside would be fresh water, which can then be used to irrigate plants. If the structure is designed correctly, one would only need to drum on the outside to create an artificial “rain” inside. When the plants and the soil inside the greenhouse reach a certain maturity, they become self-sustaining. The greenhouse can then be removed and the process repeated in a different spot. “The idea is that you may have 100 of these structures,” says John Todd. “And they’re spending five years in one site and then they’re moved, so these little ecologies are left behind.” In the Sinai, the sediment from Lake Bardawil would be pumped up to the hills, 50km inland, where it would then trickle back down through a network of eco machines. The saltiness of the sediment is actually an asset, says Van Hout, in that it has preserved all the nutrients. Flushing them through the eco machines will “reactivate” them. Around the water tanks, they are now testing to see which salt-tolerant plant species, or halophytes, grow best. Van Hout proudly points out a stack of white plastic tubs containing silt freshly scooped from the bottom of Lake Bardawil. “This is what ecosystem restoration looks like in real life,” he laughs, “buckets of very expensive mud.” Estimates of how much difference a regreened Sinai could make are hard to quantify. In terms of carbon sequestration, it would doubtless be “billions of tons”, says Van der Hoeven. But such metrics are not always helpful: if you convert atmospheric carbon into, say, phytoplankton, what happens when a fish eats that phytoplankton? Or when a bigger fish eats that fish? The effect of regreening deserts is the subject of some debate. Deserts play a crucial role in cooling the planet since they reflect up to 30% of the solar radiation that falls on them back into space – a measure known as albedo. Areas covered by vegetation are darker and less reflective, so have a lower albedo (10-15%), and thus absorb more sunlight, which could have a warming effect. Furthermore, of the remaining 70% of the solar radiation that is not reflected in deserts, around two-thirds is emitted back into the atmosphere as long-wave radiation; in other words, heat. With little cloud cover or moisture, much of that heat leaves the atmosphere and out into space – another key mechanism for cooling the planet. Were the deserts regreened, climate scientists argue that these mechanisms would be affected. But the Weather Makers say these objections discount the effects a functional, biodiverse ecosystem would have on the earth’s weather and water systems. Ecosystems remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which deserts do not, thus helping alleviate the greenhouse effect – albeit temporarily. Secondly, in wet, green areas the solar energy that would otherwise be emitted into the atmosphere as heat instead goes into evapotranspiration - evaporating water from the landscape - which has a cooling effect, though scientists say the cooling will be offset by the latent heat released when the water vapour condenses elsewhere. Their scheme may not “fix” climate change but the Weather Makers believe that, on a global scale, restored ecosystems and water cycles would help re-stabilise the out-of-balance weather systems that Millán Millán first identified. “The climate regulator on earth is the biosphere,” says Bosman. “All cycles depend on it. In the last 10,000 years we have removed more than half of this biosphere.” At present, the hot Sinai acts as a “vacuum cleaner”, drawing moist air from the Mediterranean and funnelling it towards the Indian Ocean. A cooler Sinai would mean less of that moisture being “lost”. Instead, it would fall as rain across the Middle East and north Africa, thus boosting the entire region’s natural potential. Van der Hoeven describes the Sinai peninsula as an “acupuncture point”: “There are certain points in this world where, if we accumulate our joint energy, we can make a big difference.” The Sinai is also an acupuncture point geopolitically, however. Post-Arab spring, the region has become a battle zone between Egyptian security forces and Islamist insurgents. There have been numerous terrorist incidents: the bombing of a Russian airliner in 2015 killed 224 people; an attack on a Sufi mosque in 2017 killed more than 300 worshippers. Northern Sinai is currently a no-go area to outsiders, controlled by the military, and plagued by poverty, terrorism and human rights abuses. Since 2018 the military has restricted access to Lake Bardawil for local fishermen to just a few months a year, says Ahmed Salem, founder of the UK-based Sinai Foundation for Human Rights. “There’s a lot of suffering,” he says, “because they don’t have any other way to earn money and feed their families.” A restored landscape would bring tangible benefits to locals, says Salem, but it all depends on the president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi. “If Sisi really wants to help them [the Weather Makers], it will be OK for them because he’s like a god in Egypt. But if he doesn’t, they will fail.” But the Sisi government seems to have recognised that ecosystem regeneration could fix many problems at once: food security, poverty, political stability, climate goals, as well as the potential for a green project of international renown. The government is close to signing contracts for the first phase of the restoration plan, which covers the dredging of Lake Bardawil. Subsequent phases may well require financial support from external bodies such as the EU. As outsiders, the Weather Makers are aware their plan will require local support, cooperation and labour. Because of the military restrictions, none of them has visited Lake Bardawil, although they have forged links with an organic farm in southern Sinai named Habiba. Habiba was established in 1994, by Maged El Said, a charismatic, Cairo-born tour operator who fell in love with the region. Originally it was a beach resort, but in 2007 El Said branched into organic farming, and Habiba now connects other farms, local Bedouin tribes and academic institutions. El Said has some reservations about the Weather Makers’ plan: “It’s a big shiny project, but also you’re drastically changing the environment, the flora and fauna. I don’t know if there will be side-effects.” But in terms of the larger mission, they are very much aligned: “We are all in the same boat. Desertification and climate change is happening so fast, so we need action on the ground. Enough of workshops, enough seminars, talks, talks, talks.” On a global level, the tide is turning in the Weather Makers’ direction. Discussions about regreening, reforestation and rewilding have been growing in volume and urgency, boosted by high-profile advocates such as Greta Thunberg, David Attenborough and British ecologist Thomas Crowther, who made headlines in 2019 with research suggesting the climate crisis could be solved by planting 1tn trees (he later acknowledged it was not quite that simple). This year marks the beginning of the United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, “a rallying call for the protection and revival of ecosystems around the world”. The UN hopes to restore 350m hectares of land by 2030, which could remove an additional 13 to 26 gigatons of carbon from the atmosphere. After decades of compartmentalising environmental issues and missing its own targets, the UN, too, has come to realise that the only viable solution is to do it all at once. It particularly wants to rally younger people to the cause; its social media campaigns carry a “generation restoration” hashtag. “Ecosystem restoration is not a technical challenge; it’s a social challenge,” says Tim Christophersen, head of the Nature for Climate branch at the UN Environment Programme. Nations and corporations are also making ever more ambitious commitments to regreening, even if they are struggling to live up to them. The UK, for example, plans to create 30,000 hectares of woodland a year by 2025. India has pledged to restore 26m hectares of degraded land by 2030. Africa’s Great Green Wall, “the world’s largest ecosystem restoration project”, aims to plant an 8,000km line of trees across the Sahara Desert, from Senegal to Djibouti (14 years on, it is only around 15% complete). Meanwhile, green companies are taking root, such as Ecosia, the Berlin-based search engine, which to date has planted more than 120m trees around the world. “The main challenge,” Christophersen says, “is the lack of human imagination; our inability to see a different future because we’re staring down this dystopian path of pandemic, climate change, biodiversity loss. But the collective awareness that we are in this together is a huge opportunity. People don’t have a problem imagining what a four-lane highway would look like. But to imagine a restored landscape of over a million hectares – nobody knows what that would look like because it hasn’t really been done before.” Van der Hoeven would agree. He cites Yuval Noah Hariri’s book Sapiens, which argues that humans prevailed because of our ability to share information, ideas, stories: “We were able to believe in a myth – in something which was not there yet.” Regreening the Sinai is presently little more than a myth, just as the Apollo missions once were; but it now exists in the imagination, as a signpost for the future we aspire to. The more it is shared, the more likely it is to happen. It could come to be a turning point – an acupuncture point: “We’re not going to change humanity by saying, ‘Everything has to be less,’” says Van der Hoeven. “No, we have to do more of the good things. Why don’t we come together and do something in a positive way?” • This article was amended on 13 April and 11 June 2021. An earlier version said that “deserts are heat producers, reflecting around 60% to 70% of the solar energy that falls on them straight back into the atmosphere”, and that increasing green areas would “help cool the planet”. That paragraph has been replaced to acknowledge how climate scientists argue that regreening deserts would actually warm the planet.

Its 2015 NDC set a target of reducing emissions by up to 130 MtCO2e (million tonnes of CO2 equivalent) by 2030 compared with a business-as-usual scenario, a target that many analysts have described as inadequate. Assessing progress towards this modest goal has also proved impossible – the kingdom has not published any official projections of its emissions nor even defined the business-as-usual baseline it is measuring against. Independent assessments have concluded that based on the scant information that is available, the country is not on track to meet its pledge. Yet under the influence of its young crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia aims to reduce its dependence on oil in the decades ahead in recognition its supplies are not infinite, demand is falling and the world is searching for less destructive alternatives. To that end, it has announced a slew of environmental initiatives, including plans to generate 50% of the kingdom’s energy from renewables by 2030 and to plant 10bn trees, that have raised hopes it will take a more ambitious plan to Glasgow in November. In remarks to a state media agency, Prince Mohammed drew a direct link between the climate crisis and the health of Saudi citizens, signalling a potential shift in the Saudi attitude towards environmental issues. Analysts say achieving serious cuts in Saudi emissions would require significant changes that will be politically unpopular. Earlier grand announcements including plans to build massive solar farms have also failed to translate into meaningful action. But the Gulf state appears to be recognising that weaning itself off fossil fuels is becoming a political and economic imperative, as well as an environmental one. Michael Safi South Africa South Africa published a draft updated NDC last month (March), with ambitious targets to limit its annual greenhouse gas emissions to 398-440 MtCO2e by 2030, but many campaigners and analysts raised significant concerns about its continuing commitment to coal, which supplies 85% of South Africa’s power. A combination of the Covid-19 pandemic and a long term economic shift away from extractive industries and manufacturing has already helped South Africa move towards meeting some of its emission goals, but further progress will depend on massive investment in the country’s power sector, improvements in energy efficiency, a green transport strategy and a carbon tax. Gwede Mantashe, minister of mineral resources and energy, last month announced plans for a £2bn investment in renewables to accelerate a shift from coal power generation, but again there are concerns that few of the measures outlined in the updated draft NDC are likely to be implemented in a timely fashion, if at all. “South Africa’s target is far too weak … Our government’s answer is basically that they are going to continue polluting a lot for decades to come, but a little less more than they were going to do before,” said Dr Alex Lenferna, secretary of South Africa’s Climate Justice Coalition. South Africa has suffered rolling power cuts over recent years, which have dealt a crippling blow to an already struggling economy, and are forecast to continue for at least five years. But money is short. South Africa has already accessed about $2bn a year in 2018 and 2019 to meet adaptation and mitigation needs but will need four times more annually by 2030 to meet the targets laid out in the NDC. Jason Burke in Johannesburg China While China’s leader, Xi Jinping, pledged in September 2020 that China will increase its NDC commitments in order to peak the country’s carbon emissions before 2030, details of how it would get there have not yet been released. That “increased ambition” so far is not seen as ambitious enough; Climate Action Tracker, for instance, still rates China’s commitments as “highly insufficient”. Reality paints a bleak picture. Recent major infrastructure investments as part of a Covid-19 stimulus package, and the new carbon emissions from furious steel, cement and glass production, coupled with three straight years of rollbacks on regulations restricting approvals of new coal-fired power plants, have clouded China’s ambitions. Greenpeace findings released at the end of March suggest 46.1 GW of new coal capacity was greenlit in 2020, more than the combined total in the three previous years. For Li Shuo, senior climate and energy policy officer at Greenpeace East Asia, clarity is still needed about whether or not China will introduce additional ambition over Xi’s pledge last autumn, something that would be key to determining whether China could peak closer to 2025 than 2030. “One should really pay attention to the new ambition as opposed to the release of the [new] NDC, obviously the new ambition is the weighty stuff,” Li said. But a joint statement issued by the US and China on Saturday has given some cause for optimism. Li welcomed the development. “The statement in my view is as positive as the politics would allow: it sends a very unequivocal message that on this particular issue [China and the US] will cooperate. Before the meetings in Shanghai this was not a message that we could assume.” Michael Standaert in Shenzen Mexico Mexico was once considered an international climate leader. It was the first developing country to submit an NDC in 2015. Its NDC pledged to cut greenhouse gas emissions 22% and black carbon emissions by 51% by 2030. Conditional reductions of 36% and 70% were also promised. But its 2020 NDC disappointed climate campaigners, who said the country isn’t pursuing more ambitious targets. “It should have been more ambitious to begin with [and] their target is to reduce emissions to business as usual,” said Carolina Herrera of the Natural Resources Defense Council, who called Mexico’s NDC “utterly deficient” and “disappointing”. Mexico’s NDC promises nature based solutions such as protecting coastlines and reforestation, and plans also include refurbishing hydroelectric projects. The country also promises to slash emissions to 50% below 2000 levels by 2050. But meanwhile, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has actively moved against clean energy. His government cancelled clean energy auctions. He pushed an electricity industry law through Congress in March, which forces the state-owned electricity company to dispatch energy from its own (often dirty) power plants over privately owned renewable producers. The president also promised to revive the coal industry and has pushed the construction of a behemoth refinery in south-eastern Tabasco state. “They’re favouring the public fossil fuel sector at the expense of renewable energy and, frankly, their own citizens,” said Herrera, manager for green finance and climate change at the NRDC’s Latin America Project. David Agren Australia Australia’s most recent NDC just repeated the 2030 emissions reduction target set at the Paris summit: a 26-28% cut below 2005 emissions levels. No rationale has been given. The government had been advised to set a target equivalent to a 45-60% cut. Instead it just mirrored the reduction number set by the US under Barack Obama, but pushed the timeframe back five years. Prime minister Scott Morrison has not set a net zero emissions target, saying only that the country would “preferably” reach that mark by 2050. Quite how that may happen is not clear. The government has not introduced substantial climate policies, and official government projections suggest it will fall short of what is widely considered an unambitious 2030 target. There has been some progress. National emissions are already 18% below 2005 levels (largely due to cuts when the Labor opposition was in power) and cheap renewable energy is transforming the power grid at a rate faster than expected. But Australia still gets most of its electricity from burning coal, and emissions from the transport, mining and agriculture sectors are forecast to increase over the decade. The Morrison government says it is taking a “technology, not taxes” approach to the climate crisis, but to date has committed just A$18bn over a decade to technologies including hydrogen, carbon capture and storage and soil carbon. Critics have pointed out it has not explained how or when this approach will deliver emissions cuts. Adam Morton in Sydney Brazil More ambition is needed, say representatives from agribusiness, finance and academia, and business leaders. “Brazil was expected to present a more ambitious target than the previous one. We didn’t do that,” Carolina Genin, director of the climate programme at World Resources Institute Brasil, said. “In absolute terms, our ambition is lower.” The 2020 NDC kept the pledge of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 37% by 2025, and 43% by 2030, compared with 2005 levels. But climate experts warned that the new NDC increases emissions by at least 400 MtCO2e, compared with the targets submitted in 2015. To maintain the same absolute level of emissions, Brazil should update the cut to 57% by 2030, experts say. Jair Bolsonaro’s government, however, thinks the opposite. In the proposal submitted in December 2020, it said its NDC is “among the most ambitious in the world” and that, “as a developing country and a nation of late industrialization, Brazil’s historical contribution to climate change has been low”. The proposal has one page for the NDC and eight for the information annexe, which is shorter than that from neighbours such as Argentina, Peru and Colombia. It also lacks details on how targets will be met, according to Genin: “We expected progress in sectoral goals, which were in the first NDC and do not appear in the second. These are important goals such as zero illegal deforestation, a commitment to restore 12 million hectares, among others.” Brazil has been successful in combating deforestation of the Amazon in the past, a key factor in the country’s contribution to climate mitigation, “but the picture reversed dramatically in recent years”, Genin added. Ricardo Salles, the minister of the environment, said it can reduce by 40% in one year the fast-paced deforestation of the Amazon – but only if the country receives US$1bn in foreign aid. Flávia Milhorance in Rio de Janeiro Nigeria Nigeria plans to achieve emissions reductions by massively expanding solar energy production in the country, investing in alternative renewable energy and improving processes used to produce oil and gas. It will use more natural gas and limit gas flaring. It also hopes to bring solar power to 5m households or roughly 25 million people. For now, however, these remain ambitions. In 2015 Nigeria pledged a 20% reduction in its annual greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 in relative terms, based on what it is projected to emit. The pledge was updated in 2017, spelling out Nigeria’s commitments in more detail, but the fundamentals of its pledges were the same. Since 2015 progress has been very slow, with some reports of regression. Nigeria’s pledges were based on the economy growing by 5% a year, roughly where economic growth was at the time of the agreement. The economy has been in recession twice since 2015, in one of the toughest periods in a generation for Africa’s largest economy and oil producer. This is in part caused by steep drops in crude oil prices on which Nigeria still heavily relies. A major part of Nigeria’s economic plan has been to expand the agriculture sector and make it more productive, implementing policies which critics say will increase emissions. Emmanuel Akinwotu in Lagos Canada The government of Justin Trudeau has cast itself as climate champions. In 2015, Canada initially committed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 30% below 2005 levels by 2030. A reduction of that scope would see emissions in the country from the current rate of about 730 megatonnes down to 511 megatonnes. But the reality is far different, with a report this week showing emissions have only dropped 1% below 2005 levels – far off course. “The trend is very clear: we’re still on track to miss our Paris pledge by quite a lot,” said Jessica Green, a professor of political science at the University of Toronto who specialises in climate governance. “We just don’t see what the interim steps are that will put us on the path to meet those targets.” Governing Liberals have introduced legislation that would legally bind the government to net zero by 2050, but the bill has not yet progressed throughout parliament. The bulk of Canada’s emissions come from its tar sands – one of the world’s largest petroleum reserves. Emissions from the tar sands continue to rise each year. A recent court victory has received hopes for a nationwide carbon tax, which the government plans to raise to $170/tonne by 2030. But Green cautions the fight will probably be “politically difficult”, and one that might not be as effective as other policy measures, including electrifying parts of the country’s power grid that remain reliant on fossil fuels, making public transit free – and shutting down the tar sands. Unlike many other industrialised nations, Canada has never met any of its emissions reduction targets – a custom the governing Liberals promised to end. “I think that there’s kind of more openness to this idea that the government needs to really intervene more strongly,” said Green. But at the same time, there are still a lot of political challenges to make that a reality.

The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee has touted millions of new jobs in a clean energy economy where electric vehicles, retrofitted buildings and renewable power generation help phase out emissions from fossil fuels. A Biden presidency would aim to spur tens of thousands of new wind turbines and millions of new solar panels across the US to rapidly scale up zero-carbon energy. Should Biden defeat Donald Trump in the November’s presidential election, however, the sheer scale of the energy transformation risks a backlash from communities unhappy with the nearby placement of new solar and wind infrastructure. “We must decarbonize, but that’s not the only metric. We need to care about other environmental and social impacts too,” said David Keith, a climate and energy expert at Harvard. In 2018, Keith co-authored research that found America’s transition to solar and wind would require up to 20 times more land area than previously thought. Land development was particularly significant for wind, which has an average power density – measured in watts per meter squared – that is 10 times less than solar. “Wind turbines are wonderfully efficient and we shouldn’t abandon them, but we should take their footprint seriously,” Keith said. “You should tilt the energy system towards low land footprints, which means focusing on solar, nuclear and carbon capture and storage, with wind at the margins.” An incoming Biden administration would not only have to help navigate concerns over the placement of clean energy infrastructure, but also a massive new network of transmission lines required to bring solar and wind energy from remote areas to power homes and businesses. “If there’s a seriousness about a Green New Deal and deep cuts in emissions there will need to be federal legislation that states’ rights people won’t like where decisions are made quickly,” said Keith. “It will need leadership to admit there will be tradeoffs for a shared national goal. Biden will need to be clear there will be local decisions people won’t like. We can’t pretend this is going to be easy.” The fiercest opposition to energy construction has until now centered on pipelines for fossil fuels such as oil and gas, with the Trump administration suffering recent court setbacks to its hopes of pushing through a number of projects that climate campaigners say will help push the world closer to catastrophe through disastrous global heating. But protests have also started to flare around some clean energy projects, such as a Virginia community opposed to a huge solar farm 60 miles south of Washington DC, or demonstrations in the Hawaiian island of Oahu over new wind turbines that led to more than 100 arrests late last year. “It’s not fair that AES [the company behind the wind project] can just build these monsters in our backyards, rake in all the money from them and leave us to live with the eyesore and all the side-effects,” said Kryssa Stevenson, one of the Oahu protesters, in December. Objections to wind and solar projects range from complaints they are an eyesore and harmful to property values, to largely debunked claims they are dangerous to public health. Trump has attacked “windmills” for causing a “bird graveyard” for flying animals. There are also broader environmental concerns over the land consumed for solar arrays or wind turbines. For example, conservationists have raised objections to the development of solar energy in the Mojave desert due to the threat posed to the desert tortoise, a creature that can live up to 80 years. The US has repeatedly seen renewable energy infrastructure “sited and constructed in places that have led to a significant loss of biodiversity”, said Rebecca Hernandez, co-author of a recent University of California, Davis study that found the development of the Mojave imperils cacti and other desert plants. “We need land for energy, food and conservation – how will we make sure we allocate enough for each on an increasingly hot and full Earth? We make prudent decisions about where we put our renewable energy.” Ultimately, however, the impacts of a surge in renewable energy construction may have to be weighed against an alternative where emissions are not cut and the US is roiled by unbearable heatwaves, failed crops and increasingly powerful storms. “It’s important that the Biden plan is technology neutral, so communities can pick their path to zero emissions,” said Melissa Lott, senior research scholar at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy. “A portion of the country will oppose this but that’s the case for anything that is built. On balance, are these impacts better than a carbon-intensive grid that will cut thousands of lives short? The answer is an unequivocal yes. “Getting to zero carbon for the power sector by 2035 is ambitious, it’s difficult, but it’s achievable with policy support. Every year we wait will make it harder to do.

Liz Truss raised more than £420,000 in donations for her successful Conservative leadership bid, with the biggest single contribution made by the wife of a former BP executive. The prayers of the nation are with the Queen, the archbishop of Canterbury has said, as Britain’s leaders sent messages of support to the monarch, who was put under medical supervision after doctors became worried about her health. There is ongoing coverage of this story on our separate live blog. From ITV’s Robert Peston The National Institute of Economic and Social Research, another thinktank, has published its assessment of the energy price plan. It is a bit more critical than the IFS (see 2.56pm) and the Resolution Foundation (see 3.59pm). NIESR argued for a sliding price cap, where the cost of energy per unit would go up the more energy a person uses, and it says the government’s plan is “needlessly inefficient and expensive”. Max Mosley, an NIESR economist, said: The prime minister’s energy plan is appropriate in terms of scale and ambition, but is needlessly inefficient and expensive. Its untargeted nature makes the currently unfunded proposal wasteful, which will put pressure on public finances, and for an unknown amount of time. There are better options, including a variable price cap that would gone further in lowering the bills for the poorest and could have even paid for itself. My colleague Peter Walker has written a good analysis of the energy bills announcement. Here’s an extract. There are two main things to note about Liz Truss’s energy costs package. First, there is much detail to come. Also, it is an undeniable paradox that the first move of a prime minister surrounded by former Taxpayers’ Alliance staff is a £150bn state effort to fix commercial prices … An early Truss campaign interview with the Financial Times even airily dismissed the idea of “handouts”. Future campaign messaging was less clear, but still resistant to what was disparagingly referred to as “Gordon Brown economics”. As it has turned out, Truss has ended up doing more or less what Brown argued for in early August, a call for a freeze on prices that pre-empted not just the government but even Brown’s own Labour party. What changed was the sheer weight of political and, what you might even term moral, pressure. Truss was told by an array of experts that failure to take bold action would create a humanitarian disaster, with millions of households cold or hungry or both, businesses collapsing en masse, with the impact on the economy, and especially on public health inequalities, felt for a generation. And here is the full article. The Department for Businesss, Energy and Industrial Strategy has published a factsheet giving a tiny bit more detail of the energy plans announced by Liz Truss earlier. The section on support for business illustrates how vague the plans are at this stage. Full details of how the plan will work for households are not available, but the scheme for businesses is even more sketchy; it seems to be more of a wishlist than a plan, and, with a small typeface, you could literally print it on the back of the metaphorical fag packet. But the factsheet does include this chart, showing the notional savings for households, by housing type. Martin Lewis, the consumer champion, has a good video guide to the energy announcement that you can watch here. He thinks the chances are 50-50 that the government will also cut VAT on fuel bills in its emergency budget later this month. The Resolution Foundation thinktank has published its own assessment of the energy price guarantee. Like the Institute for Fiscal Studies (see 2.56pm), it welcomes this as a substantial intervention that will avert catastrophe for many people this winter, but one that will not stop them facing a very tough winter anyway. Both thinktanks stress that this does not offer a permanent solution. Torsten Bell, the chief executive at the Resolution Foundation, said: Households should be reassured that the winter ahead will not be as bad as feared, but policymakers need to recognise it will still be very tough indeed. The energy price guarantee does a good job of targeting those households facing the highest energy bills but, because it is not well targeted at those on low and middle incomes, comes with a large price tag. Liz Truss is asking future taxpayers to pick up a large and very uncertain bill on behalf of today’s energy bill payers, but declined to set out the cost of this huge package. It could end up surpassing the bank bailouts at the height of the financial crisis, with new support for households alone on course to total around £120bn. It goes without saying this can’t be the permanent answer to higher energy bills. The Resolution Foundation is also critical of the proposal to negotiate new, long-term contracts with low-carbon energy suppliers. Echoing the argument made by Ed Miliband (see 10.09am), it says this “risks delaying but locking in those windfalls, rather than removing them”. Union leaders have criticised the energy announcement from Liz Truss, saying that it should have included a windfall tax and that ministers should have acted earlier. Here is a roundup of some of their reaction. Frances O’Grady, the outgoing TUC general secretary, said: The prime minister is making the wrong people pay. She should have imposed a much larger windfall tax on profiteering oil and gas giants, and she should have required all firms getting help with energy bills to commit to no lay-offs for the lifetime of the help, to protect livelihoods. Sharon Graham, the Unite general secretary, said: It is quite frankly remarkable that the prime minister is asking workers to pay for massive energy company profits. The economy is broken and workers will see through this plan to boost profiteering yet again. I don’t think the irony escapes many. The reason we are held to ransom now by an over-reliance on non-domestic energy is that a Conservative government privatised our energy. Andy Prendergast, national officer at the GMB, said: The Tories have been in office for 12 years. Their failures to build new nuclear power stations, to protect and utilise our gas storage capacity and willingness to engage in political groupthink on domestic on and offshore resources, means we are playing catch-up in the race to defend ourselves against the global energy crisis. And Christina McAnea, the Unison general secretary, said: At long last, the government has acted. A bill freeze should have happened months ago. Instead, millions have endured sleepless nights terrified of the winter ahead. The companies raking in billions from soaring energy costs should pay their share. Another windfall tax would be fairer than handing huge debts to future generations. The Institute of Directors, which represents business leaders, has welcomed the government’s energy plan. But Jonathan Geldart, the IoD’s director general, said it was important to get an assurance that the plan would not weaken the public finances. He said: What we need now is an external reassurance that the scale of the intervention does not jeopardise the public finances. That’s why it’s crucially important that the Office for Budget Responsibility can swiftly produce its independent assessment of the impact on government debt and the wider macroeconomy. During first minister’s questions in the Scottish parliament Nicola Sturgeon welcomed the UK government’s “very belated action on energy bills” but said people would still have to pay more. She said: It does not represent a halt to the rise in energy bills. Average energy bills right now are just under £2,000, a cap of £2,500 will still see people pay more for their energy. People are still seeing soaring energy costs because of a broken energy market and the utter incompetence of this UK government. Conor Murphy, the Sinn Féin finance minister in Northern Ireland, said the UK government needed to provide “urgent clarity” as to how it will meet its promise to ensure that households in Northern Ireland get the same help as households in Britain. In a statement on the energy package he said: While the British government has said the energy policy changes will apply here, they have failed to outline what exactly that means. This will bring little comfort to individuals who are having to decide between heating and eating. Likewise, businesses trying to plan ahead for the winter months have no certainty as to when support will be forthcoming. The absence of a functioning executive will require a workaround. At a time of crisis for citizens, businesses and public services, this is completely unacceptable. I am calling for urgent clarity on how energy support will be delivered locally. The power-sharing executive in Northern Ireland is not functioning because the DUP says it will not participate until the government abandons the Northern Ireland protocol in its current form. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has published its assessment of the energy plan announced by Liz Truss today. It says that capping the average household energy bill at £2,500 a year would cost £60bn over the next year and that just over half of that would go to households in the top half for income distribution. But while poorer households will gain less in cash terms, they will gain significant more as a proportion of what they spend, the IFS says. “The energy price guarantee will save a household with typical energy use in the lowest-income tenth an amount equivalent to 14% of their household spending, compared to 5% for the highest income tenth,” it says. The IFS also says that, if other European countries subsidise bills in the same way, this could increase the risks of a bidding war. It explains. Prices are high because Europe faces severe gas shortages in the coming months. To correct the (large) mismatch between supply and demand, some users of energy – whether households, businesses or governments – will have to reduce their energy use. The less UK households reduce their energy demand, the greater demands placed on others. If other European countries also attempt to subsidise household or business use of energy, the result could be a bidding war that raises the cost of providing support in all countries. It also risks a situation where there is simply not enough energy to go round, which would require rationing or increase the risk of blackouts. Charities say Liz Truss’s energy support package will not do enough to protect the poorest families. Here is a roundup of reaction from some of the leading voices in the sector. Imran Hussain, the director of policy and campaigns at Action for Children, said this was a “big intervention with a big hole in it”. He explained: We desperately need more targeted help through benefits for the low-paid and those who have lost their jobs or cannot work because of disability, illness or caring responsibilities. Even with a freeze, energy bills will still be double what they were a year ago, the price of other essentials continues to soar and the true value of benefits has been cut. Becca Lyon, the head of child poverty at Save the Children, said the plan would not stop many families reaching crisis point this winter. She said: How can it be right that multimillionaires will get the same support as the most vulnerable families? If there is enough money to pay the energy bills of the rich and not ask energy giants to pay a penny more, surely there should be enough money to make sure no family has to choose between heating and eating this winter. James Taylor, the director of strategy for the disability charity Scope, said the plan was just a “sticking plaster” for disabled people. He explained: Life costs more if you are disabled. This universal approach brings some relief, but disabled people often rely on higher energy use. It’s important to remember that this cap does not limit what you pay. For many disabled households their bills are still skyrocketing. The End Fuel Poverty Coalition also said the plan would be an “expensive sticking plaster” without further investment in improving energy efficiency of homes worst affected by fuel poverty. The coalition coordinator, Simon Francis, said: While many households will breathe a sigh of relief, the prime minister offered no detail of additional support for the millions of households who will be left behind in fuel poverty this winter. Carl Emmerson, deputy director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, told Radio 4’s World at One that he expected the government’s “energy price guarantee” to cost at least £100bn. He said: The cost will be very, very uncertain. It will depend on what happens to gas prices over the next two years, it will depend on whether this scheme is extended. I would be surprised if over the next 12 months it didn’t cost more than £100bn. The uncertainty gets much greater the further out you go. This expires in two years’ time. On current expectations, that will make it a very painful winter in 2024-25. I think that does open the question about whether this scheme will get extended or not, just as the [Covid] furlough scheme got extended and extended again and again. Bloomberg’s Alex Wickham said this morning that, on the basis of a government document he had seen, he expected the figure to be much higher than £100bn. Miatta Fahnbulleh, chief executive of the New Economics Foundation thinktank, says that, by not imposing a new windfall tax, the government has ensured that “our public services and communities to pay for this through lower investment”. She explains why in a Twitter thread starting here. In his speech in the energy debate Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, said Liz Truss was in effect imposing a “Truss tax” on people who would have to pay more for energy. He explained: Freezing prices wasn’t really a choice. It’s the only political option. And when the current price cap stands at 2,000 with a 54% increase since spring, and many people are already unable to pay, setting the cap at 2,500 isn’t an actual freeze. After all the waiting, it couldn’t be any clearer, [the prime minister] set it out very brazenly. The prime Mminister’s plan means that the public pays. She has made the political choice to tax families instead of companies, to put profit over people. Instead of a windfall tax, she has chosen a new Tory tax, the Truss tax. The Truss tax that means that in the months and years ahead households and businesses will be punished with higher bills, higher interest rates and higher mortgage costs. A Truss tax means that cuts to the vital public services rely on and which are used to support the most vulnerable. A Truss tax means a threat to the Scottish budget, which the Scottish government is using to protect our population and shield workers and public services as best they can. Sam Coates from Sky News has a good analysis of the “energy price guarantee”. He says there are five big unknowns: 1) no costings; 2) no detail about how average bills will be capped; 3) no clarity about what might happen after the two-year guantee expires; 4) no clarity about how people will get help in Northern Ireland, where the energy regime is different; and 5) uncertainty about what support business will actually get. And Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation thinktank, is also surprised by the decision not to give any costings for the policy. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank, says he is staggered that Liz Truss announced her “energy price guarantee” without saying how much it would cost. (See 11.47am.) Politicians have been issuing statements expressing their concerns about the Queen’s health, and their best wishes for her recovery. My colleague Miranda Bryant is covering all the developments on that story on a separate live blog. It’s here. The government has now sent out a press release about the “energy price guarantee” announced by Liz Truss earlier. It does not seem to be available online yet, and so here are some excerpts. Help for households Under new plans, a typical UK household will pay no more than £2,500 a year on their energy bill for the next two years from 1st October, through a new ‘energy price guarantee’ which limits the price suppliers can charge customers for units of gas. This takes account of temporarily removing green levies, worth around £150, from household bills. The guarantee will supersede the existing energy price cap. This will save the average household £1,000 a year based on current energy prices from October. It comes in addition to the announced £400 energy bills discount for all households and together they will bring costs close to where the energy price cap stands today. The new guarantee will apply to households in Great Britain, with the same level of support made available to households in Northern Ireland. Those households who do not pay direct for mains gas and electricity – such as those living in park homes or on heat networks – will be no worse off and receive support through a new fund. Today’s action will deliver substantial benefits to the economy - boosting growth and curbing inflation by 4-5 points, reducing the cost of servicing the national debt. Help for business As businesses have not benefited from an energy price cap and are not always able to fix their energy price through fixed deals, many are reporting projected increases in energy costs of more than 500%. A new six-month scheme for businesses and other non-domestic energy users (including charities and public sector organisations like schools) will offer equivalent support as is being provided for consumers. This will protect them from soaring energy costs and provide them with the certainty they need to plan their business. After this initial six-month scheme, the Government will provide ongoing, focused support for vulnerable industries. There will be a review in 3 months’ time to consider where this should be targeted to make sure those most in need get support. Reforms to energy market The government will provide energy suppliers with the difference between this new lower price, and what energy retailers would charge their customers were this not in place. Schemes previously funded by green levies will also continue to be funded by the government during this two year period to ensure the UK’s investment in home-grown, secure renewable technologies continues. Whilst the intervention will be funded by the government, action is being taken to significantly reduce the cost over time, including: A new energy supply taskforce – led by Madelaine McTernan who headed up the UK’s successful vaccine taskforce – has begun negotiations with domestic and international suppliers to agree long-term contracts that reduce the price they charge for energy and increase the security of its supply. The taskforce and Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy will negotiate with renewable producers to reduce the prices they charge as well. HM Treasury are announcing a joint scheme, working with the Bank of England, to address the extraordinary liquidity requirements faced by energy firms operating in UK wholesale gas and electricity markets. [The Treasury has published details of that here.] Measures to increase energy supply Learning from the mistakes of the past, the government is taking action to accelerate domestic energy supply, increase our energy resilience and achieve our ambition to make the UK an energy exporter by 2040: Launch a new oil and gas licensing round as early as next week, expected to lead to over 100 new licences. Lift the moratorium on UK shale gas production. This will enable developers to seek planning permission where there is local support, which could get gas flowing in as soon as six months. Drive forward the acceleration of new sources of energy supply from North Sea oil and gas to clean energy like nuclear, wind and solar. Continue progressing up to 24GW of nuclear by 2050, with Great British Nuclear helping to set direction of getting new nuclear projects online in the UK. In the Commons Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker, has just interrupted Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, who is delivering a speech in the debate, to comment on an announcement from Buckingham Palace. Hoyle is referring to this. Hoyle says: I know I speak on behalf of the entire house when I say that we send our best wishes to Her Majesty the Queen, and that she and her family are in our thoughts and prayers at this moment. He says he is not going to say any more at this point. My colleague Caroline Davies’s story about the Queen is here. Starmer says fracking and a dash for gas in the North Sea will not cut bills or strengthen energy security. And he says Truss should remember what Kwasi Kwarteng said about fracking in an article for the Mail on Sunday earlier this year. Kwarteng wrote: Even if we lifted the fracking moratorium tomorrow, it would take up to a decade to extract sufficient volumes – and it would come at a high cost for communities and our precious countryside. Second, no amount of shale gas from hundreds of wells dotted across rural England would be enough to lower the European price any time soon. And with the best will in the world, private companies are not going to sell the shale gas they produce to UK consumers below the market price. They are not charities, after all. He also says Kwarteng’s own department produced a Q&amp;A saying future extraction from the North Sea would not “materially impact on the global price of gas”. He ends by saying the UK needs a fresh start, not the fourth Tory leader in six years. Theresa May, the former Conservative PM, intervenes, and asks Starmer why no new nuclear power stations were build under Labour. Starmer says he remembers Tony Blair declaring his support for nuclear, and mocking David Cameron for being able to say what his policy was. Doubtless Starmer “remembers” this because the clip has been widely circulated on social media recently. Starmer says Labour did approve new nuclear power stations in 2009. But they were never build after the Tories too power, he says. Starmer says the government banned onshore wind in 2015. That cost the UK the equivalent of the energy it imported from Russia. That was a “policy disaster”, he says. And he says Truss has consistently opposed solar energy. When she was environment secretary she cut subsidies for solar, and the market crashed, he says. Keir Starmer is speaking now. He says Labour called for a price freeze earlier in the summer, and was criticised for doing so. He says he is pleased there is action being taken today. But the key question is will pay for this. The energy companies are making £170bn in windfall profits over the next two years, he says. He says Labour wants to tax this, but Li Truss is opposed. He goes on: Every pound the government refuses to raise in windfall taxes … is a pound of extra borrowing. It’s that simple. This is what Liz Truss has announced. A typical household will save on average £1,000 a year from her two-year energy price guarantee, she claims. An average energy bill for a typical household will be no more than £2,500 a year for the next two years from 1 October under the plan. This figure takes account of the removal of green levies (worth around £150 per household) and it will supersede the existing energy price cap. The policy applies to households in Britain, but in Northern Ireland (where the energy regime is different) households will get the same amount of support. Households who do not pay direct for gas or electricity from the mains will receive support from a fund, and will be no worse off, Truss says. Businesses will get equivalent support, under a scheme lasting six months. After this there will be ongoing support, particularly for vulnerable industries. The package is expected to reduce inflation by up to 5 percentage points from where it otherwise would have been. Truss says that for too long the government has ignored the need for energy security. She says she will address this. She wants to make the UK a net energy exporter by 2040, she says. That’s it. She has finished. Truss says that, to improve long-term energy security, she is announcing two reviews. First, there will be a review of energy regulation. And, second, there will be a review of how the government can reach net zero “in a way that is pro-business and pro-growth”. She says this will be led by Chris Skidmore. Skidmore, a former energy minister, is one of the Tory MPs most committed to net zero. In response to a question from Sammy Wilson (DUP), Truss says she can assure him that this policy will benefit people in Northern Ireland. Truss announces another plan that she says will curb prices. I’m announcing today that, with the Bank of England, we will set up a new scheme worth up to £40bn to ensure that firms operating in the wholesale energy market have the liquidity they need to manage price volatility. This will stabilise the market and decrease the likelihood that energy retailers need our support like they did last winter. By increasing supply, boosting the economy and increasing liquidity in the market, we will significantly reduce the cost to government of this intervention. In the Commons Truss says today’s intervention will curb inflation by up to five percentage points. This will cut the cost of servicing government debt, she says. The written ministerial statement is now available online. It is from Jacob Rees-Mogg, the business secretary, and it is here. This is what it says: HM Government is acting to protect British households from the spiralling costs of energy. The Energy Price Guarantee (EPG) which will give people certainty with their bills. The EPG will apply from 1 October and will discount the unit cost for gas and electricity use. This guarantee, which includes the temporary suspension of green levies, means that from the 1st October a typical household will pay no more than £2500 per year for each of the next two years. This will save the typical household £1000 a year. It comes in addition to the £400 Energy Bill Support Scheme. The scheme will start on the 1st October 2022, when Ofgem’s new price cap is due to come into effect. Cost projections for the delivery of the EPG are uncertain as they depend upon usage levels (which are highly dependent on weather patterns) and, for future three-month periods, the wholesale price of energy. The new guarantee will apply to households in Great Britain, with the same level of support made available to households in Northern Ireland. HM Government will also support all business, charities and public sector organisations with their energy costs this winter, offering an equivalent guarantee for six months. The Chancellor of the Exchequer will set out the expected costs as part of the fiscal statement later this month. Truss is now talking about how they might “defray” the costs of this. First of all, the government will do this by ramping up supply. A new energy supply taskforce has been set up. They are negotiating new contracts with electricity and gas suppliers. The government will also launch a new licensing round for North Sea extraction, which could lead to more than 100 new licences being awarded. She says providers will move to contracts for difference, so that they price they get is not pegged to gas. This will further bring down costs, she says. (See 10.09am.) Richard Burgon (Lab) says the government can do better than this. Why is Truss putting profits ahead of people? Truss says she is doing the important work to help people get through this winter and the next winter, while fixing the energy supply problems. She goes on: This is the moment to be bold. We are facing a global energy crisis and there are no cost-free options. John Redwood (Con) says we are too short of energy, but have too many taxes. If we have too many taxes, we will have less supply of the things we are taxing, he says. Truss says Redwood has made a good point. She goes on: The reality is that we can’t tax our way to growth. Truss says she recognises that people are worried. That is why she has brought forward this debate. Emergency legislation will be brought forward to deliver the policy. Kwasi Kwarteng, the chancellor, will give details of the costs when he makes a fiscal statement later this month. But Truss says she will not accept Labour’s call for a windfall tax. The written ministerial statement setting out this plan should be available here, but it isn’t. Some MPs are angry about not being able to read the details. Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker, says copies are being printed out by the vote office now. He seems furious. Truss says her plan means a typical household will pay no more than £2,500 a year for energy for the next two years from October. A typical household will save on average £1,000 a year from her two-year energy price guarantee, she claims. An average energy bill for a typical household will be no more than £2,500 a year for the next two years from 1 October under the plan. This figure takes account of the removal of green levies (worth around £150 per household) and it will supersede the existing energy price cap. Liz Truss is about to open the debate. But Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker, starts by complaining that the written ministerial statement setting out the plan was not published earlier. It is only just available, he says. This is discourteous to the house, he says. The new version of the register of members’ interests also clarifies who paid for Boris Johnson’s recent party to celebrate his wedding last year. It was held at the mansion owned by the JCB chair and Tory donor Anthony Bamford, and Bamford donated the equivalent of almost £24,000, it says. The declaration reads: Name of donor: Lord Anthony and Lady Carole Bamford For my wedding celebration, hire of Marquee; portaloos; catering; waiting staff; flowers; ice cream van; smoke and braai; total value £23,853. According to George Grylls from the Times, the biggest single donation to Liz Truss’s leadership campaign came from the wife of a BP executive. In the Commons Penny Mordaunt, the new leader of the Commons is still taking business questions. But she is expected to wrap up soon, within the next few minutes. When she finishes, Liz Truss will deliver her statement on her energy bills package, which will take the form of a speech opening a general debate on energy costs. Swing voters have reacted warmly to Liz Truss, according to the results of a focus group conducted by James Johnson, a pollster who used to work in Downing Street for Theresa May. The House of Commons has published its latest updated version of the register of members’ interests, and it includes details of who donated to Liz Truss’s campaign for the Tory leadership. Until now she had not released those names. The full details are here. I’ll post more on it soon. This is from the Labour MP Chris Bryant, replying to what Simon Clarke said on the Today programme this morning. Although Liz Truss is sticking to her opposition to a further windfall tax on energy companies, in most respects her announcement today marks a huge shift from the ideological stance she was taking on energy bills earlier this summer. A small state libertarian, she insisted that the best way to help people with rising prices was through tax cuts, rather than Rishi Sunak-style government intervention. “The way I would do things is in a Conservative way of lowering the tax burden, not giving out handouts,” she told the Financial Times in early August. From what we know of the announcement coming later, she will not be offering cash handouts to households. But she will be putting a limit on the amount bills can rise through handouts to energy companies, which will have a similar effect. This has alarmed some of her libertarian allies. On Sunday Mark Littlewood, who runs the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA) thinktank and who has been a friend of Truss’s since they were fellow Liberal Democrats at Oxford, wrote an article for the Sunday Telegraph saying she was the last person who would want to fix a price for energy. He said: As a convinced market liberal, [Truss] will recoil at the idea that more state involvement is the best strategy to deal with any given problem. Her approach to date on the energy crisis is a classic example of this. Whilst politicians of all stripes seem to want the government to take even more action to fix the price of energy, Truss’s starting position would be to allow the price mechanism to operate freely and then consider how one might mitigate the effects. She would rather offset the soaring price of utility bills through meaningful tax cuts, than appoint a central committee to pronounce on the exact price we should all be paying per kilowatt hour. That didn’t age well, and last night the IEA issued a press release criticsing the plan being announced today. Andy Mayer, energy analyst at the thinktank, said: Targeted welfare and tax cuts are better than price freezes. The expected energy price freeze, which will limit typical bills to between £2-2,500, is estimated to cost between £90-£170bn. It would be better and cheaper to focus on targeted welfare and tax cuts. Price controls don’t work. By suppressing the price signal and subsidising energy use, more energy will be used, inefficiently, prolonging the crisis, and limiting investment in energy saving. According to the BBC, the government is considering a plan to change the way energy companies are paid for electricity generated from sources other than gas. At the moment prices are pegged to the price of gas, which has led to producers generating energy from nuclear, or renewables, making soaring profits on the back of rising international gas prices. The idea is backed by the industry body Energy UK, which explains it in a briefing here. My colleague Alex Lawson explains what is proposed in a story here. In his interview on the Today programme, Ed Miliband, the shadow secretary for climate change and net zero, claimed this would be “terrible” for consumers. He explained: This is a proposal from Energy UK, and let’s be clear about this proposal: This would lock in massive windfall profits for these electricity generators. Let me explain why: what Energy UK have said is we’ll accept slightly lower prices now, so we can have much higher prices over the following 15 years. This would be a terrible deal for the British people, a terrible deal for billpayers. It is much better - if there are these unexpected windfalls, and there are - the right thing to do, the fair thing to do, is not to do some dodgy deal with these companies, but to do a windfall tax. In an interview with Times Radio Ed Miliband, the shadow secretary for climate change and net zero, also criticised the appointment of Jacob Rees-Mogg as business secretary because of his approach to the climate crisis and net zero. He said: Jacob Rees-Mogg has a record, which deeply disturbs me … He has questioned the science of climate change. Now, that’s not just bad in relation to climate change or the climate emergency; it is but if we’re going to lower energy bills, there is one overriding thing we’ve got to do - which is get off fossil fuels. All this nonsense about lifting the ban on fracking. That’s not a solution to this problem. Because fracking, the fracked gas, even if it isn’t dangerous, will cost exactly the same as the gas we’re currently importing. There’s only one way out of this, which is renewables, nuclear, offshore wind, onshore wind, solar, which Jacob Rees Mogg, I fear has set his face against. And here are some more lines from what Simon Clarke, the new levelling up secretary, said on his morning broadcast round. Clarke defended the government’s decision to act on the grounds that the economy would suffer “enormous damage” if it did nothing. Liz Truss is instinctively a small state Tory, and during the Tory leadership campaign she criticised what she described as Gordon Brown-style government interventions. But Clarke, one of her closest allies, said on this occasion a big intervention was essential. He said: If we fail to act, if we don’t protect the economy against the shock of the size and scale we are talking about, then there is going to be enormous damage. In these circumstances I think the country will say and I think markets will respect that this is the most sensible thing to do. The government is clear that a fiscally responsible approach sits at the heart of our plans but we cannot fail to respond to the magnitude of the moment. He said the plan announced today would provide certainty “in the medium term”, and would not just be a “sticking plaster” solution. He said: We are not looking here at sticking plaster solutions. We want a lasting settlement that provides both comfort and clarity for both households and businesses. This is a major attempt to draw a line and provide energy certainty for everybody in this country about energy usage in the medium term. He rejected suggestions that the increase in borrowing being announced today would be excessive, or that it would alarm the financial markets. He said: If you look at the UK’s most recent round of debt issuance, that was well-covered. There was much more demand for our debt than was needed to cover the latest auction. We are paying around three per cent for our debt. That is a perfectly sustainable level. The UK is obviously a very stable, very strong economy, subject to a very clear regulatory system and the rule of law. We are a safe bet and a safe haven as we always are, frankly, in these kind of situations. He came close to confirming that Truss will announce an end to the ban on fracking today – but he stressed that this was not a “miracle solution” to the energy supply crisis. Simon Clarke, the new levelling up secretary, was on the morning interview round on behalf of the government this morning. Echoing what his boss said at PMQs yesterday, he said imposing a new windfall tax on energy companies would be a mistake. He told LBC: These firms are the people we are going to be absolutely relying on to deliver that next generation of oil and gas extraction on the route to energy self-sufficiency. We need to go much, much further in getting new fields on line. That is why we need these companies to be ploughing that investment into the North Sea. We cannot do what Labour would do, which is just tax, tax, tax. Ed Miliband, the shadow secretary for climate change and net zero, was also on the Today programme this morning where he restated Labour’s call for a windfall tax to be used to part fund a rescue pacakge for energy bills. He said the government’s argument that this would deter investment was “bogus”. And he said Truss’s decision to rule out the idea showed the government had shifted to the right. He said: This investment argument is completely bogus; that it would have a damaging effect on business. Bernard Looney, the chief executive of BP, says it wouldn’t have a damaging effect. This is a dogma, and I’m afraid we see a pattern here. This is a shift to the right by the Conservative party under Liz Truss. Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak actually eventually ended up agreeing with our idea of a windfall tax. Now we have a government that is setting its face against it purely on the basis of dogma. Good morning. Liz Truss has been prime minister for less than 48 hours, but she is about to make an announcement that could define her premiership. If her plan to prevent energy bills soaring backfires or crashes, then it is hard to see how she recovers. But if it gets a positive reception, then Truss, whose ratings with the public at large are very poor, and her party, which is trailing badly behind Labour in the polls, could be on a path to recovery. Here is our overnight splash setting out what we are expecting. And here is an analysis from my colleague Archie Bland, who has examined the plan in his First Edition briefing. This morning Labour has renewed its attack on Truss for failing to considing using a windfall tax to part fund the energy rescue package. Ed Miliband, the shadow secretary for climate change and net zero, told the BBC: We know from the Treasury that there are £170bn of excess profits being made by the energy companies. We believe a windfall tax must be part of the solution to that, that is the fair thing to do, that is the right thing to do. I am afraid that Liz Truss is making a terrible mistake by setting her face against that, because in the end, higher borrowing will have to be paid for somehow and it will end up falling back on the British people, and she’s leaving money on the table that these companies are making. But there was a much more encouraging response for Truss from Martin Lewis, the consumer champion and founder of the MoneySavingExpert website. Lewis is the go-to expert on consumer issues – the equivalent of John Curtice on elections, or Paul Johnson on the IFS on budgets – and he has been described as one of the most trusted men in Britain. An endorsement from him really counts, and on the Today programme this morning he gave a qualified welcome to what Truss is doing. He said: I have said we have a catastophe coming in winter. By January we expect to see the [energy] price cap to be 120% higher than it is right now, more than double. And my great call has always been that we need to have political will to do something. Well, I think we do now have the political will. And I very much welcome the plans that are being rumoured to come out today. They are not perfect. Then again, I’ve not seen any solution that’s perfect. They are not the panacea. But they will meet millions, if not tens of millions of people, will breathe a sigh of relief that will be they will be able to afford their energy bills this winter. But clearly there will need to be some further work done looking at the very poorest in society to make sure that they can get through this. We need clarification on whether the remaining payments on benefits, the payments for those disabilities that were planned and announced in May, are still going to come through. But I think we have to be fair here. And as someone who has has been begging and pleading that more help comes out, well, this is more help. The great benefits of this policy is that it helps everyone. The great problem with this policy is that it helps everyone. It means wealthy people like me also get our bills cut. But, absolutely big picture, I think we need to welcome that something is being done, and that the political will has changed. I will be focusing almost exclusively on the Truss announcement today. It will come after 11.15am, when Truss will unveil the plan in a speeech in the Commons opening a general debate on energy costs. Unusually, she has chosen to make the announcement in this format rather than through a normal ministerial statement – which would have required her to answer questions about her plans for more than an hour. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include “Andrew” in it somewhere and I’m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can’t promise to do this for everyone.

Cambodia announced on Wednesday that it would not build any new hydropower dams on the mainstream Mekong for the next decade, allaying fears that the river’s fragile biodiversity could be further devastated by development projects. Mak Bunthoeurn, project coordinator of the NGO Forum in Cambodia, said many communities alongside the river feared they would be forced to abandon their homes and livelihoods if previous plans to develop a dam went ahead. “They have time to enjoy the river. For their livelihood they depend on the fish they receive from the Mekong river and the ecosystem,” he said. He hoped the 10-year suspension would give campaigners time to encourage officials to abandon dam projects entirely. The Mekong, which supports the world’s largest inland fishery, flows from the Tibetan plateau down to the South China Sea, passing through or by Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam. Across the region at least 60 million people depend on its resources but it is increasingly threatened by hydropower development as well as climate change and the illegal wildlife trade. Cambodia had announced plans for two dams at Sambor and Stung Treng but both are now on hold. Victor Jona, the director general of energy at Cambodia’s energy ministry, told Reuters the decision came after a Japanese consultant recommended Cambodia seek energy elsewhere. “According to the study we need to develop coal, LNG, imports from neighbouring countries and solar energy,” he said, adding that he could not give details contained in a government master plan. “In this 10-year plan, from 2020 to 2030, we have no plans to develop a mainstream dam,” he said. The country has not ruled out constructing dams on Mekong tributaries. Cambodia’s decision means that neighbouring Laos, which has opened two new dams on the mainstream Mekong in the past six months, is the only country in the Lower Mekong Basin planning hydropower on the river. Marc Goichot, who leads the World Wide Fund for Nature’s work on freshwater in the Asia Pacific region, said Cambodia had set an example for other countries. He described the decision as “the best possible news for the sustainable future of the tens of millions of people living alongside it and for the amazing biodiversity that depends on it, especially the world’s largest population of Irrawaddy river dolphins. “The science clearly shows that those dams would significantly reduce wild fisheries and block sediment flows, speeding up the sinking and shrinking of the delta and threatening the future of Vietnam’s major rice basket, countless fishing communities and long-term economic sustainability.” Bunthoeurn called on Laos to take abandon dam projects and said Mekong governments should focus instead on generating energy from solar and wind.

There are many ways to start moving in the right way'","bodyText":"Jane Goodall is a primatologist who is regarded as one of the world’s leading authorities on chimpanzees. She has spent 60 years studying the chimps that live in the Gombe Stream national park and she is a prominent advocate, via several foundations, of protecting the great apes and their habitats. She has been presented with awards by the UN and various governments for her conservation and environmental work. She appears in the Netflix documentary The Beginning of Life 2. You warned last June that humanity will be finished if we don’t make drastic changes in response to the coronavirus pandemic and the climate crisis. Have you seen any indication of that drastic change? The window is closing. Business as usual – using up natural resources faster and faster – can’t carry on. In some cases, we are already using resources faster than they can be replenished. And we can see the consequences. Look at climate change. It is not something that might happen in the future; we are already seeing terrible hurricanes and floods and fires. It is building up into an inferno. When you think globally like that, it is very, very depressing. Do you feel that the pandemic has shifted perceptions, or created more of a sense of urgency? Maybe Covid has given a push that will make a difference. The most important lesson from this pandemic is that we need a new relationship with nature and animals. Our disrespect for animals creates conditions for the emergence of zoonotic diseases. You can see that same disrespect in factory farms, bushmeat and wildlife markets and the illegal wildlife trade. About 75% of all newly emerged diseases in humans are zoonotic. What more needs to be done? We need to move to a more sustainable relationship with the natural world. We need a greener economy. If countries move away from fossil fuels and subsidise clean, green energy that will create a lot of jobs. If you plant trees in a city it has enormous benefits – it cools the temperature, cleans the air, stabilises the soil against flooding and improves psychological and physical health, to mention only a few. We also need to cut down on waste. I grew up in the war, when food was rationed and you did not throw anything out. We need to value food more – as aboriginal people do. Do you think politicians and the public are focused enough on this challenge? As damage is coming to a peak, awareness is coming to a peak. But it does not help to focus exclusively on the problems. Yes, the media must point out the harm we are inflicting. But they should give more space to all the amazing restoration programmes happening around the world – that gives people hope and they are more likely to do their bit. If you lose hope, why bother? Where do you find cause for hope? Change is happening. Millions are switching to wind and solar energy, clearing up streams or picking up rubbish. Consumers are influencing the way business does its work. I am always meeting amazing people doing great projects to allow biodiversity to creep back. A lot of it in China. There are many different ways to start moving in the right way. How about at the national and international level? The Global Biodiversity Outlook 5 report found the international community did not fully achieve any of the 20 Aichi biodiversity targets agreed in Japan in 2010 to slow the loss of the natural world. Can we expect anything better at the next big UN biodiversity meeting in Kunming, China, next year? All I have seen, to be honest, is more decision makers talking about change and making plans, but not doing enough to make it happen. At these big meetings, there is so much talk and so little follow-up action. But now we are seeing more action among the youth. Children are standing up and influencing their parents, business leaders and politicians. Voting, in democracies, can make a big difference. You and David Attenborough both appear to be more active than ever. But has your approach changed? You have tended to focus on individual responsibility in the past. Is it now time for something more radical, for system change? I think we need many different approaches. There are instances when violent tactics are necessary to make people aware - like the anti-slavery movement. But violence can be counterproductive. I think people must change from within. If children point at dominant males and say “you are bad and we demand that you change”, the response may well be “I won’t be lectured by a young person”. My way is to tell stories, trying to reach the heart. Too often people give lip service to change but carry on with business as usual. Our organisation, Roots &amp; Shoots, works at the grassroots level with youth. The movement is growing very fast - all over North and South America, Africa, Europe and Asia, including over 1,000 groups in China. There are also new groups in the Middle East. Turkey and Israel, and I want to spread it further. We are linking youth from different countries together and finding partner organisations. It is really important to grow as the programme is giving young people hope. This is needed badly as we have caused so much environmental damage since we began in 1991. And without hope youth falls into apathy and does nothing. Many of of the early Roots &amp; Shoots members are now in leadership positions. But this is not just a matter of changing individual behaviour. Aren’t there are deeper causes in the way the global economy is organised? We are seeing the consequences of the crazy idea that there can be unlimited economic development on a planet with finite natural resources and a growing population. Decisions are made for short-term gain at the expense of protecting the environment for the future. Now, the world’s population is estimated at over 7 billion people and it is expected to be closer to 10 billion by 2050. If we carry on with business as usual what is going to happen? To be clear, the main problem is not population growth. I have never said that, although George Monbiot claims that I did, which is disappointing because I have always admired him. It is one of three main problems – the other two are our greedy lifestyle, our reckless burning of fossil fuels, the demand for meat, poverty – and, of course, we must also tackle corruption. To what extent do you feel that traditional conservation needs to change? We have to eliminate poverty. Because if people are really poor, they will destroy the environment because they have to feed themselves and their families. In 1990, I flew over Gombe national park [in Tanzania] and I was shocked to see the change. During the 1960s, it had been part of a vast equatorial forest. By 1990, Gombe was just a little island of trees, surrounded by land that had been stripped bare. It was then that I realised unless we could help people make a living without destroying their environment we couldn’t save chimps or forests. So we helped in many ways including providing scholarships for girls and offering microcredit opportunities, especially to women. It’s worked. If you fly over Gombe today, you don’t see those bare hills; the forest has come back. As women’s education improves, family sizes tend to drop. Women want to educate children. They don’t want to be birth machines. In the Netflix documentary The Beginning of Life 2, you and many other biologists, conservationists and psychologists stress the mental health and social benefits that can come from a close connection to the natural world, and warn of the dangers that this is being lost among a younger, more urban generation. When I was growing up, we did not even have television, so we immersed ourselves in books and nature. Children today have less time for that because they are fascinated by iPhones, laptops and video games. Also many more children grow up in cities, surrounded by concrete. The important thing is to get them into nature – the younger the better. In the documentary, you see the expression of wonder on a child’s face – a three-year-old boy watching a snail glide along. He suddenly picked it up, ran and put it on a window pane to watch it from the other side. This kind of experience is very, very important. It is only when you care for nature that you protect it. The film is very inspiring. How has lockdown affected people’s relationship with nature? In some cases, it has meant closer contact, but that depends on whether people have a garden or live near parks or green areas where they can walk. So many poor people were confined to the concrete jungle. And how has it affected you? I miss the contact with people, my friends. But I have adapted. I used to be travelling 300 days a year and meeting people face to face. Since I have been in lockdown, I do everything virtually and have reached millions more people in many more countries. So there is a silver lining. I try to find the silver lining in everything. We mustn’t lose hope. Anything you would like to add? You remind me of my favourite chimp, David Greybeard. • This article was amended on 4 January 2021.

The announcement confirms the development of a technique known as marine cloud brightening, trialled on the reef in March, will be backed as part of the government’s $443m grant being coordinated by the not-for-profit Great Barrier Reef Foundation. On Tuesday the government and the foundation announced how it would spend $96m this financial year under the Reef Trust Partnership – the $443m collaboration between government and the foundation. Included in the spending for this financial year is more than $15m to try and control coral-eating crown-of-thorns starfish, $39m to improve water quality and more than $3m for community-based projects, including citizen science. Earlier this year the reef suffered its third mass coral bleaching event in five years. About one quarter of the reef suffered severe bleaching in the most widespread event ever recorded, affecting the full length of the 2,300km world heritage marine park. Dr Daniel Harrison of Southern Cross University is the scientific lead for the $4.7m program to investigate cooling and shading techniques. Harrison told Guardian Australia: “We want to know if this will work, and we want to know as quickly as possible. “It’s critical that [greenhouse gas] emissions come down, but that alone won’t preserve a lot of the ecosystem value of the reef so we need to do other things as well.” About half of the $4.7m will be spent developing atmospheric modelling and monitoring to understand how particles in the air that clouds need to form behave over the reef. In-kind support of $1.86m from a consortium of academic institutions led by Southern Cross University, including the CSIRO, will be added to the $4.7m. Guardian Australia revealed that in March Harrison led a small research team to trial cloud-brightening equipment on Broadhurst reef near Townsville. In the experiment, a modified turbine with 100 high-pressure nozzles was placed on the back of a boat to spray trillions of nano-sized salt crystals into the air. When deployed at a larger scale, those salt crystals theoretically mix with low-altitude clouds to reflect more solar energy away from the waters around the reef. Brightening clouds could work on a scale large enough to both shade corals and cool sea surface temperatures that could be the difference between corals dying from bleaching or recovering. A technique known as fogging will also be developed over the coming 12 months. Using a similar deployment technique, larger droplets create localised fog that would aim to give some protection to individual reefs or groups of reefs that hold particular importance, either because of their cultural values, importance to tourism, fishing or for their biodiversity. Harrison said atmospheric modelling and surveying would be used to check whether the cloud-brightening approach could have any wider impacts. Engineering facilities would also be built. He said the cloud-brightening approach, if proven, would be deployed over the course of a month or two if temperatures got too high. The fogging technique would be used over a shorter time frame. He said both approaches could be switched off rapidly and the salt crystals remained in the air for only a day or two depending on conditions. Announcing the $96m of spending for the year, environment minister Sussan Ley said: “Over the next 12 months we will be testing new approaches and technologies to protect and preserve the Great Barrier Reef, building on the partnership’s key on-ground achievements from its first two years of operation.” Anna Marsden, managing director of the foundation, said there were “more than 60 reef-saving projects” under way in regional Queensland. She said: “The significant investment of $96m will mean that two-thirds of the $443m partnership will have been committed to reef-saving projects within a year. “Saving the reef is a huge task, but there is hope. We are proud to be doing our part to bring together people and science to deliver outcomes that will preserve the reef in the face of growing threats.” The foundation has a target to raise $357m in donations to top up the government funding, but Guardian Australia revealed last week that only $21.7m had been raised so far. A world heritage committee meeting scheduled for early July this year in China has been postponed, but was to consider if the reef should be placed on an “in danger” list. Australia has already conceded that climate change has caused damage to the unique attributes that led to it being listed as a world heritage site in 1981. Greens senator Larissa Waters criticised the work plan for this financial year, saying it “talks about the need to tackle climate change and transition to clean energy, but does nothing towards that goal”. She said plans to tackle crown-of-thorns starfish and shading the reef were “Band-Aid solutions”. She said: “This work plan is more rearranging of the deck chairs on the Titanic by a federal government that ignores and worsens the climate crisis, and underfunds water quality improvement by orders of magnitude.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2020/aug/12/native-americans-energy-inequality-electricity","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2020-08-12T10:00:02Z","webTitle":"Living in the dark: Native reservations struggle with power shortages in pandemic","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/aug/12/native-americans-energy-inequality-electricity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2020/aug/12/native-americans-energy-inequality-electricity","fields":{"headline":"Living in the dark: Native reservations struggle with power shortages in pandemic","bodyText":"Within hours of posting a video to Facebook and Twitter in which she offered to donate iPads to K-12 Native students, Amanda Cheromiah was inundated with increasingly desperate requests. This was back in March, as schools across the country started closing because of Covid-19. Cheromiah, a PhD student at the University of Arizona, had begun hearing stories of Native students parking outside gas stations to finish their homework or reading for class. It was there they could maybe get better cell reception, or wifi, or enough light when the power was out at home. Unequal access to utilities – especially electricity – made remote learning nearly impossible on Native lands. Cheromiah, who leads a mentorship program for Native students, said that for many students it was “just not an option”. She mailed about a dozen iPads to students before realizing their need for more resources was too great. The pandemic has exacerbated already severe energy and economic inequalities in Indian country. For decades, many tribes have suffered from inefficient energy infrastructure, high costs and a lack of funding for new projects. Low electricity rates are compounded by limited cell and broadband service on many reservations. These needs have only gotten worse during the pandemic. In the face of these challenges, Native people are turning to renewable energy to help their tribes achieve energy and economic independence. If successful, it could also provide growing job opportunities for communities that sorely need them. Energy infrastructure is essential to living with and containing the virus. Shawnell Damon, who leads contact-tracing efforts for the Navajo area Indian Health Service (IHS), said tracing on the Navajo nation requires “extra work that other contact tracers throughout the US don’t have to do”. For example, after attempting three phone calls, Navajo contact tracers send a community health worker to find that person, an extra step made more frequent by dropped calls and spotty cell service. Contact tracers at rural testing sites, like the ones found throughout the Navajo nation, are often forced to use paper records until they have a strong enough internet connection to upload the data to the Navajo area IHS database. Inadequate electric and heating systems are not only insufficient – they’re also more expensive, and the energy bills can quickly stack up in the pandemic. Henry Red Cloud, the Oglala Lakota founder of a solar training center on the Pine Ridge reservation in South Dakota, said Native people are desperate for solutions. “They’re quarantined in their homes and using a lot of power and not having the dollars to pay that kilowatt usage.” Over the past 20 years, Red Cloud’s various companies and initiatives have built thousands of renewable energy set-ups, like solar-powered furnaces and electrical systems that are also more affordable. But high energy costs aren’t the only problem for Native communities; on the Pine Ridge reservation, Red Cloud estimates there are thousands of people without any running water and electricity – making following hygiene guidelines and stay-at-home orders more complicated, if not completely unrealistic. Red Cloud stresses that these inequalities did not happen by accident. The federal government’s violations of treaties it made with tribes left many without essential resources. Decades of federal government decisions and policies have continued to ignore the rights and needs of tribes, according to Wahleah Johns, the head of the non-profit Native Renewables, which aims to bring off-grid solar power to the Navajo nation and other Indigenous communities. “In the early 1900s, when they were expanding the transmission grid, a lot of the plans didn’t include tribal nations and sovereign nations,” Johns said. The Rural Electrification Act of 1936, which offered federal loans to deploy electrical systems in rural areas across the country, but left out many tribal nations, is an example. These policies have directly led to inequalities that the pandemic is now exacerbating. Both Johns and Red Cloud run job trainings in solar power, which they hope can help Native communities find their own solutions to this crisis, which continues to disrupt every aspect of life. Typically, Cheromiah would have spent this spring traveling to tribal schools. But since the onset of the pandemic, the lack of energy and internet access means remote sessions were often impossible in many tribal communities. “Our students don’t even have the basics,” Cheromiah said. Johns is particularly passionate about bringing electricity to these rural Native communities, knowing that it will ease financial burdens and help communities stay connected. “How many trips you take the store to load up on food, especially fresh fruits – those are things most Americans take for granted during this pandemic [because they have the] luxury of access to power and refrigeration,” Johns explains. The pandemic has delayed several projects that aim to alleviate energy inequality in Indian country. Red Cloud and Johns have halted all solar jobs trainings. Light Up Navajo II, the second phase of a project that brought power to 225 Navajo homes in a 2019 pilot, has been put on hold. Despite the challenges, Johns remains optimistic. Her non-profit, Native Renewables, which had only built a half-dozen solar units before the pandemic, hopes to begin construction in September for the first one hundred units. Red Cloud is eager to resume trainings, which he plans to do in the fall. “There is going to be a huge shift towards clean energy, so what we’re doing is developing green teams so that when all of those jobs happen, Native people are going to be on the forefront,” said Red Cloud. Beyond the economic potential of solar energy, Johns and Red Cloud believe that it offers a path towards building stronger communities that will be more resilient to future challenges.

While the Morrison government has been trumpeting record recent investment in renewable energy to rebut persistent arguments the Coalition lacks ambition on climate policy, an assessment of the investment outlook prepared by the Clean Energy Council, to be released on Wednesday, warns the positive trend is in danger of abrupt reversal because of the ongoing lack of policy certainty. “After a record breaking two years of investment in large-scale wind and solar projects, the pace of projects reaching financial close has slowed dramatically over the past two quarters,” the investment outlook says. “Quarterly investment commitments in new renewable energy projects reached a high of over 4500MW in late 2018, but has since collapsed to less than 800MW in each of the first two quarters of 2019.” The report says the large-scale RET, which winds down after 2020, led to 15,700MW of new capacity being financially committed over the past two years, with that generation either under construction or recently commissioned. “But with the absence of policy certainty beyond the 2020 RET and a range of regulatory barriers to overcome, investment commitments in new generation have fallen dramatically this year.” It notes that with the rate of new investment now slowing, the forward outlook for wholesale energy prices has begun to rise again. “A sustained slow-down in the level of new large-scale generation will have a dramatic impact on Australia’s energy prices and reliability, as well as the ability to achieve future emissions reduction targets.” Executives from the renewable energy sector will converge on Canberra on Wednesday for their annual chief executives forum and parliamentary reception. The group will hear from the energy minister, Angus Taylor, the shadow minister, Mark Butler, and the Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, as well as the head of the Australian Energy Market Operator, Audrey Zibelman, who recently used Aemo’s latest 10-year forecast of reliability in Australia’s power supply to highlight the urgent need for more investment in dispatchable energy and in transmission infrastructure. That Aemo forecast warned Australia’s ageing thermal generators are increasingly unreliable. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Energy policy in Australia has been in a state of profound uncertainty since the dumping of the national energy guarantee (Neg) last August, when conservatives moved against then prime minister Malcolm Turnbull. The renewable energy sector supports reviving the Neg, as do the Liberal governments in New South Wales and South Australia. If the Neg cannot be revived, the industry is calling on the Morrison government to extend the RET beyond 2020, implement a clean energy target, or revisit carbon pricing. The new investment outlook produced for the Clean Energy Council is cool on a Morrison government proposal to underwrite investment in new power generation. It says the “program has the potential to support a wave of new projects, but a higher level of transparency is needed in relation to the selection of projects to minimise the impact on market confidence”. Kane Thornton, the chief executive of the Clean Energy Council, said: “With Australia’s coal-fired power stations ageing rapidly, it is essential new clean energy projects are built now to ensure lower power prices and improved reliability when these old clunkers retire from service.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2020/may/29/experience-i-raised-an-ocelot-in-the-jungle","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2020-05-29T09:00:56Z","webTitle":"Experience: I raised an ocelot in the jungle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/may/29/experience-i-raised-an-ocelot-in-the-jungle","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2020/may/29/experience-i-raised-an-ocelot-in-the-jungle","fields":{"headline":"Experience: I raised an ocelot in the jungle","bodyText":"I joined the army shortly after leaving school. Initially I enjoyed the feeling of brotherhood but, seven months after joining, I was deployed to Afghanistan. In the first week, I saw someone get shot in the head, and held his arm while he died. I was 18 years old. In the six months I was there, I experienced horrific events which led me to question my purpose in life. I’ve suffered with depression in the past, but when I returned to England, I struggled with PTSD. After being medically discharged, I searched online for ways to help out in the Amazon and came across a volunteer organisation called Fauna Forever, in Peru. I booked a flight with the small payout I’d fought for. I wanted to help animals but, ultimately, I went to Peru with the intention of ending my life. After a few weeks volunteering, however, I realised that, although I was in a bad place, the jungle was making me happy. I fitted in so much better. I went back and forth between England and Peru over the coming years, but it was on my fourth trip, when I was out in the Amazon for six months, that Keanu came into my life. I was working at an eco-lodge I’d helped build on a past visit. Some members of the local community had brought a kitten to the lodge. I held him and cried. He was so tiny. His mother had been killed due to logging; he’d been destined for the illegal wildlife trade and hadn’t even opened his eyes yet. I’d previously attempted to rehabilitate another orphaned ocelot in the wild, but Khan was killed by a poacher’s trap when he was 11 months old. This was my second chance. I named him Keanu, after the Matrix films. Ocelots need a lot of wild space, so we decided to build a platform two hours upriver, deep in the jungle. It was one metre above ground, had a roof and solar panels. Ocelots are nocturnal, so Keanu and I would go out for seven or eight hours a night looking for rodents for him to eat – although we would also catch birds, snakes, lizards, frogs and bats. A mother ocelot hunts with her offspring, so in the early days I had to help out a lot. I was so proud when, aged five months, he killed his first rodent by himself. That was a big step and it made me feel I was on the right path with him. I would get time to chill out when Keanu was sleeping. I used solar energy to charge my laptop to watch something, listen to music or cook. I was living both a human and an ocelot life. Every two weeks I’d go by boat to the local community to get supplies for myself: rice, lentils and sometimes a live chicken. I also hunted for birds and went fishing. The stream near the platform was my lifeline. I didn’t have running water, so I’d collect buckets from the stream for washing myself, my clothes and dishes. If it rained, I’d collect the rainwater to drink, as it was so much fresher. I was alone a lot, but not always. Some film-makers who were recording my experience in a documentary, Raising Khan, would visit every month. The only thing that scared me in the jungle was my mental health. There were days when I still felt depressed, but I wouldn’t have changed it. People ask if Keanu ever harmed me. The truth is, yes. Ocelots have sharp claws and teeth, and our skin isn’t as thick as theirs. He would bite, scratch and get defensive over food. I’ve got scars on my arms, legs and face from when the play-fighting became too boisterous. At first I was very protective of Keanu, but as he got older he would go off and explore, coming back to me as he wanted. He would curl up with me on the forest floor. As time went on, the gap between us grew. By 14 months, he was capable of living by himself, and at that point I had to think about my own physical and mental health. Although the jungle is beautiful, it can wear you down. I’ve always liked to be alone and have adventures. I don’t feel as if I’ve changed, but I learned a lot. Those two cats taught me more than anyone in my life. The last time I saw Keanu, I gave him some chicken and he went to attack me, to keep me away from his food. That was a good sign. • As told to Amy Sedghi. In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

The Adam Smith Institute recently released a paper on the topic that made many of the same points as George Monbiot (Lab-grown food will end farming – and save the planet, Journal, 8 January). One overlooked benefit of lab-grown food is that it may help the UK tackle the crisis in housing affordability. As farming is superseded by precision fermentation, the significant amount of land currently used for livestock farming (including parts of the green belt) will be freed up for development in places that people actually want to live. However, we’d take a different lesson from the promise of lab-grown meat. Free-market environmentalism and harnessing the power of innovative technologies – supported by market-based measures like a border-adjusted carbon tax – can successfully tackle the problem of manmade climate change without fundamentally uprooting the way we run society. Saving the planet doesn’t have to cost us the earth. Daniel Pryor Adam Smith Institute • There are fundamental reasons why the Solar Foods system that George Monbiot refers to can’t compete with plants for sustainable food production. The supply of minerals for bacteria has to be assembled chemically, with all the chemical industry’s environmental downsides. By contrast, plant roots pull the right minerals in the right proportions out of mixed-up traces in the environment, using solar energy to fuel selective concentration at no cost, generating no heat or chemical pollution and requiring no purified water. The machinery by which plants acquire raw materials is itself built by the plant using solar energy in a non-polluting process, not made in a factory. Likewise, the light-energy-trapping machinery of plants is assembled on a planetary scale, with none of the unwelcome by-products of heat and chemical pollution associated with the fabrication of solar cells and wind turbines, and with the generation of hydrogen from water by electricity. The claim that “the hydrogen pathway used by Solar Foods is about 10 times as efficient as photosynthesis” is meaningless if we’re not told which aspects of the two processes are being compared. Unlike food from plants, no industrially generated food could provide the right mix of dietary constituents essential for health, such as balanced vitamins, minerals and bulk fibre. Supplying these as additives cancels any advantage of electric food. Plants are still the only source of food with long-term sustainability. David E Hanke Cambridge • There is much food for thought in George Monbiot’s paean to precision fermentation. He has undoubtedly made the case that agricultural business as usual is not an option. However, his techno-utopianism needs to come with a hefty side order of the precautionary principle. He acknowledges the likely impact on the agricultural sector, arguing that governments should “help farmers into other forms of employment” (that worked out well for the miners and steelworkers), and that “strong anti-trust laws” will limit the commercial rapaciousness of the new producers (ditto the digital giants and fossil fuel companies). Millions of people globally grow, hunt or raise food not to make money, but to feed their families. Where will they get the cash to buy the new stuff? The science may seem simple, but the politics is a minefield. On top of that we are talking about food, not fuel. Vitamin supplements are less effective for health and wellbeing than a varied, mostly plant-based diet. Will foods based on individual proteins meet all our dietary requirements as well as the complex foods we have evolved to consume? What will be the impact on our gut microbiomes? Or our immune systems? Taste, smell, colour and texture all play a part in palatability: enjoyment is a critical part of our food psychology. No doubt the food processing industry will rise to the challenge of making farmfree food fun, but it could take decades. A rapid switch to such foods would be a massive experiment on the global public: there would need to be clinical trials. We will not reap the potential advantages if the consequences are not fully explored. Georgina Ferry Oxford • Globally, over 1.3 billion people rely on livestock farming for their livelihoods, either as farmers or as part of the livestock food supply chain. Meat and dairy have known health benefits, and consumption of animal-based food during early life has been linked with lower levels of malnutrition and improved health outcomes. In many ways, British farming is the envy of the world, with high levels of sustainability and sensible land use – for example, most sheep are raised on land that could not be used for any other purpose – and the National Farmers’ Union has committed to the sector being carbon neutral by 2040. It is important to acknowledge that certain types of livestock farming may have issues with sustainability and climate change. But it is not true of all farming systems; and the issues that do exist are being dealt with using the latest research into genetics and biotechnology – for example, recent research has shown that certain types of seaweed can reduce methane emissions from cattle to close to zero. High-profile movements such as EAT-Lancet and Veganuary gain widespread press coverage, yet the fact that the World Health Organization rejected the EAT-Lancet recommendations was largely unreported, and a recent analysis of sales data showed that Veganuary in 2019 was not associated with a reduction in meat and dairy sales. Farmer data also shows that increased sales of alternative milks have not seen a corresponding reduction in dairy sales. The global food system, consumer choices and climate change are incredibly complex issues, and anyone who proposes simple solutions is almost certainly not in possession of all the relevant facts and data. Livestock are an important part of humanity’s future food needs.

The Australian-German Energy Transition Hub was announced in 2017 by then prime minister Malcolm Turnbull and German chancellor Angela Merkel as a collaboration that would “help the technical, economic and social transition to new energy systems and a low emissions economy”. Based at the University of Melbourne, the Australian National University and three German institutions, it was to receive $4m over five years from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade as part of an eventual full cross-country funding of $20m. But in an email to staff on Friday afternoon, hub managers said the department had told them the government had decided it would “not follow through on its original commitment to fund the hub until 2022”. Government funding for the hub will end in June. Guardian Australia has been told there is $1.75m unpaid from the original agreement. Some researchers said the decision made little sense given the hub’s work included areas of government interest, particularly the development of a clean hydrogen industry. Other hub projects focus on energy storage, energy system modelling, plans for a just transition to clean energy and integrating solar energy into the grid. Dylan McConnell, from the University of Melbourne’s climate and energy college, said: “It’s seems pretty hypocritical and counter-intuitive to be talking about this [hydrogen] and at the same time cutting funding.” The email said the department had indicated it hoped the hub would “continue to deliver” but it wanted to “refocus” resources “at a time of tight budgets”. It said negotiations between the University of Melbourne and the department were under way, and the university was “looking at the options for different levels of support”. “Now, it is very early days to say what comes next,” the email, by hub managing director Rebecca Burdon and co-directors, Malte Meinshausen and Frank Jotzo, said. “We know that our contribution is filling a key niche in the Australian and international research landscape, on a topic that is continuing to gain in importance. And we know that we have a great group of researchers (you!) working on crucial issues, and that we’ve established powerful networks. “We also know that industry and most state governments, and many parts of the federal government, are keenly interested in the energy transition. And we know that the bilateral relationship between Australia and Germany is and remains important, including on energy. We will need to recalibrate our activities in order to maximise opportunities for alternative funding.” The email said the department had noted in its reasoning that the German government had not continued funding for its side of the hub, which was for two and a half years. But it said the German institutes remained involved and were part of a separate upcoming major project funded by the government that was designed to advance the energy transition. On Friday night, a department spokesperson said the goals of the hub were to strengthen Australia’s bilateral relationship with Germany and better coordinate investments in research in energy transition. They said the remaining funding would be reallocated “to support our strategic priorities with Germany and other European partners more effectively, including potential collaboration with Germany on hydrogen”. Jotzo, Meinshausen and hub chairman Ross Garnaut declined to comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2022/nov/15/australia-live-news-anthony-albanese-china-dialogue-xi-jinping-flood-warnings-nsw-weather-g20-cop27-climate-change-chris-bowen","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-15T10:00:26Z","webTitle":"PM holds bilateral talks with Chinese president – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2022/nov/15/australia-live-news-anthony-albanese-china-dialogue-xi-jinping-flood-warnings-nsw-weather-g20-cop27-climate-change-chris-bowen","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2022/nov/15/australia-live-news-anthony-albanese-china-dialogue-xi-jinping-flood-warnings-nsw-weather-g20-cop27-climate-change-chris-bowen","fields":{"headline":"PM holds bilateral talks with Chinese president – as it happened","bodyText":"Guardian Australia’s political editor Katharine Murphy is in Bali following Anthony Albanese at the G20 summit, and will file a despatch from the prime minister’s meeting with China’s president Xi Jinping. That will be live on our website shortly. With that, we’ll wrap up our live coverage of the day’s news. Here’s a summary of the day’s main news developments: Prime minister Anthony Albanese has raised the cases of two Australian citizens detained in China, human rights abuses in Xinjiang and concerns over Taiwan during a 32-minute meeting with China’s president Xi Jinping, as he became the first Australian leader to hold talks with Xi since 2016. The New South Wales town of Forbes faced record flooding on Tuesday, as the community of Eugowra reeled from the “inland tsunami” that inundated the town on Monday and resulted in more than one in five residents requiring an emergency rescue. Tennis star Novak Djokovic will be given a visa by the Australian government, allowing him to compete in the 2023 Australian Open. The Reserve Bank has stoked expectations it is prepared to pause in lifting its key interest rate, while also flagging it will curb the telegraphing of future moves. Covid hospitalisations have increased by 11% in the past week, the federal health minister Mark Butler said, as he announced new vaccines have been approved to boost supply. Two genetic experts have told the inquiry into the convictions of Kathleen Folbigg that a “bad variant”, or rare genetic mutation, likely led to the deaths of her two daughters. Billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes has succeeded in shaking up the board of Australia’s biggest electricity producer, with all four of his proposed directors winning support from shareholders at AGL Energy’s annual general meeting. Have a great evening. We’ll be back to do it all again tomorrow. Eugowra residents recall moment flood hit NSW town leaving ‘total carnage’ The first warning came through on Sunday. Heavy rainfall – for the second time in a fortnight – was lashing central west New South Wales, from Mudgee in the north to Albury in the south. The Belubula River at Canowindra was flooding at a level not seen in more than 70 years. Flooding was expected to be worst at the nearby township of Eugowra early on Monday morning. When the rain came it came down hard. The mayor of Orange, Jason Hamling, was at home on Sunday night when it started “teeming down”. “It came rolling through and the country was already saturated,” he said. Then, the Wyangala Dam spilled, releasing torrents of water into the nearby Lachlan River. Hamling watched footage that showed the moment a tidal wave came rushing at the rate of 230,000 megalitres a day. Read more from Caitlin Cassidy and Cait Kelly: PM says Xi meeting went ‘over time’ Anthony Albanese played down any significance over the short length of his meeting with Xi – which lasted just 32 minutes in contrast to the three hours that Xi spent in his G20 meeting with US president Joe Biden. The prime minister denied Xi ended the meeting early, and insisted it had in fact run over time. It went over time (for) when it was scheduled, and it was very constructive.” Climate change ‘requires a global response’: Albanese to Xi Anthony Albanese spoke with Chinese president Xi Jinping about the climate crisis and “the need for us to work together in tackling climate change”. I referred to the floods that are occurring in New South Wales, that climate change is a global issue and it requires a global response.” Albanese also said he spoke to Xi about his concerns over Taiwan. China has an important role to play on Taiwan. I certainly raised that issue. I put Australia’s position which is support for the status quo, which I put forward in the meeting. And that we didn’t wish to see any change to that status.” PM raises detention of Cheng Lei and Yang Hengjun with China’s president Anthony Albanese said he raised issues including the detention of Australian citizens Cheng Lei and Yang Hengjun during his meeting with Xi Jinping. The prime minister said he “put forward Australia’s position when it comes to the blockages in our trading relationship”. He said he also “put forward the differences that we have on human rights issues, including Xinjiang”, a reference to allegations of human rights abuses against the region’s Uyghur population. Albanese added: I also put forward our position on Ukraine and asked that China exercise its influence on Russia, specifically about Russia’s threats to use tactical nuclear weapons. I noted that China had called that out, and that that is a good thing.” Anthony Albanese is speaking after his meeting with China’s president Xi Jinping. The prime minister said the meeting was “a very positive and constructive discussion”. Albanese said: And I was pleased that it was held. We know that China is Australia’s largest trading partner. They are worth more than Japan, the US and Republic of Korea together, combined. So it’s an important relationship for Australia and Australia seeks a stable relationship with China. We have big differences to manage, but we’re always going to be better off when we have dialogue and are able to talk constructively and respectfully but also honestly about what those differences are and we were able to do that this afternoon. Today I think both countries took an important step to moving forward. There are many steps of course that we are yet to take and I have said consistently since before I became prime minister we will cooperate where we can and disagree where we must act in the national interest. One of the things that struck me was that both of us spoke about how we have highly complementary economies. It is clearly in Australia’s interest to export some of the foreign products that we have a choice in China’s interest to receive those foreign products. And so it was a very constructive discussion.” Anthony Albanese said his meeting with China’s president Xi Jinping was “a positive and constructive discussion”. In a tweet, the prime minister said: It was good to discuss our relationship with China’s President Xi Jinping. It was a positive and constructive discussion. We will cooperate where we can, disagree where we must, and engage in our national interest.” The leaders are on the clock tonight. They need to get to the summit’s gala dinner. The bilateral between Joe Biden and Xi Jinping spanned three hours on Monday night. Officials say the meeting between Albanese and Xi has now wrapped. The conversation spanned 32 minutes. Here is a translation of Chinese president Xi Jinping’s comments during the opening remarks of the bilateral meeting. According to the AFP news agency, Xi said: “I am very glad to meet Mr prime minister Albanese here. This is our first meeting so hereby I congratulate you again for your appointment as Australia’s prime minister. China-Australia relations used to be in the forefront of China’s relations with developed countries for a long time. This is worth cherishing. In the past few years, China-Australia relationship has run into some difficulties. That was not what we were willing to see. Because China and Australia are both important countries in the Asia Pacific Region. We should improve, maintain and develop our relationship as it is consistent with the fundamental interests of both countries’ people, and it is beneficial to peaceful development of the region and the world. Since you assumed the leadership, you have talked about China-Australia relations on various occasions and expressed multiple times that you would handle China-Australia relations in a mature manner. I attach great importance to your opinion.” After thanking Xi for the meeting, Albanese noted the discussion came at a time of great uncertainty. The world faced supply chain shocks, economic headwinds, the Covid-19 recovery and the lived reality of the climate crisis. “As we manage these challenges we need to work towards a stable, prosperous and peaceful Indo-Pacific, and an international system that is governed by international law and the principles enshrined in the United Nations charter.” “We have had our differences and Australia won’t resile from our interests or our values. But our bilateral relationship is an important one. Both sides have worked to stabilise the relationship based upon mutual respect and mutual benefit.” This conversation is happening at the luxury Mulia Resort in Nusa Dua, Bali. Xi entered the room first. Albanese second. They shook hands and then took their places at the tables. As is the case during international summits, these events are high security, and they are covered by a small pool of journalists and cameras. The West Australian’s political editor, Katina Curtis, is the pool reporter for the Australian delegation. She tells me Xi had his head down writing notes as Albanese spoke. Hello from Bali. The Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, and the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, have just delivered the opening remarks of tonight’s bilateral. Xi spoke first, in Mandarin, we do not yet have a translation. Albanese followed. Albanese told Xi he was very pleased the two leaders were meeting. Tonight ends a diplomatic freeze that’s been playing out since 2016. But he also made the difficulties clear. Albanese said the two countries have had their differences and Australia won’t resile “from our interests or our values”. Anthony Albanese has begun talks with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Bali this evening. Speaking in front of cameras at the beginning of the meeting, the prime minister said it was happening at “a time of great global uncertainty”, noting the “challenges of Covid and the recovery, dealing with climate change and also supply chain shocks”. “As we manage these challenges we need to work towards a stable, prosperous, and peaceful Indo-Pacific, and an international system that is governed by international law and the principles that are enshrined in the United Nations Charter,” Albanese said. Albanese also acknowledged the bilateral relationship had soured in recent times: We have had our differences, and Australia won’t resile from our interests or our values, but our bilateral relationship is an important one. Both sides have worked to stabilise the relationship based upon mutual respect and mutual benefit. We will soon reach, of course, the milestone of 50 years of diplomatic relations, when a former Labor prime minister, Gough Whitlam, established diplomatic relations between Australia and the People’s Republic of China in 1972. We agreed on principles to guide the relationship, based on equality, mutual respect and benefit and a commitment to co-exist peacefully, and these principles remain important today. President Xi I look forward to a constructive exchange and dialogue today, I thank you. Fair Work Commission may stop lockout at tugboat operator Svitzer The Fair Work Commission has announced that tugboat operator Svitzer’s announcement of a lockout on Friday has prompted it to consider making an order on its own initiative to suspend or terminate protected industrial action by Svitzer. The commission will hold a hearing at noon tomorrow to consider terminating the lockout which has prompted fears of widespread supply chain disruptions ahead of Christmas. The Fair Work Commission vice-president, Adam Hatcher, noted that in February 2022 it had suspended proposed 48-hour stoppages at Svitzer because they “threatened to cause significant damage to an important part of the Australian economy”. He said that findings the commission made at that time “give rise to a concern that the protected industrial action recently announced by Svitzer may similarly threaten to cause significant damage to the Australian economy or an important part of it”. Anthony Albanese to meet Xi Jinping at G20 summit in Bali We’ll be keeping this live blog open a little later than usual tonight, as Anthony Albanese meets with China’s president, Xi Jinping, on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Indonesia. Ahead of the meeting, the Business Council of Australia has hailed the Albanese government’s “tremendous reset” with China. The BCA chief executive, Jennifer Westacott, told journalists on Monday night that Labor’s “huge foreign policy reset” with Indonesia and Pacific countries, as well as the thawing in relations with China, was creating opportunity “for business to come in behind … and start building those business-to-business relationships”.

A stench of rotting carpet and rubbish hangs over what was once a space of celebration, with the bowling green covered in mud, unusable anytime soon. The club’s treasurer, Yvonne Clyde, takes a deep breath when asked how she feels seeing the club ruined and empty. “I’m just very drained, very drained and devastated,” she says. “The water had come up to knee height and just got into every space and crevice. It feels like every time we make some progress with the clean-up, we find more mud, more water.” She says no part of the club was untouched by the surging flood waters, from the ATM to the glasses, the honours board, the vaults and seating, even the small office from which the club is run. “Everything has been ruined. I think we’d need a year to recover fully, beyond just the cosmetic clean-up. “I’m hoping we can rebuild, but we have already lost so much. We had so many bookings, so many parties and functions that are now lost. And its especially damaging because we were heading into Christmas.” ‘Everything has been touched by mud’: Molong unites for massive flood clean-up Empty shopfronts dot Bank Street in central Molong, as the town begins processing the scale of damage flood waters have wrought. Restaurants have emptied their seating onto the footpath, volunteers hose the mud out of businesses, and people hug closely when they see each other. Residents say they are proud of the resilience and community spirit in the small town, as people band together to quickly clean the major damage before getting to the more arduous, final phase of the clean-up. Volunteer Jenny, who is helping clean the local gym, says the water has “severely damaged” parts of the town. “We’ve seen flooding before, but not like this. It’s just gone through everything, all the equipment here is damaged, everything has been touched by mud. “But we’re so lucky to have this supportive community, they’ve just turned up. It’s amazing how quickly they cleaned everything up.” Harriet Pederick, who says she’s lost $40,000 worth of stock from her health store, says that despite the devastation the town spirit is “amazing.” “Everyone has come together for this massive clean-up, it’s been amazing to see. “There are some true heroes in this town, everyone has been out here today and yesterday, some just here to have a cry with. “We’ll be back though, we won’t give up on our business and this town.” Meanwhile, some more footage is coming out of Eugowra, the town of about 700 where more than one in five residents had to be rescued by emergency services on Monday. Floods have also hit Victoria this week. Had a busy day? Unable to keep up with the news? Check out Guardian Australia’s Afternoon Update: ‘Weeks and weeks of cleaning up to do’: Molong begins long process of rebuilding after flood Molong is in recovery mode, as residents begin the long process of rebuilding after flood waters swept through the town centre yesterday morning. Windows are boarded up, businesses closed, and volunteers are still hosing down the mud this afternoon, with a sense of exhaustion hanging over the town. Sharon Costa is volunteering at the hardware store, at the end of Bank Street, which saw waters reach as high as the awnings at the pub across the road. She says that while there is stock to be saved at the hardware store, many other businesses are completely ruined. “Their windows have been shattered, doorways and ceilings have collapsed, machinery or anything electrical is ruined. The local newsagency had to just throw everything out. It’s devastating. “I think some of these businesses won’t survive this.” Costa describes the scene as “surreal” as the sun shines on the town’s muddied roads. While much of the obvious debris and rubbish has been cleaned, she says the work has only begun. “It looks OK on the outside now, but there is weeks and weeks of cleaning up to do, behind and beside the buildings, in places you don’t notice. There’s still so much to do, behind the broken windows, down the alleyways of mud and rubbish.” A second Australian has died following a Halloween crowd crush in the South Korean capital last month, reports AAP. The woman succumbed to injuries sustained during the crush after two weeks. More than 150 people were killed in the tragedy during festivities in Seoul’s Itaewon district. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said it was providing assistance to the woman’s family. Sydney film production assistant Grace Rached was the first Australian to die in the days after the tragedy.

Guardian Australia understands that immigration minister, Andrew Giles, will give Djokovic a visa, overturning a three-year ban that accompanied the decision by the previous government to cancel his visa on the eve of the 2022 open. Read more of the Guardian’s exclusive story here: Wyangala dam spill forecast to ease but flood risks remain Most of the inland dams in eastern Australia are either full or spilling, it seems, with Wyangala Dam in central NSW putting on quite a spectacle: Of course, all that water entering the Lachlan River is not a good thing, swelling the river and raising the major flooding risks downstream in places such as Cowra. At its peak flows, Wyangala was dumping water at the record rate of 230 gigalitres a day (or almost half a Sydney Harbour). Fortunately, the spill rate had dropped to 80GL/day by Tuesday morning, WaterNSW said earlier today. With inflows mercifully dropping from 265GL/day at their peak to about a third of that, the dam outflows were forecast to drop to 60/GL a day too. Dam capacity remained slightly above 100%. All that flooding will likely raise questions about whether the dam wall should be raised 10 metres, as proposed by the fomer Berejiklian government. The price tag, though, had tripled to $2.1bn as of a couple of years ago, prompting unkind comments that it was a “brain fart”. More to the point, though, a higher dam wall would only increase the capacity by half to 1867GL. At the rate of the recent increases, would a couple of days of delayed outflows be worth spending so much money on? No doubt this issue will be debated - not least because the Albanese government is unlikely to stump up half the cash as originally agreed between the then Coalition-led federal and NSW governments. Health authorities in New South Wales are urging residents to check any poppy seeds in their kitchen are not affected by a nationwide recall of poppy seeds linked to poisoning. Investigations into the non-food grade poppy seeds sold as part of food grade products have indicated the presence of unusually high levels of the naturally occurring chemical thebaine that is causing toxicity. While warnings have previously been issued in relation to the poppyseed recall, new information discovered as part of the investigation has found the poppyseeds should not be consumed in any amount. A NSW Health statement said: Reports of unusual and severe symptoms following poppy seed consumption have now seen at least 12 people requiring medical attention in NSW after developing poisoning soon after ingestion, with additional cases nationally.” Medical director of the NSW Poisons Information Centre, associate professor Darren Roberts, said the product was not considered safe to eat or to drink as the chemical detected in the poppy seed product can be dangerous. Roberts urged anyone experiencing any unusual and severe symptoms to seek immediate medical attention. Reported symptoms have so far included severe muscle cramping, muscle spasms and abnormal movements, seizures and cardiac arrest. Products affected are listed on the FSANZ website and will be updated as needed. The NSW Poisons Information Centre can be contacted 24/7 on 13 11 26 and can provide more information about poisons and what to do in suspected cases of poppy seed poisoning. Snow falls in Tasmania Parts of Tasmania have been dusted with spring snow, with a weather system dumping more rain on the already drenched state. Snowfall reached as low as 400 metres on Tuesday morning and settled on areas including Hobart’s kunanyi/Mt Wellington, south of the capital and the Central Highlands. Read more: Sun Cable inks deal with Indonesia to “unlock” renewable riches Sun Cable, a firm backed by billionaires Mike Cannon-Brookes and Andrew Forrest, has inked a deal on the sides of the G20 meeting in Bali to boost “inter-island connectivity”, among other things. As we noted earlier, Cannon-Brookes has had a busy day with changes at AGL (outside his day job of being co-boss of Atlassian). Anyway, Sun Cable is planning a $30bn giant solar farm in Australia that could supply electricity to Darwin but also to Singapore via an undersea cable. Since that cable will run through Indonesia, it’s been a live question (so to speak) whether Indonesia might also tap into the power. Well, according to an MoU signed today between Sun Cable and Indonesia’s minister for energy and mineral resources, Arifin Tasrif, a formal collaboration will emerge “to advance opportunities for renewable energy generation and transmission within Indonesia”. Numbers can be a bit inflated around these things, but the two could help spur a “green industry” bonanza which would add as much as $US115bn to Indonesia’s GDP by 2035, the partners say. (In $A, that’s about $171bn, but in rupee, it’s 1.6 quadrillion - or a pretty big number). From what we can make of it, Indonesia has identified five key industries from mining and metals processing that could do with some “green hydrogen” (ie not made with fossil fuels), to transport and even “green fertilisers”. Sun Cable’s “expertise in solar energy generation and long distance transmission” could play a role. Given Indonesia is reportedly also talking about linking up Australia’s large lithium reserves with its plans to expand its battery production, we might expect more such ventures. Major anger among minor parties over preferences sting The state leader of Derryn Hinch’s Justice party, Stuart Grimley, has come out swinging against the Animal Justice party after it gained the support of parties working with “preference whisperer”, Glen Druery, but directed its own preferences to others at the last minute. The state election manager and lead southern metropolitan candidate for the Animal Justice party, Ben Schultz, gained Druery’s trust over several months and was allocated preferences from his voting bloc of minor parties. Schultz was meant to reciprocate but instead directed preferences to a bloc of progressive parties, including Fiona Patten’s Reason party, Legalise Cannabis, the Victorian Socialists, as well as Labor and the Greens. Druery’s preferences flowing to AJP candidate Georgie Purcell makes it much harder for Grimley’s Justice party colleague, Tania Maxwell to retain her seat in the northern Victoria region. Grimley says the Animal Justice party “had a deliberate strategy, from the outset, to deceive other minor parties in preference negotiations. They sought to scam parties, and they did”. “The Animal Justice Party will tell you they’re a party of integrity but take one look at their voting record and you’ll realise they’re just a lacky for the Government. Nothing more. If the AJP are happy to lie and deceive their way into the Parliament, what do you think will happen if they hold the balance of power? If you thought it couldn’t get any worse than the last 4 years, think again. Electoral analyst Ben Raue had an interesting take on the matter: Here’s our story on the saga - described by Druey as the “most elaborate sting in minor party history”: The State Emergency Service in New South Wales is focussing its flood assistance and rescue efforts on the town of Forbes, as the Lachlan River continues to rise toward record levels. The NSW SES chief superintendent, Dallas Burnes, said his organisation has “as many emergency services resources as possible in the Central West, including rescue helicopters” and that the Australian Defence Force and international personnel are arriving today. Burnes said: “After 120mm of rain fell in the area on Sunday night, our members have worked alongside emergency service partners to prepare the Forbes community, including sandbagging and public information.” Eugowra – the community of about 700 which faced devastating flood levels on Monday which resulted in more than one in five residents needing to be rescued – has reported significant damage with power and telecommunication coverage still being restored. “We have reports of floodwater moving whole houses downstream and bridges being moved off pylons. Police are continuing to work with welfare services to assist the Eugowra community. Burnes said the SES is asking flood victims to use the Australian Red Cross Register. Find. Reunite (https://register.redcross.org.au/) channel to connect family, friends and loved ones. The SES said planning is underway for more international resources to be deployed to assist with flood response and recovery, with the Bureau of Meteorology forecasting further storms in the state’s south next weekend. In the 24 hours from 3pm on Monday, the SES in NSW has performed: Requests for assistance: 489 Flood rescues: 34 As of 3pm on Tuesday, the SES has 120 warnings in place, including 25 emergency warnings to either evacuate or shelter, 76 watch and act warnings and 19 alerts at advice level.

Australian Open organisers hopeful Djokovic can play Tennis Australia head, Craig Tiley, is optimistic about Novak Djokovic returning for next year’s Australian Open but has ruled out seeking any favours from government officials who will determine the Serb’s eligibility to enter the country, reports AAP. Djokovic is serving an automatic three-year ban from Australia after being dramatically deported on the eve of this year’s Open for trying to enter the country while not vaccinated against Covid-19. While the vaccine mandate is no longer an obstacle for the former world No.1, Djokovic’s lawyers are still trying to have his visa ban overturned. “Nothing official yet. We are waiting. They are communicating with the government of Australia. That’s all I can tell you for now,” Djokovic told reporters after winning his opening match at the ATP finals in Turin on Monday night. With Wednesday marking two months before the 2023 Open gets underway in Melbourne, the stalemate is hardly ideal, but Tiley is hopeful tennis fans - and Djokovic - will not have to endure a re-run of this year’s soap opera. Tiley said Djokovic would have to go through the normal visa application process and that he doesn’t think the former world No.1, nor any other players, should receive “preferential treatment”. Tiley told AAP: I fully expect to have an answer for everyone by the time that they need to book their flights and come in, including Novak. That’s entirely up to the Australian government. I know Novak wants to come and play and to get back to competing. He loves Australia and it’s where he’s had the best success but the timing (on any announcement) is up to somebody else and we’ll just play that one by ear. But I don’t know that. That’s really between he and the feds. But the conditions have changed significantly from where they were a year ago and I’d like to have Novak here.” Queensland police commissioner ‘hoping to survive’ in role amid force’s racism and sexism scandals The Queensland police commissioner, Katarina Carroll, says she is “hoping” to keep her job amid increasing pressure on the Queensland police service’s leadership over revelations about racism, sexism and misogyny in the ranks. On Tuesday Carroll and the police minister, Mark Ryan, spent almost an hour answering questions from the media after the release of audio recordings – published by Guardian Australia – that contained officers using racist and violent language. “The stuff that we heard in the watch house is truly abhorrent,” Carroll said. Read more: Elias Visontay will take you through the rest of the afternoon. We will let you know if there is any more information on the Forbes flood situation. Thanks for joining me today and please – take care of you. The Reserve Bank is, as we know, as much about messaging as it is about interest rate hiking or cutting. Getting the public worried about coming rate rises helps dent demand, and in doing so, removes some of the need for those raises. So it’s notable today that the RBA is sending slightly mixed messages. On the one hand, the release of the minutes from its 1 November board meeting (when it raised interest rates for a seventh time in as many meetings) suggests the central bank might be quite happy to leave the cash rate at 2.85% a bit longer if necessary. Missing from the October board minutes this time around were the words that conditions were “likely to require further increases in interest rates over the period ahead”. As CBA’s top Australian economist, Gareth Aird, notes, the November tea leaves launched comments that were echoed later that day by governor Philip Lowe that, “the board is prepared to keep rates unchanged for a period while it assesses the state of the economy and the inflation outlook”. Aird counts five times this phrase has appeared since the rate hike ... basically every time a senior RBA official has popped her or his head up in public. We’ll find out on 6 December whether the RBA’s assessment is to stay relaxed and smiling as we head to the Christmas break. The bank, after all, takes a holiday in January unless something dramatic happens. (The GFC wasn’t dramatic enough for a board meeting in January.) Anyway, there’s another messaging issue to look at. The RBA has reviewed its “forward guidance” and whether telling everyone that it was unlikely to hike the cash rate (with certain caveats) until 2023 or 2024 was not an optimal outcome. The forward guidance was state-based, but at various times included a time-based element,” the RBA said in its findings. This complicated the Bank’s attempts to communicate the state-based nature of its policies and it could have done more to emphasise the conditionality of its statements about the future path of the cash rate.” In short, it will reserve the right not to give such specifics in the future. Forward guidance on interest rates will not always be provided, although the Board will continue to outline how monetary policy settings are adjusted in response to evolving economic conditions,” it said. The review of the RBA will go to the government next March. Expect that report to have a few more things to say about the bank’s communications. Five and a half million Australians haven’t had a third Covid vaccine dose In his press conference Mark Butler said: I‘ve said on a number of occasions in the first half of 2022, that then was the time to put out a very strong information campaign about the importance of booster doses. The evidence from around the world at that time was very clear that two doses, particularly against the Omicron variant of the virus - that has really swept the whole globe - that two doses of the vaccine was not sufficient, and you needed at that stage three doses to be fully vaccinated. And I think we lost very important time over a period of a few months leading into and during the election campaign not having that information out. We moved very quickly to provide that sort of public information, we’re still doing that, states have been doing that as well. But I think we all have to accept that it we’re not really shifting the dial much at all. So I talked about five and a half million Australians being eligible for a third dose last week, only 7000 of that five and a half million got their third dose, so that that number just is not shifting. We are taking advice about how to shift that, during the building wave that we’ve been experiencing over the last couple of weeks, is the obvious opportunity to reiterate the importance of being up to date with vaccinations. And as I said, the fact that vaccine numbers have increased by about 50% over the last fortnight, that’s pleasing, but there’s still much more to do, and we’re considering what we can do to improve that. Grok mystery solved One of our readers has answered a question which appeared a little earlier in the blog – so thank you! There was a question earlier on the blog “what’s a Grok”. It comes from the sci-fi novel by Robert Heinlein, Stranger in a Strange Land. It is a word Heinlein invented for his Martian language that means “to know everything” or “to empathise” or “to understand someone else so thoroughly you become part of them” In other words it is super-nerdy and perhaps also MCB making a statement about ethical investing. Thank you to all our readers for the lovely community you have built. We truly appreciate it, and you. Aged care minister says facilities preparing for Covid outbreak Further to health minister Mark Butler’s press conference on Covid wave preparations, aged care minister Anika Wells says the government is also working to shore up the the nation’s nursing home settings with more personal protective gear. By Friday we will have contacted every aged care facility to check on their PPE and antiviral treatment supply,” she tweeted on Tuesday afternoon. Wells said the health department was “pre-deploying summer packs of PPE” to all residential aged care facilities, making booster shots and anti-viral drugs more available, and readying a surge workforce if needed. The government will also continue funding for the Covid-19 support grant to support providers with outbreak costs, and maintain support for the High-Risk Settings Pandemic Payment for casual workers to not attend work if they contract Covid. The government says it is trying to be “on the front foot” in aged care as the Covid wave continues. Chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, said Australia was likely nearing the middle of this wave, which he expected to be “short and sharp”. Covid infections in Australia spiked 47% last week and government officials are urging people to get booster shots if they are eligible. New Covid vaccines approved to boost supply Melissa Davey has looked at Mark Butler’s announcement a little earlier this afternoon. Covid hospitalisations have increased by 11% in the past week, the federal health minister Mark Butler said, as he announced new vaccines have been approved to boost supply. A fifth vaccine dose has not been recommended by the Australian Technical Advisory Group of Immunisation (Atagi) for the general population at this time, Butler said. But he said this may change next year ahead of winter, particularly if other variants emerge. Butler said the Omicron subvariant XBB, now present in Australia, led to a “short and small” wave of infections in Singapore, with severe disease and death very rare for people who had at least two vaccine doses. Government moves to protect ABC funding Amanda Meade reports the Albanese government is looking at ways to protect the ABC’s funding no matter who is in power. The Albanese government is reviewing ways to protect the financial stability of the ABC after the public broadcaster lost $526m in funding under the Coalition. The communications minister, Michelle Rowland, told Guardian Australia that on top of a new five-year funding cycle work was under way on a review of funding certainty. A public consultation in the new year will examine how more stability can be given to the national broadcasters to “safeguard against funding cuts and political interference”. You can read the rest of that report, here: Second Victorian independent candidate to challenge VEC on how-to-vote cards Victorian independent candidate for Hawthorn, Melissa Lowe, is also challenging the Victorian Electoral Commission’s (VEC) decision to reject her how-to-vote card: At 10.30am yesterday, I submitted my how-to-vote card to the Victorian Electoral Commission for registration. At 11.22am today, the VEC advised that they would be rejecting my HTV [card], stating: ‘The VEC is satisfied that the how-to-vote card is likely to mislead or deceive an elector in the casting of their vote because the how-to-vote instruction contained on the how-to-vote card does not contain a preference or sequence of preferences that would result in a formal vote, or is likely to result in the elector voting in a way that is inconsistent with their intent.’ This is despite my how-to-vote card prominently displaying instructions in four places to number every box according to the elector’s preferences. I have since taken legal advice and will be seeking an urgent hearing at VCAT to appeal this decision. The VEC has cited no evidentiary basis for its decision, which appears to have been made on subjective (rather than objective) grounds. Mark McGowan will not hold inquiry into youth prisons The Western Australia premier, Mark McGowan, has declines to hold an inquiry into the state’s youth prison, AAP reports. WA’s troubled youth prison system is “working incredibly well”, the premier said, but the use of dangerous restraint techniques will be reviewed. Disturbing footage has been shown on the ABC’s Four Corners program of a teenager being “folded up” at Perth’s Banksia Hill juvenile detention centre. The technique, which involves officers using their body weight to force a person’s arms and legs against their head, is considered to pose a risk of suffocation. McGowan said WA may follow Queensland in outlawing the practice but any ban would not come into effect immediately. “We’re going to go to the department and say … that other techniques need to be investigated to deal with these sorts of situations,” he told ABC radio on Tuesday. But they’re not easy situations for the staff. Our youth custodial officers have to deal with some very difficult situations. Prison officers were only authorised to use the folding-up restraint as a last resort when there was a safety risk to staff or other detainees, WA’s Department of Justice said. Aboriginal leaders have led calls for an independent inquiry into Banksia Hill, the state’s only dedicated juvenile prison. Detainees have been subjected to repeated lockdowns which were ruled unlawful earlier this year by the supreme court. A group of boys accused of destructive behaviour has since been moved to Unit 18, a separate wing at the maximum-security Casuarina adult prison. Children’s Court president Hylton Quail last month warned the government was at risk of being found in contempt over its continued use of lockdowns at the facilities.

Lawyers claim Catholic church is pressuring survivors into smaller payouts The Catholic church has been accused of using recent rulings to pressure child abuse survivors to accept “paltry” amounts in cases where alleged perpetrators have died. We reported this morning that the Catholic church had taken an increasingly aggressive approach in civil cases where alleged paedophile priests had died. That followed rulings in the New South Wales courts that permanently stayed cases where clergy had died. In those cases, the courts found that the church could not have a fair trial. The child abuse royal commission found that, on average, survivors took more than 20 years to come forward, meaning that many cases involve alleged perpetrators who have since died. But multiple law firms told the Guardian that the church was using the recent rulings to try to pressure survivors in such cases. The head of Arnold Thomas &amp; Becker’s abuse case team, Kim Price, said: We have absolutely seen a change in the behaviour of defendants since these rulings were delivered, in particular the Catholic church. Defendants now frequently threaten to stay a claim on the basis that they cannot have a ‘fair trial’ because of the delay taken by a survivor to come forward. Including, astoundingly, cases where the alleged paedophile has multiple victims. The threat usually relates to the perpetrator being deceased and unable to assist the defendant with their investigations or defence. Rightside Legal, based in Victoria, said it expects the church to use the tactic as its latest strategy to discourage survivors from pursuing civil action. Partner Grace Wilson said the NSW cases had not yet been mirrored in Victoria, but said: It’s pretty galling to survivors that a religious order can say, ‘Our paedophile priest, whom we did nothing to deter, is dead and we can’t properly defend the claim because of that.’ Mike Cannon-Brookes congratulates new AGL board members As noted in earlier posts, Mike Cannon-Brookes – the billionaire climate activist – has had some more success in shaping AGL’s future. Against the wishes of the board, all four of his picks for directors got the nod from shareholders at today’s annual general meeting for AGL. A spokesperson for Cannon-Brookes’ Grok Ventures (his slightly discordantly named family company – one shareholder asked, “what’s a Grok?”) – said they congratulated Kerry Schott, Christine Holman, Mark Twidell, and Prof John Pollaers. Plus added a bouquet to Miles George who was also re-elected to the AGL board. AGL shareholders clearly believe that these five directors bring essential experience and credentials to the board. This represents another majority vote by AGL shareholders pointing to their desire for change, fresh thinking and more execution capacity to realise the potential of this great company. The AGL board has Grok Ventures’ full support to deliver on the monumental task ahead, of rebuilding the company to lead Australia’s green energy transition, for the benefit of all stakeholders. That sounds like a “get on with it” message, rather than “let’s shake things up more”. Let’s see if that’s the way it pans out. Here’s our article on the gathering: Victorian independent candidate to appeal against how-to-vote card rejection As Benita reported a little while ago, Sophie Torney, an independent candidate for Kew, has decided to appeal against the Victorian Electoral Commission’s rejection of her how-to-vote cards: Today the Victorian Electoral Commission (VEC) rejected our how-to-vote cards on the basis that the VEC believes they will mislead voters. This decision ignores significant evidence from the federal election where blank boxes on how-to-vote cards were used by several independent candidates. In the 2022 federal election, Kooyong independent candidate, Dr Monique Ryan, had blank boxes on her how-to-vote card with instructions to number every box. At that election, the informal vote in Kooyong was 2.89% – lower than the national average of 3.4%, lower than Victoria’s average of 3.5%, and lower than Kooyong in the 2019 federal election at 2.97%. The VEC’s position is that in order for us to display a replica of the ballot on our HTV card we must direct preferences, as the political parties do. That is undemocratic, party-centric and not supported by legislation. Due to the VEC’s decision today, we will not have any how-to-vote cards at mobile polling booths. The VEC’s decision unfairly discriminates against our campaign, prevents us from sharing information with Victoria’s most vulnerable voters, and will cost us votes. Victoria’s Electoral Commissioner, Warwick Gately, has failed to respond to our urgent letter of inquiry of Thursday 10 November. The VEC has failed to provide a rationale and evidence for their claim that our how-to-vote card could mislead voters. The VEC has offered only a subjective view on the matter. Our campaign has engaged legal representation and will challenge the decision in VCAT. Medical experts concerned ‘hospitals have relaxed or removed mask requirements’ On some of the confusion around mask use in hospitals, Mel Davey has this story: Chief health officer says to consider wearing masks The chief health officer asks people who are at risk of Covid complications to consider wearing masks. That is good advice for anyone. Kelly also says he thinks Australia is in the middle of this latest wave. Two shipments of the new Pfizer vaccine are due in Australia in the next two weeks. Chief health officer says antivirals important to prevent severe illness Prof Paul Kelly expands on the need to have an anti-viral plan if you are 50 and over with two risk factors or over 70: For example, a person over 70 who, even those that have three or four dose of vaccine, can halve the rate of death by taking the tablets. Halve the rate of death. It is incredibly important to get those treatments as quick as possible within a day of being diagnosed as best but up to five days, it would also make a difference in both your chance of severe illness lengthy hospitalisation or indeed of dying from Covid. Vulnerable people should speak to GP about antivirals – Butler People over the age of 50 with two risk factors are being encouraged to have a plan with their doctor to be able to access antivirals in the case they test positive with Covid. Mark Butler: We know even from recent evidence from Victoria, just again, how important antivirals can be in protecting vulnerable Australians from severe disease, hospitalisation or even worse. The health minister Mark Butler says Atagi has not recommended a fifth dose: Atagi has considered international evidence as well as the local data around the vaccination numbers as well as case numbers in the pandemic. And decided not to recommend a fifth dose or a third booster, if you like. At this point in time. They have said they anticipate new booster recommendations being made in early 2023 in preparation for the southern hemisphere winter. Liberal MP says report of bullying and harassment in NSW parliament was ‘not surprising’ The leader of the New South Wales parliamentary advisory group of MPs, and current and former staff, Leslie Williams, has followed up O’Dea’s statement with one on behalf of the group. She acknowledged the harms that had occurred including abuses of leadership positions, the progress that had been made and what was still to be done following the Broderick report. The Liberal MP said while the extent of bullying and harassment claims captured in the report was “both disturbing and confronting” it was also “not surprising” for many. She told the parliament: We as an advisory group want to convey to all survivors, we stand with you, and we look forward to working collaboratively to address the recommendations to ensure that the NSW parliament and elected offices are safe and respectful places to work. We make a strong and unequivocal commitment to work towards change that will ensure a positive professional supportive culture for all. She explained the plans of the advisory group moving forward: We will recognise the unique and escalated risks of misconduct experienced by people of diverse gender, race and sexuality, Aboriginal people and people with disability. We will value and respect the role of survivors and their representatives in designing and monitoring responses to the risks of misconduct and we will ensure that the contributions of underrepresented voices are actively sought out and taken into account. Here is the media release for those who can’t read the tweet: Atagi has found this next generation vaccine triggers a modest improvement in the immune response against both strains. This vaccine and the original vaccines still provide significant protection from severe disease against Omicron subvariant infections. The first doses of the bivalent vaccine have arrived in the country and are undergoing batch testing by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA). Rollout of this vaccine will commence from 12 December 2022. This is the second bivalent vaccine approved for use in Australia. The Moderna Spikevax Bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 vaccine has been available for people aged 18 years or older since 14 October 2022. A separate recommendation from ATAGI to make the paediatric Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine available for certain at-risk children aged 6 months to under 5 years has also been accepted. This vaccine will become available for eligible children from mid-January 2023. The Pfizer vaccine is being restricted to children who are severely immunocompromised or who have other specific conditions that put them at increased risk of severe illness from Covid-19. Government has also approved Pfizer’s Omicron-specific booster vaccine. Covid vaccination update Mark Butler is holding a press conference with the chief health officer, Dr Paul Kelly. That is after Atagi gave this advice on immunisation: “Atagi recommends the Pfizer 6 month to 4 years Covid-19 vaccine as a primary course of vaccination against Sars-CoV-2 for children aged 6 months to 4 years with severe immunocompromise, complex or multiple health conditions, or disability with significant or complex health needs. “This includes children with the following or similar conditions: Severe primary or secondary immunodeficiency, including those undergoing treatment for cancer, or on immunosuppressive treatments as listed in the Atagi advice on 3rd primary doses of Covid-19 vaccine in individuals who are severely immunocompromised. Bone marrow or stem cell transplant, or chimeric antigen T-cell (CAR-T) therapy recipients. Complex congenital cardiac disease. Structural airway anomalies or chronic lung disease. Type 1 diabetes mellitus. Chronic neurological or neuromuscular conditions. A disability with significant or complex health needs, such as severe cerebral palsy or Down Syndrome (Trisomy 21). “The Pfizer 6 months to 4 years vaccine requires 3 primary doses, each containing 3mcg of mRNA. Atagi recommends an interval of 8 weeks between each dose. Children with severe immunocompromise are also recommended to receive three primary doses. Atagi will update this recommendation if future evidence demonstrates a need for additional doses. “Atagi currently recommends the administration of Covid-19 vaccines be deferred for 3 months after a confirmed Sars-CoV-2 infection. Vaccination after this interval is likely to provide a better immunological response and optimise the duration of protection.” Queensland police commissioner’s future under scrutiny – reports The Queensland police commissioner, Katarina Carroll, says she is “hoping” to keep her job after the release of an inquiry report that is understood to be critical of her leadership. Carroll and the police minister, Mark Ryan, held an hour-long press conference on Tuesday morning. Most questions were about Guardian Australia’s reporting on the Brisbane city watch house tapes, which recorded officers using racist and violent language. Carroll said: The stuff that we heard in the watch house is truly abhorrent. It’s tough to stand here and listen to that being said and I know that I have apologised and I apologise again. A report in the Australian on Tuesday said the final report of the inquiry into QPS responses to domestic violence was critical of Carroll. Guardian Australia understands the report includes an entire section on leadership and that Carroll’s future is being discussed by the state government, ahead of the release of the report next week. Ryan said Carroll had his confidence. She would need the confidence of the cabinet to continue. Asked if she thought she would survive, Carroll said: I am hoping to survive. I actually believe that I am the person to take this organisation forward. AGL shareholders unimpressed with remuneration plan for executives AGL Energy’s AGM continues with the chair, Patricia McKenzie, retaining support from shareholders for now. Shareholders, were less enamoured with the company’s remuneration plan (which also includes four more directors after today) – delivering what looks to be the first “strike” about executive pay. Reaction to the new directors – a win for Mike Cannon-Brookes – was initially positive on the stock market itself. Shares were up about 1% on the news, but have given up their gains to be roughly unchanged by midday. Among the reactions, director of independent thinktank Climate Energy Finance and energy finance analyst, Tim Buckley, who says today was a “turning point for the company”. AGL has been by far the biggest carbon emitter in Australia, and a global laggard in accepting and acting on the climate science. This board renewal is critical for AGL investors given the opportunity to start to reverse the $10bn of shareholder wealth destruction in the last six years, but also for the wider context given AGL is a key Australian energy sector incumbent, with financial resources and staffing that can be leveraged constructively, with the right leadership. NSW parliament acknowledges bullying and harassment Harms caused by poor behaviour in the New South Wales parliament have been acknowledged in a statement delivered by the house speaker, Jonathan O’Dea. The statement comes following the Broderick review that found systemic bullying and widespread sexual harassment in parliament. O’Dea said: Today, as we near the end of the parliamentary term, we deliver this statement of acknowledgment on behalf of the NSW parliament. We sincerely apologise to all those who have experienced bullying, sexual harassment or sexual misconduct in any of the parliament’s workplaces. We acknowledge the harms caused and deeply regret the trauma experienced by some here in this parliament and in our offices that serve the communities of NSW. We acknowledge your pain and the mental stress and anguish caused by such behaviour. We understand the lasting impact of your experiences. We thank those who came forward to share their lived experiences and observations as part of the review. We acknowledge how hard it is to speak up about these issues. Your courage will help to create the safe, inclusive and respectful workplaces we all deserve. He said the implementation plan to deal with the recommendations made by Broderick would be released shortly. Five years since Australia’s marriage equality vote For many people, today is not a commemoration, but a reminder of just how much people had to go through: Science minister thanks outgoing CSIRO chief for ‘dedicated service’ The federal science minister, Ed Husic, has responded to the news the CSIRO chief executive, Dr Larry Marshall, is finishing up in June 2023: Dr Marshall has steered CSIRO through a rapidly changing scientific environment. A period of much scientific promise amid global turbulence, particularly through the Covid pandemic. When he completes his term in June next year, Dr Marshall will have been the national science agency’s longest serving chief executive in the past 50 years. Undoubtedly he will leave the organisation with a lasting legacy and I thank him for his dedicated service. Husic paid tribute to achievements the body made under Marshall’s tenure, including the launch of the CSIRO missions program, which brought together Australia’s top researchers and research bodies, with government, industry and community to try to address some of the nation’s most pressing issues. Husic finished with: I particularly welcomed the opportunity in August to launch CSIRO National Vaccine and Therapeutics Lab alongside Dr Marshall. CSIRO’s contribution to Australia’s resilience during the pandemic cannot be overstated. And it will play a vital role in developing sovereign capability in the years to come. The Commonwealth Bank has reported a $2.5bn profit in the September quarter – 13% more than it made in the same period last year. AAP reports the unaudited figures show the bank’s operating performance was also up 12% from the last two quarters. The CBA chief executive, Matt Comyn, said: In a competitive environment we remained disciplined and achieved good volume growth in our core markets. The economy has shown resilience in the face of growing cost of living and interest rate pressures and despite these near-term challenges we remain optimistic on the medium to long term outlook. Also reported – household deposits have grown by 8.6% year on year, home lending increased by 6.3% and business lending rose by 12.6%. The number of loans and assets the bank considered to be “troublesome and impaired” fell slightly from 0.48% to 0.45% since the last quarterly report. All in all, that saw share prices increase 1.4% to $106.53. The Victorian electoral commission has rejected the how-to-vote cards of at least four independent candidates who placed a “1” beside their names only. Nomi Kaltmann in Caulfield, Kate Lardner in Mornington, Melissa Lowe in Hawthorn and Sophie Torney in Kew have all told Guardian Australia the VEC rejected their how-to vote cards, which had the number one beside their names and blank preference boxes next to other candidates. The same type of cards were distributed at the federal election in May by independents Monique Ryan and Zoe Daniel. Under Victoria’s Electoral Act, how-to-vote cards for election day must be registered with the commission and indicate the voting preference for all candidates listed on the card, or contain a statement that a number must be placed against the name of each candidate. In 2018, the independent MP for Shepparton, Suzanna Sheed, unsuccessfully attempted to overturn the rejection of her how-to-vote card due to blank boxes at the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal. Kaltmann, Larder, Lowe and Torney, who are all being backed by Simon Holmes à Court’s Climate 200 outfit, are considering taking legal action. The ACT chief coroner, Lorraine Walker, has tested positive for Covid, resulting in the hearings for the inquest into Canberra’s 2020 summer bushfires being postponed until 2023, AAP reports. The inquest was announced in July 2021, but the wait for information on how it took 45 minutes for an army helicopter’s crew to alert the ACT Emergency Service Agency they had started a fire will continue. On Monday, the court heard the crew on board the MRH-90 Taipan helicopter were landing for a toilet break when they inadvertently ignited the monster blaze. They were scouting remote helipads in preparation for bushfire season, when they landed with their searchlight still on and started the fire in the Orroral Valley. An onboard recording heard one of the helicopter’s passengers yell “Come up, come up, we’ve started a fire, turn the searchlight off”. The helicopter only stopped for about one minute before returning to Canberra airport, but neither the pilots nor their passengers contacted emergency services to let them know they had started a fire, which one pilot estimated was already “200m by 200m” when they evacuated. The pilot said he was “concerned we were going to fall out of the sky” because of aircraft damage. The fire, which burned for five weeks, was declared out of control after 6pm when more than 1000ha were alight and would eventually grow to burn 87,923ha throughout the ACT. Walker opened proceedings by saying the inquest wasn’t about “crucifying any individual or decision made in the heat of the moment”. “We’re here to explore how we can learn from it with a view to enhancing everyone’s safety in the future,” she said. Acting eSafety commissioner in contact with local Twitter representatives Australia’s eSafety commissioner, Julie Inman Grant wrote to Twitter’s new boss Elon Musk earlier this month expressing concern about the mass sackings at the company and what it might mean for the company’s ability to comply with Australian law when it comes to child protection and dealing with online harassment and abuse. The acting commissioner Toby Dagg told a parliamentary committee on Tuesday that Twitter had since been in contact with the commissioner’s office since the letter to confirm that people in the company are still contactable: I’m pleased to say we’ve re-established those connections. Dagg did not say who he was in contact with, but said it was local and regional representatives for Twitter. Dagg said there had not been a marked increase in the number of reports made about Twitter since the takeover. In response to questions from Greens senator David Shoebridge about why eSafety had not taken a proactive approach in investigating problems on the service, Dagg said eSafety could not “police the internet” and Twitter was a huge website, so the organisation is reliant on complaints being made. If you haven’t read it as yet, this from Peter Lewis raises some interesting questions: For cricket followers, Pat Cummins has some news, as AAP reports: Cummins’ decision to forego a $1.3m Indian Premier League (IPL) pay cheque has exposed cricket’s overloaded calendar, with Australia’s best players set for more than 100 days of international games in the next 12 months. Cummins made the call on Tuesday morning to skip next year’s IPL tournament for the Kolkata Knight Riders, pointing to a heavy international workload. Australia have a four-Test tour of India next February and March before the tournament, followed by an Ashes series in England and one-day World Cup in India. Cummins’ decision comes just weeks after he was elevated to the captaincy of Australia’s one-day team, meaning he will probably feature in more white-ball series before next year’s global event. He tweeted: I’ve made the difficult decision to miss next years IPL. The international schedule is packed with Tests and ODI’s for the next 12 months, so will take some rest ahead of an Ashes series and World Cup.” When factoring in all Tests this summer as well as one-day and T20 series on the road in 2023, Australia’s players have up to 106 days of international cricket in the next 12 months. That figure includes a possible World Test Championship final in London with Australia currently top of the table, as well as the semi-finals and final of next year’s ODI World Cup. The problem is most significant for fast bowlers Cummins, Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood, and allrounder Cameron Green who will each play against England in ODIs this week. David Warner, Alex Carey, Steve Smith, Travis Head and Marnus Labuschagne also play across both red and white-ball formats, meaning nine of Australia’s top XI are now regulars in the Test and one-day teams. ABC reports Australian navy was tracked by Chinese military last month The ABC’s defence correspondent, Andrew Greene, has reported two Australian warships were “closely tracked” by the Chinese military last month, as they travelled in the South China Sea. That was part of naval exercises with the US and Japan. Greene reports: Officials with knowledge of the operation say destroyer HMAS Hobart and auxiliary tanker HMAS Stalwart sailed close to the Spratly Islands and were challenged by the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in international waters claimed by China. The interaction with the PLA occurred during a ‘regional presence deployment’, where the Australian navy was accompanied by the Japanese destroyer JS Kirisame and US navy destroyer USS Milius for a trilateral transit of the South China Sea. One defence figure, speaking to the ABC on the condition of anonymity, said the Chinese military closely tracked the vessels and showed a ‘significant increase in tactical acumen and use of EM (electronic warfare) capabilities’. Guardian Australia understands that AGL energy’s climate plan has been approved by shareholders. The number voting in favour isn’t yet known, but the proposal has the numbers. Mike Cannon-Brookes, via his Grok Ventures family company, had been pressing AGL to do more than was proposed. In short, he argued the decarbonisation approach taken by the company implied a path consistent with a world heating 1.8C v pre-industrial era levels He wanted a plan consistent with a 1.5C path, but that meant exiting coal faster than AGL wanted. In September, AGL announced it would bring forward the closure date of its Loy Yang A brown coal-fired power station in Victoria by a decade to 2035 while leaving its black-coal burning Bayswater power station in NSW running until between 2030 and 2033. AGL’s Liddell plant, also in NSW, shuts next April. So, AGL thinks shareholders are satisfied with this plan. One question is whether Cannon-Brookes, with his 11.3% or so holding in AGL, will stay put – especially if he thinks he has a more supportive board. Victorian Labor pledges $71m for women’s health The Andrews government has vowed to deliver a $71m women’s health funding package if it wins this months’ state election. Healthcare is a key battleground in the state election. Under the funding, $58m would be delivered for 20 new women’s health clinics across the state. The state government has also pledged to almost double sexual and reproductive hubs across the state as part of a $6.4m package. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, said the funding was about “equity” and “funding.” Victoria’s health minister, Mary-Anne Thomas, said women’s health issues had been routinely ignored by the sector. Thomas said the sexual health hubs would be a “one-stop shop” for women in metropolitan Melbourne and regional Victoria. An update from Katharine Murphy at G20 Good morning from the G20 meeting in Bali. Events yesterday moved at a clip so readers might appreciate a short stock take of where things are up to. After days of speculation about whether or not Australia’s prime minister would meet the Chinese president when both delegates arrived in Bali, Anthony Albanese confirmed the meeting was on minutes after disembarking his aircraft on Monday. If you’ve been hanging on the daily news of the summit season, you’ll know Joe Biden met Xi Jinping face-to-face for the first time in the Biden presidency last night on the sidelines of the G20 in an effort to reset great power relations. So Albanese’s meeting with the president will be the focal point of the day but it will be this evening Australia time (around 7pm). Meanwhile, the G20 has opened in Bali. I’m watching arrivals now. Australia’s former finance minister Mathias Cormann, now head of the OECD, has just made a jaunty entrance along the red carpet. Apart from tonight’s meeting, Albanese will participate in today’s summit events considering energy, food security and global health. AGL Energy’s board will expand with all four of the candidates put up by tech billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes winning support from shareholders ahead of today’s annual general meeting in Melbourne this morning. AGL’s chair, Paticia McKenzie, has opening the meeting by stating: Based on the proxies lodged ahead of the meeting, the election of Mark Twidell, Dr Kerry Schott, Christine Holman and John Pollaers as directors has been supported by our shareholders. The board welcomes these new directors to the board and will work constructively with them in the best of interests of shareholders. MCB, as the Atlassian founder and climate activist is known, backed these four in September, claiming they would be independent. (Schott, a former head of the Energy Security Board, was reported in the AFR as saying she had never spoken to Cannon-Brookes.) AGL’s board had only supported Twidell, a solar energy veteran, ahead of the vote. Anyway, assuming Miles George, a wind energy specialist, is also of a like mind to MCB, it’s possible to count five of the nine board members as being particularly pro-renewables. More to come, as the AGM rolls on. Small businesses in Forbes are preparing for their second major flood in two weeks, with many having to once again lift or remove their stock and close up, hoping the damage is minimal. The Forbes CBD has completely shut down as flood waters rise, with many small business owners lamenting the lost business during what should be a busy period. Business owner and head of the Forbes Business Chamber, Margaret Duggan, said some businesses could lose up to 50% of stock and trade. This should be a positive and happy time, its a time of harvest, and its close to Christmas, but its deja-vu once again after the floods last week. People are very anxious about what’s going to happen, we’re planning for the worst and hoping it doesn’t happen. Duggan said that while residents had been keeping a positive mindset, and were resilient, there are concerns for the mental health of business owners in the town. We had businesses lose 25% to 30% of turnover when the main highway into the town was closed due to flood waters. We’re mentally trying to prepare, but the repeat floods take their toll. Lots of places are damaged already, water has gotten into places its never been before. We’ve never had this kind of ran before, and we’re on flat ground so its all water logged. It’s just a waiting game now. The head of CSIRO for the past eight years, Larry Marshall, will exit the post when his third term ends in June 2023, Australia’s national science agency said this morning. The chair of the CSIRO board, Kathryn Fagg, said: Dr Marshall has led CSIRO to deliver significant scientific breakthroughs, translate its research into real world solutions and deliver a staggering benefit for our nation – eight times the investment. Marshall thanked the 5,672 people from CSIRO “who bring their best every day for the nation”: It is a rare privilege to work with people so driven to achieve for the benefit of a nation and its people. Over the past eight years, together we have reignited Australia’s ambition to solve our greatest challenges with science. Marshall’s term, the longest in half a century, was not without its controversies, none bigger perhaps than his aborted effort to cull most of climate science at the agency. (As was reported here at the time.) Lately, some of the wariness about CSIRO’s commitment to climate science surfaced when the agency scrapped its fully funded decadal climate research (and forgot to tell the World Meteorological Organization about it). Hints that the Albanese government wasn’t entirely happy with CSIRO showed up with the science minister, Ed Husic, warning the agency about “renting out its brand”. Similarly, the agency’s plan to accelerate the commercialisation of science at CSIRO – potentially at the expense of science that might have broader public benefit – raised fresh questions about the direction of the agency. Something for Marshall’s successor to consider. Liberal senator Andrew Bragg is still hopeful he will get his crypto bill up. Queensland youth prison expansion does not address drivers of offending, expert says Queensland has more children in detention than any other jurisdiction in the country, AAP reports. The state’s adult prison population also surged 68% over the past decade – the fastest pace of growth in the country, according to a Justice Reform Initiative report released on Tuesday. Almost nine in 10 of all children in detention in the state are yet to be sentenced, while the number of youths in detention under the age of 17 has risen from 172 to 219 since 2014-15. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are also significantly over-represented in the figures, making up 35% of the adult prison population and nearly 63% of young people. The rate of incarceration for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children is 33 times the rate for non-Indigenous children. According to the report, the “revolving door” model costs Queensland taxpayers $716.9m a year in prison operating costs and this is set to grow further as the incarceration rate continues to climb. The growth in incarceration has been driven “by political, policy and legislative choices”, it said. The Justice Reform Initiative executive director, Dr Mindy Sotiri, said building more prisons, as the Queensland government was planning to do with its proposed $500m youth prison expansion, did not work to deter crime or rehabilitate offenders. “This is a shortsighted and counterproductive policy that will make it more likely that vulnerable children will commit further offences and become trapped in the revolving prison door that has become a devastating feature of Queensland’s justice system,” she said. Holding children in detention fails to address the underlying drivers of incarceration, she added. Sotiri said taxpayers would be far better served by investment in early intervention, diversion and evidence-based alternatives outside the youth justice system. In New South Wales, Forbes is preparing for what could be the worst flooding its ever seen, with the Lachlan River already rising higher than expected. The town’s deputy mayor, Chris Roylance, said Forbes had been “cut in half” by the rising flood waters, and that the CBD had been emptied by evacuation orders. My wife was one of the last cars through now, the town is about to be cut in half. The river was expected to get to 10.55 metres, and its already at 10.62. I’ve lived through many floods in my time here, but this will be the biggest we’ve ever seen. The town has been cut off by the rising flood waters, with roads in and out currently blocked. Roylance said the CBD looked like a “war zone”, but added that the community sentiment was still positive. Everyone is prepared, we’re all sandbagged and set, we’re just sitting around waiting. We told people to get out and make sure they didn’t wait around, so the CBD has been emptied out. It looks like a war zone down there, with plastic covers all over and sandbags everywhere. We’re worried, but prepared. CSIRO chief to leave science organisation after term ends The CSIRO is about to receive (another) shake up. The science agency’s chief executive, Larry Marshall, will leave in June. (As an aside, the CSIRO is an excellent Instagram follow, if you aren’t following already.) Australian physicians back Raise the Age campaign The Royal Australasian College of Physicians (RACP) is part of the Raise the Age campaign, calling on governments to raise the age of criminal responsibility to 14, which is in line with medical evidence and advice. Children as young as 10 years old are being locked up in Australian detention centres, despite medical evidence showing they are too young to take responsibility for what they have done. The RACP president and paediatrician, Dr Jacqueline Small, said children need help, not prisons. The college has been campaigning for years for state and territories to raise the age of criminal responsibility. Incarcerating children this young causes serious harms for them and their communities. 14 years old is the absolute youngest age a child should be held criminally responsible, and we’ve been very disappointed to see the NT government attempt this reform, only to miss the mark with an age of 12. More must be done to ensure children are not incarcerated for behaviours that are a direct consequence of their young age, their disability or their earlier trauma and provide these children with the care, support and treatment that they need and that preserves their dignity and human rights. Exposure to the criminal legal system has direct consequences on the education, development, mental and physical health, and adult incarceration rates, on these children. Tasmania flood advice warning for Tahune Bridge area The Bureau of Meteorology has issued a minor flood warning for the Huon River: A “flood advice – monitor conditions” warning has been issued for Tahune Bridge and surrounds by Tasmania SES. Locations likely to be affected are: Tahune Bridge and surrounds During the next 12 to 24 hours: Flooding in nearby streams and rivers is likely. Some low-lying properties may become isolated by flood waters. Property, livestock, equipment, and crops in low lying areas may be at risk from flood waters. Driving conditions may be dangerous. If you live in or are travelling near the Tahune Bridge and surrounds, SES advises: If you have a flood emergency plan, check it now. Monitor conditions and prepare now to go to a safer place if conditions become more dangerous. For SES Flood Warning updates, visit TasALERT.com or listen to ABC local radio. Have your Medibank records been posted online? You can tell us your story In the past week, we have seen a bit over 1,000 Medibank customer records being posted on the dark web by a Russian hacking group after the Australian health insurer refused to pay a ransom to the company. If you are one of those people who were included in the records posted online, and feel comfortable telling your story to us (your name and details can be anonymised) please get in contact with reporter Josh Taylor by email at josh.taylor@theguardian.com. Just noting that Medibank will have likely contacted you more directly to tell you what ended up online and have assigned you a case manager if that is the case. If you’ve just received an email informing you that your data was taken – it doesn’t yet mean it has been posted online. Later this morning, we’ll get the Reserve Bank of Australia’s minutes from its 1 November meeting when it raised its cash rate for a record seventh time in as many meetings. Ahead of that 11.30am (AEDT) release, it’s worth looking at how consumer sentiment has been holding up. According to the latest weekly survey from ANZ and Roy Morgan, confidence actually perked up a bit, with the 2.7% snapping six weeks of declines that lowered the index more than 10%. We’re still down in the dumps, apparently, although still spending like we’re emerging from lockdowns all cashed-up. While many sub-indices have lately improved, the “good time to buy a major household item” gauge has retreated further – and is the lowest since the April 2020 Covid wave. As the ANZ’s top Australian economist, David Plank, notes there’s a paradox in that “household spending has held up despite the weakness in sentiment”. Whether this disconnect can continue is a central issue for policymakers. (By which he mostly has the RBA in mind.) In fact, inflation expectations have also eased in the past week, and are steady on a rolling four-week average: That’s interesting since fuel prices have continued to nudge towards the $2 a litre mark, according to the Australian Institute of Petroleum. Speaking of energy, more than a few people will be watching AGL Energy‘s annual general meeting that kicks off in Melbourne at 10.30am AEDT. (You can follow it here.) It’s something of a clash of the titans, with Atlassian billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes effectively trying to change the board of AGL and potentially upend the remaining leaders on Australia’s largest electricity generator. We published this primer on Sunday to set the scene at the Melbourne Recital Centre here: As bad as the floods are for New South Wales and Victoria of late, it’s worth keeping in mind that the tropical cyclone season is also under way. Now, it worth noting that in an average year, we should get about 11 tropical cyclones in the Australian region for the November-April period. During La Niña years, odds tend to favour a busier than usual season, and that’s what the Bureau of Meteorology is predicting – that there’s a 75% chance this season will get more than 11. As it happens, the number of tropical cyclones has been of decline in the past couple of decades even as waters have warmed. But a new science paper out recently suggested the decline may be natural variability, and conditions may snap back to longer-run averages. We have written about the paper here today: A couple of key take-aways include that cyclones are likely to get more intense and keep that intensity longer (in large part because of those warming waters). Also of worry is the prospect that these tempests will travel further south (or north, in the northern hemisphere). We got a taste for that last year when tropical cyclone Seroja crossed much further south on the Western Australia coast than is usual for a cyclone (let alone one that was of category three severity): As noted by Andrew Watkins, a senior BoM scientist, we saw a Gold Coast cyclone in the 1950s. But, of course, we have a lot more people in south-east Queensland and northern NSW now than we did seven decades ago (more than 3 million). Australia’s biggest insurer, IAG, supported that cyclone research. They think it’s time to consider strengthening our building codes to limit future damage – and step up retrofitting efforts. Anyway, a reminder that a hotter world, with a more energetic atmosphere, is something we need to both work against (limiting emissions) and prepare for. Good morning everyone and very big thank you to Tash for taking us through a very busy morning. If you are in the New South Wales central-west, we are thinking of you and we will keep you updated with any new information as it comes to hand. I am bidding you farewell for now. It’s a surprise treat as we have Amy Remeikis back on the blog outside parliament sitting! The BoM spokesperson moves on to other river systems beyond the Lachlan: Turning to the Macquarie River and specifically Bathurst, we have major flooding occurring at Bathurst. The river at Bathurst peaked at 6.64 metres around yesterday afternoon. It is currently falling and that level is very similar to the flooding that they had in 1998 at 6.69 metres. It’s currently at four and a bit metres and it’s falling but it’s still in the major flood category for Bathurst. Turning to the Bulubula and Mendageri Creek which feed into the Lachlan we had major flooding at Canowindra and Eugowra, of course. For Canowindra, upstream, that has peaked at 7.79 metres yesterday morning. And that is the highest peak it’s had in 70 years according to hydrologists this morning. So that’s a significant flood for the town of Canowindra. In Eugowra, of course, it’s peaked and it is falling but it’s had significant impacts. The levels are around the 9-metre mark. In Tamworth, moderate flooding is occurring. The Tamworth Road Bridge peaked at 5.35 metres last night. It’s currently falling but it’s in the moderate flood range. For the Tumut and Murrumbidgee Rivers, we have major flooding higher than the September 1974 flood occurring at Hay. I’ll point to Hay specifically as that’s the most significant one in that area. It’s 9m and it’s rising with major flooding. And it may stay that way right through till Wednesday. And just a brief touch on the Murray and the Edwards River. Major flooding higher than the 1975 flooding occurring at Yacool Junction there and possibly at Boundary Bend, Euston, Mildura and Wentworth as flood waters move further south. The Bureau of Meterology spokesperson moves onto floods: For the floods, the focus is on the fact that we still have 17 flood warnings issued for the state. Eight of those are in a major category and they’re the focus of today. They’re affecting about 25 locations. Moving through some of these catchments, probably in order of significance right now, for the Lachlan River and Lachlan catchment, we have major flooding occurring at Forbes and we have a reach mark of 10.8 metres possible this afternoon. That’s similar to the June 1952 flood. We have major flooding at Cowra, Nanami, Cottons Weir and Jemalong Weir. I’ll focus on this particular catchment for some details. For Cowra in particular we have a peak of 14.3 metres. It’s steady at the moment. In November, it peaked at 13.5 metres, so it’s a metre above the early November peak. If you’re wondering how that peak arrived, Cowra from a rainfall event over the weekend had 121mm and according to records this morning, that’s the highest daily rainfall at the Cowra ag station in 118 years. For the Lachlan and the Namoi, the town of Namoi it may reach 13.6 metres this afternoon. Earlier this November, it was 13.4. In Forbes, the Ironbridge may reach 10.8 metres this afternoon – for context, the flood in Forbes in earlier November was 10.67 metres. Further downstream for Cottons Weir, it may reach 7.3 metres today. Potential for further rise is possible as more water is coming down. Downstream of the Lachlan, I want to point to Condoblin. Condoblin Bridge is currently at 7.35 metres and steady. It does have major flooding and it’s likely that it may remain around 7.4 metres through to Thursday. So it’s a significant lag in the way it moves away from the bridge there. In Euabalong, it may reach 7.4 metres around 20 November, as the flood peaks move further south or further along the river. And it’s slightly below the 1952 flood. Significant cooling of conditions in NSW, as more November snow predicted: BoM A representative from the NSW Bureau of Meteorology is up next – they’re providing a general update of weather conditions before giving flood-specific info. The good news is the rain and thunderstorm risk we experienced over the weekend has eased and abated. There is still a slight chance of thunderstorms around the Hunter to the mid north coast today. But largely you’ll see settled conditions across much of the state. Conditions are cooling off today in the southern districts and they’ll be the first to feel a fairly significant cold snap. The rest of the state into tomorrow, Wednesday, will start to see temperatures drop to eight or 10 degrees below average, which is a significant cooling of conditions for this time of year. That is likely to lead to frost for the tablelands, very unseasonable for November, and we will likely see some snow on the Alps this week. That said, it is generally settled. The next front that is lining up in the west of the state or over in the Bight is scheduled around the weekend. Power outages and communication problems due to flooding in Eugowra York goes on to say flooding has also seen power outages which has caused people to become concerned for loved ones they are unable to reach: So there are a number of power outages and communication problems around the Eugowra area and the broader geographical area of Eugowra. A number of people have obviously heeded our warnings and evacuated early, but, because of the communication problems, sometimes you can’t reach your friends and loved ones, and family are concerned. I’d remind you of the benefit of registering at the Red Cross’s Register Find Reunite. It’s important if you have not gone to an evacuation centre but have left your home, that you registered on the site – Register, Find, Reunite – so we aren’t sending out resources to search for you when you are safe and well at other premises. York also reminded farmers to keep their animals dry: There are many rural properties severely affected by these floods and, again, particularly downstream of Forbes we’re asking those farmers to ensure their livestock are put to higher ground so they are safe as well. York has reiterated that “the flood risk remains high for weeks and months to come”. Carlene York, NSW SES commissioner takes the mic saying this flood event has required the biggest operations in the state’s history. The New South Wales SES are leading what would be the biggest operations in relation to flood response across New South Wales in its history. And I thank our emergency services partners to be able to go out and meet the community’s needs and respond to their requests for assistance. Our main area of focus today is Eugowra and as mentioned, at Forbes, so what we’re seeing is a number of creeks and rivers flowing into that Lachlan river area, flowing down into Forbes and then expected to flood further downstream from Forbes. York says rivers are now rising more quickly than expected in the central west: Yesterday, we had an immense amount of requests by communities for our assistance in flood rescues in the Eugowra area and it did rise much quicker than we had expected, as is Forbes today, rising quicker than we had expected. It was incredibly serious and significant. We saw river heights double in size through to 8am on Monday morning, where it peaked at 9.75 metres and the emergency warning was issued at 6.14am. We received 180 requests for assistance and 159 flood rescues, many off roofs of houses and businesses. We’ve been able to preposition resources there but when calls for assistance came, we moved many more resources and helicopters to assist in those flood rescues. We had over 140 emergency service personnel assisting that community. We had 14 helicopters and we have four that are helping us move our resources around that can’t get down the roads because of flooded waters down those roads so today not only are we helping to respond downstream from Forbes but we’re starting rapid damage assessments. We have 100 additional ADF personnel coming in to assist us today and we have 12 personnel from New Zealand fire and emergency services come and help us. Condobolin entirely isolated by flooding, as schools all along Lachlan River closed Cooke: We are also turning our attention to downstream of Forbes. Once the peak passes through Forbes, we know the lower Lachlan area has been in major flood now for 12 months and, again. Our heart goes out to the communities of Condobolin which are entirely isolated at this point. We have schools all along the lower Lachlan who are closed at present. We have children learning from home and assisting their families on properties as required. Cooke: Everyone across New South Wales today is thinking of the communities right across the central west, where we’ve seen inundation in many communities, including Canowindra, Eugowra and Molong. We are deploying as many resources as we possibly can to get into those communities as quickly as that flood water recedes, so that we can do those rapid damage assessments and get people back into their homes. We now have 70 local government areas that are the subject of a natural disaster declaration as a result of this event, which is now in its 63rd day. And so our focus at this time is really two-pronged. We are still in the emergency response in many communities and that includes as the premier has mentioned, Forbes and Eugowra, and we are in the early stages of recovery in places like Molong and Canowindra. Up to 600 homes and businesses to be inundated in Forbes NSW emergency services minister, Steph Cooke, is up next: Overnight we’ve seen the river levels at Forbes increase faster than expected which has led forward to the bring forward of the evacuation order from 9:00am to 7:00am this morning. We’ve got around 1,000 properties covered about by that order, hundreds of people, and we are expecting that 500 to 600 homes and businesses will experience inundation from the flooding that we anticipate to come through Forbes because we’re anticipating similar river levels there, around 10.88m over the days ahead, similar to what that community experienced just two weeks ago. It’s devestating for the Forbes community that they are experiencing this once again and particularly in such a short period of time. Many of those residents have not been able to return to their home from the flooding two weeks ago and are now facing a situation where their home is likely to be inundated again. This is not just people’s houses. This is their homes. It’s their belongings, their memories, their livelihoods and futures. One hundred ADF personnel to assist NSW flood efforts Perrottet thanks the defence minister, and acting prime minister, Richard Marles, for the support that Australian defence personnel have provided flood affected communities. I want to thank the acting prime minister, Richard Marles. I spoke to him yesterday in relation to getting additional ADF support. We’ll have more boots on the ground today, an additional 100 ADF personnel. The cooperation between the federal government, the state government and local councils in those areas has been incredibly important in making sure that care and support is there. Perrottet said there are also more than 14 aircraft from the SES, ADF, police and Surf Life Saving that have been rescuing many people in the Eugowra area. A press conference is happening at the NSW emergency operations centre. Premier Dominic Perrottet is up first: Over the last 24 hours, we’ve had over 900 requests for assistance. There have been 222 flood rescues. There’s obviously concerns for our communities in Eugowra and Forbes, particularly Forbes this morning, where evacuation orders are in in place. Those evacuation orders affect properties, impacting hundreds of people. I say to the community in Forbes we will be with you every step of the way. We were only there two weeks ago. They have gone through flood event after flood event after flood event. We do expect a difficult period of time over the next couple of days … We know for many communities in the central west, there is a lot of pain and hurt. We’ve got through these challenges in the past and will get through them again. Australia spearheads online safety push Australia’s eSafety Commission will team with online regulators from the UK, Ireland and Fiji to create new laws combating abuse, harmful content and illegal material on social networks. Representatives for the four countries announced their partnership at a conference in Washington DC on Tuesday, revealing the global online safety regulators network would collaborate on an “international approach to online safety regulation”. The news comes after Australia introduced a world-first adult cyber abuse scheme and Online Safety Act in January, and follows major cutbacks to online safety and moderation teams at Twitter and Facebook this month. The collaboration received early praise from social media experts who said the fight against online abuse and trolls needed “all the firepower” it could get. The group will be made of Australia’s eSafety Commission, UK communications regulator Ofcom, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, and Fiji’s Online Safety Commission. eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said teaming up would allow the agencies to share information and develop consistent laws, avoiding a “splinternet” of rules for social networks and their users across different countries. She said: I’ve always believed the future of effective online safety regulation would involve a network of global regulators working together to make the online world a safer place for everyone. Ofcom chief executive Melanie Dawes said sharing experiences and research across countries would help to ensure the safety of “everyone from Melbourne to Manchester”. - from AAP Steggall calls for MPs to speak up on koalas and native forest protection Federal and state politicians as well as advocates have welcomed the news that the NSW government has pulled its contentious forestry bill which would have threatened koala habitat, but say more needs to be done to protect natural resources and species. Independent MP for Warringah, Zali Steggall, has called on more members of parliament to “speak up and cross the floor”. The workplace relations minister, Tony Burke, has said that he’s “devastated” at the way the industrial dispute at Svitzer has unfolded. Danish tug boat company Svitzer has said it will lock out about 590 workers from 17 metropolitan and regional ports from midday on Friday, and will keep them shut out indefinitely. Svitzer and the unions have been working to finalise a new enterprise agreement for workers at the 17 ports for the last three years, however increasing agitation from the union has begun to harm their operations, the company says. Burke told 2GB Radio that it was long-running disputes such as this one that had led Labor to propose giving the Fair Work Commission the power to arbitrate “intractable” disputes. He noted under the current law, the “umpire can only blow the whistle” when both sides agree to arbitration. He said: I want the umpire to be able to make decisions on protracted disputes. This is not the only long running dispute that has been driving people spare, particularly across NSW over the last 12 months or so. You’ll often get in a negotiation brief disputes that go back and forth ... compared to other countries, we don’t have a lot. But these long protracted ones – you need to have a system where the umpire can step in and say ‘OK we’re going to sort this out’. I’m hopeful we’re only two or three weeks away from that being law. I wish the company could just pause and take breath and wait for those laws to be in place. Early voting yesterday opened for the Victorian state election which saw a record 115,065 votes cast. The Victorian Electoral Commission said the figure represented a 52% increase on the figures recorded on the first day of the last state election. The surge might be explained that Victorians don’t have to give a reason for voting early at the state level, unlike the federal election. Nevertheless, the result comes despite the fact printing delays and wet weather did delay 21 centres from opening on time. Of course, votes will not be counted before election day. Australians can help Somalia, World Vision chief urges not to be overwhelmed With famine looming over Somalia, World Vision Australia’s chief says it’s not too late to help those in the “hungriest place on Earth”. Daniel Wordsworth talked to Guardian Australia from a town called Doolow, where a camp for displaced people has been set up. He said people are travelling for weeks to get there, walking at night to avoid the heat, searching for food and clean water. He said: I talked to one grandma who’s in her 90s. She travelled for 20 days. I talked to a young mother, who had five children … they’re all under the age of 10. I talked to another family whose kids are all under 10 and they lost one of their bubbas on the way there. It’s hard to imagine as a parent making that decision [to leave home in search of aid] because you are fully realising that if you stay, it may be too late. We get too weak, we’ve gone without for too long and we can’t make the journey. We go now, when we have some strength, you realise you may lose someone on the way. That’s a dreadful decision. Wordsworth said once they get to the camp, people are triaged, with medical help for the most urgent cases, while the others set up basic camps. He said he worries that Australians might feel overwhelmed by the scale of the catastrophe unfolding, but that they should be reassured they can help. He said: There’s always a danger that you can feel like there’s nothing you can do. You feel like you’re just one small thing, how, in the face of something like global famine, can you actually do anything? But you can … we are here on the ground, we can translate within days, donations into life-saving assistance. It’s real. It actually happens. So you don’t have to worry that alone you can do nothing. Because you’re not alone. Read more about the crisis in Somalia here: Break in rain coming Our resident weather connoisseur Peter Hannam has good news for (most of) you. Up to a week to clear derailed rail wagons near Geelong It could take up to a week to reopen the rail corridor between Melbourne and Adelaide as authorities work out how to remove more than a dozen derailed train carriages near Geelong, in Victoria’s west. Shipping containers were sent tumbling when a 1.7 kilometre-long train with 55 carriages derailed near Inverleigh early on Monday. Sixteen of the carriages went off the tracks, blocking the rail corridor between Adelaide and Melbourne. No one was injured and the cause is under investigation. The Victorian State Emergency Service chief officer, Tim Wiebusch, told reporters on Monday: We know there was heavy rainfall and some flash flooding in that area but at this stage it’s too early to know what the cause was of the train derailment. We are lucky we weren’t dealing with a passenger train in this instance and that the crew on board that freight train were also unscathed. Wiebusch said authorities were working out how to get heavy machinery to the rural area and it could take more than a week for the debris to be cleared. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau has taken control of the site. Bureau chief commissioner Angus Mitchell said: Investigators will survey the site and collect any relevant components for further examination and analysis. They will also obtain and review any recorded data, weather information, witness reports, and relevant train and track operator records. – From AAP Torrents of water spill from Wyangala Dam We mentioned on the blog earlier that Wyangala Dam across the Lachlan River is spilling over record megalitres of water and increasing the risk of flooding for those surrounding central west communities, including Forbes. The Wyangala Dam ais at at 104.1% capacity, with WaterNSW saying the 230,000 megalitre outflow from the dam was a record surpassing the 205,000 megalitres during flooding in 1990. To understand how big those numbers are, just take a look for yourself. Chalmers says the war in Ukraine hangs over the G20 meeting, with Russia’s invasion making it “difficult to get outcomes”. Chalmers says: The chaos in energy markets, brought about by Russia’s war in Ukraine is the defining challenge in the global economy. On domestic gas prices, the treasurer says when it comes to mechanisms: Our first preference is to find a regulatory solution here, rather than a tax solution here, I think we’ve said that in different days over the course of the last couple of weeks and see if we can find a temporary, meaningful, sensible and responsible intervention in this market. Karvelas asks Chalmers, once a decision on the intervention is made, how long until it starts to lower prices? We’ll do it in a calm and considered way, but we’ll do it as urgently as we can. There’s a lot of complexity in these policy areas and I don’t want to pretend to your listeners there’s an easy lever to pull. You can’t click your fingers and make a war in Ukraine go away. Karvelas challenges Chalmers that you can make the “glut of greed” of gas producers go away, as the industry minister Ed Husic has pointed out. Nobody pretending issues raised ‘will be solved overnight’: Chalmers Albanese has said there are no preconditions ahead of the meeting with Xi but Karvelas is pressing Chalmers on what could be on the table. He’s staying pretty tight-lipped but here are some of his answers. On whether the meeting between Xi and Albanese will see trade sanctions wound back, Chalmers says: We’ve made it really clear for some time … that these trade sanctions are not in Australia’s interests, and we want to see them lifted. Beijing has made its own demands of Australia, Chalmers is asked what concessions Australia will be willing to make: I don’t think anybody pretends some of the issues China has raised, certainly some we have raised will be solved overnight, but again we give ourselves a much better chance where there is engagement and dialogue. On whether the prime minister would bring up the treatment of two Australians including journalist Cheng Lei and writer Yang Hengjun, Chalmers says: Australia’s made its views clear over a long period of time when it comes to the detention of these two people. PM’s meeting with President Xi seeking to stabilise relationship with China, treasurer says The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, is speaking with ABC Radio following the big news yesterday that the country’s leader Anthony Albanese had secured a meeting with his Chinese counterpart for the first time since 2016. Chalmers has just gotten back from the G20 meeting in Bali where he was with the prime minister yesterday. RN Breakfast host Patricia Karvelas: What’s Australia’s ambition here? Chalmers: We seek a more stable relationship with China. We will speak up for our national interest where necessary, but we believe engagement is important to give ourselves the chance to work through some of these issues if we’re talking to each other. Lachlan River reaching major flood level at Forbes Shortly after residents of Forbes were told to evacuate or risk being cut off, data from the Bureau of Meteorology shows that the Lachlan River at Forbes is reaching major flood levels. Tasmanians warned of heavy rainfall in south east corner Tasmania’s south east corner is getting drenched. The Bureau of Meteorology has issued a severe weather warning for heavy rainfall. Australia needs more ‘impactful projection’ and lethality: Marles The acting prime minister and defence minister, Richard Marles, last night spoke at the Sydney Institute, revealing some of his thinking after receiving the interim advice from the defence strategic review. Marles said: Gone are the days of simply paying the entry price to obtain our guarantee from our security guarantor. The world and our region is far too precarious for that. We will have to be willing – and capable – to act on our own terms, when we have to. Crucially, for my portfolio, this will mean ensuring that the military arm of national power is match fit. Australia’s defence capabilities cannot match those of major powers. Australian statecraft is only viable if it is underpinned by the ability to project force and power: to deter military threats, and defend Australia’s national interests within our immediate region. And so I believe the cornerstone of future Australian strategic thought will be impactful projection. We must invest in targeted capabilities that enable us to hold potential adversaries’ forces at risk at a distance and increase the calculated cost of aggression against Australia and its interests. And we must be able to do this through the full spectrum of proportionate response. This will require the Australian defence force to recalibrate its military capabilities, force structure and posture. Our approach must strengthen the lethality, resilience and readiness of the ADF. We must ensure we accord adequate priority to high-end military capabilities to do this. The ADF must augment its self-reliance to deploy and deliver combat power through impactful materiel, enhanced strike capability – including over longer distances – and better logistics and supply chain support, including through a vibrant and innovative partnership with industry. But Marles also flagged the need for cuts elsewhere: If we are to grow the defence budget, then in the same breath we must also open up defence spending to scrutiny. The defence strategic review will inevitably foreshadow some difficult decisions. As we think about how we reconfigure our defence force for a very different strategic environment inevitably we will have to make some hard choices. But the very process of exposing the defence budget to scrutiny and criticism is exactly what will provide the licence for the defence budget to grow in the way it must. He warned of a defence personnel crisis: Today, the reality is defence faces greater challenges to recruit, retain and grow its workforce than we have for decades. The ADF is almost 3,000 below its allocated force strength. The Department of Defence is more than 1,000 below its budgeted size. In part the defence establishment is simply experiencing the demand for labour which is being felt right around the country. But it also has to do with ensuring that defence’s recruitment reflects the way young Australians approach their careers and that within this context the defence offering is competitive. What is completely clear is that urgent action is required if we are to respond to our more challenging strategic environment. Because right now we have a defence personnel crisis. Equality Australia asks ‘what’s next’ on five-year anniversary of yes vote Five years ago the Australian Bureau of Statistics released the results of the marriage law postal survey: 61.6% of Australians voted yes to allow two people, regardless of sex, to be able to marry. Three weeks later, marriage equality became law. Since then, almost 18,000 same sex couples have married in Australia, according to the ABS. Including 6,538 in the year following the yes vote (5.5% of all marriages). On Tuesday peak LGBTIQ+ body Equality Australia will use the anniversary to launch the YES, What’s Next? campaign, calling for an end to gender and sexuality discrimination in religious schools and organisations, ending “conversion therapy” practices and ensuring trans people are fully equal. Equality Australia chief executive, Anna Brown, said: Five years ago, Australians said YES to marriage equality. They said yes to love, fairness and acceptance. It’s a bittersweet day for our communities – both a landmark moment in our national history that has brought great happiness to 36,000 people and their families, and a reminder of a divisive and unnecessary public debate about our lives and our families ... We’ve come a long way as a society in the last five years, but there’s so much more to do. Still today, many of us face discrimination at school, in our workplace or when accessing services. Violence against people in our communities still happens and the opponents who lobbied against marriage equality have shifted focus, doubling down on their attacks on trans and gender diverse people in Australia. Ian Thorpe, five time Olympic gold medal swimmer and prominent marriage equality campaigner, said: The YES vote meant more than simply saying yes to same sex marriage, it was also saying yes to all the LGBTQ+ kids out there that they are just as much a part of society as everyone else, and that all of us are equal no matter who we love. Australia is at its best when we embrace all of our differences. We are better and stronger together. And that’s what the YES vote did, it brought us all together – not only in spirit but also in law ... The YES, What’s Next? pledge is a rallying cry to political leaders across the country to build a more fair, equal and just society by ending conversion practices, ensuring trans people are fully equal, protecting LGBTIQ+ students and staff from discrimination in religious school, and protecting intersex people from harm. Natasha May now on deck with you. Residents of Forbes were warned to evacuate before 7am or risk being cut off this morning as the SES say the Lachlan River is rising faster than originally forecast. The central west town in NSW has had several major floods over the past 12 months, the last only two weeks ago coming in just under the level reached in the June 1952 flood. This time, the Bureau of Meteorology predicts water levels will peak around 10.8 metres on Wednesday – similar to the 1952 level. The flooding in Forbes comes as the Wyangala Dam across the Lachlan River is spilling over at at 104.1% capacity. A WaterNSW spokesman told the Sydney Morning Herald that the 230,000 megalitre outflow from the dam was a record surpassing the 205,000 megalitres during flooding in 1990. NSW flood warnings for Lachlan and Macquarie rivers The Bureau of Meteorology has issued more flood warnings for central west New South Wales as the state continues to feel the impact of massive rainfall over recent days and the Wyangala Dam continues to spill. “With all the rain over the weekend we are still seeing significant flooding for large parts of the country – particularly for Bathurst and Forbes,” Bureau of Meteorology senior meteorologist Jonathan How told Australian Associated Press. The BoM released a warning for the Lachlan River in the early hours of this morning: Moderate to heavy rainfall observed across the Lachlan River catchment has resulted in renewed river level rises and areas of flooding. Major flooding is occurring at Cowra and Nanami. Major flooding is likely at Forbes from early Tuesday morning. Major flooding is occurring at Cottons Weir. It also said major flooding was occurring at Bathurst but the Macquarie River was now falling. Further south-west, the town of Eugowra has been cut off and residents had to be rescued by helicopter and taken to Orange. Our reporter Cait Kelly filed this story last night, including this quote from emergency services minister, Steph Cooke. “With a population of 700, one in five residents have been rescued in the last few hours, by helicopter or by boat. This [severe weather] event is now in its 62nd day, and every day it throws up new challenges.” And that’s it from me this morning, my colleague Natasha May will keep you up to date on everything you need to know. A new report published overnight shows that Australia still lags most developed countries in the climate performance index despite the Labor government’s attempts to improve the country’s standing. Australia is ranked 55th out of 63 in the index, a slight improvement on its 59th place last year as a lack of national plan to phase out fossil fuel mining contin ues to hold the country back. Nicki Hutley, an economist with the Climate Council, said Australia had “gone from dead last to a pass”. “Despite the nation’s recent progress, there is no escaping just how far behind we are and how much catching up we’ve got to do,” she said. Adam Morton has the full story here. Welcome to our live blog where the day will be dominated by the run up to Anthony Albanese’s meeting with Xi Jinping in Bali tonight. My colleague Natasha May will be here soon to guide you through the day but in the meantime, let’s see what’s coming up. The Business Council of Australia has hailed the prime minister’s meeting with Xi as a “tremendous reset” and an opportunity to rebuild relations with our biggest trading partner after trade wars and spats about the pandemic and human rights. Our political editor, Katharine Murphy, is in Bali and will keep us informed every step of the way. She has this take on the comments by BCA chief Jennifer Westacott. Another summit, another country, and climate minister Chris Bowen is in Egypt for the Cop27 climate talks. He plans to give a speech later today criticising the World Bank for failing to offer a rigorous enough response to the climate emergency, and also suggesting that the architecture of the global financial system needs to be reworked to create better solutions to the problem. Our environment editor, Adam Morton, is in Sharm el-Sheikh and has filed this take on Bowen. Severe flooding continues to pose a serious risk to communities in the central west of New South Wales with major flooding expected in towns including Forbes and Bathurst. In addition, there are emergency orders in place for areas from the Queensland border to Victoria as far south as Geelong."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2022/jul/12/australia-news-live-covid-hospitalisations-anthony-albanese-sydney-energy-forum-pacific-islands-forum-fiji-kiribati-china-queensland-monkeypox","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-12T08:39:09Z","webTitle":"End of rapid Covid test and telehealth subsidies criticised – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2022/jul/12/australia-news-live-covid-hospitalisations-anthony-albanese-sydney-energy-forum-pacific-islands-forum-fiji-kiribati-china-queensland-monkeypox","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2022/jul/12/australia-news-live-covid-hospitalisations-anthony-albanese-sydney-energy-forum-pacific-islands-forum-fiji-kiribati-china-queensland-monkeypox","fields":{"headline":"End of rapid Covid test and telehealth subsidies criticised – as it happened","bodyText":"With that, we will wrap up the blog for the evening. We’ll be back first thing tomorrow, with all the latest from Fiji and closer to shore. Here are today’s major developments: With the Pacific Islands Forum underway, Australia has resisted calls from neighbours for no new gas or coal projects, saying it was not responsible for other countries’ emissions. In other forum news, the Australian and US governments have signed a deal they say will help accelerate zero emissions technology, including long duration storage and removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The announcement was made by the climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, and the US secretary of energy, Jennifer Granholm, on the sidelines of the Sydney Energy Forum. The federal health minister, Mark Butler, announced the federal program providing 10 free rapid antigen tests every three months for concession card holders will end in July. The opposition’s health spokeswoman, Anne Ruston, has called for the health advice underpinning the decision to be released. The announcement has been criticised by health bodies including the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners and the Pharmaceutical Society of Australia. Australia reported 58 Covid deaths on Tuesday, as both NSW and Victoria reduced the reinfection period from 12 down to four weeks. And Australia’s privacy watchdog has launched an investigation into retail giants Bunnings and Kmart over their use of facial recognition technology in stores. A gentle reminder we’re still in a pandemic: Man dies in Fitzroy in Melbourne A man has died in Fitzroy this afternoon after a fatal shooting occurred, Victoria Police say. Emergency services were called to Brunswick Street about 4.15pm this afternoon where the man was located with life threatening injuries. Police believe he was involved in an altercation with a number of people at a car parked on Brunswick Street before he was fatally shot. Witnesses called triple zero and ambulance crews tried to treat the man, who is yet to be formally identified, but he later died at the scene. Police have cordoned off the area and a crime scene has been established. Victoria police: Detectives are still working to determine the exact circumstances of the incident but at this stage it appears to be a targeted incident with the parties involved possibly known to each other. Police would like to speak anyone who witnessed anything or has CCTV or dashcam vision of the incident. Covid admissions up 53% in Victorian hospitals in past two weeks The Victorian government has released more information on today’s Covid update. Health authorities say there’s been a 53% increase in the numbers of Victorians in hospital with the virus in the past two weeks, as BA.4/BA.5 becomes the dominant strain circulating in the community. At the same time, the third wave of Omicron isn’t expected to peak until August. The Victorian government joined New South Wales in reducing the period of reinfection from 12 weeks to 28 days, and has pushed for Victorians to get their booster and wear masks in high risk settings. Case and hospitalisation trends are increasing in Victoria. This is in line with similar patterns globally and in other Australian jurisdictions, which have seen a significant rise in the number of people hospitalised with Covid-19 in recent weeks. What is GDP? Our latest News glossary video explains When a country’s economy is discussed in the news, you often hear a number called GDP, or gross domestic product, thrown around. But what does it actually mean, and is it gross? In this episode of News glossary, Matilda Boseley explains the meaning of GDP and how it reflects economies in Australia and abroad. PM defends the scrapping of pandemic leave payments Anthony Albanese has defended scrapping pandemic leave payments, laying the blame at the feet of the previous government, AAP reports. The payments for workers who needed to spend time away from work while they isolated ended on 30 June. But there have been calls for the payments to be reinstated as Covid case numbers and hospitalisations increase across the country, driven by new, infectious sub-variants. The prime minister, who today received his fourth Covid-19 vaccine dose, said he would not bring back the payments due to the need for the government to rein in spending. The new government had inherited the former’s decision to end the payments and $1tn of debt, he said: They are circumstances which my government faces … there are a range of things we would like to do, but we intend to be fiscally responsible in how we deal with issues. As case numbers rise across the country, the chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, said hospitals could hold back some elective surgery due to the strain on the system. He said the emergence of influenza for the first time in three years in Australia was making the situation worse. The health minister, Mark Butler, said Covid cases were not likely to peak nationally for at least four weeks during the third wave of infections. While case numbers have increased and calls have grown for mask mandates to return, the prime minister said he would follow health advice on the issue. The epidemiologist Catherine Bennett told Sky News educating the public about the risks of exposure to Covid would be more helpful than reintroducing a mask mandate. Australia has resisted calls from the Pacific for no new gas or coal projects, saying it was not responsible for other countries’ emissions, in a move that could cause tensions as Pacific leaders meet in Suva this week. A key demand of Pacific nations – that Australia commit to no new coal or gas projects – will remain a point of difference between Australia and Pacific nations, as Anthony Albanese arrives in Fiji on Wednesday ahead of the Pacific Islands Forum leaders meeting. Labor late off the mark on foot-and-mouth disease, Littleproud says David Littleproud just appeared on ABC’s Afternoon Briefing to discuss the growing threat of foot-and-mouth disease. As if we didn’t need more things to worry about. Murray Watt, the federal minister for agriculture, has backed the expansion of electronic tagging to improve tracing of livestock to combat the risk of disease, but says it’s up to state governments to mandate it. Littleproud says he’s been too late off the mark. While I welcome the fact Murray’s going to Indonesia, we would have hoped probably last week he might have picked the phone up and tried to build on what we’d already put in place in Indonesia and Timor and Papua New Guinea. When this hit, we – not only with foot-and-mouth disease, but with lumpy skin disease – we put biosecurity officers and vets into those countries to try and ... help. What we’re concerned about is there’s no decisive action on some other measures that could be taken ... there are hundreds of people coming from Indonesia back into Australia every day. Anthony Albanese has the Australia-themed sportswear on but he’s missing the face mask flag. Throwback: Hydrogen project will need government support, energy forum hears In the closing panel of the Sydney Energy Forum, Yoshinori Kanehana of Kawasaki Heavy Industries says greater government support will be needed to progress the Japanese-Australian Hydrogen Energy Supply Chain project (HESC) – an engineering milestone that makes liquefied hydrogen from coal. HESC was “so successful because of the big support from the Japanese and Australian government”, he says. Under the $500m HESC pilot project, hydrogen will be made in Victoria’s LaTrobe valley from brown coal and transported aboard a purpose-built ship to Japan, where it will be burned in coal-fired power plants. Kanehana says: At the beginning, the cost [of liquid hydrogen] may be more expensive compared to fossil fuels ... So we need operating expense help from the government. Large, vast quantity production of hydrogen will reduce the cost. This cannot be done by a single company or single country. Some researchers have raised concerns that the project could increase emissions and lock in a new fossil fuel industry. Fiji’s PM urges Pacific unity but respects Kiribati withdrawal from forum In Suva, Fiji’s prime minister, Frank Bainimarama, says the Pacific is “most resilient as a family”, while respecting the wishes of Kiribati and its government to withdraw from the forum. The people and government of Kiribati have always been and will remain part of our Pacific family. Australia’s privacy watchdog has launched an investigation into retail giants Bunnings and Kmart over their use of facial recognition technology in stores. Consumer group Choice last month revealed Bunnings and Kmart were using the technology – which captures images of people’s faces from video cameras as a unique faceprint that is then stored and can be compared with other faceprints – in what the companies say is a move to protect customers and staff and reduce theft in selected stores. Choice reported the two companies along with the The Good Guys to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC), raising questions over how people’s personal information was being handled through the technology. The OAIC announced on Tuesday it had decided to launch an investigation into the personal information handling practices of Bunnings and Kmart and how they use the facial recognition technology in store. The Good Guys paused its use of the technology following preliminary inquiries from the OAIC. The OAIC said: In line with the OAIC’s Privacy regulatory action policy, no further comment will be made while the investigations are ongoing. Comment has been sought from Bunnings and Kmart. Environment protection agency needed to help Australia ‘do better’, Plibersek says Finally, Plibersek is asked about the State of the Environment Report, to be released on 19 July and expected to be “grim reading”. The report was received by the previous government in December and not made public before the federal election. Question: What would a standalone environment protection agency, the likes of which you have promised, what would it do to improve any of the findings in that report and by when? Plibersek: This is a report that is months overdue ... the fact we’ve kept it secret before the last election tells you a lot about the contents of the report. I don’t want to disclose everything today. I will tell you that this report shows that there’s been a substantial decline in a number of key areas of our environment. We need to do better. We absolutely need to do better to protect our landscapes, our threatened species, to protect the environment for all Australians. We’ve spoken about an environmental protection agency because it’s a simple fact that the EPBC Act ... is not doing its job particularly well. It’s not protecting the environment in the best way and it’s also quite slow and cumbersome. Labor ‘determined’ to invest in shift to renewable despite global energy crisis Plibersek is asked whether a warning from the visiting International Energy Agency chief that the global energy crisis may get worse before it gets better could hinder the federal government’s 43% energy reduction commitment. She says Labor remains “determined” to invest in the transition to cleaner energy. I think it’s plain to everyone that the conflict in Ukraine and other uncertainties are having an impact on energy markets around the world but it doesn’t change the fact that particularly in the medium to longer term, the best way of bringing down power prices is to see more renewables entering the market. I think this is a reminder that this transition is a huge opportunity for Australia. Of course, it has short-term difficulties, and I’m not for a moment discounting the impact that higher energy prices right now are having. This is the result of 10 years of ... neglect by the previous government. Short term, then, is there a lot of “pressure placed on [her] shoulders” to approve new coal and gas projects? (Presumably as a sort of “band-aid fix” despite the fact coalmines take a reasonable amount of time to start up and shut down.) I don’t think any serious commentator is saying that we’ve got to stop exporting Australian coal and gas tomorrow. I don’t think anybody serious is saying that. It will be part of our energy mix for some time to come and part of the global energy mix for some time. What we need to do is make sure at the same time we develop the economic opportunities of renewable energy. Australia in talks with Pacific on 2029 UN climate conference, Plibersek says The environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, follows Conroy on ABC’s Afternoon Briefing. Still on the Pacific Islands Forum, she’s asked how much thought the federal government has given to the 2029 UN climate conference and the involvement of smaller Pacific nations. Plibersek says: We’ve started to have conversations with our Pacific neighbours about the sort of involvement they’d like to see. I met with the Samoan environment minister today, and last week when I was in Lisbon I met with a number of Pacific leaders and ambassadors from Pacific nations, and there’s a fair degree of enthusiasm for this proposal. Obviously no region in the world is more impacted by climate change than the Pacific. So, there’s a very strong interest from Pacific nations to remind the world again of what an existential issue this is for them. Australia is supporting Vanuatu’s voice on climate, Conroy says Conroy is asked about the push from Vanuatu for the international court of justice (ICJ) to seek referrals on countries that don’t meet their climate change obligations. No Pacific island nation is a party to the ICJ, yet Conroy has indicated he’s in support of the proposal. Is Australia “backing the wrong horse”? We’re backing a process. We’re being very supportive of the Vanuatu government’s efforts to get a resolution passed by the UN general assembly, that would refer a number of questions to the international court of justice for their deliberations ... we make it clear that the UNFCCC negotiations is the primary focus for achieving climate action around the globe but are supportive of the process that Vanuatu has been pursuing ... we haven’t agreed on the resolution. We’re yet to see the questions that the government of Vanuatu intends to put to the UN general assembly and we will reserve our position until we see the questions, like every other nation. This is just an example of where under the new Australian government rather than stifling climate action, rather than trying to bully and intimidate Pacific countries to stop them talking about climate action, we’re supporting their voice in multilateral forums because is the number one security threat to the Pacific and we’re very committed to being part of the solution, rather than being part of the problem. Pacific Islands Forum focused on ‘rebuilding unity’, Conroy says Now to China, “looming large” over discussions at the forum. Conroy: We made a decision to not include dialogue partners in this PIF, but the focus was on concentrating on rebuilding PIF unity. So that’s why the vast majority of the program with limited exceptions ... focused on Pacific Island Forum leaders and foreign ministers talking to each other, working on how we can renew and energise the PIF architecture. Why, then, did the US vice-president, Kamala Harris, make a pitch to members? There are some limited and specific interventions that the chair has allowed. And obviously that was a decision that the prime minister of Fiji made. So you have to go to the Fiji government as to why they did that. There are limited exceptions to that focus. The overwhelming focus is on rebuilding unity. Australia’s aid to Kiribati has no strings attached, Conroy says Asked what more Australia could do to entice Kiribati back, Conroy acknowledged it was “important that the discussions are being led by Fiji” as the chair of the Pacific Islands Forum. Yesterday, Australia committed $2m in additional assistance to help the island nation through drought. It’s counter productive for Australia to be too forward leaning. That decision around the aid package is not conditional on Kiribati rejoining the Pacific Islands Forum. We don’t deliver aid like that. We don’t deliver aid with strings attached, unlike other countries interested in this region. Pacific minister Pat Conroy on Kiribati rejoining the Pacific Islands Forum Pacific minister Pat Conroy is appearing on ABC’s Afternoon Briefing, wearing a lovely shirt. Asked whether Kiribati may rejoin the Pacific Islands Forum, he replied: The leaders’ dialogue had a lot of strong language around commitment to unity and the importance of a strong united Pacific voice. That is a positive. Importantly, several Micronesian leaders were strong in the need to implement the Suva agreement and rebuild the architecture of the Pacific Islands Forum as the central architecture for the region. I wouldn’t say that I’m more optimistic about Kiribati rejoining. I’m not more pessimistic, but I think it’s one where we have to let Kiribati go through their paces, acknowledging today is their national day ... Pacific unity is vital for our shared interests. That’s what Micronesian leaders said ... and something we’re working towards. Controversial Queensland New Acland coalmine should stay closed, activists say My thought has well and truly been provoked by this Fijian cloud. On the topic of climate change, the Queensland Resources Council is lobbying the state government to expand a controversial New Acland open-cut coalmine, which would extract some seven million tonnes of coal per year and extend its life for more than a decade. Paul King from Oakey Coal Action Alliance said the mine was currently closed and should stay that way. This controversial mine expansion will risk prime agricultural land and water resources and goes against the science that tells us emissions must rapidly decrease to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. During our current food crisis, it doesn’t make sense to destroy prime agricultural land and put up to 10m litres of milk production at risk by reopening this mine. The new mining project will also use up to 1.3m litres of water a day, draining local water bores. Farmers in this area are completely reliant on this groundwater source. Local farmers and landholders are calling on the government to reject this licence and put an end to this dangerous project once and for all. RACGP backs continuation of free RATs for concession card holders The RACGP is backing the continuation of free rapid antigen tests for concession card holders following the federal government’s announcement the funding would be cut. It comes amid the rollback of other Covid measures including 70 telehealth items introduced during the pandemic. Its president Karen Price says Covid “is not disappearing anytime soon” and we “must do more to reduce community transmission”. Government urged to consider shared infrastructure at Sydney Energy Forum Amanda Lacaze of Lynas has pleaded to the government to think about shared infrastructure between critical mineral and battery production at the Sydney Energy Forum today. Shared infrastructure is by definition going to be lower cost. My plead to the government is to think about shared infrastructure for these value-add activities. In Kalgoorlie, Western Australia – home to a Lyans mineral refining facility – it is “about water”, she explains. At the same time, it is “equally about minerals, sulphuric acid, hydrochloric acid ... it is about building the ecosystem and the capability”. If we do that, we can win ... [it] allows us to be cross-competitive. Spike in solar panel prices puts pressure on increased demand Prof Martin Green of UNSW acknowledges a spike in solar panel prices at the Sydney Energy Forum. Solar panel prices “hit an all time low in 2020”, he explains. Following a shortage in pure silicon material used in production following disturbances at three major factories, prices have “gone up about 40% per watt per solar panel”. With the “important role of solar” for climate change mitigation being increasingly “publicised”, Green points to “increased demand right at the time supply is struggling”. Disgraced former Ipswich mayor’s name stripped from bridge and street signs Ipswich mayor Teresa Harding says “common sense” has “prevailed” after the council voted to strip the name of jailed sex offender and former mayor Paul Pisasale from a bridge and street west of Brisbane. Pisasale was sentenced to seven-and-a-half years in prison in 2020 after pleading guilty to more than 30 offences. Seven of nine councillors voted to remove Pisasale’s name from the council assets on Tuesday after a decision to leave the names unchanged sparked community backlash earlier this month. Pisasale’s former deputy mayor, councillor Paul Tully, and another fellow member of the former council, councillor Sheila Ireland abstained from the vote. On Facebook, Harding thanked residents for relaying their concerns and said their voices had “been heard loud and clear”. The council has authorised its chief executive to work with the Yuggera Ugarapul people native title holders to come up with new names in line with community sentiment. A council spokesperson said in the meantime, the bridge will be unnamed and street signs with the existing name at Yamanto will remain in place. The opposition’s health spokeswoman, Anne Ruston, has called on the federal government to release the health advice underpinning its decision to end free Covid tests for concession card holders. She raised concern that this followed a government decision to end more than 70 different telehealth services, and the winding up of pandemic leave payments despite Australia entering into a devastating third wave of the virus. She told Guardian Australia: At a time when we are seeing a massive increase in the number of Covid cases and cost of living pressures impacting very seriously on Australians, Mr Butler must outline what expert advice has formed the basis of his decision. The pattern of behaviour in the Albanese government’s health response to Covid is worrying. There have already been cuts to 70 telehealth services, cuts to the pandemic leave disaster payments, and now cuts to the access of rapid antigen testing for concession card holders. You would have to question the timing of these cuts when it is so important that Australians are mindful of this new, dangerous wave of Covid going through our communities. Queensland monkeypox case poses ‘no general risk’ In better news, a monkeypox case reported in Queensland yesterday evening – the state’s first – poses “no general risk” and no sleep lost. Which is a relief, as there are already enough things to stay up fretting over. Number of Queensland health staff off work equal to state’s first Covid wave The number of health staff off work in Queensland is nearly equal to the state’s first wave earlier in the year. Nevertheless, there’s been no move on a tightening of restrictions, with the chief health officer acknowledging keeping Covid off cruise ships is “incredibly difficult” following a major outbreak. The Pharmaceutical Society of Australia [PSA] national president Dr Fei Sim said the federal government’s announcement that the Covid-19 rapid test concessional access program will not be extended beyond July will put vulnerable Australians at risk. She said it also sends the wrong message to the public: The pandemic is not over, and the threat of serious illness is still there for many vulnerable people in our communities. Testing remains a vital part of our Covid-19 response. While recognising that our approach to test-trace-isolate has changed since the program was launched in January, testing with even mild symptoms remains an expectation of everyone in the community. She said with most states and territories adopting advice from the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee [AHPPC] to move from a three-month to a 28-day immunity period, access to testing will be vital, especially for vulnerable groups who’ve relied on the concessional program. Earlier on Tuesday the Australian Medical Association [AMA] and the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners [RACGP] said vulnerable people will be most impacted by the end of Medicare-subsidised extended telehealth consultations and a range of other telehealth items. Both organisations have written to health minister Mark Butler urging him to meet with them and discuss the changes. AMA president, Dr Omar Khorshid has said: These changes undermine the ability of patients to access their doctors, and in particular for GPs to prescribe antivirals for Covid-positive patients and will lead to costs elsewhere in the health system, including in overstretched hospitals. This decision means telephone access to doctors will be significantly limited, hitting vulnerable patients hardest, including those who do not have access to high bandwidth internet and those who can’t operate the necessary IT systems. Many thanks to the lovely Natasha May for keeping us informed today. I’ll be with you for the rest of this fine Tuesday. Handing you over to the wonderful Caitlin Cassidy who’ll be helming the blog for the rest of the day! Sydney Energy Forum hears how Taiwan has no oil and gas Naiwen Marina Hsu of the Taiwanese branch of a fund management company specialising in energy infrastructure assets, Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners, told the panel at the Sydney Energy Forum today how Taiwan has “no oil and gas, at all”. In “looking to build out renewable energy”, the Chinese government has declared a net zero goal, she says. In response, “the buildout [of renewable energy manufacturing] has to be much more aggressive”. From zero to one [Taiwan] is building an offshore wind industry. 25km off the coast of Taiwan, commercialised offshore wind turbines are being constructed. [The Chinese government] just launched three rounds to build out to 15GW of offshore wind. A steady and a planned, staged policy department, together with capable private capital going in ... [and] experienced developers giving back to society by building up local industry. Emergency service volunteers being trained to fill Victoria’s ambulance staff shortage Fifty of Victoria’s fire and emergency service volunteers are being trained to provide first aid as the state’s ambulance staff are in extreme shortage. The training comes as Ambulance Victoria on Sunday issued its seventh code red emergency in as many months. Queensland energy minister calls for Australia to think about value rather than cost when it comes to renewables Mick de Brenni, the Queensland minister for energy, renewables and hydrogen, emphasises thinking about spending on renewable energy as “about value ... not about cost” on a panel at the Sydney Energy Forum. Value when looking at the cost of what we need to build includes consideration of reliability, quality, deliverability ... valuing the supply chains, the new business and job opportunities we create. Value means measuring the opportunity cost of not acting to develop your own capacity. It is a real threat ... if we are pushing for just low cost. De Brenni says this was the “shift” in the Queendsland government’s mindset when “thinking about investments” in renewables. NSW flood recovery and clean-up continues Agencies continue to help flood victims clean up their homes and streets. Fire and Rescue NSW said that fire crews have been cleaning up seaweed piled up in backyards at Chittaway Bay, on the Central Coast, in addition to the more usual activities of mopping up water, hosing out silt and moving ruined furniture from flood-damaged homes. At Sackville, on the Hawkesbury River, the agency has deployed its Hytrans Bulk Water Transfer unit to help pump large quantities of water out of affected areas. They’ve released a video showing some of these efforts. Agency running NDIS doesn’t understand First Nations cultural practices, inquiry hears The agency running the National Disability Insurance Scheme doesn’t understand the importance of Return to Country cultural practices to First Nations people, an inquiry has heard. The disability royal commission is this week exploring the experiences of First Nations people navigating the NDIS in remote communities over five days of hearings in Alice Springs. Beth Walker, the Northern Territory public guardian, told the inquiry the agency failed to understand the significance of Return to Country trips and did not include a specific line item for funding them in NDIS packages. She said: The NDIA doesn’t really get the importance of those Return to Country trips. They are viewed a little bit like a holiday rather than a cultural connection. That’s really important to First Nations people. And, again, there’s no specific line item in the NDIA pricing guide that covers Return to Country trips and so we are often trying to manoeuvre around people’s day to day services and pull out little bits or use other areas to fund the Return to Country trip. Walker said the logistics of planning such trips could be “extensive” because of a person’s disability needs, including mobility issues and the need for one or multiple support workers. So they are not necessarily easy things to plan, depending on the needs of the person. But the benefit and the joy that you see on someone’s face of returning and being with family is – there’s really no words to describe that. Walker also said she was concerned by cuts to the NDIS plans of some of the individuals for whom she acts as public guardian. Guardian Australia has previously reported cuts to funding packages in the NT, particularly for accomodation funding. She said: I think what I am seeing as public guardian is the winding back of people’s plans and it seems to have a financial driver rather than the needs of the person at the centre of what’s happening. And that really concerns me. Walker is the guardian for 337 First Nations people in the NT, 203 of whom living in remote communities. The inquiry continues. PM gets fourth Covid vaccine jab The prime minister Anthony Albanese rolled up his sleeve today for a fourth dose of the Covid-19 vaccine before he departs for Fiji to attend the Pacific Islands Forum. Albanese is part of the over 50 age bracket that Atagi recommended receive an additional dose of the vaccine last week, as hospitalisations surge across the country amid another Omicron wave. Since yesterday Australians over the age of 30 have been eligible for the extra jab. Climate action must be ‘fairly shared’ across Indo-Pacific, Bowen says Chris Bowen, minister for climate change and energy, urges the Indo-Pacific region could “lead the world in clean energy transformations” in his address to the Sydney Energy Forum. Pointing to battery, steal, hydrogen and solar manufacturing, Bowen says the region “can become the key global source of the raw materials, products and technologies that are vital to reducing emissions”. Australia is the biggest producer of lithium in the world, with 49% of global production in 2020. With battery demand expected to grow at an incredible rate over the next decade, Australia can seize the opportunity to become a critical mineral powerhouse ... Japan is setting the foundations for new clean energy supply chains in our region, investing significantly in hydrogen production, use and transport technologies. Japan and the Indo-Pacific are leading the world in hydrogen ... and ... India is on the path to becoming a solar giant, underpinned by the scale of their manufacturing sector, and spurred on by their ambitious target of reaching 100 GW of solar this year. Acknowledging the frequency and severity of both fires and floods sweeping Australia, Bowen says action on climate is both an “environmental obligation” and “in our region’s own economic interest”. It is also vital that no one is left behind. Bowen urges that the economic costs and benefits of “real action” on climate change must be “fairly shared” across the Indo-Pacific. We need to work with the leaders of emerging economies to understand and address their concerns. Bowen points to the Albanese government’s $15bn National Reconstruction Fund, aimed to “harness Australia’s renewable potential”. It will focus on production of green, low-cost materials for wind turbines and solar PV, as well as the broader economy ... [and] strengthen emerging sectors such as hydrogen and battery production, supported by hydrogen hubs and an Australian Made Battery Precinct. Bowen’s address comes as Australia signs a deal with the US to accelerate deployment of zero emissions technology, as covered by Guardian Australia’s climate and environment editor Adam Morton in the blog. First Nations people lobby to change culturally insensitive name of Queensland creek In Queensland, the Iningai and Bidjara people have successfully lobbied to change the name of Longreach’s Black Gin creek, deemed culturally insensitive to traditional owners. Bidjara man Trevor Robinson is lobbying to change the name to Watyakan, an Iningai word meaning women’s creek. In my view, not only is the current name intolerable to First Nations people but also to the wider community, especially women. State resources minister Scott Stewart said there was strong support for the name change from local council. This creek is a site of cultural importance to the traditional owners and custodians of the land and the current name does not give the site the respect it deserves. The ... government will continue to work with First Nations peoples to formally rename insensitive sites. The existing name first appeared on maps from about 1887 and covers the watercourse as it journeys from south-east of Ilfracombe to the Thompson River. Consultation with community on the name change will run until September. Australia must ‘walk the talk’ on climate, Greens leader says The Greens are pushing for the federal government to can new coal and gas projects as the Pacific Forum gets underway. Greens leader Adam Bandt said Australia must “walk the talk” on climate to bolster its position in the region. If we don’t change course ... big talk will mean nothing to our regional neighbours. We’ve promised our partners in the region that we’ll act to keep warming under 1.5 degrees, but Labor’s current climate target will make that impossible. A weak emissions reduction of 43% is consistent with at least two degrees of warming. Even the weak target of 43% by 2030 will be impossible if Labor doesn’t urgently halt new gas projects at Scarborough and the Beetaloo Basin. Pacific Island leaders want 75% and no new coal and gas because that’s what it takes to keep warming under 1.5 degrees. They’re not alone: According to applications lodged under national environment laws, the federal government could face decisions on whether to approve up to 27 coal mining developments. The RBA has released a nifty little snapshot of Australia’s economy. Millennials, avert your eyes at the average price of residential dwellings. The Australian and US governments have signed a deal that they say will help accelerate the development and deployment of zero emissions technology, including long duration storage and removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The announcement by Australia’s climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, and the US secretary of energy, Jennifer Granholm, was made on the sidelines of the Sydney Energy Forum, covered elsewhere in the blog by Rafqa Touma. Few details of agreement were released, but Bowen said it would put dealing with climate change at the centre of the relationship between the countries. Both ministers suggested it should ultimately make the two countries less reliant on Chinese clean energy supply chains. The Chinese control about 80% of the global manufacturing supply chain for solar energy. Granholm said the two countries would “work together to unlock critical advances in long-duration storage, grid integration, clean hydrogen, direct air capture, and critical minerals and materials.” Bowen said the partnership was “a huge milestone in ramping up the US and Australia’s shared commitment to ambitious climate action and energy security”. It prioritises not just development but deployment of the critical technologies that will underpin economic opportunity in the energy transformation of our two countries. The announcement of the Australia-US net zero technology acceleration partnership coincided with the signing of a memorandum of understanding between the CSIRO and the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory to work together developing clean energy tech. New canine member added to Queensland fire and rescue squad With the many recent natural disasters, Australia’s emergency services are more vital than ever. Fire and Rescue Queensland earlier today introduced the public to Bolt, their smallest qualified urban search and rescue canine. The South Australian police made an April fools’ joke last year claiming to be introducing sausage dogs into its ranks, but Bolt appears to be a legitimate member of the Queensland service. Here are the latest coronavirus numbers from around Australia today, as the country records at least 58 deaths from Covid-19: ACT Deaths: 0 Cases: 1,174 In hospital: 140 (with 3 people in ICU) NSW Deaths: 20 Cases: 10,806 In hospital: 2,049 (with 58 people in ICU) Northern Territory Deaths: 0 Cases: 481 In hospital: 39 (with no people in ICU) Queensland Deaths: 15 Cases: 6,768 In hospital: 860 (with 12 people in ICU) South Australia Deaths: 3 Cases: 3,668 In hospital: 246 (with 6 people in ICU) Tasmania Deaths: 1 Cases: 1,812 In hospital: 29 (with 2 people in ICU) Victoria Deaths: 16 Cases: 10,627 In hospital: 737 (with 39 people in ICU) Western Australia Deaths: 3 Cases: 6,000 In hospital: 297 (with 6 people in ICU) There were 6,000 new cases in the last reporting period, and six people are in intensive care. Calls for move to greater electricity use at Sydney Energy Forum Claudio Facchin of Hitachi Energy, urges the need to move “move 20% to 50-70% electricity” in the grid on a panel at today’s Sydney Energy Forum. He says there is comfort in “a lot of the technology needed to make that shift” being “available today” and there being “a lot of electrification across industries” on the “demand side”. Facchin says “we need do more to make everyone understand that the entire electricity system” will need to change. The scale that is needed and the pace at which we need to deliver that technology ... requires a lot of innovation. Facchin points to that innovation in “how we partner, look at business models, how we innovate across the entire supply chain, how we create policies and a regulatory environment to deploy this technology [across countries and regionally].” There were 3,668 new cases in the last reporting period, and six people are in intensive care. India’s energy supply chain discussed at Sydney Energy Forum Sumant Sinha of ReNew Power acknowledges the issues that come with India’s growth on a panel at today’s Sydney Energy Forum. As India grows, inevitably energy consumption will continue to grow. 70% of India’s total power comes from the coal sector, with 10% from renewables, Sinha explains. A lot of the power sector still sits in the hands of government controlled entities. How policy making evolves in a sector that moves very rapidly ... is a challenge. Following on from discussion earlier this morning on China’s monopoly over the solar panel manufacturing market, Sinha says “we cannot keep importing solar panels”, urging away from dependence on “another part of the world”. India has to create manufacturing domestically. There were 1,174 new cases in the last reporting period, and three people are in intensive care. First images from Nasa’s James Webb space telescope reveal ancient galaxies Nasa today released an image showing the deepest glimpse into the universe we’ve ever seen. It’s the first image from the James Webb telescope, the most powerful telescope ever put into space. The image shows a cluster of some of the earliest formed galaxies after the big bang 13.8bn years ago. On China’s monopoly of solar power manufacturing And an audience question brings us back to the topic of China’s monopoly on solar power manufacturing at the Sydney Energy Forum today. Sumant Sinha of ReNew Power explains China’s manufacturing advantage of companies’ access to cheaper land, and capitol cost being a bit lower. He says the “ecosystem you build” around manufacturing of solar panels – from glass panels to glue – is key to “bringing down logistic costs”. All of that gives you a significant competitive advantage. China crossed that quite some time ago. Any country that wants to start has to start from zero. That manufacturing ecosystem “needs to get to scale before you get to a comparative end product”. Sinha warns of a 25-35% cost disadvantage for a new country entering the market. Will people be willing to pay more to support a new country manufacturing [to diversify away from China]? This is difficult ... because people want access to the cheapest power. Hydrogen could step in to reduce reliance on gas, CSIRO boss says Malcolm Turnbull, former prime minister of Australia, puts forward a question about long duration energy storage at the Sydney Energy Forum today. Dr Larry Marshall of CSIRO says, to address that question, “we need to go beyond the grid”. We need fuel to transfer massive amounts of energy quickly. Marshall warns of an expectation that a reliance on gas will persist until 2040. But he is optimistic that hydrogen will emerge as the solution. Hydrogen will be able to step in and fill in the gap to reduce the amount of storage needed. Equivalent to Europe’s use of hydro electric and nuclear energy, “we think we can do ... with hydrogen in Australia”. There were 6,768 new cases in the last reporting period, and 12 people are in intensive care. Australia needs ‘innovation’ to make clean energy transition Dr Larry Marshall of CSIRO says “innovation is key” in the transition to clean energy technologies on a panel at the Sydney Energy Forum today. Our biggest problem [in Australia] is our innovation dilemma. We can’t make this massive transition, bigger than anything any of us have ever lived through, if we can’t fix that. ‘Huge opportunity’ for Australia to cooperate with US on defence, Marles says Earlier, at the Centre for Strategic International Studies the defence minister Richard Marles also spoke about the possibility of greater development cooperation with the United States. Marles said development was an aspect of the US-Australia alliance that is “underdone” because there “is not the same deep, organic interoperability as in other areas such as defence”. To be glass half full about it – there’s huge opportunity to develop this and do more. Marles then gave an extended analogy about how US naval patrols around its territories including Hawaii traversed the exclusive economic zones of other countries, and could alert them to illegal fishing from “grey” vessels “pillaging” their fish. He proposed an audit of existing activities in the Pacific to determine how these could help Pacific neighbours. Bridi Rice, the chief executive of Development Intelligence Lab, said: The Australia-US alliance is missing a critical dimension for security and stability in the Pacific – development. It’s about time we heard a defence leader talking about development challenges of our region and as a serious and valuable space for US-Australian cooperation. While the political commitment to US and Australian development cooperation in the Pacific has ramped up, we fall woefully short when it comes to practice. We don’t have shared assessments, joint cooperation on the ground is scarce. That has got to change if we are going to have an effective alliance in the Pacific. Update on the second day of hearings held by the disability royal commission in Alice Springs focused on NDIS for First Nations people A First Nations woman with disability living has told of a lack of support in Tennant Creek, saying her life has become more difficult since the national disability insurance scheme arrived in town. Emily, who grew up in Mount Isa, Queensland, but now lives in the Northern Territory, had a stroke in her twenties in 2003 that left her unable to speak. She told the disability royal commission she uses an electric scooter to get around, but that her front door was too small to bring it inside. This meant she needed to charge the scooter outside by running a cable through a window. She said she was concerned her scooter would be stolen, as had occurred to others in the town. Emily also said she had an NDIS plan but that no one had told her how to use her funds. There is no NDIS office in Tennant Creek, meaning she needs to go to a Centrelink office to discuss NDIS issues. That office is not wheelchair accessible, so she can only enter using a walking stick. When asked by counsel assisting the commission, Avelina Tarrago, whether things had gotten worse since the NDIS started, Emily agreed that they had. The commission was also played a clip of Emily crossing the Barkly Highway, the main road in Tennant Creek. Emily said she was often scared crossing the bumpy road on her scooter because there were many trucks which tended to speed along the highway. Her scooter’s tyres were easily damaged on the rough terrain. The inquiry is this week investigating the experiences of First Nations people in remote communities in accessing the NDIS. Minister defied advice on mask mandates Victoria’s health minister Mary-Anne Thomas has revealed the state government defied the acting chief health officer’s advice to introduce mask mandates in a range of settings including early childhood education and some retail environments. It comes after the Victorian government last week extended the state’s pandemic declaration for another three months, citing a serious Covid risk to the public. Speaking to reporters, Thomas said the government had consulted with industry groups and other stakeholders in making its decision: We want to empower Victorians to make the best decision. Victoria today joined NSW in reducing the state’s Covid reinfection period to four weeks, as the state government recommends people wear masks indoors and in crowded public places. Covid-carrying cruise ship under watchful eye of NSW Health When the Coral Princess cruise ship – carrying over 100 Covid positive cases – arrives in NSW the crew will not be allowed to disembark and passengers will have to return a negative RAT test, NSW Health authorities say: The vast majority of Covid-19 cases on the ship are currently in crew members. A small number of passengers have been diagnosed with Covid-19 since boarding the Coral Princess, their infections were most likely acquired prior to boarding and they subsequently tested positive. The ship is currently en route to the port of Eden on the South Coast of NSW and is also scheduled to be in Sydney for one day on Wednesday, 13 July, before travelling to Brisbane. NSW Health said it is liaising with the Coral Princess cruise ship to monitor the health of its passengers and crew members: NSW Health’s assessment is that the Covid-19 risk level for the Coral Princess during this cruise is amber, which indicates a moderate impact to the vessel. When the ship arrives at the port of Eden, NSW Health says that no crew members will disembark and all passengers disembarking will be requested to return a negative RAT result first: To further minimise the risk of transmission, passengers on shore tours will also be advised to wear masks when on transport or in other public indoor spaces, physically distance wherever possible and to regularly use hand sanitiser. ‘I want a frank, fair-dinkum review’: Perrottet on flooding Albanese and Perrottet are speaking about the future of flood-prone areas like Lismore and whether rebuilding should occur. Albanese said: I don’t think we’ve had a discussion about relocating the whole of Lismore. But what we have had on a pretty informal basis is discussion about planning. I think we’d have a common view that you can’t continue to commit the same issues and wonder why you get the same outcomes. And quite clearly planning and development in flood planes is something that is primarily the responsibility of state governments, but common sense has got to apply here as well and I’m confident that the premier will be doing just that. Perrottet said he agreed with the principle that you can’t keep doing the same things the same way and expect a different outcome: There’s no doubt these events are becoming more prevalent and I have commissioned that review. I expect to receive that review by the end of the month. I have said that I’ll make that review public. Now, a lot of that will focus on the immediate response to these disasters but there’s no doubt there will be a medium- to long-term focus and our government is already, independently of that review, working through how we plan for the long term. We need to make sure that we can stand here as leaders in a circumstance where an event like this happens in the future – which it inevitably will – that we have done everything we can to make sure we don’t make the mistakes of the past. And whether that’s development on flood plains in circumstances where not only does that cost and risk lives, but the impact on properties, homes, and businesses, which the Government, at a Commonwealth and state level will always be there to provide that financial support. That’s our job. I have said to both Mary O’Kane and Mick Fuller in relation to that review that I don’t want a political review. I want a frank, fair-dinkum review, that the government will take on board and respond. And I’ll make that report public as quickly as possible. I’ll await the legislation, says PM on assisted dying Albanese is asked how he would vote on the issue of assisted dying: We haven’t seen the bill yet. It will be a private member’s bill. I’ll look at the details of the bill. I’ve been on the record previously - I was an opponent of the Andrews bill when it occurred. The Labor Party has a conscience vote on these issues and so I’ll await the legislation that I read is being introduced by Luke Gosling from the Northern Territory and Alicia Payne from the ACT. Albanese says there are two issues at play: The issue of substance and also the issue of the right of territory governments to be able to determine their own legislation as well. That’s something that, in my view, people in Australia should not be treated any differently and with less rights if they happen to live in Canberra compared with living in Queanbeyan in the state of New South Wales, and similar issues apply to the Northern Territory. Throw out your thongs, say farmers AAP reports that farmers are urging travellers from Bali to throw out their thongs before arriving in Australia, to help stop the highly contagious foot and mouth disease. It’s been estimated the arrival of FMD in Australia could cost the agriculture industry $80b. National farmers federation president Fiona Simson said people throwing away their old footwear would be given a voucher towards a new pair of shoes. “Ringers Western will give them a 30% voucher on their return,” she said. “I never thought we’d be helping people buy new shoes to keep my cattle safe, but here we are.” Last week, biosecurity measures were strengthened at Australian airports. Detector dogs are operating at Darwin and Cairns airports and biosecurity officers are boarding flights from Indonesia to do checks of travellers arriving from Indonesia. – with AAP NSW flood relief payments being fast-tracked: PM The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is emphasising the payments are being fast-tracked to prioritise support for victims over auditing the process. However, both he and the premier are imploring people to only apply if they are eligible: The costs so far to the commonwealth has been $514m , so this joint funding is separate from that as well. I make this point – we’re making the payments. We’re not holding them up in order to audit in advance. But we will be auditing in retrospect as well. So only people who are eligible for these payments should apply for these payments, but we didn’t want to be in a circumstance whereby people were not able to receive support because some of these people have lost everything. So the idea that you can go through and check every application before payments are made would have had a severe impact on people and would have added to the trauma which people are experiencing. Perrottet has affirmed the audit will be performed in due course and any false claims will be identified: Whether it’s through Covid payments or disaster payments, there are always people who fraudulently put registrations and applications in who are not eligible and that is disgraceful. If you do that, we will catch you out ... But from a state and Commonwealth perspective, it is most important right now that we provide that assistance as quickly as possible to those who need it and, as the Prime Minister has said, significant audits will be in place following this period. Further flood support details NSW treasurer, Matt Kean, is providing more details on what the additional funding will go towards: Today, we’re announcing significant financial assistance for those impacted by these recent floods and it’s a joint initiative with the commonwealth government. This includes grants to councils that will help with things like urgent repairs to infrastructure and helping them employ additional people to help with the flood recovery. In addition to that, we’ve committed funding for the clean-up, primary producer and small business grants and boots on the ground to assess... the recovery process. We’re at the start of the recovery and our two governments will make the necessary financial commitments to get these communities back on their feet as soon as possible. Flood support extended to eight further LGAs Murray Watt, the federal minister for emergency management, has announced an additional eight local government areas will receive support. We’re also pleased to announce today that we’ve extended that support to a further eight local government areas in addition to the 29 that had been previously announced. So there’s now a total of 37. The extra eight LGAs are Cumberland, mid-Coast, Muswellbrook, Nambucca, Newcastle, Port Stephens, Randwick and Warren, a total of 37 LGAs around New South Wales that will be eligible for those payments and they will also be eligible for the payments that have been announced by the Prime Minister and the Premier today. Perrottet pledges grants, $1m of flood support per council NSW Premier Dominic Perrottet says the additional supports will be available by the end of the week: The assistance that we’re announcing today ... will be available for registration by the end of the week through Service New South Wales for the business grant of up to $50,000. The primary producer grant, through the rural assistance authority of up to $75,000. With regards the council grants: This financial support today of $1m per council impacted is in addition to that financial support that we have provided in the past and we’ll continue to work with our local government areas right across the state to ensure they have the financial support they need to get their communities back on track as quickly as possible. Prime minister Anthony Albanese is announcing additional funding to support flood victims in NSW to help get people’s lives “back on track.” Clean-up immediate assistance and an initial estimated cost of $80m with an estimated commonwealth contribution of half that amount. Primary producer recovery grants of up to $75,000 at an additional estimated cost of $55m with an estimated commonwealth contribution of half that. Small businesses and nonprofit organisation recovery grants of up to $50,000 with half of the amount coming to a cost of $27m, shared between the commonwealth and New South Wales. At-flood property assessment program at an estimated initial cost of some $36m. We’ll also be providing $1m grants to each council in the 37 disaster-related declared LGAs to assist with their immediate social built economic and environmental needs. Push to replace gas with renewables amidst war in Ukraine at Sydney Energy Forum Answering a question from the audience on whether a need to reduce dependence on Russian gas amid war in Ukraine increases a need for greater investment in gas from other countries at the Sydney Energy Forum today, Dr Fatih Birol, executive director of International Energy Agency says: I put a big question mark on if those investments will be profitable. “We have to bring gas, oil demand down,” he said, pointing to a plethora of possible alternatives. We can replace gas with renewables, with nuclear power, with energy efficiency. There are already available gas reservoirs ... We can increase production from there. There is a huge amount of methane emissions today escaping many countries around the world exporting gas ... If we catch this methane, we can help to replace Russian gas. For the latest in Australian politics join Poll the Position webinar at 1pm Guardian’s Essential poll shows the prime minister Anthony Albanese’s approval is wavering as the honeymoon period fades. You can find out more about what the latest poll shows by joining Guardian’s political editor Katherine Murphy and Peter Lewis at the the live version at 1PM today following the below link. Asian Development Bank president addresses Sydney Energy Forum Masatsugu Asakawa, Asian Development Bank president, said “we all need to pick up the scale and pace of energy transition” at the Sydney Energy Forum today. My friends, we know transformation [to clean energy grid] is far from complete. The world needs to decarbonise. Asia and the Pacific are responsible for more than 50% of global greenhouse emissions. And it impacts small nations and the most vulnerable population. Asakawa points to a need for “collective action” on innovative solutions to “turn the tide”, urging leaders to “invest to get us on the path to a net zero future”. “In the role of new technologies ... access will be the key.” The transition to clean and efficient energy is fully compatible with robust economic growth. Minister defied advice on mask mandate Mary-Anne Thomas, the Victorian health minister, reveals she went against health advice not mandating masks indoors for several settings. The federal health minister, Mark Butler, has revealed the federal program providing 10 free rapid antigen tests every three months for concession card holders will end in July. Butler was speaking to 3AW Radio about the covid crisis in Australia, confirming that 300 Australians are “losing their life every single week”, with new data suggesting “Covid is the largest killer of Australians this year, overtaking coronary disease”. Asked if the free RATs could be extended beyond July, Butler said: No, I think that expiry is about the right time. [Early in 2022] we had a very ferocious debate at a time rapid tests were very hard to get ... The price has come down dramatically, the cost was averaging $24-$25 per test in January, they’re now down to about $8 a test. Pensioners and concession card holders can still get their allocation of up to 10 before the end of the month, and that can carry them through for a period of time. There are so many RATs out in the community, many state governments provide free access ... and they’re available if you live in an aged care facility. The problem we were facing is largely resolved. Butler said Australia is “going through a difficult period” and if employers feel they are able to continue their operations with employees working from home, they should heed the chief health officer’s advice to consider allowing staff to do so. Butler asked Australians “if you’re in indoor spaces, particularly crowded ones where you can’t socially distance, think about putting mask on,” signalling he may start wearing them to press conferences again. Asked why the government isn’t doing more, Butler said: We’re deep into the third year of the pandemic. There is a level of fatigue that governments and health authorities need to reflect when putting in measurers to deal with this third wave. We’ve tried to bring new energy about the importance of getting the third vaccine dose. Interest rate hikes dent consumer confidence Consumer confidence has fallen for the second week in a row, particularly for mortgage holders being hit by higher interest rates. The weekly ANZ-Roy Morgan Australian Consumer Confidence Rating saw a drop of 2.5% to 81.6, well under the last three decade’s monthly average of 112.4. Consumer confidence for those paying off a mortgage was down by a “sharp” 5.4%, the survey found. Since talk of rate hikes began in late April, consumer confidence among mortgage holders has fallen 25%, while confidence among renters is down 4%. CBA’s chief economist, Stephen Halmarick, says expected interest rate increases are likely “to see discretionary spending weaken further in coming months”. – with AAP Fog alert! Foggy conditions in Adelaide where a road weather alert has been issued by the SA state emergency service. More updates from the Sydney Energy Forum Ms Jennifer Granholm, US Secretary of Energy, says US President Joe Biden is “very enthused” about building out the clean energy transition at today’s Sydney Energy Forum: We want a modern grid with an expanded capacity. It is not just the flipping of a switch. It’s a period of time ... We want to plan responsible, with a sense of urgency. Granholm points to change being needed in the fossil fuel industry: “There is a moment for all of us to call upon diversification of fossil companies ... to become energy companies, and not just fossil energy companies,” she says, urging a move to clean energy sources, “whether it is hydrogen, or geothermal”. Clean energy development is: truly about energy security and energy independence as nations. We cannot be under the thumb of those who don’t share our values ... or under the thumb of those who [want to] control our supply chain. Climate is No 1 national security, economic challenge of region: Wong Conroy said development assistance doesn’t come “with strings attached” in reference to Pacific Island nations’ relationships with China: To demonstrate the conviction... only yesterday we announced an additional $2m of assistance to Kiribati to assist with their crippling drought, that is on top of the $600,000 we announced a couple of weeks ago. It is very important that aid is unconditional like that. Wong was asked if climate change has been overshadowed as the biggest threat facing the region and whether it will still be the centre of discussions at the forum this week. She has affirmed it remains the biggest threat the regions faces: I can only say this, that climate is central in the statements of many leaders passed, it is the number one national security, economic challenge that the region faces. Obviously, people have spoken about climate and spoken about strategic competition and have spoken about Covid and the path of recovery where there are real challenges for the Pacific. We know that there is a risk that we had a discussion today about a lower development path, what they call economic scarring as a result of Covid. This is not a region that can afford that we need to work with them to try to about that. Conroy, Wong defend Australia’s emissions target The media conference is asking Wong and Pat Conroy, the minister for international development, about the adequacy of Australia’s climate stance. Conroy says it’s credible for Australia to host a COP forum when its emissions target is one of the highest in the developed world. Wong says the 43% target is “quite a substantial target” and says coal mines “will be dealt with in accordance with Australian law”: I would make the point that the target that we are proposing would see Australia adding 2% renewable energy for our domestic market by 2030. Wong says she hasn’t been asked at the forum whether Australia would not allow any more coal reserves of gas most to be utilised. Penny Wong has emphasised the importance the forum remain united, in light of the withdrawal of Kiribati from the forum: I had a very good discussion today with the secretary of FSM and we spoke about the lived experience of the Micronesian states to climate change. And, as you know, that was one of the key aspects of Prime Minister Albanese’s election campaign. I’d like to make a comment about the unity of the forum, which has obviously been a big discussion over these last week. The region is stronger together. It’s a simple proposition. The region is stronger together. And in the bilateral they have had, in the discussions I have had in my previous visits in the dialogue today, leaders talked about the challenges the region faces, climate change, Covid, and recovery from Covid, both of which have fallen harder on this region and on many other parts of the world and, of course, strategic competition. And all the nations of this region are seeking to navigate those challenges. ...and we do it best when we do it together. That is the approach Australia has taken. That is the approach the Pacific Islands Forum has taken and that is why Pacific for immunity is so important. As you know, There have been a lot of discussions about Pacific Islands Forum unity and the position the Australian government has consistently taken is we were seeking to support whatever the consensus could deliver, because the most important thing was to ensure that at this time, in a contestable, in a world confronting climate, Covid, and economic recovery from Covid, that the forum remain united. ‘We are here to listen’: Penny Wong in Suva Penny Wong, the minister for foreign affairs, is giving a press conference from Suva where she is attending the Pacific Islands Forum. I said today at the leaders forum dialogue that we are here to listen and learn. It is obviously my first forum and it was a very important to listen to the contributions from the various perspectives of presidents and prime ministers around the table and they gained a lot from that. As they have said previously, the Australian government, the new Australian government is committed to bringing new energy and new resources to the Pacific and we recognise, in particular, the importance of climate change. China’s monopoly on solar under spotlight at forum Reporter Rafqa Touma here with some updates from today’s Sydney Energy Forum, where leaders in government and industry from around the world are gathering to discuss clean energy supply, sustainability and security in the Indo-Pacific region. Dr Fatih Birol, Executive Director of International Energy Agency, urges that leaders “need to think about” China’s monopoly on solar energy manufacturing “from an energy security perspective” at the Sydney Energy Forum today: Of all the manufacturing capacity around the world ... about 80% of the global supply chain manufacturing comes from one single country – China. China did excellently within the last 15 years to bring the cost of solar down, providing multiple benefits around the world. But at the same time, today, 80% ... is a big number. Every country “relying on technology from one single country ... is something we all need to think about from an energy security perspective”. Victoria has joined NSW in reducing the state’s Covid reinfection period to four weeks, as the state government recommends people wear masks indoors and in crowded public places. It follows similar moves by the WA and ACT governments yesterday in line with advice from the the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee. The previous Covid reinfection period – when people are exempt from testing and isolating – was 12 weeks. The Victorian government has also requested employers consider working-from-home arrangements, noting there has been a 53% increase in the number of Victorians in hospital with Covid over the past two weeks. All smiles in Suva Guardian Australia’s Pacific editor, Kate Lyons, is currently in Suva covering the Pacific Islands Forum. This morning, she was there for a warm greeting between Jacinda Ardern, the prime minster of New Zealand, and Penny Wong, Australia’s minister for foreign affairs. Flood toll on NSW roads emerges NSW roads are significantly damaged by last week’s floods, as this image from Wiseman’s Ferry shows. The state’s Rural Fire Service has reminded Australians the unknown condition of the roads is another reason why it’s unsafe to cross flood waters. ‘I am very uncomfortable with this voice’: Abbott on Indigenous voice to parliament The former Liberal prime minister, Tony Abbott, also shared his views on the Indigenous voice to parliament, which Labor wants to hold a referendum on as soon as 2023. Abbott told Radio National: Let me say I think the opposition is right in the first instance to demand all the detail from the government. Personally, I am very uncomfortable with this voice, with what Malcolm Turnbull called a third chamber of parliament. I’m uncomfortable electing a body determined by race. When Abbott was pulled up on the fact the voice is not a third chamber of parliament he said he was merely “citing what my successor said” – which isn’t a great way to engage in public discourse, happily repeating a misrepresentation as long as someone else said it first. Abbott continued: You can’t ask the people for a blank cheque on something as significant as this. If asked to vote on an unspecified voice, the natural response will be to say, ‘If you don’t know, vote no.’ The last thing we want is a referendum designed to forward reconciliation defeated and inevitably that puts reconciliation back. The most likely referendum proposal is to include an enabling provision in the constitution, specifying that parliament will legislate the design of the voice. Not necessarily a blank cheque, depending on how much detail is released about the design of the body to be legislated. There were 10,627 new cases in the last reporting period, and 39 people are in intensive care. ‘Finding common ground’: Albanese on nations working together Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has begun his opening address at the Sydney Energy Forum, emphasising the need for nations to work together towards a common good: The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed vulnerabilities and laid bare challenges that we simply cannot ignore. There are many lessons that we will all take from this experience, but one of the most critical ones for me is that we are stronger when we work together. We are, for all of our differences, one common human family and we all call this one fragile planet our home. When we pause and reflect on this, we recognise our connection to one another. We recognise that we have a common stake in each other and that the best way to meet the challenges in front of us is by finding common ground. That is what this forum is about – finding common ground. And that’s the message I’m carrying with me today, a message underscored by your presence here today. The diversity and unity of purpose in this room makes it very clear – all of you coming together from across sectors and nations because you understand that our future is linked. All of us here know what needs to be done. The nature of the challenge and the science is not in question. Its urgency and scope is clear. The question is our ability, but importantly as well our appetite to seize the opportunities that it contains and to shape them in our common interests. As Prime Minister, I’m committed to renewing Australia’s standing in our region. Reporter Rafqa Touma will be bringing you more updates about Albanese’s address here on the blog but you can also read political editor Katherine Murphy’s preview. There were 10,806 new cases in the last reporting period, and 58 people are in intensive care. The Australian Medical Association (AMA) and Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) are calling on the health minister, Mark Butler, to reverse the decision to let the telehealth items lapse amidst the latest Covid-19 outbreak. The bodies want to meet with Butler to discuss the reinstatement of Covid-19 telehealth items cancelled on 1 July. Dr Omar Khorshid, the AMA president, said: These changes undermine the ability of patients to access their doctors, and in particular for GPs to prescribe antivirals for Covid-positive patients and will lead to costs elsewhere in the health system, including in overstretched hospitals. Khorshid said the item for telephone consults longer that 20 minutes with a GP – a key part of the government’s “Living with Covid” strategy – was critical and must be restored: Prescribing antivirals is time consuming, requiring a GP to consider complex eligibility requirements, contraindications and drug interactions and then arrange for patients to obtain the medication while isolating. Even simple cases take thirty minutes to an hour to properly complete. Professor Karen Price, the president of RACGP, said given the growing number of COVID-19 cases and the unknown impacts of long COVID going forward, enabling access to longer telephone consultations was vital: GPs have told the RACGP the removal of Medicare patient rebates for longer phone consultations has reduced access to care and increased health gaps for vulnerable patients. This includes rural communities, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, older people, people with disability and mental health concerns, many of whom already have poorer health outcomes than the general population,” Price said. The former Liberal prime minister, Tony Abbott, has praised the Albanese government’s handling of the Pacific step-up, even implicitly criticising the Morrison government for being focused on the election instead of China’s ambitions in the region. Abbott told Radio National: I think it would be very serious if China were to establish a string of military bases in the South Pacific. It’s obvious that’s China and the Beijing regime’s intention. It’s important Australia do everything it can to ensure the people of Pacific understand their peril, not just ours. Because the Beijing regime may come to these countries all smiles, but Beijing is out for Beijing’s interests, not anybody else’s. Asked if the new government had been more active than Morrison’s, Abbott replied: I certainly applaud the fact Penny Wong went to Solomon Islands almost immediately, and the prime minister is going to the Pacific Islands Forum. The new government is being absolutely active in the Pacific as it should be – good on them. I don’t have the slightest criticism [of them]. Asked if it was a mistake for former foreign minister, Marise Payne, not to immediately go to Solomon Islands after it announced a draft security pact with China, he said: That’s dirty water under the bridge. I suppose at the time we were on the verge of an election campaign, and people were a bit focused elsewhere. The new government got straight down to business, good on them for that. Government to outline plans on responsible lending laws Stephen Jones, the assistant treasurer and minister for financial services, will address the Responsible Lending Summit this morning and outline the government’s plans on responsible lending laws, including buy-now-pay-later and pay day lending. The Buy-Now-Pay-Later sector currently doesn’t have the same regulations as banks do when they provide loans. If you want to hear more about the issues in the sector ahead of Jones’ address, senior business reporter Ben Butler wrote this article when Jones first announced plans for regulation. New Omicron subvariants becoming dominant in Australia Paul Kelly, the country’s chief medical officer, is on ABC and says the latest Covid-19 subvariants BA4 and 5 are becoming the dominant variant in Australia: We have seen a rise in this new variant of Omicron, so it is still the COVID-19 virus, the SARS-CoV-2 virus, it is just a different – slight differences in the way that that virus looks and how our immune system looks at it. We do know that this new variant has caused waves in other countries and is now becoming the dominant variant in Australia. We have no suggestion at the moment that it causes for severe disease but it escapes our immune system, whether that is due to previous infection or vaccination. We do expect that these new variants will cause a rise in cases and probably hospitalisations in the coming weeks. Kelly has reiterated the importance of third and fourth vaccine doses. Asked about the difference that reducing the reinfection period makes, Kelly says that the decisions are based on evidence as the new variants are more infectious: The new BA4 and BA5 are more infectious and there is strong evidence that you can get reinfected earlier than what was previously the case. It is important that anyone who develops symptoms again 28 or more days after they have had a previous COVID-19 infection, to get tested and to take the appropriate arrangements in terms of isolation. A new campaign has launched today to tackle racism by the Australian Human Rights Commission. Chin Tan, the race discrimination commissioner, was on ABC Radio this morning discussing the campaign he says calls on all Australians to reflect on the causes and impacts of racism, not only on its victims but Australia’s collective wellbeing as a society. Tan said the government hasn’t funded the campaign itself but its framework. Tan said the funding for the campaign had come from the corporate and private sector. Sarah Collard, Guardian Australia’s Indigenous affairs reporter, has more on how the campaign was partly funded by a disaffected former Collingwood football club sponsor. Cronulla beach washed away by rowdy surf The dangerous surf conditions along the NSW coast is causing massive erosion on Sydney’s Cronulla beach. The North Cronulla lifeguard tower even had to be lifted out of reach of the dangerous surf via crane last night. The St George and Sutherland Shire Leader is reporting that “the tower had been perilously close to falling into the ocean after being undermined by another big swell on the weekend.” The Leader said that the Sutherland Shire Council ordered its removal early on Monday with the main section lifted off after 8pm. Mayor of the Sutherland Shire Council, Carmelo Pesce, told the Leader a new seawall at North Cronulla beach was provided for in a draft plan of management, which had recently been finalised and the council was also seeking state government assistance to repair beaches.

We have seen a rise in the number of scam texts that are occurring. These are predominantly run by criminals who are sophisticated. Some of them in Australia, many overseas, but the technology needs to keep up with that in order to keep Australians safe. Rowland is asked about the scepticism Andy Penn, the CEO of Telstra, has expressed that the new rules can actually deliver for consumers because of the difficulty stopping scam messages. She said the technology has become more sophisticated to enable these scam texts to be identified: We know for a fact as the evidence shows, in just over a year since we have had obligations in place about scam calls, we have had some half a billion scam calls being blocked. Will this mean that every scam call, every scam text and every scam email will no longer reach innocent Australian consumers? The honest answer is no. But we can make it better and we can ensure that there is consistency across the industry so that consumers have confidence that no matter who their provider is. Abbott pays tribute to Abe Tony Abbott is on ABC Radio paying tribute to Japan’s former prime minister Shinzo Abe – “the best friend Australia has ever had from Japan”. Abbott said Abe’s designing the Quad is “the reason India is there”, which might not have been the case had it been designed by the US. He said he didn’t believe the criticisms of Abe as a WW2 revisionist are valid. History shouldn’t be used a stick ... that’s what China has tended to do with Japan. Abbott is asked about the whether the new government should be given credit for the step-up in the Pacific. He said the new government was “being absolutely active in the Pacific as it should be. Good on them.” Asked whether it was a mistake not to send Marise Paine under the coalition government, Abbott said: “That’s dirty water under the bridge.” Asked whether the opposition should support a yes vote in referendum on Uluru Statement of the Heart, Abbott reinforced he did not support an Aboriginal voice in parliament and said the opposition was right to ask for more detail. ‘They need to get their story straight’ Jim Chalmers is asked about Sussan Ley’s calls to cancel the jobs and skills summit and Angus Taylor’s call for a seat at the table: They need to get their story straight. Asked about whether independents will be invited, Chalmers said the invitation list hasn’t been finalised: A hundred people sounds like a lot of people until you see who’s in the first list and who might not be. Even for the people who aren’t in the 100, we will find ways to consult with them in meaningful ways, including all parts of the parliament. When it comes to invitations for the opposition, Chalmers says: We will consider people who want to be there on their merits. Let’s see if the opposition is actually serious. I think what you just quoted from yesterday, where one person was saying it should be cancelled, another person was insisting on being invited. Let’s see if they’re serious first. I mean, they have had to bring people together in the way that we hope to bring people together. They didn’t do that. The big reason why we’ve had this waste a decade of missed opportunities in the economy, whether its energy policy chaos, or not enough Australians trained for key roles. We need to see if they’re serious, they haven’t shown so far that they are. Chalmers on a ‘wasted decade’ Treasurer Jim Chalmers is on ABC Radio discussing the jobs and skills summit he and the prime minister announced yesterday which will take place in September: There are a whole range of issues here which have combined to create what I think has been a wasted decade of missed opportunities in the economy. Too much division, too much looking for the things which divide us rather than a common ground. There’s more common ground in these areas than people realise. Asked about the calls from business to include a temporary two-year increase in skilled migration to increase it to 200,000 places a year, Chalmers says migration shouldn’t be considered the only solution when it comes to the challenges facing the workforce: We’ve had a quite unusual period when it comes to migration and as we emerge from it, we should work together to get the settings right but what I want to make sure we don’t see this as the one lever that you would pull to solve our issues and inflation and wages and labor shortages and skill shortages. We can get migration right without seeing it as a substitute for doing all of the other things in the economy, which will get that wages growth and fill these skills shortages and deliver the right kind of prosperity that we want to see into the future. ‘The Pacific is the part of the world where the US rightly looks to Australia to lead’ Australia’s defence minister, Richard Marles, has warned of the use of “force or coercion” in the South China Sea and “intensification of major power competition” – references to China’s rising power in the Indo-Pacific. Marles made the comments in a speech to the Center for Strategic and International Studies on his visit to the US, committing Australia to closer cooperation with the US, higher defence spending and to address climate change in part as a national security issue: All of us here today understand the challenges we face: a military build-up occurring at a rate unseen since world war two; the development and deployment of new weapons that challenge our military capability edge; expanding cyber and grey zone capabilities which blur the line between peace and conflict; and the intensification of major power competition in ways that both concentrate and transcend geographic confines. These trends compel an even greater Australian focus on the Indo-Pacific. For the first time in decades we are thinking hard about the security of our strategic geography, the viability of our trade and supply routes, and above all the preservation of an inclusive regional order founded on rules agreed by all, not the coercive capabilities of a few. In particular we worry about use of force or coercion to advance territorial claims, as is occurring in the South China Sea, and its implications for the any number of places in the Indo-Pacific where borders or sovereignty is disputed. On Australia’s relationship with the Pacific, where Australia is racing to persuade nations not to follow Solomon Islands’ lead in signing a security pact with China, Marles said: The Pacific is where Australia must invest in effective regionalism by reinforcing the Pacific Islands Forum and other regional institutions that are so key to regional resilience and agency. We must do this not only because of our unique connections to the Pacific but because Pacific security so directly impacts on our own security. Given this reality, the Pacific is the part of the world where the United States rightly looks to Australia to lead. And we will. We will not take our status for granted. Pacific Island countries have choices about their partners. And we will work to earn their trust. The Pacific has been clear in saying that geopolitical competition is of lesser concern to them than the threat of rising sea levels, economic insecurity and transnational crime. Australia respects and understands this position. And we are listening. And while we will not ask our partners to pick a side, I am confident that an Australia which collaborates and invests in shared priorities with the Pacific is an Australia which will be the natural partner of choice for the Pacific. SMS scam protections Australians will be better protected from text message scams as new regulations for telecommunications companies come into effect today. The code, registered by the Australian Communications and Media Authority (Acma) today, will require the companies to trace, identify and block SMS scam messages, and publish information for customers on how to identify and report scams. Mobile phone companies could face up to $250,000 in fines for failing to comply with the new code. Reporter Josh Taylor has more: NSW Health today announced that – effective immediately – the Covid reinfection period is now four weeks, down from 12. It follows similar moves by the WA and ACT governments yesterday, in line with advice from the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee. Tasmania had already changed its reinfection period on Friday last week. Anyone in the state experiencing Covid symptoms from 28 days after their isolation ends is now required to test for the virus. In a statement, the chief health officer, Kerry Chant, said the new advice was due to the Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants “circulating widely in NSW”: They are more able to evade immunity gained from previous infection and vaccination reinfection is more likely and possible just weeks after a prior infection. This post was amended on 12 July to add the date Tasmania changed the reinfection period. Prime minister Anthony Albanese is due to make the opening speech at the Sydney Energy Forum today. He will tell the forum Australia has rejoined the ranks of “trusted global partners” on climate action. He’ll be making the speech before travelling to the Pacific Islands Forum in Fiji, where leaders are set to meet later in the week. Covid-19 hospitalisations are surging in Australia from the winter Omicron wave, with pressures on hospitals leading to some elective surgeries being cancelled and paramedics overwhelmed. In NSW the Covid reinfection period has been reduced to four weeks down from 12 weeks previously, from today. The first monkeypox case has been detected in Queensland. The state’s authorities say the public health risk is “very low” but it comes after community transmission was found in NSW last week.

Here’s what happened today: Cardinal George Pell, the former Catholic archbishop of Melbourne and of Sydney, died in Vatican City aged 81. There was reaction to the death across the country, with some honouring Pell and others remembering the controversy that surrounded him. A bipartisan coalition of members of Congress has written to the US president, Joe Biden, expressing its support for the Aukus deal. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, announced new funding being brought forward for the Rocky Ring Road despite the project being stalled under the previous government. The New South Wales anti-corruption watchdog said it is now unlikely to finalise its probe into the former premier Gladys Berejiklian before the March election. The climate change minister, Chris Bowen, said the $600m decarbonisation fund for big business is in the national interest. A “massive” disaster relief operation is in full swing in the Fitzroy River catchment area, where many people remain isolated by flood waters and damaged roads. Sun Cable, the company aiming to supply Darwin and Singapore with electricity from a giant solar farm in the Northern Territory, was placed into voluntary administration. Residents near Menindee warned to avoid mosquito bites due to Murray Valley encephalitis fears Authorities in NSW are urging residents near Menindee to be wary of mosquitoes and of Murray Valley encephalitis (MVE), a virus that can spread from mosquitoes to humans. MVE virus is spread by mosquitos from infected animals to humans. Rarely it causes severe neurological illness with headache, convulsions and reduced consciousness in some cases. The virus cannot be transmitted between humans, and people cannot get the virus by touching an infected animal or eating animal products. In a statement the executive director of Health Protection NSW, Dr Richard Broome, urges people to avoid mosquito bites and says that MVE only causes symptoms in a minority of people: Only a small proportion of people infected with the virus will experience symptoms, which include fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, diarrhoea, and muscle aches. Among those who get a severe infection, some may die or have lifelong neurological complications. There is no vaccination or specific treatment for MVE and the best way to avoid infection is to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes, which are most active between dusk and dawn. Avoiding mosquito bites will also protect against other mosquito-borne infections including Japanese encephalitis, Ross River fever and Barmah Forest virus. Coalition welcomes US bipartisan show of support for Aukus The federal opposition has welcomed a move by members of the US House of Representatives to declare their strong support for Aukus. The supportive letter to the US president, Joe Biden, was signed by nine US House of Representatives members from both parties, including the Democratic representative Joe Courtney who led the effort. The letter says the US will gain from providing “our closest ally with an undersea capability to better posture itself in the region”. Courtney’s grouping says while it is essential for the US to stick to its own plan to build a minimum of two submarines a year to meet American requirements, “we are supportive of expanding the industrial base to meet Aukus expectations”. That could include the US providing or building new submarines for Australia before domestic construction is ready. The Coalition’s defence spokesperson, Andrew Hastie, said the opposition “welcomes the bipartisan support and commitment of the US Congress for Aukus”. In a statement issued this afternoon, Hastie said: The Coalition, which alongside our US and UK partners formed the historic security pact in 2021, recognises that delivering future capability, including Australia’s first nuclear submarine, will require a significant step up from industry and government. Production lines must be scaled up to get boats in the water as quickly as possible – whether it be to support ‘off the shelf’ options or to domestically produce nuclear powered submarines. Or both concurrently. We know that Aukus is a nation building opportunity for Australia and call on the Albanese Government to do whatever is necessary to drive contribution in a timely manner. The Opposition remains committed to supporting the shared vision of Aukus to secure Australia’s national interests. Key decisions are due in March. Anthony Albanese has spoken to ABC Queensland about his trip to Papua New Guinea. He said: I will have the great honour tomorrow morning of being the first foreign leader to ever address the parliament of Papua New Guinea [and] Thursday the 12th of January isn’t normally when the parliament would be sitting. So the PNG government of Prime Minister [James] Marape, are giving Australia, a great honour, in all of the MPs being brought together for this address and then we’ll have our PNG-Australia annual leaders dialogue take place after that. Minister Pat Conroy who has responsibility for the Pacific is coming with me as well as Senator Nita Green, who’s the local senator based here in Cairns will be traveling, as well as senior members of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. This will be important. There’s no more near neighbour with such a strong history as Papua New Guinea in the links with Australia, of course, and next year, we will commemorate the 50-year anniversary of independence for PNG ... The economic relationship and economic development there is critical. National security – we will be talking about our enhanced security arrangements and cooperation there, which is critical as our near neighbour to the north. But also, our common interest in acting on climate change and will be having a discussion as well about advancing the vision that Prime Minister Marape has to have a rugby league team based in PNG, made up of people from PNG, the Pacific Islands and around the region. And that is something that, of course, those links are so important that we have those cultural links and our common interest, and one of our common interests is, of course, passion for rugby league. Bushwalker spots three men in the water off Sydney sparking rescue Three men whose boat capsized in rough seas off Sydney have been rescued thanks to a bushwalker’s keen eye, AAP reports. The walker saw the men in the water near Wedding Cake Rock in Sydney’s south today and called for help, sparking a rescue involving three helicopters. The men had been in the water for about an hour before being spotted, the NSW ambulance Inspector Andrew Bibby said. “All agencies worked well together to coordinate the rescue, with the men winched from the water and taken to NSW ambulance paramedics to be assessed,” Bibby said. The men were treated for hypothermia at Wattamolla beach before being taken to Sutherland hospital in a stable condition. Bibby said the use of life jackets was key in preventing a more serious outcome. “This is a timely reminder to anyone heading out on the water to be prepared,” he said. Marine Rescue NSW said boaters should ensure to bring an emergency beacon, called an Epirb, when heading out on the water, particularly more than two nautical miles. The beacon emits a continuous radio signal when activated, alerting search and rescue services. A spokeswoman for NSW police confirmed the overturned boat has been safely towed to shore. We’re getting a bit more clarity over what happened between billionaire investors in Sun Cable, Mike Cannon-Brookes and Andrew “Twiggy” Forrest. So, Grok, which is MCB’s family firm, points to one investor standing in the way of the company. Forrest isn’t named, but he’s the one they have in mind. “In the circumstances, including where all but one shareholder agreed with the company’s funding strategy – the Board was left with no other option, but to enter into voluntary administration,” the Grok spokesperson says. Grok remains “a strong supporter of Sun Cable delivering the world’s largest solar energy infrastructure network and the Australia-Asia Power Link (AAPowerLink)”, the spokesperson said, adding they are confident the firm “will be an attractive investment proposition and remain at the forefront of Australia’s energy transition”. The “circumstances”, so Guardian Australia has been told, involve the need for emergency funding in the order of $60m that investors had to decide on just before Christmas. Forrest had his view and MCB had a different one. Why the company needed the funds, having raised $210m last March, seems to hinge on how fast Sun Cable was “burning” through the cash. Management was – according to one source – also failing to meet its agreed goals, with Indonesian agreements being one source of angst. MCB’s Grok reckons Sun Cable “has made tremendous progress” over the AAPowerLink in the past few years and sees voluntary administration as providing the best opportunity for it to access “appropriate funding sources”. Those sources could yet include money from Twiggy Forrest, but that would seem unlikely unless the board and management changed, and that includes turfing out MCB who is Sun Cable’s chair. Moral of the story? As the African parable goes, “when two elephants fight, the grass suffers. When elephants make love, the grass also suffers”. One elephant per pasture, then, might be the way to go. Scott Morrison loses Twitter blue tick status In another loss, the former prime minister Scott Morrison has been stripped of his blue Twitter verification tick. It comes after the Twitter CEO, Elon Musk, introduced a paid verification program, and after Twitter Support said (in a tweet, of course) that verified accounts that change their display name or profile photo will lose their check until their account can be reviewed. Morrison’s Facebook and Instagram accounts are still verified though, and also more active than his Twitter. His last tweet was a link to an explainer on how to vote for the Liberal party on election day: Ten-year-old boy critical but stable after Gold Coast helicopter crash Sydney boy Nicholas Tadros is in a critical but stable condition a day after he was due for surgery following the helicopter crash that killed his mother and three others on the Gold Coast, AAP reports. The 10-year-old is one of three survivors who were in a helicopter that collided with another chopper and crashed into a sandbar near Sea World on 2 January. Four people died including Nicholas’s mother, Vanessa Tadros, 36, Britons Ron and Diane Hughes, 65 and 57, and the 40-year-old pilot Ashley Jenkinson. Nicholas’s lungs were flooded with aviation fuel but their capacity has improved over the past few days and he was transferred on the weekend to Queensland Children’s hospital for an operation on Tuesday. His father, Simon Tadros, told friends it would be a “major test” with five surgeries for broken bones in his left hand and both legs, which are broken in multiple places. Nicholas’s condition has been “critical” since the crash, but he appeared to have slightly improved as of Wednesday. “Nicholas Tadros is in a critical but stable condition,” a hospital spokesperson said. Simon Tadros’s friend Charlie Bakhos invited people to pray a special rosary for Nicholas at St Charbel’s Monastery Punchbowl, in south-west Sydney, on Wednesday night. “For his recovery and to give his family strength during this time,” he wrote on Facebook on Wednesday. “Everyone is welcome.” The nine-year-old Victorian boy Leon de Silva, who was in the same helicopter as Nicholas, is in a stable condition at the hospital after suffering a brain injury in the accident. Leon’s mother, Winnie, 33, is also stable in a Gold Coast hospital after undergoing another operation for her injuries that include two broken legs, a damaged left knee, a broken right shoulder and a broken collarbone. The Catholic archbishop of Sydney, Anthony Fisher, has remembered Cardinal George Pell as “a fine priest” and “a good Christian soul”. In a statement, Fisher says Pell “lived up” to his own episcopal motto, “Be Not Afraid”, and that he had seen Pell last week for the funeral of Pope Benedict, where Pell was “in good spirits”. Fisher also adds that the archdiocese of Sydney “thrived” under Pell’s leadership and that Pell worked for “openness in Church affairs”: The Archdiocese of Sydney thrived under his leadership. He saw great promise in youth, and his vision in bringing World Youth Day 2008 to Sydney saw a whole generation of young Catholics respond to Christ’s call. Our community as a whole was uplifted by this colossal event and moved by the testimony it offered. His Eminence was an author of books and a regular newspaper columnist, a lecturer and leader in Catholic education, and a scholar in his own right. He served the broader Church as a member of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, the Vox Clara Commission, the Pontifical Council for the Family and the Congregation of Bishops. As Prefect for the Secretariat of the Economy, member of Pope Francis’ Council of Cardinal Advisors and one of the highest-ranking church officials in the world, the Cardinal’s work for openness in Church affairs was hugely important. His final years were marked by his wrongful conviction and imprisonment, but he bore this with grace and goodwill and gave us all an example of how to accept suffering with dignity and peace. His words of reconciliation with his detractors and concern for survivors increased in authenticity as he steadfastly and successfully maintained his innocence. The Bureau of Meteorology has issued severe thunderstorm warnings for central Queensland: Retailers call on government to help fix ‘chronic labour shortages’ Following on from the release of labour numbers from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, Australia’s peak retail body, the Australian Retailers Association, is urging the government to introduce measures to alleviate “chronic labour shortages”. In a statement, the ARA said the data released today showed the scale of the crisis, showing 49,900 vacancies across the retail sector in November 2022 – an increase of 8.2% compared to August 2022. The association’s CEO, Paul Zahra, has urged state and federal governments to intervene: Retail businesses are at the coalface of Australia’s economy and our daily lives, yet they can’t secure enough staff. The Government has made great strides in this space, increasing the cap on migration, improving support for women in the workforce and introducing the Work Bonus for pensioners – but it’s clear from today’s data that further work is urgently needed. These shortages were exacerbated during the frenetic Christmas trading period, the most critical time of the year for retail. And the strain of labour shortages is far reaching. You end up with staff who can find themselves overworked and burnt out, and shoppers languishing in longer queues. With longer waiting times, shoppers become impatient and the risk of antisocial behaviour increases. A 10-strong Australian team has just completed a 1,200km traverse across Antarctica, reaching a site where they hope to drill a core of ice at least one million years old. Tractors set off from Casey station – 3,880km south of Perth – on 23 December, dragging heavy-duty sleds, snow groomers, accommodation vans, science labs and tents. After passing a European ice core team carrying out a simultaneous mission, the Australian team arrived at its selected drill site at Little Dome C in the last few hours. The Antarctic traverse is the furthest inland for the Australian program since 1962. “We made it,” tweeted the glaciologist and cryosphere modeller Dr Lenneke Jong. The aim of the Australian Antarctic Program’s Million Year Ice mission is to drill down 3km and extract a core of ice that will give a continuous record of the Earth’s climate going back one million years. After setting up the mobile research station, the drilling program is expected to take four to five summers to complete. As snow falls in Antarctica it traps air pockets as it compresses year after year, preserving a record of the atmosphere at that time. Ice cores have been a central tool for climate scientists to understand the planet’s past conditions, and are used to help calibrate climate models. The environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, tweeted congratulations to the team. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, has released a statement on Cardinal George Pell’s death, calling him an “important intellectual figure and a towering presence in the Catholic community”. The statement rattles off all the places Pell has been, including when he was ordained, his appointment as cardinal (which Dutton calls a “good day for Australia”) and his appointment in 2014 as head of the Vatican’s Secretariat for the Economy. Dutton goes on to say that Pell’s convictions being quashed by the high court should have caused some reflection for the Victorian Labor government that “led this modern-day political persecution”: No other Australian has risen to a higher position in the Catholic Church. A fierce defender of the Catholic faith and Christian ideals, Dr Pell made friends – and enemies – along the way. On his passing, the fact he spent a year in prison for a conviction that the High Court of Australia unanimously quashed should provide some cause for reflection for the Victorian Labor Government and its institutions that led this modern-day political persecution. Pell never lost faith in his God, his country, and in justice – despite the tests and trials he endured in life. Sun Cable, the company aiming to supply Darwin and Singapore with electricity from a giant solar farm in the Northern Territory, has been placed into voluntary administration. The company had the backing of both Mike Cannon-Brookes and Andrew “Twiggy” Forrest, including raising $210m from the billionaires and other investors last year. The plans had included a solar farm of as much as 20 gigawatts of capacity, and had been eyeing a project cost of $30bn all up. In a media statement today, Sun Cable said it had “made the difficult decision to enter voluntary administration”. It’s hoped the move would “unlock a path forward for the company to access additional capital for continued development of its marque project, the Australia-Asia PowerLink (AAPowerLink) and progress the next stage of its development portfolio in a strong market”. The administrators, Christopher Hill, David McGrath and John Park of FTI Consulting, will likely “seek expressions of interest for either a recapitalisation or sale of the business”. “The appointment followed the absence of alignment with the objectives of all shareholders,” the statement said. It notes Sun Cable currently has a portfolio of a further 11GW of proposed projects. Cannon-Brookes, as chair of Sun Cable, may not be going away, it seems. “Sun Cable has achieved so much since it was founded in 2018. I’m confident it will play a huge role in delivering green energy for the world, right here from Australia,” MCB, the co-founder of Atlassian, said. “I fully back this ambition and the team, and look forward to supporting the company’s next chapter.” Let’s see if any of these ventures can be revived. PM says Australia will continue to engage China on dropping tariffs Asked whether Australia might drop its World Trade Organization challenges against China’s tariffs on Australian wine and barley in order to progress the diplomatic relationship, Anthony Albanese said the government would “engage in our national interest”. He said Australia would “continue to put our case that any impediments which are there towards trade should be removed in Australia’s interest and in China’s interest”. He said Australia was looking for a “win-win” outcome (using one of Beijing’s favourite phrases), but that the two countries would continue to have differences: The dialogue has been constructive. No one can argue that the mood in the relationship has not been enhanced substantially since I’ve been prime minister. I’ve been busy making sure that that occurs. We’ll continue to engage in a constructive way. But we do have differences with China, and we’ll continue to stand up for our interests where we must … The fact that yesterday, again, the ambassador made positive soundings is a good sign. But we’ll continue to engage diplomatically. For more on the Chinese ambassador’s intervention, see our news report here: Anthony Albanese asked about Chinese ambassador’s comments on Japan The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has declared that Australia has “a very positive relationship with Japan” in response to a question about the Chinese ambassador’s warning that Canberra should be wary of Tokyo’s intentions. Albanese attempted to remain above the fray as he was asked a series of questions today about the 90-minute press conference conducted by China’s ambassador, Xiao Qian, yesterday. The main message that Albanese took from that press conference was that China was “positive and constructive” about the prospect of continued improvement in relations between Canberra and Beijing this year. Xiao yesterday took a swipe at the Japanese ambassador to Australia, Shingo Yamagami, who has repeatedly warned publicly about security threats posed by China. Xiao said ambassadors posted to Canberra should not try to stop Australia from developing a normal relationship with a third country such as China: “I’m afraid our colleague from Japan is not doing his job.” Xiao argued Japan had never properly apologised for its actions during the second world war – including bombing Darwin and mistreating Australian prisoners of war – and he questioned whether “they might repeat the history”. That intervention prompted a journalist to ask Albanese in Rockhampton today: Yesterday, the Chinese ambassador raised world war two and that Australia should be wary of a possible military attack from Japan in the future. Do you think that’s a serious prospect? Albanese responded: We have a very positive relationship with Japan. I have visited Japan twice as prime minister and hosted Prime Minister Kishida at a very successful visit in Perth at the end of last year. I look forward to hosting Prime Minister Kishida here in some time in 2023 as part of the Quad leaders meeting. With China, we also want to see an improvement in relations. I believe that the ambassador’s comments were positive and constructive about those issues. I met with President Xi last year. That was a positive meeting; it led to the foreign minister visiting Beijing on the 21st of December to commemorate the 50th anniversary of positive relations between Australia and the People’s Republic of China. I look forward to continuing to build on that constructive dialogue, I want to cooperate with China where we can, we will disagree where we must, but will engage in our national interest. Good afternoon, Mostafa Rachwani with you this afternoon, beginning with a quick thanks to Rafqa Touma and Natasha May for their work this morning. Handing over to Mostafa Rachwani, who will carry the blog into the evening. PM urges politicians ‘to not put up furphies’ on the voice referendum The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has implored federal politicians not to put out “furphies” on the voice to parliament referendum, and says social media companies have a responsibility to not let misinformation thrive on their platforms. Going back to Albanese’s press conference in Queensland earlier on, he was asked a few questions about the voice at the tail end, specifically about fears of misinformation online. As we reported this morning, several legal experts raised concerns that the scrapping of the official information pamphlet traditionally distributed at referendums would lead to further false details being spread online. Albanese said the government would continue to put out clear factual information on public websites about the vote. After criticising the Coalition frontbencher Jane Hume who admitted she hadn’t read the voice co-design report from Marcia Langton and Tom Calma, the PM also made a pointed remark about the role of “public office holders” (ie politicians) in the referendum. I would just say that people should not put out disinformation. It will be combated where it can. But I would say that there’s a need to be responsible, particularly public office holders, to be responsible and to not put up furphies in order to to confuse the situation going forward. Pressed further on whether the government had actively sounded out social media companies in a bid to address misinformation on the voice, Albanese admitted he hadn’t personally. I have not had those discussions. But social media platforms have a responsibility to make sure that misinformation isn’t got out there. Social media has a responsibility to do the right thing here. Archbishop Peter Comensoli says he hopes his work with victims of child sexual abuse defines “appropriate compensation and redress”. I would hope on my own journey with them, which is something happens on a weekly basis for me, that I am walking with and seeking justice for, defining of appropriate compensation and redress, and there are ongoing care and support, all things we as a local church group in Melbourne strive to do as best we can. And each of us will be judged accordingly on how we might be able to handle that. Archbishop Peter Comensoli tells a press conference that Cardinal George Pell was “one of the great churchmen of Australia”. He, over many years, has been a forthright defender of the faith, a great gospel man I find him. And that dimension of his life will remain, I think, a very important dimension. There probably has not been a churchman in Australia quite like the cardinal. His response in the Australian context and the international context has been quite instrumental, and I think for many years to come that will be known and thought about. The Catholic archbishop of Melbourne, Peter Comensoli, is holding a press conference on the “really unexpected” death of Cardinal George Pell. I am a sinner, all of us are sinners, and all of us in that sense we failed in ways. In a sense, our beliefs as Christians is towards a God who is full of tenderness and we strive to live that in our own lives. None of us do that well, all the time. We are all sinners and in need of our Lord’s mercy and forgiveness. Comensoli says Pell was “quite a good mentor, a really important mentor, a father figure for me”. I have known him well for about 12 years, and it is seen as something of a real friend. Of these last few years, when he has been in retirement, either in Rome or back in Sydney, that he has been able to continue to exercise his role as a cardinal and to do so in ways that were then able to build up the life of faith in those sort of settings. Million-year ice core researchers travel 1,200km over icy landscape to reach project site Australian researchers have made it to Little Dome C in Antarctica to drill down into million-year-old ice in an effort to learn about climate change. The team of 10 traversed 1,200km over 19 days in temperatures as low as -50C on their Antarctic expedition. The researchers will analyse air bubbles trapped in ice cores to help inform what we know about the climate system’s stability over the past 1m years, and help scientists make predictions about the future. Retail sales rise 1.4% in November, boosted by Black Friday spending More from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, with retail sales growth surprising on the upside too. Completing the trifecta of higher-than-tipped November numbers from the ABS today were retail sales. These rose 1.4% for the month alone, and 7.7% from a year earlier. The ANZ, for instance, tipped a 0.6% monthly rise and CBA expected a 0.8% increase. Given rising prices and an expanding population, total spending hit new record highs, as you might expect (sans pandemics etc). Among the pointers to the economy being robust towards the end of 2022, October’s retail sales were also revised to a 0.4% increase compared with an initial decrease when first reported. Ben Dorber, the ABS head of retail statistics, attributed Black Friday sales for boosting spending on clothing, footwear, furniture and electronic goods. (Not to be confused with “Black Friday” related to bushfires – this is some marketing ruse for the day after the US Thanksgiving day on the last Thursday of November.) “Given the increasing popularity of Black Friday sales, the smaller increase in October may reflect consumers waiting to take advantage of discounting in November, particularly in light of cost-of-living pressures,” Dorber said. All up, then, the November numbers might well be noted by the Reserve Bankers at the beach or wherever they spend their summer sloth. Not a lot of sign of the economy losing steam even with the flurry of rate rises to November (with another in December). John Howard releases statement on death of George Pell The death of George Cardinal Pell in Rome has taken from us a person of enormous influence, not only in the Catholic Church, but in the nation more generally. He was a strong and determined religious leader. His episcopal motto was ‘be not afraid’. In the senior roles he held in the Church, he displayed consistent courage in expressing Christian views in the public space. Believers and non-believers alike were left in no doubt where George Pell stood on issues. His deep and compassionate faith sustained him during more than 400 days in prison for alleged crimes which many, me included, believed should never have been the subject of charges. Cardinal Pell’s trust in Australia’s justice system was vindicated when the High Court of Australia unanimously quashed his conviction. A great sports lover, having been an accomplished Australian Rules player, he then embraced the more widely played Rugby codes in Sydney. Until recent years he and his late sister were regulars during the traditional New Year Cricket Test in Sydney. We often spent time together at the cricket discussing all manner of issues. I liked and respected the late Cardinal a lot. His passing is a great loss to the intellectual and spiritual life of our country.” Teal independents say safeguard mechanism revamp ‘falls short’ and has ‘room for improvement’ Zali Steggall, the federal member for Warringah, says the Albanese government’s proposed changes to the safeguard mechanism “falls short”. Kate Chaney, the federal member for Curtin, thinks there is “room for improvement”, but says the proposal still “looks pretty good”. The New South Wales anti-corruption watchdog says it is now unlikely to finalise its probe into the former premier Gladys Berejiklian before the March election, citing the complexity of the investigation. Operation Keppel began as an investigation into the former Wagga Wagga MP Daryl Maguire before widening to include Berejiklian after details of her “close personal relationship” with him were revealed in 2020. Berejiklian resigned as premier in 2021 after the Independent Commission Against Corruption revealed it had widened its probe to include whether she broke the law by failing to report his alleged conduct. Berejiklian repeatedly denied any alleged wrongdoing, including during her grilling at a fresh set of hearings in October 2021. The commission had been expected to hand down its findings last year, but it has repeatedly pushed the finalised report, including as recently as October. On Wednesday the commission confirmed the commissioner, Ruth McColl, was “continuing her work in relation to the Operation Keppel report” but was now unlikely to deliver the final report until the second quarter of this year. In a statement, the commission said: Substantial parts of the report have been drafted. At the same time, it must be recognised that the report concerns complex matters of law and fact, two public inquiries which proceeded over 30 days, over 2,800 pages of transcript, 516 exhibits comprising approximately 10,600 pages and 957 pages of submissions (the last of which were received on 18 October 2022). It is necessary that the issues relevant to the investigation are addressed carefully. Ms McColl is working to complete a draft of the report as soon as possible but, given these matters, it is not possible to specify a date by which it will be completed. It said that once the report was complete it would still need to be subjected to “review, editing and production processes” and was “now unlikely” to be handed in during the first quarter of the year. Icac said: On the information presently available the Commission anticipates it is more likely to be available for furnishing in the second quarter of 2023. Abuse survivor network calls for Catholic church to avoid funeral service with full honours for Pell SNAP, a network of 25,000 abuse survivors based in the United States, has called for the Catholic church to avoid a “funeral service with full honors for Cardinal Pell”. In a statement, the group said: We hope Catholic officials will show compassion to abuse victims and betrayed Catholics by avoiding a funeral service with full honors for Cardinal Pell. Restraint would be appropriate unless the church hierarchy wants to deepen already deep wounds. In our view, Pell’s serious wrongdoing is already ignored and minimized by the church’s hierarchy. The group encouraged abuse survivors to seek support from trusted friends and families or from support groups. Louise Milligan: ‘Think about how painful it is’ for victim survivors ABC reporter Louise Milligan, who has reported extensively on Cardinal Pell, tells ABC News how alleged survivors of child abuse may take news of Pell’s death. This is the end of a very dark chapter in the life of the Australian church which is connected to the life of the international church. George Pell was at the pinnacle of that history in Australia and then rose to become the third most senior Catholic in the world. For victims and survivors, including complainants who made allegations against him, it is, I think, still brings up all of that pain. And the pain never goes away. I would always say to people to think about those people. Think about how painful it is for those people and have a bit of empathy and kindness towards those people. Aerial shots show Broome-bound freight pushing through roads inundated with water, amid flooding in Western Australia. Community disenchantment means Catholic church’s influence ‘waning rapidly’: Francis Sullivan Francis Sullivan, CEO of the Truth, Justice and Healing Council, tells ABC news the Catholic church’s influence is “waning rapidly”. We saw through the royal commission the absolute horror the community felt when it realised the degree to which the church would conceal and do everything to protect its image, even though the damage to survivors was so obvious. And the persistence and inertia that the hierarchy of the church has demonstrated for decades has only led to great disenchantment and disinterest now, from so many Catholics and the wider community. And in turn, the church’s influence in areas where it should have quite a lot of it is waning rapidly. On Pell’s handling of sexual abuse complaints against clergy, Sullivan says: The whole sex abuse scandal is prominent because he, along with others, administered the church in a period where they sought to contain rather than be completely open. The Truth, Justice and Healing Council was established by Catholic representative bodies in response to the royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse. Global economic growth forecast downgraded by nearly half The World Bank has downgraded its global economic growth forecast for 2023 by almost half – from 3% to just 1.7%. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, says “this report leaves little no doubt the international economy is facing its third crisis in 15 years – following the hammer blows caused by the GFC and pandemic”. We should be optimistic about the future of our economy and our country but realistic about what the deteriorating international outlook means for us in Australia. Global prospects in 2023 will be shaped by the energy shock caused by the war in Ukraine, China’s Covid management, the fate of major economies, and the trajectory, severity and impact of interest rate rises around the world. And here in Australia, we know all too well our communities and economy are also facing greater threats from floods, fire, storms and drought. While Australia won’t be immune from a global slowdown, the Albanese government is continuing its work towards creating a stronger, more inclusive and more resilient economy that can better withstand future shocks. Thanks for your attention this Wednesday morning. Take it away, Rafqa Touma! Snap analysis on US jostling on Aukus It’s worth taking a moment to step through why a group of US politicians felt the need to write to Joe Biden in strong support of the Aukus security deal – and where the points of contention remain as key decisions loom. Under Aukus, Australia plans acquire at least eight nuclear-powered submarines with the help of the US and the UK, and March looms as the deadline for more details about which design will be adopted and the timeframe for construction. That’s why there is an uptick in activity to bed down exactly how this might be achieved. The letter to the US president, published overnight, was signed by nine US House of Representatives members from both parties, including Democratic representative Joe Courtney who led the effort. They were implicitly pushing back at an argument advanced recently by two key senators about risks to the US’s own submarine needs if the Biden administration agrees to sell one or two Virginia-class submarines to Australia this decade. The idea has been floated as a potential way to bridge the gap before Australia is ready to start building its own nuclear-powered submarines in Adelaide. Domestically built ones may not start to be operational until the late 2030s or early 2040s, but Australia’s existing conventional Collins class submarines will start to be retired in the late 2030s. The stopgap idea is clearly being taken seriously by the Biden administration. But it’s well known that the US production line is already under stress as the US navy seeks to ramp up construction of its own submarines. That is what led Democratic senator Jack Reed – the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee – and then-Republican senator James Inhofe to implore Biden not to stress “the US submarine industrial base to the breaking point”. Reed and Inhofe raised concern that “what was initially touted as a ‘do no harm’ opportunity to support Australia and the United Kingdom and build long-term competitive advantages for the US and its Pacific allies, may be turning into a zero-sum game for scarce, highly advanced US [nuclear submarines]”. But the new letter by the Courtney-led bipartisan group says the US will gain from providing “our closest ally with an undersea capability to better posture itself in the region”. Courtney’s grouping says while it is essential for the US to stick to its own plan to build a minimum of two submarines a year to meet its own requirements, “we are supportive of expanding the industrial base to meet Aukus expectations”. Far from a zero-sum game, the potential for the United States to provide or build new submarines under Aukus, should that be the recommendation of the trilateral consultation, could very well be a ‘rising tide that lifts all boats’ … We particularly believe that an expansion of our industrial base beyond two submarines would support the early provisioning of existing Virginia class submarines to be made available concurrent with the retirement of the Collins class attack submarines. These realities should not be viewed as a reason not to pursue US build submarine options in Aukus but rather as a unique opportunity to leverage the support and resources possible under Aukus to grow our industrial base to support both US and Australian submarine construction, recognizing that the full fruition of Aukus over many decades will result in Australia’s ability to domestically produce nuclear-powered submarines. It should be pointed out that none of the US politicians who have been active on either side of this debate have been hostile to the broad security partnership known as Aukus. The contention is about exactly how the US can help Australia in the short to medium term without undermining its own submarine needs. For his part, Reed popped up on Twitter overnight to made clear his recent letter should not be seen as opposing Aukus; he just wanted “responsible oversight and a stable industrial base”. Reed said Aukus was “central to ensuring a free and open Indo-Pacific, dramatically improving the capabilities of our allies, and increasing our engagement in the region”. Expect to see this debate heating up in the weeks ahead. Number of job vacancies slide further but remain far above pre-Covid levels Another key number out today from the ABS is the one for job vacancies, and that result is a slight down arrow. In November, vacancies totalled 444,000 – down 5% or 23,000 – from the August reading. That tally is now off 8% from the May peak. The number of job openings, though, remains high by historic measures, and is still almost double the pre-Covid level of 228,000. The number of businesses reporting at least one vacancy is still rising, with about 28% of firms looking for staff, according to Bjorn Jarvis, head of labour statistics at the ABS. Jarvis said: These figures continue to show the high demand for workers across many businesses and all industries, in a tight labour market. Interestingly, vacancies to work in the public sector were up 6% while those in the private sector were down by that margin, compared with August. Such large vacancy numbers might suggest the jobless rate, at 3.4% in November, might have further to fall before it inevitably starts to climb as the higher interest rates start to drag on the economy. Next up, some retail numbers that are mildly therapeutic. Father of deceased ex-choirboy will continue civil action against Pell despite cardinal’s death A father of a deceased ex-choirboy who alleged that Cardinal George Pell sexually abused him while he was archbishop of Melbourne will continue his civil action against the cardinal despite his death. Pell was acquitted in 2020 after the high court quashed his convictions for child sexual assault related to allegations he molested two choirboys in the sacristy at St Patrick’s Cathedral while he was archbishop of Melbourne in 1996. He served 13 months in prison before being released. One of the choirboys died aged 31 from a drug overdose. His father filed a civil claim against the Catholic archdiocese of Melbourne and Pell in the supreme court in July last year. The man is suing for damages for psychological injury, which he claims he suffered after learning of the allegations his son had been sexually abused. The case is being defended. His lawyer, Shine Lawyers chief legal officer, Lisa Flynn, has issued the following statement: Shine Lawyers is progressing a civil claim on behalf of the father of a former altar boy who alleged he was sexually abused by George Pell. The Catholic Archdiocese of Melbourne is also listed as a defendant in this matter. The claim will continue against the church and whatever estate Pell has left behind. A civil trial likely would have provided the opportunity to cross examine Pell, and truly test his defence against these allegations. There is still a great deal of evidence for this claim to rely on, and the court will be asked in due course to make its ruling on that evidence. Taking questions, Albanese is asked about Cardinal George Pell’s death. He expresses his condolences for those mourning and says it will “come as a shock to many”. He also says the Department of Foreign Affairs is assisting bringing Pell’s body back to Australia. For many people, particularly of the Catholic faith, this will be a difficult day and I express my condolences to all those who are mourning today. I discussed with Archbishop Fisher this morning, I expressed my condolences to Archbishop Fisher on behalf of the government. Archbishop Fisher informed me that there will be a service held in the Vatican in coming days but then there will be a service at St Mary’s Cathedral at sometime in the future. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade trade [is] providing assistance to ensure that Cardinal Pell is brought back to Australia and those arrangements are being put in place and further announcements will be made when they are finalised. Asked whether he will be attending the funeral, Albanese said: It hasn’t been set yet for when, for any of those dates. There will be an event in the coming days in the Vatican and that will be held as appropriate. The announcements will be made, they haven’t been finalised yet of course, this will come as a shock to many. This was a hip operation and the consequences of it unfortunately have been that Cardinal Pell has lost his life, and I’ll express my condolences to all those who will be mourning today. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is speaking live from Rockhampton in Queensland. He’s speaking about new funding being brought forward for the Rocky Ring Road despite the project being stalled under the previous government. Now that you have a federal Labor government working with the Queensland Labor government, we are getting on with this project, and that is why we have brought forward $280m to commence a project that will cost more than $1bn. We are still doing the final costing because it wasn’t done properly by the former government. Albanese says the project will mean more than 2,600 heavy vehicles are taken off Rockhampton CBD every day which will improve efficiency and road safety. Consumer prices in November were up 7.3% from a year earlier, with the cost of food, transport and new houses rising the most, the Australian Bureau of Statistics says. In the first batch of notable ABS stats for the year, headline CPI quickened in the month from the 6.9% pace recorded in October. Analysts had been tipping 7.2%, so the outcome was slightly above those expectations. Within the mix, the cost of building a new home rose 9.6% from a year earlier. Food and non-alcoholic beverages were 9.4% more pricey, while transport was 9% more expensive. The trimmed mean measure of inflation, which the Reserve Bank is interested in, rose 5.6% from a year earlier, or slightly above the 5.5% market consensus. Prior to today’s numbers, investors had tipped a roughly three-in-five chance the RBA would hike its key interest rate another 25 basis points when its board meets early next month. Such a rise would extend the record series of rate rises to nine, and bring the cash rate to 3.35%. That’s getting a bit ahead of things, but today’s CPI numbers on the margin will likely increase the odds of that rate rise on 7 February. A couple of other economic stats to look at … stay tuned. Reports Pell’s body will be flown back to Australia for burial Cardinal George Pell has died in Rome, but Catholic media outlet Crux Now is reporting his body will be flown back to Australia for burial. Pell will be flown back to Australia following his Vatican funeral, and he will be buried in St. Mary’s Cathedral in Sydney, where he served as archbishop for 13 years before moving to the Vatican. The president of the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference, Archbishop Timothy Costelloe, has just issued a statement on the death of George Pell. Costelloe said Pell had provided “strong and clear leadership” for the church in Australia. The world, as his Vatican appointments as Prefect of the Secretariat for the Economy and as a member of the Council of Cardinals, an advisory group to Pope Francis, testify. Cardinal Pell’s impact on the life of the Church in Australia and around the world will continue to be felt for many years. As we remember him and reflect on his legacy, I invite all Catholics and other people of goodwill to join in praying for Cardinal Pell, a man of deep and abiding faith, and for the repose of his soul. Government considering introducing carbon tariffs, Bowen says Circling back to the ABC Radio interview with the energy minister, Chris Bowen, following the government’s changes to the safeguard mechanism yesterday: Bowen said the government is considering introducing carbon tariffs in the way that the EU has talked about doing, so that Australian businesses now facing these obligations remain competitive internationally. Yes, this is something we should look at alongside all the other options available to government to ensure that now that Australia has a decent climate policy, Australian industry is guided on that, and just as Europe has gone down this road, Australia will consider its options alongside other options. Australia’s lucrative international student sector appears set for a huge boost due to improving relations with China. Government data shows Chinese student visa holders more than halved between 2019 and 2022, falling from 165,149 to 78,234 during the pandemic period. China’s ambassador to Australia, Xiao Qian, said yesterday “bad political relations” had contributed to students’ reluctance to come to Australia, but more stability in the relationship should see that trend reversed. He told reporters: Some Chinese students are not happy with the policies and then they might be hesitant to come to study. Once we have an improvement [in the] relationship, that absolutely is going to send messages to students [that] you should have confidence about the future, you should have confidence about the relationship between the two countries, you should have confidence to come back to study in Australia. Xiao said “absolutely extraordinary” policies for international students could also deter students from coming to Australia. Student visa holders require approval from the Department of Home Affairs to switch courses and some require initial approval before they can begin a course. Xiao said: Some of the policies by the previous government, they have been a negative influence on Chinese students’ attitudes to come to study in this country. This is absolutely extraordinary … this is very much not a normal kind of practice in many other countries. Australia’s international student sector was valued at a cool $40bn in 2019. The employment and workplace relations minister, Tony Burke, said the Labor government was approaching Chinese-Australian relations differently from its predecessors. He told Nine: … the refrain now is, you cooperate where you can, you disagree where you must, and you pursue the national interest. Out of that we have seen a thawing of relationships; things are much better than they were twelve months ago. - AAP Archbishop of Melbourne confirms George Pell died of heart complications following hip surgery The archbishop of Melbourne, Peter A Comensoli, has confirmed George Pell died of heart complications following hip surgery in Rome. In a statement, he said: It is with great sadness that I have learned that Cardinal George Pell, the seventh Archbishop of Melbourne, has died overnight from heart complications following hip surgery in Rome, Italy. Cardinal Pell was a very significant and influential Church leader, both in Australia and internationally, deeply committed to Christian discipleship. Cardinal Pell led the local Church of Melbourne from 1996 to 2001 with strong leadership in the Catholic faith and with good governance, before being transferred to Sydney and then to Rome. At this immediate moment, let our prayers go out to the God of Jesus Christ, whom Cardinal Pell wholeheartedly believed in and followed, that he may be welcomed into eternal life. Our prayers of comfort and condolence are also with his family, especially his only surviving sibling David Pell. May eternal light shine upon him, and may he now rest in peace and rise to glory in the Lord. Australian charities forced to spend millions to deal with donation dumping Australian charities are forking out millions of dollars to deal with donation “dumping” amid increasing demands for their help as the cost-of-living crisis bites. The St Vincent de Paul Society in South Australia knew that the Christmas break increased the risk of donated goods being left strewn across the ground outside bins, so it organised daily cleanouts of the bins – but it wasn’t enough. Images show piles of goods stretching the length of its storefront in Mount Barker. In the end, it had to hire trucks to remove the goods, some of which will end up in landfill. WA bushfire threats downgraded Two bushfires that threatened properties in Western Australia have been downgraded from emergency warnings to watch and act alerts. Residents near a fire burning east of Donnybrook in the state’s southwest were told on Tuesday they were in danger and should evacuate. The warning was issued for people in parts of Beelerup, Brookhampton and Charley Creek, and an evacuation centre was opened at Donnybrook Recreation Centre. That blaze was downgraded to watch and act on Wednesday morning. The Department of Fire and Emergency Services said the fire, caused by lightning, was stationary but not contained or controlled, with 30 firefighters building and strengthening containment lines. Meanwhile, a second blaze that on Tuesday threatened homes about 10km southeast of Bridgetown in the rural areas of Sunnyside, Kingston and Yornup has also been downgraded from an emergency warning to a watch and act. The fire started near the intersection of Gomm Lane and Kingston Roads on Sunnyside, in the state’s heavily wooded southwest. An earlier blaze threatening homes near the tiny town of Kununoppin, north of Merredin, has been contained. - AAP Returning back to the Aukus submarines, which have been in the news since a US senator expressed concerns about what the deal would mean for America’s own defence capabilities. A bipartisan coalition of members of congress have written to the president, Joe Biden, expressing their support not only for Aukus but for the commitment to help Australian develop its nuclear powered submarine capability. We write to reiterate strong support not just for the Australian-United Kingdom-United States security pact (Aukus) but also, in particular, the commitment to develop an Australian nuclear powered submarine capability. You can see their full letter here: The Archbishop of Sydney, Anthony Fisher, has released a statement on the death of George Pell. He says: It is with deep sadness that I can confirm His Eminence, George Cardinal Pell, passed away in Rome in the early hours of this morning. This news comes as a great shock to all of us. Please pray for the repose of the soul of Cardinal Pell, for comfort and consolation for his family and for all of those who loved him and are grieving him at this time. You can read the Guardian’s obituary for Cardinal George Pell, who has died aged 81, here: Cardinal George Pell has died in Vatican City, aged 81. Cardinal Pell, the former Catholic Archbishop of Melbourne, died on Tuesday evening, AAP has confirmed. He was the Vatican’s top finance minister before he left in 2017 to stand trial in Australia for child abuse offences. In 2020, Pell was cleared on appeal of his 2018 conviction for molesting two teenage choirboys in the sacristy at St Patrick’s Cathedral while he was Archbishop of Melbourne in 1996. The convictions were quashed in an unanimous decision by the high court. Next big wet may be in north Queensland and heat builds in the south PM Anthony Albanese and other government ministers have lately been out to the Kimberley in the nation’s north-west to inspect flood damage. We’re approaching halfway in the cyclone season, so there could be more places to visit to inspect the disasters that the climate change minister, Chris Bowen, told us earlier in the week were becoming “less natural” as the planet heats up. A look at the Bureau of Meteorology’s rain forecasts suggest the north Queensland coastline could see some sizeable accumulated rainfall totals over the next week or so. The south, meanwhile, has been warming up, and another heatwave is on the way for the south-east in the next few days. Melbourne is looking at a top of 38C on Saturday, the latest bout of peaky hot days this summer. Adelaide is also tracking for a toasty 37-38C on Friday and Saturday. By contrast, Sydney is yet to clock a 30C day this summer (with 29.7C in December the nearest miss so far). A few days over the next week may nudge 29C and perhaps tick over the 30C level for the first time since last February. Acting defence minister unfazed by comments from China’s ambassador RN Breakfast host Hamish McDonald also asked Keogh about some of the more incendiary comments that came from China’s ambassador Xiao Qian’s press conference yesterday, but the acting defence minister says the rhetoric is nothing new. Qian warned that the Aukus deal will end up as a costly mistake. However, Keogh said he does not interpret his words as a threat. The comments that were made yesterday are the same sort of comments that China has made about the Aukus deal since it was initially announced. We’re familiar with the concern that China has raised but putting that one side I think the more important element of what was spoken about yesterday by the Chinese ambassador was the improving of the relationship that comes from a new government here in Australia and looking at how we improve those trade relationships in particular, with China reopening those markets for Australia into China. McDonald: Interestingly, the ambassador waged a war of words, if you want to put it that way, on the Japanese ambassador, who warned Canberra against believing too much of what China is saying. In return, the Chinese ambassador seemed to suggest that Japan could once again pose a military threat. What do you make of this style? Keogh: Well, again, this is not sort of rhetoric that we haven’t heard before from China, about other countries like Japan. But I don’t think we need to be getting ourselves concerned into day to day commentary on what one country said about another country in speeches like this. McDonald: Respectfully, this is no day to day diplomacy. I mean, the Chinese ambassador was talking about the second world war, Japan invading Australia, bombing Darwin and never apologising for it. This is fairly extraordinary stuff. Keogh: Look, it’s it’s, as I said before, it’s not rhetoric that we haven’t heard before.… It’s not something that it’s useful for us as a government to provide running commentary on those sort of things that have been concerns expressed between two other countries. Australian involvement in construction of Aukus submarines important, acting defence minister says More on submarines. In an interview with ABC Radio, the veterans affairs and acting defence minister, Matt Keogh, has reaffirmed the government’s confidence it can reach its deadline of acquiring nuclear submarines by the end of the next decade. Asked if the government has been in contact with these US senators that have raised concerns about the procurement process and the impact on the US construction process of its own submarines, Keogh said: We’re certainly alive to the concerns that were raised in that letter that those congressmen wrote, but we’ve been engaging with the Biden administration, very positively … The American government and the UK Government are as committed as the Australian government to this project and see that there is a pathway forward on how we will go about procuring these submarines. The industrial base for all of the three countries – Australia included - is critical to achieving those outcomes and making sure that we’re able to grow the pie by bringing the Australian industrial base into those existing industrial bases is very important. So it’s important for from an Australian point of view that there’s Australian involvement in the construction of these submarines … it’s important that we do grow the Australian industrial base not just to support submarines, but to support our defence capability more generally, looking at things like missile technology, for example, as well, but also to the broader Australian industry. US senator tweets support for Aukus submarine deal An influential US senator who warned that the Aukus pact could push the US submarine-building industry to breaking point has tweeted he is proud to support the “powerful partnership”. Democrat Jack Reed and Republican James Inhofe wrote to the US president, Joe Biden, late last year imploring him not to let the security pact between Australia, the US and the UK come at a cost to US capability. They urged the president not to sell Virginia-class submarines to Australia, an option that the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, has been pushing as a way of filling a gap in Australia’s defence capability. In response to the leaked letter, the Albanese government has stood by the nuclear-powered submarine project and says it remains on track. On Tuesday, senator Reed tweeted his support for the “powerful partnership” struck in September 2021 by Biden, the then Australian prime minister Scott Morrison and the former UK leader Boris Johnson. Reed said successful implementation of Aukus required “responsible oversight and a stable industrial base”, particularly when it came to submarine programs. - AAP Anniversary is opportunity for us to reflect on the mental health effects of war, Keogh says The veteran affairs minister, Matt Keogh, says the 50th anniversary of the end of Australia’s involvement in the Vietnam War is “an opportunity for Australians to reflect”. Keogh told ABC News Breakfast how the Vietnam War has shaped better understanding of mental health for contemporary veterans: The 3,000 Australians injured and the 523 that lost their lives serving our nation … were part of the 60,000 Australians that were involved in the Vietnam war effort from Australia. It’s really our Vietnam veteran cohort that led us to really understand the impact of war from a mental health point of view and to understand things like PTSD ... what we’ve learned from that cohort has allowed us to be in a much better position to support our contemporary veterans as well. On whether Australia should have never gotten involved in the Vietnam war, Keogh says: I don’t think it’s useful to reflect on if Australia should have been involved or not involved in those conflicts. What’s important is to think about the sacrifice of the individuals and their families from their involvement. When it came to Vietnam, we had national service involved in that time, we had conscription. That led to some massive protests across Australia and a lot of negative views from Australians about that conflict. What is important ... is to think about how that reflected on those individuals and there’s an opportunity in this 50th anniversary year ... to be very clear in communicating to our veterans that their service is respected, and honoured, and that we thank them for that service and the sacrifice that they made and the sacrifice their families made by putting on the Australian uniform with the Australian flag and serving their nation and we thank them for that service. 50 years since Australia announced withdrawal from Vietnam War Today marks the day that Australia’s governor general officially ended Australia’s involvement in the war in Vietnam, 50 years ago. During the course of Australia’s involvement, 60,000 served in Vietnam, 523 were killed and almost 2,500 were wounded. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has taken to social media to acknowledge the anniversary and pay tribute to those Australians. Bowen defends carbon credit review amid criticisms from whistleblower who first blew lid McDonald also asks Bowen about some of the criticisms that have emerged from the Chubb review into Australia’s carbon credit scheme, which found the scheme did not need an overhaul. Andrew McIntosh, the academic who initially blew the whistle with concerns about the scheme, told ABC Radio earlier this morning he found the review’s findings bewildering: The panel has not presented any analysis or evidence to support its conclusions that there’s nothing essentially wrong with the scheme. We and others have presented a veritable mountain of evidence that there’s significant problems. Bowen defends the independence of the review and its findings: This panel took many many submissions, held many stakeholder groups, went out and saw these projects, went out to places like Cobar and saw the controversial methods being implemented and saw regeneration on one side of the fence and sparse environments on the other side of the fence and saw the real world impacts of this now. Carbon credits are important, they are a complement to emissions reduction at the facility level, at the coalface if you will. They will not be ever replaced that but they are important part of the journey and I’m absolutely determined that there will be rigour. We will take legislation through to implement the recommendations when I come to appoint the members [in] this new committee and nobody will be in any doubt. When I appoint the new members of the rigour, their independence, their credentials, their scientific background, and there will be, I think, an opportunity for great confidence in the system. Hamish McDonald asks Bowen about the $600m fund that has been set up to help cover the costs of decarbonisation, and how the government justifies subsidising big business. Bowen says it’s in the national interest and a continuation of previous Labor policies to advance the transition to net zero. McDonald: Many of these businesses are trading … against businesses overseas. There will be an impact on their capacity to operate because of these obligations, and you’re making grants available to them from a $600m fund to help cover the cost of decarbonising. These are big businesses. They are enormous polluters, why should taxpayers be subsidising these businesses transition programs? Bowen: Because this is a national endeavour. Because it is vital for those companies to make this transition but it’s also vital for our country … We need to be all in, and these companies need to be all in and they are in many instances making many hundreds of millions … billions of dollars of investment, including big traditional fossil fuel industries, and they know they need to do that. Just as the CSC and Arena [Australian Renewable Energy Agency] have played a vital role in what we have achieved previously – and we’re very proud of them being Labor creations – we would not have achieved anywhere near as much without the investments [and] coinvestments as CFC and arena helping businesses make this transition. We are … putting an obligation on businesses to decarbonise at quite an ambitious rate. We will make the $600m out of the $1.9bn, [the] powering the regions funds [are] available to help you if you can satisfy us that it is real investment in real abatement and real reductions in emissions, then this is a national endeavor. Now we can’t afford not to be all in. We need all businesses doing all levels of government doing it, all society. And so this is a real partnership. And yes, of course, we are requiring businesses to make big investments but where we can provide that extra bit of support to provide that extra certainty and again, as I said, enabled, in some cases management to convince the boards that this is a good instance. I think this is very much in the national interest. Safeguard mechanism will take 205m tonnes of carbon out of atmosphere, Bowen says The climate change minister, Chris Bowen, yesterday released the government’s plan to revamp the safeguard mechanism, a Coalition policy that was promised to limit emissions from more than 200 industrial facilities but in practice has failed. Now, the Albanese government says Australia’s big polluting sites from mid year will have to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by nearly 5% a year until 2030 but will face no limits on the use of carbon offsets. Bowen is this morning speaking to ABC Radio about some the concerns that have emerged since the changes were announced, including whether there is enough incentive to reduce emissions, rather than simply buying offsets. Bowen says there “absolutely” is. This is a very ambitious package that we announced yesterday. 5% reductions each year is an ambitious step forward, between now and 2030, it will take 205m tonnes of carbon emission out of our atmosphere. Now that’s equivalent to two thirds of the emissions from all of Australia’s cars over that period. So this is a big deal. You can read more about the safeguard mechanism from our environment editor Adam Morton and economics correspondent Peter Hannam: Fitzroy Crossing airstrip now dry enough to land larger aircraft A “massive” disaster relief operation hits full swing in the Fitzroy River catchment area, where many people remain isolated by floodwaters and damaged roads. More than nine tonnes of food and 10 boxes of medical supplies have been flown in to flood-ravaged Fitzroy Crossing as more planes join the airlift. WA’s fire and emergency services commissioner, Darren Klemm, told reporters: This is a massive operation underway to get essential supplies into that community and its surrounds. It was earlier reported that the airstrip was too flooded to get large aircraft in, but the airstrip was now dry enough to land larger aircraft. It will significantly increase capacity to resupply the town of about 1,200. He said: I want to reassure the people in the Kimberley region we are bringing a significant amount of food into the region to ensure we have adequate supplies. Authorities, with assistance from the Australian Defence Force, have also started the damage assessment and cleanup operation in the areas they can access. - AAP Long wait before flooded WA bridge reopens A Western Australian bridge destroyed by once-in-a-century flooding could take more than a year to rebuild, the state’s emergency services minister has said. The roadway over the Fitzroy River in the Kimberley region is the state’s only sealed roadway to the north. The emergency services minister, Stephen Dawson, said there was significant damage to the bridge at Fitzroy Crossing and the Great Northern Highway. Engineers and divers are expected to start inspecting the structure in the coming days to determine what can be salvaged and how much work will be required before the transport link can reopen. Dawson told reporters: That will give us [an] indication [of] how many months or indeed years [it will take] to build that bridge back up again. Early indications are that that work will take a significant amount of time. He said any work was likely to start after the wet season ends. State authorities are also looking at temporary transport alternatives, such as an old flood crossing across the river bed, and talking to the Australian Defence Force about building a temporary bridge. In the meantime, road trains with freight for Kununurra and the Northern Territory have been diverted from southern WA in South Australia to travel up the Stuart Highway through central Australia. A barge is also transporting essential goods from Perth Hedland to Broome, with authorities saying an airlift and boats might be the only way to reach some communities until the roadway is repaired. - AAP Western Australia is facing the prospect of another natural disaster, with bushfire emergency warnings in place in the south of the state only a week after the once-in-a-century flooding in the Kimberley. In the early hours of this morning a bushfire emergency warning was issued for parts of Beelerup, Brookhampton and Charley Creek in the Donnybrook-Balingup shire. A watch and act warning has also been issued for the Noggerup, also in the Donnybrook-Balingup, and part of the Wellington National Park in the shire of Dardanup. In the north of the state, a barge containing food, medicine and other essential supplies is arriving in Broome, after last week’s flooding devastated the region’s road and air infrastructure. The roadway over the Fitzroy River, the state’s only sealed roadway to the north, was left looking as thought it “had a big bomb dropped on it” was how the emergency services minister Murray Watt described it yesterday. However, that main freight route could take more than a year to rebuild, according to Stephen Dawson, WA’s emergency services minister.

The companies announced plans to set up a 50:50 joint venture almost two years after BP made its return to the solar market by snapping up a 43% stake in Lightsource for £200m. BP will increase its stake in the company by buying new shares for an undisclosed price to help accelerate Lightsource BP’s solar power targets. It had hoped to grow its portfolio to 6GW of capacity by 2023 but plans to reach 10GW over the same timescale. BP has used the UK solar startup to re-establish a presence in the solar sector after it backed out of the market in 2011. It plans to use more solar power in its own offices too. Dev Sanyal, the boss of BP’s alternative energy division, said the oil company was in conversation with the venture to source solar energy to power BP’s global offices next year. BP’s commodity traders will also sell more renewable energy from Lightsource BP projects to other companies that want to run on clean energy. Sanyal said: “BP is committed to helping meet the world’s rapidly growing demand for low-carbon energy. Solar, which is predicted to increase by a factor of 10 by 2040, plays a key role in this energy transition. That is why we want to invest more in Lightsource BP and to deepen our partnership.” Lightsource BP has grown its pipeline of solar projects almost 10-fold across nine new countries in the last two years by harnessing BP’s international networks and energy trading expertise. The company has also been experimenting with ways to boost the financial rewards of solar power projects, including trials that use double-sided panels or help to balance the energy system at night. Nick Boyle, the group chief executive of Lightsource BP, said: “Two years ago, we were in four countries and we’re now in 13. We had a global pipeline of 1.6GW and today it’s over 12GW. It’s that sort of additional momentum which has been facilitated [by BP].” BP’s fresh investment in the solar company came as environmental lawyers prepared to take action against a multimillion-pound BP advertising campaign. ClientEarth said the company was misleading the public with claims of being committed to a low-carbon future. The charity is calling for the ads to be banned unless they include a health warning that BP’s oil and gas spending is contributing to the climate crisis."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2020/may/07/michael-moore-far-right-climate-crisis-deniers-film-environment-falsehoods","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2020-05-07T10:28:41Z","webTitle":"How did Michael Moore become a hero to climate deniers and the far right? | George Monbiot","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/07/michael-moore-far-right-climate-crisis-deniers-film-environment-falsehoods","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2020/may/07/michael-moore-far-right-climate-crisis-deniers-film-environment-falsehoods","fields":{"headline":"How did Michael Moore become a hero to climate deniers and the far right?","bodyText":"Denial never dies; it just goes quiet and waits. Today, after years of irrelevance, the climate science deniers are triumphant. Long after their last, desperate claims had collapsed, when they had traction only on “alt-right” conspiracy sites, a hero of the left turns up and gives them more than they could have dreamed of. Planet of the Humans, whose executive producer and chief promoter is Michael Moore, now has more than 6 million views on YouTube. The film does not deny climate science. But it promotes the discredited myths that deniers have used for years to justify their position. It claims that environmentalism is a self-seeking scam, doing immense harm to the living world while enriching a group of con artists. This has long been the most effective means by which denial – most of which has been funded by the fossil fuel industry – has been spread. Everyone hates a scammer. And yes, there are scammers. There are real issues and real conflicts to be explored in seeking to prevent the collapse of our life support systems. But they are handled so clumsily and incoherently by this film that watching it is like seeing someone start a drunken brawl over a spilled pint, then lamping his friends when they try to restrain him. It stumbles so blindly into toxic issues that Moore, former champion of the underdog, unwittingly aligns himself with white supremacists and the extreme right. Occasionally, the film lands a punch on the right nose. It is right to attack the burning of trees to make electricity. But when the film’s presenter and director, Jeff Gibbs, claims, “I found only one environmental leader willing to reject biomass and biofuels”, he can’t have been looking very far. Some people have been speaking out against them ever since they became a serious proposition (since 2004 in my case). Almost every environmental leader I know opposes the burning of fresh materials to generate power. There are also some genuine and difficult problems with renewable energy, particularly the mining of the necessary materials. But the film’s attacks on solar and wind power rely on a series of blatant falsehoods. It claims that, in producing electricity from renewables, “You use more fossil fuels to do this than you’re getting benefit from it. You would have been better off just burning fossil fuels in the first place”. This is flat wrong. On average, a solar panel generates 26 units of solar energy for every unit of fossil energy required to build and install it. For wind turbines the ratio is 44 to one. Planet of the Humans also claims that you can’t reduce fossil fuel use through renewable energy: coal is instead being replaced by gas. Well, in the third quarter of 2019, renewables in the UK generated more electricity than coal, oil and gas plants put together. As a result of the switch to renewables in this country, the amount of fossil fuel used for power generation has halved since 2010. By 2025, the government forecasts, roughly half our electricity will come from renewables, while gas burning will drop by a further 40%. To hammer home its point, the film shows footage of a “large terminal to import natural gas from the United States” that “Germany just built”. Germany has no such terminal. The footage was shot in Turkey. There is also a real story to be told about the co-option and capture of some environmental groups by the industries they should hold to account. A remarkable number of large conservation organisations take money from fossil fuel companies. This is a disgrace. But rather than pinning the blame where it lies, Planet of the Humans concentrates its attacks on Bill McKibben, the co-founder of 350.org, who takes no money from any of his campaigning work. It’s an almost comic exercise in misdirection, but unfortunately it has horrible, real-world consequences, as McKibben now faces even more threats and attacks than he confronted before. But this is by no means the worst of it. The film offers only one concrete solution to our predicament: the most toxic of all possible answers. “We really have got to start dealing with the issue of population … without seeing some sort of major die-off in population, there’s no turning back.” Yes, population growth does contribute to the pressures on the natural world. But while the global population is rising by 1% a year, consumption, until the pandemic, was rising at a steady 3%. High consumption is concentrated in countries where population growth is low. Where population growth is highest, consumption tends to be extremely low. Almost all the growth in numbers is in poor countries largely inhabited by black and brown people. When wealthy people, such as Moore and Gibbs, point to this issue without the necessary caveats, they are saying, in effect, “it’s not Us consuming, it’s Them breeding.” It’s not hard to see why the far right loves this film. Population is where you go when you haven’t thought your argument through. Population is where you go when you don’t have the guts to face the structural, systemic causes of our predicament: inequality, oligarchic power, capitalism. Population is where you go when you want to kick down. We have been here many times before. Dozens of films have spread falsehoods about environmental activists and ripped into green technologies, while letting fossil fuels off the hook. But never before have these attacks come from a famous campaigner for social justice, rubbing our faces in the dirt. • George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"australia-news/2020/sep/06/with-record-new-solar-and-wind-installed-australias-clean-energy-is-booming-for-now","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2020-09-05T20:00:04Z","webTitle":"With record new solar and wind installed, Australia's clean energy is booming – for now","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/sep/06/with-record-new-solar-and-wind-installed-australias-clean-energy-is-booming-for-now","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2020/sep/06/with-record-new-solar-and-wind-installed-australias-clean-energy-is-booming-for-now","fields":{"headline":"With record new solar and wind installed, Australia's clean energy is booming – for now","bodyText":"The numbers make a clear case that renewable energy is booming in Australia. Data released last week by the government’s Clean Energy Regulator suggests 6.3 gigawatts of new solar and wind energy – roughly equivalent in capacity to four large coal plants – will be installed across the country this year. It would equal the record set last year, and is about five times greater than what was installed in 2016. The Victorian, Queensland and NSW governments are setting up renewable energy zones in regional areas, aiming to give developers confidence they can get connected to the grid, something that has not recently been guaranteed. Labor governments in Victoria and Queensland also have schemes to buy power from a set amount of large-scale clean energy farms at a fixed price, giving developers a revenue guarantee that helps them secure finance in a troubled investment market. The Andrews government last week said it would look to sign up another 600 megawatts through its renewable energy target auction program. It follows the 927 megawatts it backed in 2017. Together, the two rounds will support clean energy roughly equivalent in capacity to the giant Hazelwood coal plant that shut nearly four years ago. Victoria’s energy and climate change minister, Lily D’Ambrosio, said the auction should be seen as part of the global push for what are often called “green recovery” programs. “It will help drive our economic recovery from coronavirus,” she said. “It’s not only good for our economy, it will deliver more reliable, affordable energy to households across Victoria.” Though still in their relative infancy, large-scale lithium batteries that will provide part of the flexible supply needed to underpin variable solar and wind are winning support at a largely unheralded rate. The owner of the country’s first giant battery farm at Hornsdale, in South Australia, last week announced it had completed a 50% expansion. There are battery projects promised or in development in Queensland, Victoria and NSW. A growing band of major companies, some of them facing escalating pressure from shareholders to act on the climate crisis, are also increasingly backing clean energy. In the past 10 days, mining and emitting giant BHP announced an agreement to get half the electricity it needs to run coalmines in Queensland from wind and solar; supermarket chain Aldi promised it would be running on 100% renewable energy by next year; and tech giant Apple said it would invest in renewable energy in Australia as part of a worldwide push to be carbon neutral by 2030. The Morrison government, which has primarily been promoting the need for a taxpayer-funded expansion of gas, a fossil fuel, to drive the economic recovery, said the Clean Energy Regulator data showed renewable energy was thriving. In a statement, the energy and emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, said more renewables was good news for the economy, the environment and people hanging out for lower energy prices. “Australia is a world leader in renewable energy,” he said. “This dispels the myths that some continue to spread around of a stall in investment.” But does it? A case can also be made that investment in renewable energy has not only stalled but slumped in a way likely to be felt in the years ahead. The data released by the regulator relates to delivery – how much renewable energy is being connected to the grid and rooftops. Because it can take a couple of years to get from an investment decision to a big energy project being in the ground, it means connections are a lagging indicator of what is happening in the market. A more up-to-date picture comes from new investment decisions. Dylan McConnell, a researcher at the University of Melbourne’s climate and energy college, last week posted data from Bloomberg New Energy Finance that shows investment has plunged by about US$500m (AU$687m) in each of the past three quarters. From a peak of nearly US$3bn (AU$4.12bn) in the final three months of 2018, new spending dropped to just US$400m (AU$549m) in the June quarter this year. This is broadly consistent with research by Reserve Bank economists, who noted the economic impact. They found large-scale renewable energy made up nearly 5% of non-mining investment across the country in 2018 before falling away markedly. McConnell says the data for installations and investment are both legitimate measures, but it is worth paying attention to the latter. “In a year or two we would expect new connections to be quite different because of it,” he said. Analysts say investment has fallen for two reasons – the rising challenge of getting the growing number of new large-scale farms connected to the grid and the effective end of incentives from the national renewable energy target. The target requires energy retailers to sell at least 33,000 gigawatt-hours of electricity, roughly 23% of all generation across the grid, from renewable sources by 2020. This level of generation was reached by mid-2019. As a result, the target has stopped being an incentive for new projects. It has not been replaced. Without it, and without a policy to tell investors when the country’s fleet of ageing coal-fired power plants will close, there is no national policy to keep private investment at the record levels of recent years. The federal government is content with this. While claiming credit for the record growth in solar and wind, its policies are designed to slow the increase in the years ahead. It says transmission links are needed and has promised to underwrite flexible energy sources that can be called on at any time. These sources include pumped hydro and, though the Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo) has suggested it may not be the cheapest option for consumers, new gas-fired power. Analysts say it has been slow to develop these programs – it is nearly 18 months since the underwriting scheme was promised – and that what it is planning is an unnecessary intervention that will scare off new investment from other companies. A key question is whether the states – particularly the three big eastern states, which trail South Australia and Tasmania on renewable generation by some distance – can fill the relative void in new renewable energy investment that opened over the past year. Victoria and Queensland both have schemes that underwrite a minimum energy price to ensure solar and wind farms are built. New South Wales has promised new renewable energy zones in the central west and New England, and promised $119m for the planning, coordination, transmission and storage needed to support them. Tristan Edis, a director and analyst with Green Energy Markets, says the avalanche of projects already in development, assuming all are built, combined with the state programs, should lead to about 50% of supply coming from renewable sources by 2030. This is in line with government projections and up from about 25% today. To put this into perspective, ClimateWorks, a respected not-for-profit, estimated Australia would need 79% clean energy by 2030 to be on track to play its part to meet the goals of the Paris agreement. The extraordinary uptake of rooftop solar is likely to continue, building on what is expected to be about 45% growth in the number of panels going up this year. It is forcing regulators to look at ways to harness the massive surge in solar energy when the sun is high in the middle of the day, in part through support for household batteries that can save it to use at other times. But the growth in large-scale generation has started to fall off. The Clean Energy Regulator forecasts accreditation of new projects will be down about 17% in 2020 compared with last year. Edis says there is a significant number of solar and wind projects already in development that will enter the market over the next two years, but it is then expected to drop. Green Energy Market calculated Victoria should jump from 30% renewable energy by the end of this year to 65% by 2030, but Queensland and New South Wales would grow more slowly, up from 20% by the end of the year to 38% and 35% respectively. Edis says governments are right to focus on upgrading the grid, improving connections between states and regions, and developing energy storage programs. But he says these steps could be taken while continuing to drive a rapid uptake of renewables in the lagging northern states. “We have a genuine problem here with a lack of coordination,” he says. “The states are doing the best they can, but ideally if this was nationally coordinated we wouldn’t be building as many solar farms in north-west Victoria, you would be building them in northern NSW and central Queensland.” While everyone, from the government down, agrees the transition underway in the electricity system is historic and complicated, McConnell says the current approach suffers from being piecemeal and ad-hoc. “You need renewable energy incentives, growing demand, or a coal closure program,” he says. “If we don’t have those, you’re not going to get the investment we need to address our climate commitments.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2020/aug/08/india-prime-minister-narendra-modi-plans-to-fell-ancient-forest-to-create-40-new-coal-fields","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2020-08-08T07:00:01Z","webTitle":"India plans to fell ancient forest to create 40 new coalfields","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/08/india-prime-minister-narendra-modi-plans-to-fell-ancient-forest-to-create-40-new-coal-fields","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2020/aug/08/india-prime-minister-narendra-modi-plans-to-fell-ancient-forest-to-create-40-new-coal-fields","fields":{"headline":"India plans to fell ancient forest to create 40 new coalfields","bodyText":"Over the past decade, Umeshwar Singh Amra has witnessed his homeland descend into a battleground. The war being waged in Hasdeo Arand, a rich and biodiverse Indian forest, has pitted indigenous people, ancient trees, elephants and sloth bears against the might of bulldozers, trucks and hydraulic jacks, fighting with a single purpose: the extraction of coal. Yet under a new “self-reliant India” plan by the prime minister, Narendra Modi, to boost the economy post-Covid-19 and reduce costly imports, 40 new coalfields in some of India’s most ecologically sensitive forests are to be opened up for commercial mining. Among them are four huge blocks of Hasdeo Arand’s 420,000 acres of forest in the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh, which sit above an estimated 5bn tonnes of coal. It marks a significant shift. The coal industry in India is state-owned, but this auction of 40 new coal blocks will see the creation of a privatised, commercial coal sector in India. Among those bidding for it are India’s rich and powerful industrial giants, including the $14bn (£11bn) Adani group run by the Indian billionaire Gautam Adani, who operates India’s largest coal power plants and has close ties to Modi. The coal auction has already proved controversial at both the local and political level. At least seven of the coal blocks up for auction were previously deemed “no go” areas for mining due to their environmentally valuable status and about 80% of the blocks are home to indigenous communities and thick forest cover. Four state governments – West Bengal, Maharashtra, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh – have written to Modi in opposition or raised legal objections to the auction, and one coal block, which overlapped with the Tadoba tiger reserve in Maharashtra, has already been removed. Amra, who is an Adivasi, a term used to describe India’s indigenous people, was one of nine local sarpanchs – village leaders – who recently wrote to Modi demanding a stop to the auction in Hasdeo Arand. He said: “If the government gave me the option to give up my life in exchange for no more mining happening in the forest, I would do it in a second.” Amra has seen first-hand the environmental devastation wreaked by open-cast coal mines. In 2011, two vast open-cast mines were excavated on the forest’s peripheries, ripping up the fragile land and filling the surroundings with pollution, smoke, heat, noise and poison. Crime rose drastically in the area and the elephants that lived in the forest, disoriented by the new hostile conditions, became aggressive, leading to dozens of deaths. The prospect of more significant blocks of the forest, the largest in India, being handed over to private mining operations was more than Amra could bear. Five villages will be destroyed and more than 6,000 mainly indigenous people displaced, as well as thousands of hectares of trees, torn down for mines and roads. “If more mining happens everything will change; the natural resources will be gone, our way of life will disappear, everything will be under threat,” he said. “We are tribal people, we cannot go out and live in the cities and no amount of money can ever compensate us. There is no forest like this in the world – cut it down and it can never be replaced.” While across the world governments have geared towards a “green recovery” post Covid-19 – the United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, said recently there was “no good reason for any country to include coal” in recovery plans – India is putting fossil fuel at the forefront of its strategy to turn the pandemic into economic opportunity. “Why cannot India be the world’s largest exporter of coal?” asked Modi as he announced the coal auction project. Yet with its 45% ash content, making it some of the most polluting coal in the world, there is unlikely to be an international market for Indian coal. In addition, many major factories in India cannot run on “dirty” domestic coal, meaning they will still need to import it from abroad. There is also a question of necessity. While India is the world’s second largest consumer of coal, and annually imports 247m tonnes, costing more than $20bn (£15bn), India’s electricity demand is forecast to fall by up to 15% over the next five years due to the economic reverberations of Covid-19. Meanwhile, a report this week by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air concluded that the current state-run coal mines of India already have capacity to produce 20% more coal than the expected demand in 2030. Environmental activists also question why India cannot be weaned off foreign coal through a gradual increase in investment in domestic renewable energy, such as solar. This month, Modi inaugurated Asia’s largest solar farm in the state of Madhya Pradesh. India is the world’s cheapest producer of solar power and the cost of constructing a new solar plant is 14% less than that of a building a new coal plant. With proper investment, it has been estimated that the solar energy industry could generate as many as 1.6m jobs in India by 2022, far more than would be generated by domestic coal. But India’s joint secretary for coal, Maddirala Nagaraju, said that all the country’s projections showed that demand for coal would increase and insisted that increased domestic coalmining was the “cheapest way of meeting the energy needs of the people”. “We are the country with the fourth largest coal reserves in the world and we need to provide energy security for over a billion people: coal is the only way,” said Nagaraju. He conceded that there would be “costly trade-offs” in opening up protected forest areas for mining, but said this had the support of local communities who “want the land to be acquired because they get high compensation packages”. He added: “Yes, some people have objected, but the mining will bring a lot of development, employment and money to these areas. How else will we develop these Adivasi people in central India?” Among the prominent opponents to the project is the former environment minister, Jairan Ramesh, who also wrote a letter to Modi condemning coal auctions. It was during his time in office that a survey was carried out in 2010 on India’s biggest coalfields and determined that 30% were “no-go areas” due to their biodiversity or resident tiger or elephant populations. Yet since Modi came to power in 2014, that 30% has been reduced to about 5%. Ramesh alleged this was a direct result of pressure from the powerful corporate coal lobby, Adani in particular. The Adani group is contracted to operate two of the mines currently open in Hasdeo Arand, and has been pushing to expand mining operations in the forest for years, even reportedly offering microloans to local tribal people in order to win their support. “Adani is behind this,” claims Ramesh. “He is one of the most influential forces on the government.” “Modi poses as a great environmental champion globally but his track record is one of complete loosening of environmental laws and regulations,” Ramesh added. “The corporate lobbies are just too powerful and in the name of ease for businesses, environment has become the biggest casualty.” The Adani group rejected the allegations as baseless and politically motivated. A spokesperson said the company: “Has always strived to provide balanced and affordable energy supply to an energy-deprived population of 1.3 billion people whose per capita energy consumption is less than half the world’s average and almost one-tenth of many of the developed economies. “The Adani Group has been a leading contributor to India’s vision for a balanced energy mix and an enabler of India’s leadership in meeting its [Paris agreement on climate change] target.” It said it aimed to become the world’s largest renewable energy company by 2025. • This article was amended on 18 August 2020.

Even before the virus struck, some residents were left incommunicado for weeks at a time in a personal lockdown hell. Research shows that hearing loss increases substantially the risk of dementia and grassroots voluntary organisations across the country testify to the patchy provision available. When will the government act? Wally Harbert Frome, Somerset Nicci Gerrard’s article resonated with my experience of trying to stay in touch with my 93-year-old father. He is in a care home, and has dementia. He isn’t allowed out of his small room, and over the past seven weeks I have noticed a marked deterioration in his mental health. Covid-19 is indirectly hastening his demise. Josephine Howell Great Baddow, Essex Asylum seekers ignored I read with interest the article by Helena Smith about the low rate of the pandemic in Greece (“Greeks marvel at British Covid chaos as their lockdown lifts after just 150 deaths”, News). However, she does not mention that there are 37,427 asylum seekers in five of Greece’s islands (Chios, Kos, Leros, Lesbos and Samos), with facilities for only 6,095. They are kept literally as prisoners, living in sub-standard accommodation, without an entitlement to health services. The Human Rights Watch representative, Belkis Wille, declared last month that the situation in the islands is approaching a human catastrophe. The EU has provided Greece with funding to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic, but the Greek government is not even attempting to improve the inhuman conditions in the camps. It is estimated that another 100,000 refugees live in mainland Greece. They may be living in better conditions than those left on the islands, but most of them too are in poor accommodation where the sanitary conditions are conducive to the spread of coronavirus. Professor Shulamit Ramon The University of Hertfordshire Hatfield, Herts Road closures just the start I read with excitement your coverage of the announcement that roads around schools are to be closed to keep everyone safer (“Roads near schools to close at peak times”, News). While I welcome any steps to reduce traffic on the school run, having successfully delivered one of the UK’s first traffic-free schools I’m afraid that closing roads alone will not have the desired impact. At Ysgol Hamadryad in Cardiff, we decided from the outset to build a sustainable travel school. We worked closely with parents on mapping suitable routes and identifying any barriers to such travel. These included dangerous road junctions, lack of access to cycles/scooters, lack of confidence among children and timing challenges. We delivered a range of measures, including: a walking bus that runs every day of the year; cycling and scooting lessons from year one; plenty of bike and scooter parking; driving and parking restrictions in the immediate vicinity; working out particularly challenging road junctions; support for parents to access low-cost bikes and scooters. In our first six months of operation, some 98% of children’s journeys to the school were active. My plea to schools that will hopefully follow our example is to consider all aspects of travel to school, not just closing roads. By doing so, we can ensure that sustainable school runs are the future for all schools. Dr Dafydd Trystan, chair of governors Ysgol Hamadryad, Cardiff Nuclear power? No thanks Your business leader urges massive government intervention in support of new – as-yet not even designed – military-derived “small modular reactors” from Rolls Royce (“Government could save jobs at Rolls – if it reacts quickly”). Yet wind and solar energy prices are dropping precipitously. The British Isles have some of the best renewable resources in the world. There is no technical reason why the UK could not be fully and economically powered this way – more quickly creating far greater employment, with more secure export prospects. Even well established forms of nuclear are rapidly declining in competitiveness worldwide. The nuclear industry has a track record of catastrophically expensive hype and disappointment on speculative new ventures like this, so there are no rational grounds to divert investment or employment away from renewables in the way you urge so strongly.

The late Leslie Lever, Labour MP for Manchester Ardwick, and later life peer, used to tell a story in the Commons’ tea room about an encounter during the 1950 general election campaign, when he had made a fiery socialist speech at an open-air meeting in Manchester. As the meeting broke up, he was approached by an elderly gent, who said to him: “I used to believe all this stuff, but I don’t any more.” “What’s your name?” Lever asked. “Victor Grayson,” he replied, and slipped into the crowd. If true, this would appear to corroborate the view that he was not murdered, but escaped into anonymity.

The legislation, passed by the Senate late on Wednesday, includes a $60bn bailout for airlines. Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the Democrat-controlled House, had proposed a requirement for airlines to cut their planet-warming emissions in half by 2050, but that provision is not in the bill. The House is expected to vote on the package on Friday. It also includes nearly $500bn in lending authority that one environment group, Friends of the Earth, called a “corporate slush fund with insufficient guardrails to protect workers, taxpayers and the climate”. Congressional Republicans have accused Democrats of taking advantage of the Covid-19 pandemic to pursue climate policy. The Senate leader, Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, said this week that Democrats were “bargaining as usual” with “counter-offers that demanded things like new emission standards or tax credits for solar panels”. Multiple Republican politicians tweeted accusing Democrats of trying to usher in a Green New Deal with massive climate spending during a crisis. In the end, the stimulus package focused on direct aid to individuals and the worst-hit industries, while setting climate considerations aside. Annie Petsonk, international counsel for the Environmental Defense Fund, said that while the situation for airlines and their workers was dire, the industry should have had to commit to slashing emissions as a condition of the aid. “The provisions we were focused on simply would hold the airlines to what they already said they’re going to do,” Petsonk said. “People do not want to solve one crisis by making another crisis worse.” The 2008 auto industry bailout, in comparison, led to stricter rules for pollution from vehicle tailpipes. The bill, the third in a series of stimulus packages, offers virtually nothing to climate advocates, but it is not the last word. Scott Segal, a lawyer and lobbyist with the firm Bracewell LLC, which represents energy industry clients, said a fourth stimulus deal was likely to involve “significant discussions of green objectives”. “Was this a missed opportunity for climate? I think the answer to that is no,” Segal said. “This stimulus package was primarily about getting money into the hands of individual households and workers and in some service sectors that were particularly hurt.” Kevin Book, the managing director of ClearView Energy Partners, a research firm, said: “Congress is going to be making more deals, and as long as there is a deal to be made, Democrats have made clear what they want.” Democrats negotiated multiple measures meant to prevent abuse of the $500bn available in lending, including an oversight board, a special inspector general and provisions aimed at limiting Donald Trump’s businesses from benefiting – an issue that has already come under scrutiny. But climate hawks said those stipulations were not strong enough. “What makes this so frightening is that there are very few binding restrictions on how this money can be used that the secretary of treasury cannot waive,” said Lukas Ross, a senior policy analyst with Friends of the Earth. “It’s great that [Trump’s son-in-law ] Jared Kushner isn’t going to get a subsidised line of credit. It’s much more worrying in human terms that Chevron, Exxon and every other polluter you can imagine is eligible to be propped up in terms of the stimulus package.” The bill also does not include specific assistance to the renewable energy industry, although trade associations and lobbyists expect to revisit that possibility as discussions continue about more targeted aid for at-risk sectors of the economy. The American Wind Energy Association (AWEA) projects that the US wind industry could lose 35,000 jobs and $35bn in investment. Those losses could lead to lease payment and tax revenue reductions for local and state governments. No tax credit extensions have been granted for the solar and wind industries, meaning they may lose access to credits if they miss deadlines. “Obviously of primary importance is the public health and keeping the economy moving. We applaud that big effort,” said Tom Kiernan, the chief executive of the AWEA, adding that his group would continue to push for tax provisions to stem industry losses. The Solar Energy Industries Association said the solar sector could lose half its jobs, meaning “125,000 families who will no longer receive a paycheck”. Abigail Ross Hopper, its president and CEO, said: “Legislators were really focused on industry-wide protections and assistance, like the unemployment insurance, like the loans for which our companies are eligible, and did not include industry-specific solutions for a couple of particularly hard hit ones.” In one climate win for Democrats, the bill does not include a discussed $3bn to buy oil to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in order to lift global oil prices."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2020/may/29/fulbright-scholarships-are-not-a-panacea-for-the-worlds-ills-but-an-avenue-of-hope","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2020-05-29T03:22:55Z","webTitle":"Fulbright scholarships are not a panacea for the world's ills but an avenue of hope | Ranjana Srivastava","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/29/fulbright-scholarships-are-not-a-panacea-for-the-worlds-ills-but-an-avenue-of-hope","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2020/may/29/fulbright-scholarships-are-not-a-panacea-for-the-worlds-ills-but-an-avenue-of-hope","fields":{"headline":"Fulbright scholarships are not a panacea for the world's ills but an avenue of hope","bodyText":"Three months ago, Indians were witnessing communal violence, Syrian children were freezing to death and locusts were terrorising Africa. Venezuelans craved reform, China was oppressing minorities and Kiribati was sinking. Although the pandemic has wiped these issues off the front page, we will still need to reckon with them one day. But at a time when mutual cooperation and problem-solving seems the only way forward, the world appears to be a confusing and partisan place where leaders take a special delight in skewering their opponents with language and conduct that would be banned on a playground. When fealty and praise are valued above honesty and transparency, it’s hard for optimism to flourish. Consequently, there is a real temptation for the average person to feel disempowered and hence disengaged from the issues facing broader society. Perhaps, if we can juggle endless Zoom meetings, avoid an argument at home and manage to cook something largely edible, it is enough. And maybe this is why I’ve been reflecting on something that serves as a fitting antidote to my own inward-looking tendencies. Late February wasn’t so long ago but now it seems like another era when the Great Hall of the Australian parliament hosted a gala event to recognise the recipients of this year’s Fulbright awards. The Fulbright program is the flagship foreign exchange scholarship program of the United States, aimed at increasing cultural understanding, collaboration and the exchange of ideas. It was established by Senator William Fulbright in 1946 by using credits from the sale of surplus war material to fund academic exchanges between host nations and the US. In the past 70 years, 400,000 Fulbright recipients from around the world have attended the program. Being the fortunate recipient of a second Fulbright award to study public policy at the Harvard Kennedy School gave me much food for thought. Each year, several doctors receive a Fulbright and it’s easy to see why. After all, infections, diabetes, heart disease and cancer are ubiquitous threats to population health. Also, we need an opioid policy that limits harm while doing good and societies must ponder how artificial intelligence engages with healthcare. But something I increasingly realise is that the status society accords to healthcare workers, especially frontline clinicians, can trick us into thinking that only health is wealth. Time spent with the sick and needy patients makes us rightly passionate about healthcare but of course, a civil society requires far, far more: good infrastructure, sound education, affordable housing, a clean environment, human rights, and able government to name but a few. Consequently, my favourite part of a Fulbright event is meeting those who consider issues that I frankly know very little about. How do we defend our water assets? What will make solar energy more efficient? How do we nurture artists and musicians in a world obsessed with immediate outcomes? What minerals will help the transition to green energy? How do fish and grasshoppers affect our ecosystem? What afflicts our cotton and wheat? How do we tackle modern slavery, sports integrity and addictive gaming? How can we improve education? Why does space research matter? These are just some of the questions this year’s Fulbright scholars are asking on behalf of society. As someone whose thinking as a doctor and a global citizen has been transformed by Senator Fulbright’s vision, I am often asked two questions. What does it take to win a Fulbright award? A good education, not to be confused with an elite upbringing. Most scholars neither attend prestigious institutions nor have “connected” families; indeed, many hail from small towns with scarce opportunities and even less patience for the problems of the world. But the common thread is they found one person who fired their imagination and challenged them to think differently. A sound early education opens doors by prompting broad curiosity, individual persistence and interdisciplinary collaboration. Incidentally, educated parents are writ large in the lives of Fulbright scholars. It was impossible for my Indian parents to entertain such an undertaking for themselves, but their education imbued them with a deep enthusiasm for learning. A rising tide lifts all boats, which is why an excellent educational system is the foundation of a successful society and why we should demand early learning, pay teachers well, support higher education and applaud researchers. In order to flourish, we all need someone who asks why not, instead of what for. What are Fulbright scholars like? They are ordinary people from all walks of life with one important attribute – they think deeply about an idea and are unafraid to take a measured risk in pursuit of a goal. Scholars spend years crystallising their thoughts and honing their case. There is no age limit and the oldest scholars have decades over the youngest. Being bold enough to champion an idea yet humble enough to recognise one’s limitations matters. Vision is important. But most important is grit and the ability to persevere in the face of rejection, something everyone eventually encounters. A society thrives not just by producing scholars but by equipping all its citizens to discover their potential. Again, this is the real power of a good education. The final address to this year’s Fulbright scholars came from Sara James, an Emmy award-winning American journalist and author who barely alluded to her considerable personal accomplishments. But you could hear a pin drop when she evoked the experience of raising a child with a disability and the inevitable collision of personal ambition with parental responsibility and societal advocacy. Delivered with grace and humility, her words were an unforgettable reminder that in life, reward and responsibility are frequently intertwined and it is up to us to take some and give back substantially more. Senator Fulbright memorably called his namesake program not a panacea but an avenue of hope that would give us “the ability to see the world as others see it and to allow for the possibility that others may see something we have failed to see, or may see it more accurately.” Never have his words sounded more prophetic. You may be the next Fulbright scholar, or indeed, the reason someone decides to apply. Either way, applications are now open to find another group of curious thinkers. Go ahead and have a look. • Ranjana Srivastava is an Australian oncologist, award-winning author and Fulbright scholar.

The agreement reached between federal ministers and representatives of four coalmining states removes a key hurdle in Germany’s plan to curb greenhouse gas emissions over the coming decades. Some regions, particularly in the less prosperous east, are heavily dependent on mining lignite, or brown coal. Together with imported bituminous – or black – coal it provides about a third of Germany’s electricity needs but is also responsible for a big share of the country’s carbon emissions. The finance minister, Olaf Scholz, said that operators of heavily polluting coal-fired power plants in western Germany will receive €2.6bn (£2.2bn) in compensation for switching them off early, while €1.75bn will go to those with plants in the east. RWE, Germany’s biggest power producer, said it would cut some 6,000 jobs, or nearly a third of its current workforce, by 2030 as the country phases out brown coal as an energy source. It said the compensation offered was less than the €3.5bn hit it estimated it would take, even excluding the expected loss of profits. However, the deal pushed up RWE’s share price by 2%, their highest level in five years. The compensation for the utilities is on top of €40bn that the government has already promised to coalmining regions to soften the economic blow of abandoning the fossil fuel. The government said reviews will be carried out in 2026 and 2029 to determine whether Germany can exit coal-fired electricity generation in 2035, three years before the final deadline. “What we have here is a good agreement for climate protection because it makes clear that we mean it seriously,” the economy minister Peter Altmaier said. Environmental campaigners criticised the decision, though, noting that the agreement will still mean a new coal-fired plant – Datteln 4 – goes online this year and allow for the expansion of the Garzweiler opencast mine in western Germany, although a nearby forest that has been the target of long-running protests will be spared. “Australia’s forests are burning, millions of people are demonstrating for climate protection and the German government is clearing the way for a new coal power plant,” said Martin Kaiser, the managing director of Greenpeace Germany. “Nothing shows more clearly than Datteln 4 that this government can’t find an answer to the climate crisis. “Chancellor [Angela] Merkel has missed a chance today to provide companies with long-term planning safety and to send a signal that Germany is reacting appropriately to the climate crisis.” Eric Schweitzer, who heads the Association of German Chambers of Commerce and Industry, said a key question is how the electricity currently coming from coal-fired power plants will be replaced. The government has set a target of generating 65% of Germany’s electricity from renewable sources by 2030. The environment minister, Svenja Schulze, acknowledged that Germany will need a “massive expansion of wind and solar energy” as the country is also in the process of exiting atomic power. The last nuclear reactor is set to go offline at the end of 2022. “We are the first country that is exiting nuclear and coal power on a binding basis and this is an important international signal that we are sending,” she said of Thursday’s agreement. The head of Germany’s main industrial lobby group, BDI, urged the government not to wait until 2026 – three years after the shutdown of the last nuclear plant – to review the measures. However, Altmaier, the economy minister, said that while there would less “excess production” in Germany in the future, “we are very sure that we can ensure sufficient electricity supply for business but also for private consumers”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2019/jul/26/getting-to-grips-with-the-climate-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2019-07-26T15:27:44Z","webTitle":"Getting to grips with the climate crisis | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/26/getting-to-grips-with-the-climate-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2019/jul/26/getting-to-grips-with-the-climate-crisis","fields":{"headline":"Getting to grips with the climate crisis","bodyText":"Our political system has been hijacked by a cabal of ideologically driven free marketeers with no democratic mandate.

Ofgem’s regulation of Britain’s energy networks has facilitated the huge expansion of renewable electricity generation over the last decade, and we are working with the government and other stakeholders to help decarbonise how we heat our homes, businesses and transport, particularly through electric vehicles. This month Ofgem published its new corporate vision, which set out our objective of helping decarbonise the economy at the lowest cost to consumers in support of the recently passed legislation enshrining in law the target of net zero carbon emissions for the UK by 2050. Ultimately government is responsible for setting the policy for the energy sector and proposing any changes to Ofgem’s statutory framework. Dermot Nolan Chief executive, Ofgem • Ian McNicholas (Letters, 24 July) suggests we need a new home once this planet becomes uninhabitable for humans. Why? What is so important about the (often deeply unpleasant) human race that it needs to be continued past its evolutionary sell-by date? What gives us the right for permanence in a constantly changing universe? Any regrets about the extinction of life on Earth might be directed at non-human life, which has at least not accelerated its own demise. Let us not cry for the end of the human race, which exists in the blink of an eye compared with the lifespan and enormity of the universe. Given life popped up here, it will more than likely pop up elsewhere (if it has not already done so). Simon Lawton-Smith London • Elle Hunt raises valid points on rising temperatures (This isn’t just a heatwave. It’s an alarm call, 25 July) but there are worse concerns. As ice sheets melt, they reflect less solar energy, the exposed darker surfaces absorb more heat and previously frozen trapped gases escape. The effects spread to permafrost and could easily swamp even major reductions from human activities. If this seems over-pessimistic, consider how Arctic temperatures have recently soared despite few of the obvious sources of human emissions. One potential solution involves geoengineering to limit solar input above the poles, with some methods mimicking how debris from volcanic eruptions can block sunlight. I mentioned this option to the Department of Energy and Climate Change; they helpfully gave me more details of such methods but then, despite allowing fracking, told me the idea was too risky. Compared with what, I wonder?

The IEA, or International Energy Agency, predicts that solar energy will play a big role in supporting the continent’s growing population and industrialisation over the next 20 years. Africa has less than half the solar power installations seen in the UK, despite the sunnier conditions, but the IEA is predicting a solar boom in countries across the continent, which could give hundreds of millions of homes electricity for the first time. The report forecasts that Africa’s appetite for energy will grow at double the rate of the global average in the coming decades as the continent overtakes China and India as the most populated region in the world. Africa’s population is expected to grow to more than 2 billion people by 2040, a rise of 800 million from today or the population equivalent of the US and Europe combined, says the report. People are expected to turn to cities and towns at a rate never seen before, where the demand for new houses and infrastructure will ignite an energy-hungry industrial revolution. Fatih Birol, executive director of the IEA, said Africa had a “unique opportunity” to leapfrog the fossil fuel dependency of other industrialised regions and host the first economic transformation that did not contribute to the climate crisis. “I am optimistic about Africa’s energy future – it will surprise pessimists,” Birol said. “I have great expectations for the energy industry in the years to come, both in terms of bringing energy access to Africa’s people but also driving economic growth.” He urged Africa’s leaders to take advantage of the natural resources available through solar power generation, and the mining of raw minerals needed to make electric and hydrogen batteries, which are in high demand across the world. He said some fossil fuels, such as natural gas, would be needed to support Africa’s heavy industries as they built the towns and cities needed to house the continent’s growing population. But the increase would be insignificant in the wider global climate effort, according to the IEA. Birol said: “Africa’s total contribution to cumulative global emissions from energy over the last 100 years is only 2%, which is half the emissions of Germany today. If everyone in Africa had access to energy this 2% will rise to just 3% – it’s still nothing. It’s peanuts compared to other countries in the world which are using fossil fuels such as coal for energy. “But while Africa does not contribute to climate change the continent is on the frontline of its potential effects, including droughts. Africa is perhaps the most innocent continent in terms of its contributions to climate change, but they will be the victims.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2020/apr/17/polluter-bailouts-and-lobbying-during-covid-19-pandemic","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2020-04-17T09:00:10Z","webTitle":"Polluter bailouts and lobbying during Covid-19 pandemic","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/17/polluter-bailouts-and-lobbying-during-covid-19-pandemic","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2020/apr/17/polluter-bailouts-and-lobbying-during-covid-19-pandemic","fields":{"headline":"Polluter bailouts and lobbying during Covid-19 pandemic","bodyText":"Polluting industries around the world are using the coronavirus pandemic to gain billions of dollars in bailouts and to weaken and delay environmental protections. The moves have been described as dangerous and irresponsible by senior figures. They say the unprecedented sums of money being committed to the global recovery are a historic opportunity to tackle the climate crisis, but such action has not been taken to date. Fossil fuels The fossil fuel industry, which already benefits from a $5tn-a-year subsidy, according to the IMF, has had the biggest wins during the coronavirus pandemic in the US and Canada. The controversial Keystone XL pipeline to transport tar sands oil from Canada to the US got the go-ahead, with $5bn in financial support from the Alberta government. US president Donald Trump called the move “GREAT news”. Other pipelines continued construction despite the lockdown. To “alleviate financial hardship” to the US fossil fuel industry, Trump directed the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to be filled to its maximum capacity. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a sweeping suspension of its enforcement of environmental laws, three days after a request from the American Petroleum Institute, and extended the period that the more polluting winter gasoline can be sold. Three US states passed laws criminalising fossil fuel protests – South Dakota, Kentucky and West Virginia. Republican senators asked the US federal government to “reduce, delay or suspend” taxes due on oil, gas and coal, while the National Mining Association lobbied to cut $220m in taxes intended to support coal miners affected by black lung disease. In China, as the worst impacts of the virus outbreak passed, there was a surge in permits for new coal-fired power plants. From 1 to 18 March, more coal-fired capacity was approved than in the whole of 2019. In South Korea, the major coal plant builder Doosan Heavy Industries got a $825m government bailout; green groups say the company was in deep financial trouble before the pandemic. In Australia, lobbyists welcomed the South Australia government’s move to defer taxes and other commitments to oil and gas explorers. Renewable energy In the US, assistance for the green energy sector was not included in the $2tn support package on 26 March, three days after 24 rightwing thinktanks, including the Competitive Enterprise Institute, said they were “deeply disturbed” by possibility of funding for “unreliable ‘green’ energy programs”. However, New York state did pass new laws to speed up clean energy projects. In Brazil, the energy regulator has indefinitely postponed green power auctions scheduled for 2020 and in South Africa, the state-owned power giant Eskom, which relies heavily on coal, said it will cut the wind power it had committed to buy. Motor industry In the US, the EPA finalised its rollback of Obama-era rules that made cars less polluting. In the EU, lobby groups argued for a delay in emissions reduction laws, although VW, BMW and Daimler say they are aiming to comply regardless of the virus crisis. Aviation A leaked letter from the International Air Transport Association describes its “aggressive” lobbying approach and includes a call for relief from corporate taxes, sales taxes, employer-paid payroll taxes and passenger ticket taxes. In the US, aviation got a $60bn bailout package and the suspension of many taxes. In the UK, major carrier easyJet got a £600m soft loan, weeks after its biggest shareholder received almost £60m in dividends. Farming In the EU, the farmers’ association Copa-Cogeca called for a further postponement of the “farm to fork” strategy, which is aimed at making agriculture less polluting. The call is backed by the rightwing EPP bloc, the largest group in the European parliament. In Germany, its farming lobby pushed for an easing of environmental standards, particularly those restricting fertiliser use, which are intended to reduce pollution. In the US, the American Farm Bureau Federation and the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association lobbied heavily and won a $23.5bn bailout package. Agricultural pollution is the cause of a huge “dead zone” in the Gulf of Mexico. Plastics and chemicals In the US, the plastic industry lobbied to remove bans on single-use plastic bags, citing hygiene concerns, and saw bans lifted in Maine, New Hampshire, Oregon and Massachusetts. The EPA also weakened the Toxic Substances Control Act for many chemical and petrochemical manufacturers. In the EU, plastic industry lobbyists asked the European commission to postpone implementation of the single-use plastic directive, intended to cut plastic pollution. However, the commission rejected this call. In England, a ban on plastic straws, stirrers and cotton buds that was due in April has been postponed. Timber In Indonesia, the trade ministry revoked rules requiring basic certification that wood exports were legally produced in response to lobbying from the furniture and logging industries, according to campaign group Mighty Earth. Green shoots The Covid-19 crisis has seen some backing for a sustainable recovery and rejections of polluter lobbying. G20 finance ministers committed to an “environmentally sustainable and inclusive recovery” and EU leaders backed “measures necessary to get back to a normal functioning of our societies and economies and to sustainable growth”. The European commission has not delayed its consultation on a new green finance strategy and is now considering imposing new requirements on firms to reduce the risk of biodiversity loss and pandemics. This is despite coal-heavy states including Poland and the Czech Republic urging the bloc to abandon its Green Deal plan and emissions trading scheme. In France, the government has approved 288 wind and solar energy projects and has relaxed deadlines and cancelled a planned withdrawal of rooftop solar subsidies. Germany rejected calls to ease the planned shutdown of its coal industry, while in Canada prime minister Justin Trudeau rejected the call from Albertan companies to postpone an increase in the federal carbon tax. The fallout from the pandemic is also delaying a number of big fossil fuel projects, from LNG terminals in Australia to coal plants in Indonesia."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2020/jan/17/where-does-change-come-from-climate","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2020-01-17T11:00:02Z","webTitle":"Where does change come from, and is it finally coming on climate?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/17/where-does-change-come-from-climate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2020/jan/17/where-does-change-come-from-climate","fields":{"headline":"Where does change come from, and is it finally coming on climate?","bodyText":"Where does change come from? What creates a pivotal moment or a tipping point? What, for example, stopped us drink-driving in the 1970s? What turned us off cigarettes over the past couple of decades? Why was English football roundly loathed in the early 1980s but the most popular spectator sport on the planet two decades later? What was it about 1991 that was fatal to the Soviet Union? Why did it take until 2011 for the Arab world to rise up against despots? I am no expert in change. (Perhaps you are – do get in touch and let me have your expertise, so I can pretend it is mine). But it’s my hunch that it comes not from government but from a fluid mishmash of factors: a startling event, some great new scientific insight, an inspiring individual, a sudden new generation, protest, advocacy and of course journalism. It’s also my hunch that these factors are conspiring right now to bring about a huge cultural shift in our relationship with the environment. Think about it: startling changes to the climate; irrefutable science, Greta Thunberg and Sir David Attenborough, school strikes, civil disobedience, newspaper campaigns. And now we are seeing the knock-on effects: fossil fuel divestment is accelerating, renewable capacity is soaring, single-use plastic bans are multiplying, carbon offsets are growing. Our attitude towards quotidian utilities like flying, coal and meat are undergoing a profound shift. It may be too little too late. But the Upside is going to catalogue it anyway, week in, week out.

The last time I was in a treehouse I was a bookish 11-year-old, who saw the spider-infested, lichen-covered box in the branches at the end of the garden as a private kingdom I could visit to rearrange my football-sticker swap piles. Now, in my 30s, could a weekend combining the two transport me back to the joys of childhood? Treehouses have moved up in the world in the past 20 years. Dafydd and Ceri Tomos, owners of Beudy Banc, have recently turned a traditional campsite into a glamping site, with cabins powered by wind and solar energy dotted around a lush valley near the Welsh market town of Machynlleth. In the branches of a giant oak, the treehouse is the most recent addition and thanks to a stove, shower and double bed, it has little in common with my childhood refuge. For a start, it has at least 20 miles of mountain bike routes on its doorstep. Dafydd’s email before we arrived described them as “downhill trails” but I know enough about hills to know that’s only half the story. Luckily, bikes my partner and I borrowed had a generous lowest gear that made all but the steepest sections easy to get up (slowly). Much of the route we chose was through fields of grazing sheep, and dismounting was necessary for the many gates connecting them, each one seemingly with a different locking mechanism to keep us on our toes. The ridge that runs above Beudy Banc provides panoramic views across the Dyfi valley, taking in Cardigan Bay to the west, the gently sloping peak of Cader Idris to the north and the Cambrian Mountains to the south. White specks of sheep dot the fields, far outnumbering humans – we covered about 20km over four hours, and two lost walkers were the only people we saw. As for the sheep, they were curious about us but as soon as we got too close they would turn and run. The treehouse cabin was a welcome sanctuary as the rain rolled in, with its hot shower and stove stocked with environmentally friendly sawdust briquettes. Within a few minutes we were warm and clean, and had a perfect view of the sunset through the enormous windows. The cabins have strong eco-credentials, too, using solar and wind power to supply the electric sockets. Although the nearest place to stock up on supplies is in Machynlleth, there was no risk of going hungry – in the nearby roadside verges alone we found wild damsons we stewed on the treehouse’s gas hob, as well as blackberries, hazelnuts and even a few mushrooms. After breakfast in the treehouse, we set out again on our bikes for the top of the ridge before descending on farm tracks into the village of Glantwymyn for a drink at the Dovey Valley Hotel. We planned a circular route that split our time between off-road trails and lightly trafficked B-roads, and stopped off for lunch at the White Lion in Machynlleth for the meatiest steak pie I’ve ever tasted. Bumping through pastures and down dirt tracks was tremendous fun and surprisingly easy for two cautious beginners more used to city cycling, but this part of Wales is a paradise for more-seasoned mountain bikers as well. Dafydd has built a snaking downhill track at Beudy Banc itself, and there are nationally renowned tracks a few miles north of Machynlleth, including the black-diamond-difficulty ClimachX trail. For the really tough, the area also hosts the annual Dyfi Enduro, a 56km endurance race. We relied on our bikes and the local taxi firms to get in and out of Machynlleth, a lively market town with five pubs, a few cafes and restaurants, three bookshops and several antique shops. It’s an ideal destination for walkers, too, with two long-distance footpaths, Glyndwr’s Way and the Dyfi Valley Way, passing through. A final morning walk through the fields was rewarded with the sight of squirrels darting up trees as the sun glinted off the dewy grass. A taxi back to Mach, as the locals refer to it, dropped us at the Tŷ Medi vegetarian cafe on the high street for buttery cheese scones and friendly questions from proud locals who were all keen to know where we had stayed, what we had done, and what we thought of their town. Fortunately, there was no need for polite white lies – I was more than happy to sing the praises of the area after a weekend that left me, if not quite 11 years old again, at least slightly rejuvenated. • The trip was provided by Canopy and Stars.

The device will be built on the site of an old fossil fuel plant in the north of England to power up to 50,000 homes for up to five hours. Unlike traditional lithium-ion batteries, which typically store electricity for a few hours, the “cryobattery” will be able to store energy for months. The UK’s first full-scale cryobattery, developed by Highview Power, uses renewable electricity to chill air to -196C, transforming it into a liquid that will be stored in large metal tanks. When renewable electricity levels are low the liquid can be turned back into gas, which is used to turn a turbine and generate electricity – but without burning the gas and releasing emissions. Highview Power claims its cryobattery will be the largest project in Europe capable of long-term energy storage. The full-scale “liquid air” battery has a capacity of 50MW or 250MWh over a five-hour release time. It follows the success of a 5MW pathfinder project built next to a landfill site in Bury, Greater Manchester, in summer 2018 with £8m of funding from Innovate UK. The chief executive of Highview Power said the battery could provide cost-efficient energy storage at old fossil fuel plants across the country to help balance the energy system. “More and more power plants are going to be decommissioned, and we are bringing a solution which can use the same energy infrastructure and grid connections to give a new life to these sites,” Javier Cavada said. He added that long-duration, giga-scale energy storage was the “necessary foundation” to help build a carbon-free energy system that relies heavily on wind and solar power. The global shift towards clean electricity has spurred a boom in battery technology development to help harness wind and solar energy, and a flurry of investment plans from energy utilities. Highview said the cryobattery would cost about £110 per MWh of electricity, using a 200MW system, which would make it one of the cheapest energy storage technologies. The claim comes after an Edinburgh-based start-up, Gravitricity, said Britain’s cheapest virtual battery could be created by hoisting and dropping 12,000-tonne weights down disused mine shafts. A study by Imperial College London said the gravity energy could cost $171 (£132) per MWh, compared with an average lithium-ion project of $367 (£283) per MWh. Cavada said the company planned to finalise agreements with its project partner and would secure deals with National Grid to help provide grid balancing services. He declined to comment on the name of the disused power plant Highview planned to use."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2019/dec/24/south-australias-clean-energy-shift-brings-lowest-power-prices-on-national-grid-audit-finds","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2019-12-23T17:00:49Z","webTitle":"South Australia’s clean-energy shift brings lowest power prices on national grid, audit finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/dec/24/south-australias-clean-energy-shift-brings-lowest-power-prices-on-national-grid-audit-finds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2019/dec/24/south-australias-clean-energy-shift-brings-lowest-power-prices-on-national-grid-audit-finds","fields":{"headline":"South Australia’s clean-energy shift brings lowest power prices on national grid, audit finds","bodyText":"The shift to more than 50% clean energy in South Australia led to the lowest average wholesale power prices in the national electricity grid over the past two months, an audit has found. According to the national energy emissions audit published by the Australia Institute, South Australia has had lower monthly wholesale electricity prices than Victoria since January, than New South Wales since August and than Queensland and Tasmania for the past two months. It is the first time the state has had cheaper wholesale power than all other states for consecutive months. It coincided with the percentage of electricity from wind and solar energy in the state reaching nearly 65% in November. Hugh Saddler, the author of the monthly audit and an associate professor at the Australian National University, said wind and solar power supplied more than 50% of the electricity generated in South Australia for most months over the past two years. “That’s made electricity in SA the cheapest in the national electricity market and dramatically increased reliability.” Saddler said the benefits would be increased if a proposed new interconnector was built between South Australia and NSW as it would ensure NSW had access to solar power into the early evening, helping improve management of demand during peak periods. The audit comes as different reports tell competing stories on electricity prices. The annual report of the Australian Energy Market Commission earlier this month found household prices were expected to start falling over the next few years, mostly due to decreases in wholesale costs as clean energy generation capacity, particularly from windfarms, increased. On Sunday, the competition watchdog found Australian households had already saved $65 on their power bills over the past year, but it said electricity affordability required further attention, in part because while solar panels reduced bills for households that had them, others shouldered the cost of feed-in tariff incentive schemes. According to the website Open NEM, 25.9% of electricity in the five eastern states has been from renewable sources over the past month. There was 100% clean generation in Tasmania, which runs on hydro power, 60% in South Australia, 25% in Victoria, 18% in NSW and 16% in Queensland. The most recent federal government emissions projections suggest it expects Australia to reach 50% clean energy by 2030. The Coalition accused Labor of being economically reckless when it set a non-binding 50% renewable energy target over that timeframe before the election. The Australia Institute audit supports government analysis that found Australia was not expected to meet its 2030 emissions reduction target – a 26-28% cut below 2005 levels – unless it relied on a controversial accounting measure. The measure, which involves claiming credit for beating previous targets under the expiring Kyoto protocol, was strongly opposed by several countries at the recent UN climate talks in Madrid. Saddler found a brief fall in diesel fuel sales had been reversed, suggesting emissions from transport would continue to rise while there was no credible policies to reduce them. He found an ongoing reduction in emissions from electricity generation – due to the rise of clean energy – was likely to be completely offset by rising pollution from transport, mining and agriculture. The audit compares emissions over the five years before the repeal of the former carbon price scheme with the five years since it was abolished. While recent changes to government emissions data now suggest pollution has been lower under the Coalition than under Labor, the report found that if emissions from the land were excluded from national accounts and the focus was solely on fossil fuel industries, pollution trended down between 2009 and 2014 and had trended upwards since. “The emissions reduction fund, which commenced in 2014, has certainly done much less to reduce emissions than the carbon price did … It is, in fact, hard to see that it has had any significant impact,” the audit report says. “The government’s most recent projections of emissions over the next 10 years indicate very little further reduction. If Australia is to meet its Paris agreement target without using Kyoto carryover credits (for which there is no legal basis), another 13% emissions reduction will be required.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2019/nov/11/australia-climate-response-among-worst-g20","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2019-11-11T05:34:20Z","webTitle":"Australia's climate response among the worst in the G20, report finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/11/australia-climate-response-among-worst-g20","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2019/nov/11/australia-climate-response-among-worst-g20","fields":{"headline":"Australia's climate response among the worst in the G20, report finds","bodyText":"Australia’s response to climate change is one of the worst in the G20 with a lack of policy, reliance on fossil fuels and rising emissions leaving the country exposed “economically, politically and environmentally”, according to a new international report. Australia’s progress to meeting its already “unambitious” Paris climate targets was third worst, fossil fuel energy was on the rise and policies to tackle high transport emissions and deforestation were also among the worst across the G20 countries. The Brown to Green report, now in its fifth year, takes stock of the performance of G20 countries on climate change adaptation and mitigation across key sectors, and in the finance sector. The chief executive of Climate Analytics, Bill Hare, an Australian co-author of the report, told Guardian Australia: “Australia is behind [on] climate action in nearly every dimension. Australia’s emissions are increasing and there’s virtually no policy in place to reduce them.” Some 14 non-governmental groups, thinktanks and research institutes compile the report, funded by the World Bank, the US-based ClimateWorks Foundation and Germany’s environment ministry. Across the G20, the report said, limiting global heating to 1.5C would cut negative impacts by 70%, compared with allowing global temperatures to rise by 3C. Currently, extreme weather events were costing G20 countries about US$142bn annually. While the report doesn’t provide an overall ranking, Australia appears consistently among the worst performers in the report’s analysis. India and Australia were the only two G20 countries that had not introduced, or were not considering, policies to price greenhouse gas emissions, the report said. Only South Korea and Canada were further away than Australia from meeting the pledges that formed their Paris climate commitments. On deforestation, the report said Australia was the only developed country that was a “deforestation hotspot”, but had no policies to tackle it. Australia was ranked third worst for transport emissions per capita, and the report found “Australia, in particular, lacking significant policy” in the transport sector. Per capita emissions from aviation were 53 times higher than India’s. Australia, along with Russia, had no policies to move away from petrol-powered cars, no policies to decarbonise the heavy-duty vehicle sector and no policies to shift people onto public transport, the report said. Australia, along with the US and Saudi Arabia, had high emissions from the building sector. Australia had no building codes covering renovation of older buildings. All this lack of action, Hare said, was leaving Australia and its people exposed on climate change “economically, politically and environmentally”. Hare told Guardian Australia: “The leadership of the country is effectively telling lies about their performance, and contradicting their own government’s information. “The country is led by politicians who in one way or another deny either the science or are de facto denying it, and actively and wilfully opposing or obstructing climate policies.” Referring to the current Liberal-led Coalition government, Hare said this was the same political party that had repealed climate legislation, such as the carbon pricing mechanism, and “since then has done all it can to undermine any level of action”. He said the country’s position was in contrast with its opportunities in renewable energy, which it had not exploited as fully as it could. “Australia has one of the best solar energy potential and wind potential in general of any of the G20 countries,” he said. “Australia is not transforming its energy system and is focused on building coal and gas, and has not paid any attention to the need to transition to a zero-carbon economy.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2019/nov/03/how-to-tend-indoor-plants-in-winter-advice","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2019-11-03T08:15:15Z","webTitle":"How to tend indoor plants in winter | James Wong","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/nov/03/how-to-tend-indoor-plants-in-winter-advice","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2019/nov/03/how-to-tend-indoor-plants-in-winter-advice","fields":{"headline":"How to tend indoor plants in winter","bodyText":"I am more than happy to admit that I am a fair-weather gardener. With the past week of relentless rain, mist and mud, thank goodness for indoor plants. They offer me the chance to be surrounded by growth and life, even in the darkest depths of winter. However, just as with exterior plants, seasonal changes will affect how you garden in the great indoors. In fact, for many houseplant species, understanding this shift can mean the difference between being an easy-care option and one that will really struggle for you. So here are the three things to remember as you tend to your indoor Eden over winter. Most modern homes don’t suffer a significant drop in temperature in winter, but they will have far lower light levels as the nights draw in. As plants are essentially living solar panels, this slowing of their energy supply means some struggle. Light-lovers, such as cacti and succulents, often become long and leggy as they attempt to stretch toward a light source to eke out the winter rays. Others, such as citrus and pileas, will start to abort their leaves, exhausted by the lack of light energy to match their fast metabolism in a warm room. There are two simple tricks to overcome this. First, simply move your plant closer to a window. Ledges that can scorch plants with searing UV in summer often become the perfect “bright but indirect” houseplant habitat in the winter. The one caveat is to avoid placing them near radiators, whose high localised heat levels can literally cook plants. Alternatively, move your plant to a cooler room – counterintuitive, I know. You see, many plants won’t mind lower light levels as long as they are paired with cooler conditions. This dip in temperature slows their metabolism, so they won’t require as much solar energy. Most houseplants will fare better with temperatures of 15C or so in winter if you can’t boost light levels. An unheated porch or conservatory is a great spot. As plant growth rate slows in winter so does their requirement for water and fertiliser. As the number-one killer of houseplants is usually overwatering, you might need to cut back your use of the watering can by half (or even more) in winter, so your plant’s roots don’t sit in damp sogginess and become prone to rot. With my 500 houseplants, for example, I am watering once every two to three days in summer to beat the heat, but in winter I have left them for as long as a fortnight at a time with no visible signs of stress. Some commercial growers of drought-tolerant species will almost stop watering altogether for months on end, with this winter rest period being a key biological trigger for larger flowers and more vivid colour. Finally, winter is often a time when pest populations can explode – particularly as many hitch a lift indoors from patio plants that are brought in. I am a big fan of “plant invigorator” sprays that combine minerals with dilute surfactants. These not only help boost plant immunity, but can act as physical deterrents to pests, without the need to deploy conventional pesticides.

We have now had 25 of them – the 26th Conference of the Parties (Cop26) will take place in Glasgow in November – yet greenhouse gas concentrations continue to rise inexorably. Cops – especially the one in Paris in 2015 – have changed attitudes and influenced policy. But to meet the goal of reducing global emissions to net zero by mid-century we have to start doing something substantial and different in addition to seeking stronger commitments at Cop26. The good news is that there are now real grounds for optimism that we can slow and ultimately stop greenhouse gas emissions. Renewable energy currently outcompetes fossil fuels in many areas and continues to become cheaper every year. New energy storage options, ranging from cheaper batteries to green ammonia, are emerging. New ways to produce proteins at scale without destroying rainforests are being developed. When these solutions become so good, and so cheap, that they routinely outcompete their fossil fuel and biodiversity-destroying counterparts, greenhouse gas emissions will decline to near zero. Getting there, though, needs some serious focus on green technologies supported by policies that will get them rolled out. A research group in Oxford, led by my co-authors and myself has been identifying groups of “unicorn” technologies, named by analogy with “unicorn” startups valued at over $1bn, that can each deliver a reduction of at least a billion tonnes of CO2 a year. Unicorns don’t depend on fundamental new discoveries so should be ready for large-scale deployment within a decade. With a moderate investment in research and development or other support, they could in combination unlock multiple benefits across whole “energy ecosystems”. One example of such an ecosystem centres on converting cheap renewable energy – either from sunny places with few people, or spare wind from the North Sea – into hydrogen and ammonia, to provide zero-carbon fuel for shipping, heavy goods vehicles and even potentially aviation. They could provide the energy storage needed to complement variable wind and solar energy, process heat for industry, and turn iron ore into steel. The technologies that would unlock this ecosystem are the next generation of high-efficiency solar cells, low-cost electrolysers, and hydrogen and ammonia fuel cells and engines. All are proven technologies that simply need to be cheaper – further development could rapidly unlock a virtuous circle of falling costs and increased deployment. Another example is exceptionally water-efficient plants that can grow in semi-arid areas or on degraded land – prickly pear, pineapples and euphorbias are examples. Such plants could sequester carbon in soil on a large scale, and be fermented to proteins in place of soya beans, whose growth causes widespread deforestation and huge greenhouse gas emissions; they could even be used to make plastics. The unicorn technologies in this case include learning how to grow plants that we have historically ignored, along with precision separation and fermentation of the biomass. Getting a bold, unanimous agreement to ratchet up global ambition to act on climate at Cop26 will be very hard at this stage of the game, with the usual cabal of petro-states and coal producers doing their utmost to dilute any decisions of consequence. However, an approach focused around “coalitions of the willing” in the bottom-up spirit of the Paris climate agreement, could enable substantial progress without being stymied by vested interests. Each of these coalitions, built from nation states but also regions and even corporates, could focus on one or more of the unicorns. They would support research and development, advance demonstrators, or provide lower-cost finance or performance guarantees to encourage rollout and help the technologies become cheaper. They would allow least-developed and developed nations to share ambitions and interests in technologies where they have comparative advantages, such as solar resources, land or skills. Management and licensing of intellectual property could encourage coalitions to form and accelerate technology deployment. The formation of these coalitions could be seen as evolution of an earlier UK initiative called Mission Innovation. It targeted sectors or problems, rather than – as we are proposing – selected technology areas that underwrite whole energy ecosystems, which we believe would be a very much more productive approach. This should not be seen as “picking winners”, but rather as “picking runners”. Funders should be prepared to see failures as well as successes. As co-chair with Italy of Cop26, the UK has an excellent opportunity to build coalitions that would lead to cheaper alternatives to fossil fuels. The UK is home to several companies and world experts in both the “hydrammonia” economy and semi-arid plants, and British businesses could be leading players in these two examples of ecosystems. In parallel with preparing for Cop26, the government should also change the UK’s broad approach. Neither academia nor industry on their own has the principal objective of solving the climate crisis. They have neither skills nor funding to develop technologies that are (nearly) out of the laboratory, build demonstrators when necessary, and create the technical and financial conditions needed to enable large-scale rollout. We believe the UK needs something like the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, created in the US, which “advances high-potential, high-impact energy technologies that are too early for private-sector investment”. By fostering coalitions of the willing, which would focus on clusters of unicorn technologies, the UK could make a major contribution to solving the climate crisis. Cop26 could indeed be a turning point – but it cannot simply be more of the same. • Mike Mason is a fellow at the Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment, University of Oxford.

A detailed study of the world’s coastlines has found that offshore windfarms alone could provide more electricity than the world needs – even if they are only built in windy regions in shallow waters near the shore. Analysis by the International Energy Agency (IEA) revealed that if windfarms were built across all useable sites which are no further than 60km (37 miles) off the coast, and where coastal waters are no deeper than 60 metres, they could generate 36,000 terawatt hours of renewable electricity a year. This would easily meeting the current global demand for electricity of 23,000 terawatt hours. “Offshore wind currently provides just 0.3% of global power generation, but its potential is vast,” the IEA’s executive director, Fatih Birol, said. The study predicts offshore wind generation will grow 15-fold to emerge as a $1tn (£780bn) industry in the next 20 years and will prove to be the next great energy revolution. The IEA said earlier this week that global supplies of renewable electricity were growing faster than expected and could expand by 50% in the next five years, driven by a resurgence in solar energy. Offshore wind power would drive the world’s growth in clean power due to plummeting costs and new technological breakthroughs, including turbines close to the height of the Eiffel Tower and floating installations that can harness wind speeds further from the coast. The next generation of floating turbines capable of operating further from the shore could generate enough energy to meet the world’s total electricity demand 11 times over in 2040, according to IEA estimates. The report predicts that the EU’s offshore wind capacity will grow from almost 20 gigawatts today to nearly 130 gigawatts by 2040, and could reach 180 gigawatts with stronger climate commitments. In China, the growth of offshore wind generation is likely to be even more rapid, the IEA said. Its offshore wind capacity is forecast to grow from 4 gigawatts to 110 gigawatts by 2040 or 170 gigawatts if it adopts tougher climate targets. Birol said offshore wind would not only contribute to generating clean electricity, but could also offer a major opportunity in the production of hydrogen, which can be used instead of fossil fuel gas for heating and in heavy industry. The process of making hydrogen from water uses huge amounts of electricity but abundant, cheap offshore wind power could help produce a low-cost, zero-carbon alternative to gas. In the North Sea, energy companies are already planning to use the electricity generated by giant offshore windfarms to turn seawater into hydrogen on a floating “green hydrogen” project, backed by the UK government. The clean-burning gas could be pumped back to shore to heat millions of homes by the 2030s. The UK has committed to reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050. The overlap between the UK’s declining oil and gas industry and the burgeoning offshore wind sector could offer major economic benefits for the UK, Birol said. “Offshore wind provides a huge new business portfolio for major engineering firms and established oil and gas companies which have a strong offshore production experience,” he said. “Our analysis shows that 40% of the work in offshore wind construction and maintenance has synergies with oil and gas practises.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/dec/15/invest-solar-energy-energise-frica","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-15T19:11:58Z","webTitle":"How investing in solar energy can create a brighter future for Africa","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/15/invest-solar-energy-energise-frica","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/dec/15/invest-solar-energy-energise-frica","fields":{"headline":"How investing in solar energy can create a brighter future for Africa","bodyText":"How would you like to earn a return of up to 6% on your cash while at the same time providing families in countries such as Kenya with “life-changing” access to clean, affordable solar energy? Energise Africa is a new ethical investment scheme which aims to raise £20m to provide a brighter future for more than 110,000 families and small businesses in sub-Saharan Africa over the next three years. Investors will find some reassurance that it is supported by UK aid money from the Department for International Development (DfID). And what is also notable is that, unusually, some of the investments on offer benefit from what is known as “first loss cover” – which means that if the worst were to happen, and the company was unable to pay back what it owed, individual investors would be prioritised ahead of DfID, thereby providing an extra level of protection. With a minimum investment of £50, it is a potentially straightforward and accessible way for people to make sure their money is doing some good. However, this is not risk-free, and the returns are not guaranteed. In the worst-case scenario, if there was some kind of disaster/crisis/bankruptcy, you could lose some or all your capital, and you would not be able to get redress from the UK’s Financial Services Compensation Scheme or complain to the Financial Ombudsman Service, so you need to go into this with your eyes open. Currently 600 million people in sub-Saharan Africa live without access to electricity. For example, in Uganda, the figure is just 7% of rural families. Many use traditional energy sources such as kerosene lamps, candles and batteries for their energy needs – but these can be extremely hazardous, as well as costly. Lamps and candles have been responsible for many house fires, while soot and fumes can cause health problems. Having a solar system can transform people’s lives in so many ways – allowing children to read and study in the evening, enabling families to charge their mobile phones, or enabling a stallholder to install a fridge so they can sell cold drinks. Energise Africa is an initiative that provides working capital to businesses that sell solar home systems, the result of a link-up between Ethex, a UK-based ethical investment platform, and Lendahand, a Dutch-based crowdfunding platform. It was “soft launched” in the summer and is also being backed by Virgin Unite, the non-profit foundation of the Virgin Group. So what’s the deal? This involves investing in unsecured bonds that are not listed on a public market in return for an expected 4% to 6% annual return. Basically, you are lending money to businesses that sell small solar systems to families throughout sub-Saharan Africa. UK investors can deposit small or large sums in one or more projects, and the term of the investment is typically either two or three years. Once the project is fully funded, the money is transferred to the solar business. Every six months investors will receive both interest and a capital repayment from their chosen business. The loans provided to the businesses are then used to buy solar home systems, which are then sold to African families via a financing plan. Typically, a family makes monthly payments over 12 to 24 months, and then owns the system outright. At the time of writing there were two projects open for investment, both of them featured on the Lendahand.co.uk website and benefiting from match funding. One, from Dutch firm SolarWorks!, is looking to raise £90,000, and is a three-year bond where the expected interest rate is 6% a year. This project aims to provide clean energy to 1,000 families in Mozambique, and there is the added advantage of £45,000 of first-loss cover from DfID. “In the unlikely event that SolarWorks! Trading BV was unable to make all of its bond repayments, the crowd would be prioritised ahead of repayment to UK aid,” says the Lendahand site. The other project is a two-year bond with an expected interest rate of 5% a year but no first loss cover. The company behind this is a UK one, Azuri, which has its HQ in Cambridge, and has set an investment target of £200,000. It says every £100 invested will allow Azuri to make a solar home system available to a rural family in Tanzania that would otherwise be out of their financial reach. This project benefits from match funding to the tune of an upfront £100,000 of DfID aid money. In June, Lisa Ashford, a director at Lendahand Ethex, travelled to Mpigi in Uganda, where she met families and visited schools, orphanages and businesses, all whom were now using solar. She says one of the most striking things was the demand for education. “The desire to study hard and succeed was very apparent across the classes we visited at Lumuza school. The children were still doing prep in the evening under the solar lights across the classrooms. Without the solar I’m not sure how they would have all have managed to work so hard.” The team also met Patience, who runs a small local store that provides her with income to look after her young family. Since getting solar, she has installed fridges, so she can sell cold drinks and refrigerated food without high bills or power cuts. Those who sign up will be able to benefit from tax-free returns by holding their investment within an “innovative finance” Isa – the new account for debt-based crowd funding and peer-to-peer loans. But it’s vital to read up on the risks, which could include everything from potential political instability in the country concerned to a natural disaster such as a flood or famine. • Fancy earning a potential 15% a year from turning whisky into motor fuel? It sounds fanciful to say the least, but this is a genuine investment offer, with multimillion-pound backing from the Scottish government. But that sky-high rate gives you an indication that this is a whole lot riskier than putting your money into a savings account, with no compensation if things go wrong, so this definitely isn’t the place to stash your entire life savings. A Scottish startup, Celtic Renewables Ltd, has secured planning permission to build a plant at Grangemouth that will produce biobutanol, a sustainable biofuel made using whisky residue that, according to the firm, is a direct replacement for petrol and diesel. The plant will cost just over £20m to build, almost half of which is coming from the Scottish government in the form of a £9m grant. The firm is looking to raise up to £4.375m via a two-year investment available via the ethical investment platform Abundance. It is offering 15% interest a year, with the capital and interest paid at maturity in December 2019. Those who invest would be buying debentures, which are like IOUs issued by companies. However, the offer document outlines five pages of risks - for example, debentures are not covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme or the Financial Ombudsman Service. “Part or all of your original invested capital may be at risk,” and returns are not guaranteed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2020/may/17/coal-industry-will-never-recover-after-coronavirus-pandemic-say-experts","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2020-05-17T10:01:17Z","webTitle":"Coal industry will never recover after coronavirus pandemic, say experts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/17/coal-industry-will-never-recover-after-coronavirus-pandemic-say-experts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2020/may/17/coal-industry-will-never-recover-after-coronavirus-pandemic-say-experts","fields":{"headline":"Coal industry will never recover after coronavirus pandemic, say experts","bodyText":"The global coal industry will “never recover” from the Covid-19 pandemic, industry observers predict, because the crisis has proved renewable energy is cheaper for consumers and a safer bet for investors. A long-term shift away from dirty fossil fuels has accelerated during the lockdown, bringing forward power plant closures in several countries and providing new evidence that humanity’s coal use may finally have peaked after more than 200 years. That makes the worst-case climate scenarios less likely, because they are based on a continued expansion of coal for the rest of the century. Even before the pandemic, the industry was under pressure due to heightened climate activism, divestment campaigns and cheap alternatives. The lockdown has exposed its frailties even further, wiping billions from the market valuations of the world’s biggest coal miners. As demand for electricity has fallen, many utilities have cut back on coal first, because it is more expensive than gas, wind and solar. In the EU imports of coal for thermal power plants plunged by almost two-thirds in recent months to reach lows not seen in 30 years. The consequences have been felt around the world as well. This week, a new report by the US Energy Information Administration projected the US would produce more electricity this year from renewables than from coal for the first time. Industry analysts predict coal’s share of US electricity generation could fall to just 10% in five years, down from 50% a decade ago. Despite Donald Trump’s campaign pledge to “dig coal”, there are now more job losses and closures in the industry than at any time since Eisenhower’s presidency 60 years ago. Among the latest has been Great River Energy’s plan to shut down a 1.1-gigawatt thermal plant in North Dakota and replace it with wind and gas. Rob Jackson, the chair of Global Carbon Project, said the pandemic was likely to confirm that coal will never again reach the global peak seen in 2013: “Covid-19 will slash coal emissions so much this year that the industry will never recover, even with a continued build-out in India and elsewhere. The crash in natural gas prices, record-cheap solar and wind power, and climate and health concerns have undercut the industry permanently.” Records are falling thick and fast. By Friday, the UK national grid had not burned a single lump of coal for 35 days, the longest uninterrupted period since the start of the industrial revolution more than 230 years ago. In Portugal, the record coal-free run has extended almost two months, the campaign group Europe Beyond Coal recently reported. Last month Sweden closed its last coal-fired power plant, KVV6 in Hjorthagen, eastern Stockholm, two years early because the mild winter meant it was not used even before the pandemic. Austria followed suit with the shutdown of its only remaining coal plant at Mellach. The Netherlands said it would reduce the capacity of its thermal plants by 75% to comply with a court order to reduce climate risks. More importantly, in India – the world’s second-biggest coal consumer – the government has prioritised cheap solar energy rather than coal in response to a slump in electricity demand caused by Covid-19 and a weak economy. This has led to the first year-on-year fall in carbon emissions in four decades, exceptional air quality, and a growing public clamour for more renewables. Elsewhere in Asia, the picture is mixed. A few years ago, Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines were expected to be the industry’s biggest growth areas, but the pandemic, falling renewable prices and a growing divestment campaign have put several major coal projects on hold. The party of South Korean president Moon Jae-in has been re-elected on a pledge to phase out domestic coal use, and many in his ruling coalition are pushing to end financing of overseas projects. In Japan, the big three commercial lenders and the governor of the Japan Bank of International Cooperation have recently said they will no longer accept proposals for coal generation. Other money taps are also being turned off, as investors and finance houses respond to scientific advice and campaigns by divestment activists and school strikers such as Greta Thunberg. “The economics of coal were already under structural pressure before the pandemic,” said Mark Lewis, the head of sustainability research at the investment management arm of French bank BNP Paribas. “And coming out of it these pressures will still be there – but now compounded by the impact of the pandemic.” BNP Paribas is one of a growing list of financial institutions which have chosen to sever ties with coal. The bank said last week that it would accelerate its planned exit from coal financing to 2030 to bring its portfolio in line with the Paris climate goals sooner. In the same week, the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund – the world’s biggest – ditched a host of coal mining and energy companies, including Glencore, Anglo-American, Vale and AGL over climate concerns. This follows coal blacklisting announcements by BlackRock, Standard Chartered and JPMorgan Chase. The fossil fuel has fallen from favour in the eyes of many investors due to rising climate concerns, cheaper renewable energy alternatives and a public backlash against air pollution. “The public health benefits of cleaner air will be front and centre after weeks of lockdown that have prompted blue skies and clean air in Asia’s megalopolises,” Lewis said. “This pressure from the finance sector will only accelerate going forward, pushing the cost of capital for coal projects even higher.” Even before the pandemic, Australian coal companies said they were finding it hard to find financing for mines and port facilities due to the international divestment campaign. This is not the only economic squeeze. A near-30% fall in the price of thermal coal has made more than half of production unprofitable, prompting several firms to warn of pit closures and layoffs. The elephant in the room is China, which burns half of the world’s coal and is the biggest financier of mines and power plants in Asia and Africa – largely to provide an export market for its domestic manufacturing and engineering firms. A few years ago, domestic coal consumption fell, prompting hopes that president Xi Jinping was committed to a shift away from dirty, high-emitting power production. But after the lockdown, the political priority is to jumpstart the economy. Provincial governments are now working on a slew of new thermal plants. But they are running at less than half of capacity because demand for coal has not returned to its previous level. “Covid-19 has made clear that China and India have built more than they need. Even before the crisis, they had overcapacity. Now with lower demand, you can see everything is a mess,” said Carlos Fernández Alvarez, lead coal analyst at the International Energy Agency. Alvarez said coal had been hit hardest by the pandemic, but he cautioned the decline could be temporary unless governments invest in renewables to pull economies out of the lockdown. “We have to look at this structurally. If there is high energy demand again in the future, it will probably be coal that picks up the slack because it is the marginal supplier,” he said. While nobody is expecting coal to disappear any time soon, Ted Nace, director of Global Energy Monitor, believes the balance has shifted for good. “Coal is definitely on the downturn and this pandemic is going to accelerate that. Demand should come back to some degree next year. But there is a very strong argument that it is not going to just bounce back.” • This article was amended on 18 May 2020.

The conglomerate has taken a stake in off-grid solar company BBOXX through the start-up’s latest funding round, which will power the Africa-focused company deeper into Asia. The funds will also help BBOXX, which operates in Rwanda, Kenya, Togo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to break into new African markets, where an estimated one in three people live without reliable access to electricity. BBOXX is one of a growing number of energy companies to plug into the demand for energy across Africa and south Asia. The falling cost of solar technology and the strength of mobile banking across Africa have encouraged major investments from global energy companies including US giant General Electric and France’s EDF and Engie. Mansoor Hamayun, BBOXX’s chief executive and co-founder, said Mitsubishi’s “extensive reach” and “technological expertise” would help the company to supply more people living without access to modern utilities and services. “The funding is further evidence of Japanese interest in Africa and in PAYG [pay as you go] solar energy globally,” he said. BBOXX and its rivals use mobile money to charge customers a monthly fee for the use of mini solar panels and ultra-efficient lighting strips. The fixed-period contracts usually run for about two years, until the equipment is paid off. Customers can then choose to keep their existing kit and use the electricity for free, or upgrade their system to include more panels and extra appliances under a new contract. Earlier this year, BBOXX sold a 50% stake in its Togo-based business to EDF Energy in return for funding to help grow the company. It operates about 270,000 solar systems, of which 200,000 are monitored remotely by software that uses machine learning to track customers’ energy use and payments. In time, BBOXX hopes to broaden its reach beyond energy to include gas, water, internet and loans. The company’s largest rival, Fenix International, supplies 500,000 homes and was snapped up by Engie in late 2017. Hamayun said: “We look forward to this next phase of growth that will help us to transform more lives, unlock potential and grow our already global footprint by opening up new markets, and develop our product range.” The funding round also included Bamboo Capital Partners, a Luxembourg-based impact investor; DOEN Participaties, a Dutch impact investment fund; and Canadian growth equity firm MacKinnon, Bennett &amp; Company."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2020/feb/18/renewables-barely-feature-building-programme-schools-solar-panels","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2020-02-18T06:13:13Z","webTitle":"Renewables barely feature in building programme for 500 schools","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/feb/18/renewables-barely-feature-building-programme-schools-solar-panels","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2020/feb/18/renewables-barely-feature-building-programme-schools-solar-panels","fields":{"headline":"Renewables barely feature in building programme for 500 schools","bodyText":"It is a modernist version of a log cabin nestling in a busy south London suburb – and it is about to make history. The new building for Hackbridge primary, in Sutton, opens next week as England’s first zero-carbon school, able to produce and conserve as much energy as it uses, and even put unused electricity generated back into the grid. With its wood frame and cladding, solar panels, pumps to collect heat from the ground, and insulation made from recycled newspaper, it is the first school in England to meet the ambitious Passivhaus Plus low-energy design standard. “The school will have no net demand on an annual basis, for electricity and no gas connection,” Architype, the architects, say. Sadly, however, only a handful of the 500-plus schools being rebuilt or refurbished across the county through the government’s £4.3bn priority school building programme are installing renewable energy technology – and the Department for Education’s (DfE’s) recommended designs do not include renewables. Hackbridge’s new building was subsidised by Sutton council as part of its broader environmental strategy. High Weald academy, in Cranbrook, Kent, is one school whose new buildings, officially opened last month, do not have the technology to harness green energy. And in Birmingham, work is being completed on new buildings for Colmers school and sixth form college to offer “modern facilities” with an emphasis on “quality and innovation throughout the building programme”. Again, there are no solar panels or heat pumps, two of the most cost-effective ways of harnessing green energy. In Watford, Hertfordshire, Westfield academy’s light and airy building, opened three years ago, was hailed by its headteacher, Tim Body, as “a remarkable new building for the 21st century”. It has a fully equipped design and technology rooms, ICT suites, a professional theatre, dance studio and a modern beauty salon. It, too, is not equipped to harness green energy. In fact, of the 260 schools rebuilt or replaced across England between 2015-19 in the first phase of the programme, very few use renewable energy – nor do most of the further 277 schools being refurbished in the second building phase to 2021. But one secondary, in Somerset, is taking a stand, rejecting the plans for its rebuild, unveiled last month, on the grounds that the design does not meet the aspirations of parents, pupils and staff to protect the planet. They say new premises for Kingsmead, the 880-pupil secondary school in Wiveliscombe, Taunton, provide an opportunity to make carbon savings and reduce energy bills. Liz Pow, the school’s director of finance and operations, says: “Unfortunately, as the project is managed by the Department for Education, we don’t have any input into the energy efficiency of the build. The topic of renewable energy was raised several times during the consultation process as students, staff, parents and the wider community feel it should be an important feature of any new school.” Mark Blaker, an independent district councillor, has written to Rebecca Pow, the local Conservative MP and a junior environment minister, asking her to intervene. “This will be the biggest building for a 10-mile radius. It will be a statement of our community aspirations and our hopes for generations of young people to come. Ignoring the economic and environmental benefits of renewable energy in the much-needed new building feels like a betrayal of those aspirations,” he says. Colin Diamond, professor of education at Birmingham University and a former Kingsmead parent and governor, says: “It’s astonishing to learn that the DfE is not leading by example here. It continues to procure new school buildings with no apparent awareness of sustainability and regenerative economics. This is a golden opportunity to create a carbon-neutral learning environment where students can find out about energy efficiency first hand in their own community school.” Caroline Buckingham, a member of the ethics and sustainable group of the Royal Institute of British Architects, explains that contractors and designers on the DfE’s priority programme work to generic briefs. “The frameworks go out to contractors who have usually built lots of schools and have got meeting the DfE’s standards down to a fine art. There are no bells and whistles, no wriggle room for innovation because these buildings were approved during times of austerity, based on pound per square metre,” she says. “Sometimes you get a really good local authority that is pushing sustainable building and includes renewable technologies, but it is usually for smaller primary or special schools.” James Eades, operations director of the energy consultancy firm Energymyway, says school roofs are usually perfect for solar panels – but the people paying for the build may not be interested in reducing ongoing running costs. Changes in government policy, such as the reduction in 2016 in the price paid for solar energy exported to the grid, have hit the industry hard in England – since then, the number of registered installers has gone down from 5,000 to 1,600, he says. “However, since the Extinction Rebellion demonstrations we have been getting more inquiries for solar panels from people who want it for environmental reasons, not purely on investment grounds,” he says. “Often when schools fit panels to existing buildings, it is the parent teacher associations that fund them.” As school buildings are occupied during daylight hours, electricity can be used as it is generated. On present prices, the costs of panel installation, between £38,000 and £50,000, would be recouped within five to seven years respectively, he says. The DfE, however, says its priority build programme does address environmental performance. “Reduction in energy use in new buildings is a key priority and DfE-delivered schools are designed to be straightforward buildings, easy to use with simple built forms which adopt a ‘fabric first’ approach limiting the amount of energy required in their operation,” said a spokeswoman. The DfE is working with Innovate UK, the quasi-government innovation agency, to develop a model of sustainable future schools, she adds."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2019/sep/20/the-climate-crisis-explained-in-10-charts","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2019-09-19T21:29:37Z","webTitle":"The climate crisis explained in 10 charts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/20/the-climate-crisis-explained-in-10-charts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2019/sep/20/the-climate-crisis-explained-in-10-charts","fields":{"headline":"The climate crisis explained in 10 charts","bodyText":"The problem – rising carbon dioxide in the atmosphere The level of CO2 has been rising since the industrial revolution and is now at its highest for about 4 million years. The rate of the rise is even more striking – the fastest for 66m years – with scientists saying we are in “uncharted territory”. The causes – fossil fuel burning Billions of tonnes of CO2 are sent into the atmosphere every year from coal, oil and gas burning. There is no sign of these emissions starting to fall rapidly, as is needed. The causes – forest destruction The felling of forests for timber, cattle, soy and palm oil is a big contributor to carbon emissions. It is also a major cause of the annihilation of wildlife on Earth. The consequences – global temperature rise The planet’s average temperature started to climb steadily two centuries ago, but has rocketed since the second world war as consumption and population has risen. Global heating means there is more energy in the atmosphere, making extreme weather events more frequent and more intense. The consequences – ice melting in Greenland Greenland has lost almost 4 trillion tonnes of ice since 2002. Mountain ranges from the Himalayas to the Andes to the Alps are also losing ice rapidly as glaciers shrink. A third of the Himalayan and Hindu Kush ice is already doomed. The consequences – rising sea levels Sea levels are inexorably rising as ice on land melts and hotter oceans expand. Sea levels are slow to respond to global heating, so even if the temperature rise is restricted to 2C, one in five people in the world will eventually see their cities submerged, from New York to London to Shanghai. The consequences – shrinking Arctic sea ice As heating melts the sea ice, the darker water revealed absorbs more of the sun’s heat, causing more heating – one example of the vicious circles in the climate system. Scientists think the changes in the Arctic may be responsible for worsened heatwaves and floods in Eurasia and North America. The upside (I) – wind and solar energy is soaring Huge cost drops have seen renewable energy become the cheapest energy in many places and the rollout is projected to continue. Analysts also expect coal use to fall. But much government action is still required to reach the scale needed, and solve difficult problems such as aviation and farming. The upside (II) – electric vehicles The global fleet of electric cars and vans is still small compared with those running on fossil fuels. But sales are growing very fast. Electric cars are cheaper to run, suggesting they will become mainstream. The upside (III) – battery costs Renewable energy is intermittent, depending on when the sun shines or wind blows. So storage is vital and the cost of batteries is plummeting. But other technologies, such as generating hydrogen, will also be needed. This article was amended on 20 September 2019 to correct an error in the figure given for the rate of Greenland’s ice loss. The correct amount is 4 trillion tonnes of ice lost since 2002."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2019/nov/08/november-revolutions-1917-berlin-wall-eastern-europe","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2019-11-08T11:00:29Z","webTitle":"Why November is the true revolutionary month","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/08/november-revolutions-1917-berlin-wall-eastern-europe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2019/nov/08/november-revolutions-1917-berlin-wall-eastern-europe","fields":{"headline":"Why November is the true revolutionary month","bodyText":"One of the subtle ironies of Soviet life was that its founding moment was habitually celebrated in the wrong month. The “great October” marking the events of 1917 used to be commemorated every year on 7 November, thanks to a quirk of chronology dating back centuries. This was not lost on the locals, with their well developed sense of irony: even the calendar was against them. Of course, 1917 was not the only November revolution that upended the region. Another uprising 30 years ago this weekend upstaged the Bolshevik festivities and steered a swathe of eastern Europe on to a new course. But for better or worse? Much has been made of the disillusionment gripping the region, but as our central and eastern European correspondent, Shaun Walker, found out, in countries such as Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania, people have never had it so good. The fall of the Berlin Wall on 9 November 1989 was perhaps the most Upsidey revolution in history. If you’re not convinced, perhaps these before and after images from Berlin will change your mind.

In this otherwise peaceful, uncorrupted and well-educated country, poaching is the biggest cause of wolf mortality. Even though wolves are strictly protected by European law and Finland promotes itself as a destination for lovers of nature and the great outdoors, wolves are being legally hunted down. In fact, Finland was recently taken to the European court of justice over the way its authorities seem to easily hand out wolf-killing permits without sufficiently justifying their decisions. The present situation for the wolves in Finland is so severe that if public opinion doesn’t change, Finland could be left with no wolves at all. Where was the Upside?

Thanks, as ever, for your comments, correspondence and company. I hope the lights are staying on where you are. Be well, all of you. A brief summary of today’s developments: The Australian Energy Market Operator has again warned of the threat of widespread blackouts caused by power shortages. Five states face supply gaps in coming days. Western Australia will shut its last coal-fired power plant by the end of the decade Foreign minister Penny Wong will visit her NZ counterpart. Former Wallabies captain David Pocock has become the first independent candidate to win a territory senate seat, elected to parliament as a senator for the ACT. Australian stocks plunged, following a global sell-off of stocks on fears of worsening inflation, and ... The Australian Socceroos will play in a fifth straight World Cup Finals, thanks, in the significant part, to the rubber-limbed genius of goalkeeper Andrew Redmayne. Curiouser and curiouser... Conservation officials in New Zealand believe mass die-offs of sea birds are becoming more frequent as climate crisis disrupts food chains. Here’s the full report: Western Australia will shut its last coal-fired power unit before the end of the decade and spend an extra half a billion dollars to foster new jobs for displayed workers, the state government said. Later this year, the first of the 854-megawatt Muja power station’s units near Collie, south of Perth, will close, with the entire plant to be shut by 2029. The nearby 340MW Collie plant will exit the market by the end of 2027, the premier, Mark McGowan, said in a statement on Tuesday. Georgina Kekea reports from Honiara: The controversial security deal struck between Solomon Islands and China that caught the western world off guard was needed to maintain internal security and help fight climate change, a leading Solomon Islands official has said, defending his country’s right to choose its allies. Lovely read from Emma Kemp on Andrew ‘the Grey Wiggle’ Redmayne... The Socceroos goalkeeper’s penalty shootout save made headlines, but his journey to Qatar has not been straightforward. Penny Wong headed to New Zealand on fifth international trip since taking office The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, is about to embark on her fifth international trip since taking office last month. Her New Zealand counterpart, Nanaia Mahuta, announced that she would welcome Wong for an in-person meeting this Thursday, saying “deep cooperation and partnerships” would stand both countries in good stead. In a statement reported by New Zealand media, Mahuta said the formal bilateral talks with Wong would provide “an opportunity for new conversations on ways to advance our partnership”. Mahuta said climate change was the “number one security issue” for the Pacific: I look forward to talking to the new foreign minister in more detail on Australia’s climate change agenda, and further ways we can assist Pacific Island nations on mitigation and adaptation measures. On broader Pacific challenges, Aotearoa New Zealand seeks to elevate the Pacific Island voice, and support collaboration and partnership through established institutions, especially the Pacific Islands Forum. As Katharine Murphy observed in this dispatch from Indonesia last week, Wong has hit the ground running. The day she was sworn in as foreign affairs minister, Wong flew with the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, to Tokyo for the long-scheduled Quad leaders’ summit. Her second trip, later in that same week, was to Fiji, where she made Australia’s case to be the region’s parter of choice amid growing competition with China for influence. Wong’s third trip was to both Samoa and Tonga. In her fourth trip, Wong travelled with Albanese to Indonesia last week. Wong’s forthcoming trip to New Zealand follows Albanese’s meetings with Jacinda Ardern in Sydney on Thursday and Friday. The new prime minister has promised to consider changing the way the section 501 visa cancellation policy is applied to address New Zealand’s concerns. Daniel Hurst’s file is here: NSW to set up fund for environmental offset credits, in part to compensate for state renewable energy projects A new $106.7m NSW government fund dedicated to buying and selling biodiversity credits in the state’s environmental offset market will be used to help the Perrottet government compensate for habitat clearing for its renewable energy zones. The NSW treasurer, Matt Kean, and the environment minister, James Griffin, announced the forthcoming state budget would include an investment to establish a biodiversity credits supply fund within the NSW planning and environment department. Currently, developers looking to offset the environmental impacts of projects can purchase offset credits from private landholders who protect their properties for conservation under an agreement with the state government. The new fund will see the state government purchase credits and sell them on to developers. The government says the fund will serve several purposes, including ensuring that there is an “efficient and trusted” source of credits and that there is a supply of credits available to offset projects when they are needed. Griffin said it was also intended to meet the offset requirements for large infrastructure projects the state government has in the pipeline, including its five planned renewable energy zones. He said the fund would create a significant increase in the supply of available credits that could be used for projects that were important to the community. Griffin said: This means the NSW government will be securing more habitat for threatened species and ecosystems sooner, effectively bringing forward environmental benefits. ASX200 ends trading down 3.6%, the biggest single-day drop in two years Meanwhile in those other, bigger markets, such as the ASX, it’s been a grim day. The ASX200 benchmark of (you guessed it) 200 top companies on the stock market lost 3.6%, which apparently is the biggest single-day drop in just over two years. It could have been worse, though, after the market opened a tad more than 5.2% lower. Asian markets were down too, but more in the 1-2% range. That’s partly because they were trading on Monday – while Australia was mostly on holiday – and took a chunk of their losses then. The big Australian banks all had another sour day. Despite some investors saying banks don’t mind higher interest rates, if they rise too fast, there’s more chance of bad debts and, of course, slower overall economic growth. It wasn’t much more than a week ago that CBA, Australia’s biggest bank, was worth $105 a share. Today it closed at $91.20, denting the values of many a superfund that holds it. Federal MPs and public officer holders to receive 2.75% pay rise Federal MPs and public office holders have been granted a 2.75% pay increase from 1 July, with a backbencher set to receive a base salary of $217,060. The remuneration tribunal, which independently sets the pay of statutory officers and other public officials, ordered the 2.75% pay increase. It’s an improvement on last year – when no increase was ordered – but still a distance short of inflation, which was already 5.1% in headline terms or 3.7% in underlying terms at the time of the last budget. It has only increased since then, and that means pollies (like many others) have suffered a real pay cut. In its decision on MPs’ pay, the tribunal said: While the work performed by the wide variety of offices in the tribunal’s jurisdiction, including members of parliament, is diverse and unique, the tribunal is conscious of ensuring that relativities within the group of offices for which it determines remuneration remain consistent. Consistent with previous decisions the tribunal maintains the view that the pay of parliamentarians should increase relative to that of other public office holders, and thus the decision to determine an adjustment for the office holders in the tribunal’s jurisdiction generally will also apply to parliamentarians. For the approximately 2.7 million Australians whose pay is set by the national minimum wage (currently $20.33 an hour) or related award minimums, the Fair Work Commission will announce its decision at 10am on Wednesday. This is pretty opaque if you’re not part of the energy cognoscenti, but Peter Hannam (who most assuredly is), tells me this is a “warning shot” ... Big energy users in Queensland and NSW to cut down use as Aemo warns of energy supply gaps The Australian Energy Market Operator has several tricks up its regulatory sleeves when it comes to ensuring we don’t get blackouts in a tight market. One is the daintily named Reliability and Emergency Reserve Trader (or Rert, NOT Rort), which is a pre-arranged list of big energy users that agree to reduce load in a power pinch – and collect some payment for helping out. Yesterday, the Rert was activated for Queensland and it’s been done again, for most of the rest of today. Interestingly, the same request is being made in NSW for about the same period. We learned yesterday that Rio Tinto’s Boyne Smelter was not part of the scheme, but we have to assume other big power users will be. Some, of course, can’t turn off the power for too long – such as aluminium* smelters, as their potlines turn solid after a couple of hours and are then useless. (*Not to be confused with aluminum, which is the Yanks’ accidental typo, when Alcoa lodged its company name and left out the ‘i’ by mistake.) That is a cracking headline ... There’s a national cabinet planned for Friday, and you can be certain that energy will feature highly, for reasons that may be more acute by week’s end. Aside from blaming the Abbott/Turnbull/Morrison government, the Albanese government will need to come up with more of the “way forward”. Part of that may be the Transition Plan, or even gas storage options floated by the energy minister, Chris Bowen, after energy ministers had their first post-election gathering last week. (It wasn’t the “emergency” meeting as some described.) To make up for the lack of federal Labor v Coalition stoush at the cabinet meeting, the various states might bring a bit of their own banter to the table. On Tuesday, NSW energy minister, Matt Kean, seemed to be laying at least some of the blame for the current electricity squeeze on the neighbours to the north. “Obviously, there’s been some big challenges in Queensland,” Kean told reporters including Guardian Australia’s own Tamsin Rose. “They’ve had an unusually cold winter and a number of the big generators have gone out of the system. That’s putting increasing pressure on the NSW generators.” Not surprisingly, his Queensland counterpart, Mick de Brenni, was not overly impressed. “Queensland has been doing the heavy lifting for the entire east coast, whether it’s on supplying gas to NSW and Victoria, to opening up more gas fields for exploration,” de Brenni told journalists. (After that riposte, de Brenni wanted to “reassure all Queenslanders that the system is operating ... We don’t expect there to be widespread outages.”) Meanwhile, Victoria’s power pinch is forecast for tomorrow evening at this stage. In news to darken the soul of Queensland senator and wannabe coalminer Matt Canavan, Western Australia has joined the rush to dump the fossil fuel from its electricity sector. According to the ABC, the McGowan Labor government will exit coal in its grid before 2030 and pour billions of dollars into renewable energy. In a “landmark announcement” this afternoon, the premier, Mark McGowan, and energy minister, Bill Johnston, said state-owned power provider Synergy would shut its remaining coal-fired plants by 2029. Synergy currently owns and runs two coal-fired power stations, the 854Mw Muja plant and the 340Mw Collie plant, both near Collie some 200km south of Perth, ABC said. Something else to chew over at the national cabinet gathering this week. Tasmanian Greens leader tables petition calling on government to end subsidies for greyhound racing The Greens leader in Tasmania, Cassy O’Connor, has tabled a petition in that state’s parliament calling for an end to government subsidies for the greyhound industry. It was a great honour to table a record-breaking petition condemning the brutal greyhound racing industry in parliament today. This is an industry that wouldn’t survive without tens of millions in taxpayer money. More than 13,500 Tasmanians signed the e-petition to end the subsidies to greyhound racing – making it the biggest e-petition in Tasmanian parliamentary history. The public know this industry has cruelty at its core and want no part in paying for it. The momentum to end the cruelty of greyhound racing is gathering as the industry continues to lose its social license. Tasmanians have spoken, and the Rockliff government is on notice. This industry, that breeds dogs to die or cast aside when they don’t run fast enough, has had its time. The Coalition for the Protection of Greyhounds – which is backing the petition – has detailed 64 deaths of greyhounds on Australian racing tracks this year, and 4573 injuries. There were 213 greyhound deaths from racing in 2021. Judge rebukes Pauline Hanson staffer James Ashby for being ‘evasive’ during defamation trial Senator Brian Burston was alleged to have been a “serial text pest” and worse (read on)... Guardian reporter Michael McGowan has filed from the federal court on Burston’s defamation case against his former boss, Pauline Hanson. Hanson’s staffer James Ashby was accused by a judge of being “evasive” in his evidence. The disgraced Hey Dad! actor and convicted child sexual offender Robert Hughes has been released from Sydney’s Long Bay jail and is expected to be deported immediately to the UK. There’s still a flurry of notices from the Australian Energy Market Operator this afternoon, as the electrons flow around the national electricity market. (Note SA is still paying users to take its power.) The market, though, remains tight, with a total of five “lack of reserve – level 3” notices issued for NSW for later today and into Wednesday. Each has a possible shortfall of supply. Tasmania, meanwhile, has joined its mainland counterparts in facing a supply gap within the next day or so. It’s the only one of the five states without a price cap imposed by Aemo (though at the $15,100/megawatt-hour maximum rate it was charging for its power earlier today, it might not be long before it joins the others with a forced $300/Mwh limit). Another long evening ahead for regulators (and bloggers). Far-right extremism less closely monitored amid focus on Islamist extremism, Victorian inquiry hears From Callum Godde in Melbourne for AAP: A “myopic” focus on Islamist extremism in Australia since 2001’s September 11 attacks in the United States has come at the expense of monitoring the far-right movement, a Victorian parliamentary inquiry has been told. Liberty Victoria president, Michael Stanton, has acknowledged the recent emergence of far-right extremism in the state, citing neo-Nazis gathering in the Grampians and gallows erected outside state parliament as pandemic legislation was debated last year. He told an inquiry on Tuesday that far-right extremism is real, but argued Victorian politicians need to be careful not to blindly expand executive powers, surveillance and censorship to combat its influence. “We need to make sure that in responding to those confronting scenes in the Grampians – whether it be Nazi salutes or display of the swastika – or the erection of gallows outside parliament, that we do not have a legislative response that throws the baby out with the bathwater,” Stanton said. “Sometimes that involves tolerating speech that we find offensive or humiliating.” The barrister said Australian law enforcement agencies’ focus has been drawn away from neo-Nazis and other far-right movements over the past 20 years by Islamist extremism. Both must be addressed, Stanton said, but Victoria’s parliament should not cast the net too wide with any reforms. “The focus should be on those people who are directly likely to be engaged in committing violent acts,” he said. “To cast their net more broadly risks increasing stigmatisation – the kind of stigmatisation faced by the Muslim community, or parts of the Muslim community, in Australia for almost two decades – and risks being counterproductive.” As well as investigating the rise of far-right extremism in Victoria, the inquiry is studying how the Covid-19 pandemic has affected its apparent growth. Col Blanch to be appointed WA police commissioner Current deputy police commissioner in the Western Australian police force, Col Blanch, will become the force’s new commissioner next month. Blanch, who has overseen key portfolios including gang crime, homicide, organised crime, and state intelligence, has been appointed for a five-year term. Blanch became, briefly, a household name last year as the public face of the WA police force’s search for missing girl Cleo Smith, who was found, safe and well, 18 days after she vanished from a remote camping site. “We have all had tears in our eyes this morning,” he said of the early morning rescue of the girl. Blanch is also a former executive director of intelligence for the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission, and chair of the WA State Emergency Coordination Group. WA premier, Mark McGowan, said Blanch was an outstanding candidate. “Col Blanch has proven himself a leader of integrity who cares deeply about safety of the community and those serving under his command,” McGowan said. “Mr Blanch has been directly involved in shepherding the state through the pandemic and he is well-placed to lead the Western Australian Police Force as it confronts challenges of the post-pandemic world.” And now Victoria ... Experts urge ‘careful consideration’ in designing Australian centre for disease control after Labor’s election promise Before its election win, Labor had promised to set up an Australian Centre for Disease Control to help prepare for, and cope with, future pandemics and outbreaks. Experts are now urging the government to carefully consider the body’s design prior to its establishment, warning there is a risk that the establishment of an Australian CDC may be “seen as a ‘quick win’” by the new government. Three experts from the Sydney Institute for Infectious Diseases at the University of Sydney, Prof Ben Marais, Prof Tania Sorrell and Prof Lyn Gilbert, say the Covid pandemic showed such a body was sorely needed to coordinate the national response, collate critical data, and conduct rapid research. In a statement published Tuesday, they said: Careful consideration and consultation are needed to establish this organisation as one that society can look to as a leader in preventing, preparing for and responding to disease outbreaks. It needs to be an entity that can bring together the collective expertise of researchers, epidemiologists, public health microbiologists and practitioners, communications, infection prevention and control experts, and policy makers. The three experts said questions remained about whether an Australian CDC should examine both infectious and non-communicable diseases, how it would be structured to avoid bias or perceptions of bias, and how it could create a national disease surveillance network across various jurisdictions. Here are the latest coronavirus case numbers from around Australia on Tuesday, as the country records at least 31 deaths from Covid-19: ACT Deaths: 0 Cases: 633 In hospital: 93 (with 3 people in ICU) NSW Deaths: 3 Cases: 5,157 In hospital: 1,341 (with 39 people in ICU) Northern Territory Deaths: 0 Cases: 169 In hospital: 22 (with 2 people in ICU) Queensland Deaths: 6 Cases: 4,190 In hospital: 373 (with 8 people in ICU) South Australia Deaths: 0 Cases: 2,429 In hospital: 226 (with 8 people in ICU) Tasmania Deaths: 1 Cases: 658 In hospital: 45 (with 2 people in ICU) Victoria Deaths: 15 Cases: 6,071 In hospital: 473 (with 28 people in ICU) Western Australia Deaths: 6 Cases: 6,315 In hospital: 278 (with 12 people in ICU) David Pocock thanks ‘a community I love’ after being elected to Senate for ACT Climate change activist, independent candidate and former Wallabies captain David Pocock has been elected to the Senate as one of two upper house seats for the Australian Capital Territory. He is the first independent candidate to win election as a territory senator. (The other ACT senator is the finance minister, Katy Gallagher, who was returned.) Pocock received 21.18% of the primary vote. With preferences he achieved quota at the distribution of preferences on Tuesday. Pocock thanked the ACT community for its support. “Today, the extraordinary movement of people we brought together across the ACT made history,” Pocock said. “For the first time, we have an independent voice representing our community in the federal parliament. “Thank you to everyone who put their trust in me to represent you. It is an incredible honour to be able to serve a community I love.” Pocock congratulated Gallagher on her re-election, and acknowledged the work of outgoing Liberal senator Zed Seselja, who had held the second ACT senate seat for nine years but lost out to Pocock in the final counting in this election. Pocock said his campaign “aimed to make politics about people”. “We built a policy platform off the back of thousands of conversations about the things that matter. “We kept it positive. We talked about the issues and the ideas for the future we want and It clearly resonated.” The AEC will officially declare the result tomorrow in Canberra. I told you he was inexhaustible ... (unlike east coast power supplies, it seems): Afternoon fellow travellers. Thanks to the indefatigable Mostafa for his stellar first innings. Speaking of inexhaustible: the latest dispatch (see what I did there ...) from our energetic energy correspondent Peter Hannam: ... So we have an updated view from the Australian energy market operator of the forecast electricity supply gap for Queensland. It’s 1,789 megawatts (which looks revolutionary) at 6.30pm AEST this evening, and larger than the biggest projected shortfall yesterday at 1,454Mw. No wonder Aemo is looking for a response from generators. At this size, you’d expect the Queensland government to again ask consumers to turn off unnecessary appliances, and big power users will probably be asked to do so too (and for some, they will be paid to do so). There are other “lack of reserve” notices for other states including NSW at level 1 or 2, which are not as serious. Some reputable commentators smell a rat, though, as there is ample capacity in the market even taking into account the increasingly unreliable coal-fired power plants in the national electricity market. The Australian Energy Regulator, which is supposed to keep an eye on price gouging, says it is “monitoring the market closely”, as is the competition watchdog, the ACCC. Whether anyone will get pinged for anti-competitive behaviour remains to be seen. And with that, I will leave the blog in the trusty hands of Ben Doherty. Thanks for reading. Albanese suggests bosses go easy on Socceroos fans today Earlier, prime minister Anthony Albanese was asked what is arguably the most important question of the day: will he give the nation a day off to celebrate the Socceroos? Unfortunately, the PM could only offer some encouragement for bosses to go easy on employees today (booooooo): If someone’s having a little kip in the corner, it’s understandable, because if they’ve been up since 4 o’clock watching … and then celebrating afterwards, it’s understandable that coffee can only go so far. The AEC is due to officially declare results in numerous House of Representatives seats today, but the result in the NSW seat of Gilmore has been delayed after Liberal candidate Andrew Constance called for a recount. The former NSW state minister ended up just 373 votes behind Labor MP Fiona Phillips, according to the AEC’s official numbers, and the seat was to be declared officially at 2pm today. But the AEC says that has been delayed after a formal request for a recount, which the electoral body says it will give “thorough consideration”. Constance told Guardian Australia that his vote scrutineers had “raised concerns in relation to certain aspects of the process, particularly the scrutiny of informal votes”. Constance said he believed the close result meant there were “strong grounds for a recount”. The AEC said its staff need time to assess the request, stressing that the delay of the declaration was not any indication of what decision it would make. A spokesman noted the AEC’s validation processes for counting votes, including that ballots are counted more than once in a process called “fresh scrutiny”. Albanese says ‘all things are on the table’ for energy policy review Earlier, Anthony Albanese was asked about the fact the energy minister, Chris Bowen, did not rule out price controls on gas in a morning interview. Albanese said: He didn’t speak about that at all, I’ve read the transcript, he was asked about that. It’s a different thing. With what Mr Bowen said in the interview ... is that all things are on the table. We’ve said we will have a review of the so-called trigger, which is in place. The so-called trigger isn’t really a trigger at all because you pull the trigger and nothing happens until January 1. So what we will do and are doing as a matter of urgency is a review and all things are on the table. Albanese also sounded off about the failures of the Morrison government on energy. He said: It’s not acceptable that we have had a government previously, which was in office for three terms, announced 22 different energy policies and didn’t land one – that is not acceptable. You’ve had a decade of neglect ... you’ve had a decade where we have an energy grid that isn’t fit for purpose for the 21st century. You’ve had too many arguments taking place rather than the investment certainty which comes from having an energy policy ... And what we find is the consequences of the former government’s failure to put in place an energy policy is being felt right now, with problems in the market. The Australian Electoral Commission has announced the count for senators in the Northern Territory has concluded, with Labor’s Malarndirri McCarthy and the Country Liberals’ Jacinta Nampijinpa Price successfully voted into the Senate. Anthony Albanese has been asked about China’s sanctions, after defence minister Richard Marles met his Chinese counterpart, ending several years of Australia being frozen out by Chinese ministers. Albanese said: Well it’s China that has imposed sanctions on Australia, they need to remove those sanctions in order to improve relations between Australia and China. It’s a good thing that Richard Marles [was able to meet] with his counterpart on the sides of the conference in Singapore. We do need to engage with each other and that’s a positive step. But it’s China that has imposed sanctions, it’s China that has changed and it’s China that needs to remove those sanctions. China needs to remove the sanctions they have put in place, there is no reason for them to be there. We are a trading nation, we have fulfilled all of our obligations as part of contracts and arrangements put in place, and we make good products as well. And those sanctions hurt Australia but they also hurt China, because of the quality of our products. Albanese said dialogue had been “missing” in the last few years, but there need to be “concrete steps” from China. My colleague Daniel Hurst has reported similar demands from foreign minister, Penny Wong, to end trade sanctions. Albanese also confirmed he has written back to China after premier, Li Keqiang, sent him a “congratulatory message”, but would not comment beyond saying he “responded appropriately”. “There have been prime ministers who reveal text messages and correspondence - I’m not one of them,” he said. Albanese questioned on reducing deportations of New Zealanders convicted of crimes The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is holding a press conference in Brisbane with the aged care minister Anika Wells. Albanese was asked about his talks with New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, about reducing deportations of New Zealanders convicted of crimes in Australia. He said: I’ve said that section 501 will stay in place. What we’ll have discussions over though is how that framework operates in a sensible way, in the context as well [that] New Zealand has agreed, of course, to take some people who are currently on Nauru, and we’ll have those discussions in the context as well and of how we smooth out the path to citizenship for people from New Zealand, which is a substantial number right here in Australia. Fascinating that he made a link between reducing deportations and New Zealand agreeing to take asylum seekers and refugees from offshore detention. Tasmania records 658 new Covid cases And Tasmania has also reported their Covid numbers, with 658 new cases overnight. There are currently two patients in ICU and 3,645 total active cases. NT records 169 new Covid cases The Northern Territory has recorded 169 new Covid cases overnight, with 22 patients currently in hospital, three of whom require oxygen. ACT records 633 new Covid cases Western Australia is reporting 6,315 new Covid cases and six deaths overnight. There are 278 people with Covid in hospital in the state, with 12 of them in intensive care. Business confidence retreats as Australian stocks plunge Australian stocks seem to have plateaued for now, down just a tad less than 5%, pretty much how far they plunged at the open. There are more details here on that fall, which wiped off more than $110bn in share value: Eventually the effects of financial markets do affect the “real economy” but the daily gyrations can sometimes be misleading (and are bad for blood pressure, and so on). So what’s the real world look like? NAB’s monthly survey of business confidence and conditions finds some retreat but forward orders are keeping both relatively buoyant. Overall conditions remain “well above average”at +16 points, NAB says. That sentiment is patchy, though, with confidence dipping in South Australia and Victoria, but improving in Queensland. Some industries, though, such as construction are not doing very well, profit-wise, even if their order books are generally full. “No other industry is facing such margin pressure,” NAB said. The signs are mixed too for inflation. On the one hand, labour costs were up 2.5% in May, easing from the record 3.0% rise in April, while the cost of finished goods rose 1.8% and retail price growth came in at 3.1% on a quarterly basis, NAB said. By that score, real wages are looking like they might still be going backwards. Queensland has recorded 4,190 new Covid cases and six deaths. There are currently 373 with the virus in hospital in the state, with eight of them in ICU. Public hearings begin into far-right extremism in Victoria A Victorian parliamentary inquiry investigating the rising threat of far-right extremism has begun holding public hearings today. Liberty Victoria president, Michael Stanton, tells the inquiry it is vital a legislative response does not “throw the baby out with the bath water” to ensure free speech is balanced with people’s right to live without discrimination and violence: Sometimes that involves tolerating things that we find offensive or humiliating, and I’m reminded of John Howard, who famously of course introduced gun control but also strongly opposed flag burning becoming a criminal offence, despite pressure from his own backbench. The inquiry, announced in February after a push from the Greens, comes amid a recent emergence of extremist and neo-Nazi groups into public view. Last month, Victoria introduced landmark legislation that would see the state become the first jurisdictions in Australia to ban the Nazi swastika. Aemo says it might need to intervene in SA amid energy shortage but solar helping Eastern Australia’s energy market continues to be busy, with the Australian Energy Market Operator signalling it may have to intervene in South Australia if more supply isn’t forthcoming. At the moment, wind and solar are supplying almost 90% of that’s state’s needs, and SA is busily exporting to Victoria (SA’s spot wholesale price is negative-$1 per megawatt hour, compared with $200-$300 in other parts of the national electricity market). So the intervention will likely be for system security with more “synchronous generating units” needed. Meanwhile, there have been a couple of actual lack of reserve notices in NSW and Queensland where the available extra capacity has been lower than desired but without supply gaps looming. The sunny days across most of eastern Australia (long may they last after the rains) mean there’s a decent amount of solar energy being generated even though we’re in winter. At the moment, about a quarter of supplies are coming from solar farms and rooftops. Short of some surprises, then, the main focus of regulators (and nervous energy ministers) will be what happens as the sun sets. Blackouts, though, remain unlikely but can’t be ruled out. Police in the the town of Taupiri on New Zealand’s north island are responding to reports of an active shooter. AAP reports that a person was injured about 9.30am while a nearby school was in lockdown as a precaution. Police were responding to a “serious incident” in Taupiri, south of Auckland, on Tuesday morning. Local media are reporting that an active shooter was in the Taupiri area. A large number of police remain at the scene. Earlier today, Australia’s energy regulator, the Australian Electricity Market Operator (Aemo), warned that blackouts could still be possible in NSW and Queensland, between 5pm and 9pm tonight. Aemo said in a statement that it has issued notices to encourage more power generation, and that if those measures aren’t sufficient some areas may face blackouts. The market operators also said price caps were in place in Queensland, NSW, Victoria and South Australia because wholesale prices have breached a threshold. As a consequence, some generators revised their market availability in New South Wales and Queensland for today. This has contributed to forecast supply shortfalls, along with generation units being offline for planned maintenance and repairs. Supply reserve shortfalls (lack of reserve 2 and 3) are currently forecast in Queensland and New South Wales this evening (approximately 5pm to 9pm). AustralianSuper cuts weekly admin fee but raises annual fee for contributors The nation’s biggest superannuation fund has cut administration fees that it charges most members – but some will see their fees rise. AustralianSuper, which manages about $261bn of retirement savings on behalf of 2.7 million members, will cut its weekly account-keeping fee from $2.25 to $1. However, it is also increasing the annual fee it charges people who are still contributing to their super, which is based on the size of your retirement account, from 0.04% to 0.1%. Total fees for people accumulating savings will be capped at $350 a year. For people who are retired and drawing down on their fund, the variable fee will go down from the current 0.11% to 0.1%, and the total fee will be capped at $600 a year – down from the current cap of $750 a year. Aussie says that the result will benefit people with less in their super – those with a balance below $50,000 will pay almost 60% less in administration fees. The average fee decrease for people who are retired and drawing down on their super will be 25%, the fund says. In all, about 2.3 million members will either enjoy a decrease or see fees remain the same; it’s estimated about 300,000 to 400,000 members with larger balances will see fees increase. The fund says insurance costs for about 1.13 million members will decrease this year. It has also spent considerable effort bringing investment managers in-house, rather than employing expensive external advisors – something it says has saved members $1bn over eight years and slashed investment fees for members in its main balanced option from a high of 0.84% in 2009 to 0.63% last year. We are expecting to hear from Anthony Albanese in Brisbane shortly. ACT Liberal leader congratulates new senators but doesn’t mention outgoing colleague The Liberal leader in the ACT, Elizabeth Lee, has taken to Twitter to congratulate new Canberran senators Katy Gallagher and David Pocock. Of note here is the complete lack of mention of former Liberal senator Zed Seselja. Make of that what you will: The New South Wales premier Dominic Perrottet has just stepped up to discuss his government’s new childcare plan, saying the $775m commitment over the next four years is an “investment in our family, in our children”. Perrottet says the cash injection will “drive women’s participation, provide great opportunities for families who are struggling with bouncing their work and family life struggle”. This is a once-in-a-generation reform. We know this is an area that has been put in the too hard basket for way too long. This investment today will increase places right across our state, over time and over the next decade ensure prices also come down – a saving of around $4,000 for those families with one child and close to $8,000 for those families who use child care and have two children. It is nation-leading reform that we would expect other states to follow suit. This is something from a commonwealth level hasn’t had the traction that it needs. It has put many women in a position where they are not able to make that choice, they are not able to stay in the work place and this is something that will drive economic activity of around $17bn a year. Pocock on being a senator: ‘I am committed to being accountable and accessible’ And here is David Pocock’s statement on his election win, thanking everyone who put their trust in him, and reiterating his campaign’s focus on making politics about people: Our campaign aimed to make politics about people. We built a policy platform off the back of thousands of conversations about the things that matter. I am committed to being accessible and accountable to Canberrans. I’d love you to come to my first quarterly town hall in July to continue the conversation. The big falls on overseas financial markets have been echoed in Australia, where the stock market was already playing catch-up after Monday’s holiday close. Within a few minutes of opening, the ASX 200 benchmark index was more than 5% down, with all major sub-indices lower. The drop was not a surprise given the steep falls in the US, including 4.7% for the tech-concentrated Nasdaq index overnight. The main concern for investors is that the spike in inflation continues to be worse than feared, which will prompt central banks to send interest rates higher, faster. The US Federal Reserve, for instance, is now expected to lift its key rate by 0.75 percentage points later this week. The S&amp;P 500, a broad measure of US stocks, is down 9% in just three days, Bloomberg notes. The Aussie dollar has also lost ground lately, trading at about 69.5 US cents in recent trade, down from 72 cents last week. No doubt more to come. It’s now official – former rugby union star David Pocock is a senator. The independent candidate has been officially elected to the federal Senate in the Australian Capital Territory, the Australian Electoral Commission announced on Tuesday. He will join Labor’s finance minister, Katy Gallagher, as the ACT’s two upper-house representatives, while former Liberal senator Zed Seselja will miss out. It’s now been more than three weeks since the May 21 election date, but the complicated process of distributing Senate preferences – about 115m preferences nationally, the AEC said – means it takes far longer to officially name upper-house results than those in the House of Representatives. On Tuesday, the AEC named Gallagher and Pocock as the two senators for the ACT, after preferences were distributed. “As with all aspects of the count, the automated distribution of preferences undertaken today was open to scrutineers appointed by the candidates,” said Australian Electoral Officer for the Australian Capital Territory, David Molnar. The Northern Territory’s Senate spots will be revealed later today. The rest of Australia’s Senate composition will be notified “soon”, the AEC said. The electoral commission said on Twitter that the Senate result was “one of the most complex upper house counts in the world – it’s so complex that we needed to write a program to distribute your preferences, as doing it by hand would mean we couldn’t provide elected Senators in time to take their seat.” The ASX is following Wall Street into a tumble: You can read more on the story at the link below: Bowen says export and price control needs to go through parliament I wanted to return to Chris Bowen, who also made the media rounds this morning. He told RN Breakfast that there is a chance the government will seek to implement a 90-day temporary export and price control, to deal with the energy crisis. But he also warned the government does not have a “legislative basis” to introduce short term reforms. But we would need to take that through parliament, there’s no legislative basis at the moment. One thing this government will not do is … respond with an ad hoc reaction … we’ve had enough knee-jerk reactions. There are real challenges, when we have a reform process we will explain it, we’ll take it through parliament and we will seek it. Deputy PM Richard Marles made the rounds this morning, speaking from Tokyo and saying that he intends to build stronger relationships with Japan, while being open to further meetings with China. It comes after Beijing ended its diplomatic freeze of Australia, and a breakthrough meeting in Singapore, where “full and frank” discussions were had on tensions in the Pacific and South China Sea. Speaking to the ABC, Marles said he had wanted to ensure the “relationship was put in a better place”: There was a desire in the meeting that we had, on both sides, to have the relationship put in a better place. The door is open to having further meetings, but I think we do need to understand that the relationship has not been in a good place at all, and this is only the first step and there’s still a long way to go. We want to assert our rights in places like the South China Sea; we see the importance of a global, rules-based order in the Pacific. We’re going to go about our relations with China, but our relations with the whole world in a way which is professional, where we understand the importance of dialogue where we believe in the power of diplomacy. Marles also appeared on the Today Show, emphasising his intention to build stronger military ties between Australia and Japan: We’re not going to be looking to other countries in terms of influencing the relationships that we build with friends like Japan. So we’re building this relationship with Japan on its own terms and it’s never been more important. China is seeking to shape the world around it in a way that it has not done before. That makes our strategic circumstances complex. Both Japan and Australia are allies of the United States. We both have an interest in keeping the United States as engaged as possible within East Asia. Dan Tehan wants parliament to return Dan Tehan, opposition immigration spokesman, says the government should bring forward its first sitting date to deal with the energy crisis, and accusing Labor of trying to avoid scrutiny. This, of course, comes only months after the Coalition had laid out a schedule with only 10 (that’s right, 10) sitting days before August 2022. Tehan was on Sky News this morning, and said he wanted to hold the government accountable early (obviously there’s much more energy when in opposition): The parliament is the place where we are able to hold the government to account, we’ve got an energy crisis and a skills crisis and we’re not sitting until the end of July, why? I’m incredibly surprised, this was a government that said accountability and transparency will be at the forefront of everything they do. It’s right to say the government should think about pulling this trigger, if we can’t get the gas at the right price to our manufacturing industries in particular, we’re going to see dire consequences as a result. These are the types of questions we should be able to put to the parliament when the parliament sits. A spike in deaths in Victoria today, with 15 reported in addition to 6,071 new cases: NSW is reporting 5,157 new cases and three deaths overnight: Childcare in New South Wales will be bolstered with a $5bn package over the next decade as part of a state government plan to boost female participation in the workforce. It was hoped the policy would create an extra 47,000 places across the state, enable private childcare operators to expand or build new centres and increase the workforce, including through university scholarships for early childhood teachers. Announcing the policy at a Committee for Sydney event on Tuesday morning, the treasurer, Matt Kean, said the investment was good economic policy for everyone, not just women. He said: Childcare should not be a postcode lottery. This reform will transform childcare in NSW. Good women’s policy is also good economic policy for everyone. Kean said the loss of female voters for the federal Liberals at the May election was devastating and that he would work to support women in NSW. He said: I was devastated by that because my party should be the standard-bearer for individual liberty that makes our country great. The federal energy minister, Chris Bowen, has said Australia is facing a “bumpy” winter as energy shortfalls bite across the east coast. Bowen was on Sunrise this morning, and said that while there was increased strain on the energy system, he remained confident the situation could be managed. There is a big chunk of coal-fired power out of action in Queensland. That has led to higher prices, and … with the situation in Ukraine, flooding and it being a bit colder earlier than normal, that has increased the load on the system. It’s all being actively managed. We can have confidence in our operators, regulators who are working together with the states. I believe that will result in a better situation for energy consumers and avoid blackouts and certainly minimise the risk of any load shedding activities. The operator tells me there is no need to be concerned about blackouts in the immediate future. I’m not here to give a magical guarantee, but I am here to say that everything that could be done is being done very actively. Socceroos coach Graham Arnold has asked the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, to declare a public holiday in celebration of Australia’s qualification for the Fifa World Cup – and he’s already got one high-profile political supporter in federal energy and climate minister Chris Bowen. “A four-day weekend to celebrate the Socceroos win, is something I think we can all get behind,” Bowen told Radio National this morning. “There’s a prime ministerial tradition isn’t there – any boss who sacks their worker for turning up late today is a bum, that’s what the prime minister should say on a day like this, we can all agree.” Bowen was of course referencing former PM Bob Hawke’s immortal declaration after Australia’s 1983 America’s Cup win. We’re not sure if we’ll see Albanese in front of the cameras in a special white jacket adorned with AUSTRALIA, though. The current PM has only tweeted a simple congratulations (so far) to mark the Socceroos win. “We’re very proud of them, a great day for Australia,” Bowen continued on RN. Other politicians got on the Socceroos bandwagon, with a bunch of Labor MPs getting up early to live-tweet much of the game. Labor senator Nita Green joked Australia was “going to be late for work” after the early morning start. Minister for Sport, Anika Wells, was getting behind new national hero, Andrew Redmayne, who made the ultimate penalty save to seal the Socceroos win. New MP for Bennelong, Jerome Laxale, asked Albanese for “permission to do the Redmayne dance in question time”. Lack of reserve notice from energy regulator It’s going to be a long day by the looks of it when it comes to “lack of reserve” notices and intervention by the Australian Energy Market Operator, such as this early one in NSW: As mentioned in this article, the price caps result in a lot of generators dropping out, and then the regulators are going to have to ask them to jump back in. Seems like an odd way to run things, but Chris Bowen, the federal energy minister, says that’s the market we have to work with. (Cue: perhaps we need to review how the market operates.) As for the mix of what’s in the market overnight, and at the start of the day across the National Electricity Market (NEM), here’s the scene: The NEM, of course, is really only the eastern states and most of South Australia. Western Australia operates its own grids. Still that’s about 80% of the population, and hence, I suppose, the “national” tag still works. Theft on a large scale In a very interesting story this morning, Western Australia Police are appealing to the public for information on a burglary from December, where three people stole a sea container with approximately $100,000 worth of mining equipment inside it. Police say two men and a woman gained entry to into a commercial yard on Wellard Street in Bibra Lake on 28 December, and used a sea container handler to load a 6-metre (!!) sea container onto a truck (that they also stole in August 2021). It is believed the truck used to transport the sea container was stolen from a commercial yard in Naval Base in August 2021. The truck was later found burnt out on a rural property in Oldbury on Wednesday 8 June 2022. Anyone with information is asked to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or report online at crimestopperswa.com.au Convicted paedophile and former star of Hey Dad! Robert Hughes, is set to be deported to the UK today. Hughes was granted parole earlier this month by the NSW State Parole Authority, which determined he be released from Long Bay correctional facility no later than Tuesday. The 73-year-old renounced his Australian citizenship in 2020, becoming a non-lawful citizen requiring deportation upon release. Australian Border Force, who usually handles the deportation of convicted criminals who are not Australian citizens, told AAP it does not comment on operational matters. World Cup joy Between politicians discussing energy and childcare, we still had the joy of the Socceroos winning their World Cup qualifier this morning, and I felt the ABC’s Tony Armstrong captured the mood pretty perfectly: Next off the bench is government services and NDIS minister (and former Labor leader) Bill Shorten, who is blaming the cold for the energy shortfall in NSW and Queensland. Speaking to the Today Show, Shorten also added that “dispatchable power” was essential to combating the energy crisis. He also urged the opposition to join Laor in ending the “energy market operator wars.” The very cold weather, combined with let’s face it, 10 years of delay and denial about investing in our energy market operator grid, and the chickens have come to roost. You need what’s called dispatchable power. That’s power that you don’t need to be paying for seven days, 24 hours a week but when it’s really cold, that’s when you need it. (Australians) want to hear that the government and opposition are working together. The truth is we need more dispatchable power (and) renewable energy is cheaper. Let’s move forward. Less of the argy-bargy and more of the action. Matt Kean on NSW’s $5bn childcare package Kean has gone on to spruik the state government’s new $5bn childcare policy, which he says will grow the state’s economy by $17.4bn. What it will do is see up to 95,000 women be able to enter the workforce or take on more hours. I mean, childcare costs are attacks on the dreams of women and families right across New South Wales, indeed right across the country. We believe that families should have access to quality affordable childcare no matter where they live ... And these reforms will deliver a middle-income family in New South Wales who have one child full-time care savings of up to $3,900 per annum. When asked if the state was stepping in to fill a role usually reserved for the federal government, Kean avoided the question: This is one of the biggest productivity reforms that we can have that will grow our economy. And obviously lift living standards in this state. Our policy is focused on providing additional childcare – accessible and affordable childcare across New South Wales – will grow the overall size of the economy by $17.4 billion. NSW treasurer Matt Kean says he has confidence in the “reliability of the system,” indicating he is not expecting any blackouts in the coming days. Speaking to Patricia Karvelas on RN Breakfast, Kean said the government was monitoring the situation, but asked people to be conscious of their power usage. We’re obviously monitoring the situation very closely. But this situation has arisen because the wholesale prices of electricity have gone above a point which triggers the market cap. That cap is in place to protect consumers. And because the price of electricity that the generators can get for supplying electricity into the market is too low to cover their costs, they’re not bidding into the system. So this is a market failure issue. We’re not telling people to turn off the heaters, we’re not telling people to turn down their air conditioners or anything like that. But people should just be conscious that where they can reduce their use of electricity, that’s a good thing for them. It’s going to lower their power bills, and it’s also going to take a bit of pressure off the system. Socceroos qualify for the World Cup Before we jump into the inevitable flow of politicians making the media rounds this morning, I wanted to point to Emma Kemp’s ongoing live blog of Australia’s World Cup qualifier. Earlier this morning, Australia beat Peru on penalties to make their fifth consecutive World Cup: You can also read the match report, linked here. Good morning, and happy World Cup qualification day! Mostafa Rachwani with you this morning, to take you through the day’s news. We begin in New South Wales, where energy authorities are on high alert for possible power shortfalls hitting homes and businesses tonight. It comes after Queensland only narrowly avoided blackouts last night, after the Australian Energy Market Operator worked to head off a gap projected at one stage to be 1,454 megawatts. In federal politics, deputy prime minister Richard Marles will be in Tokyo today, maintaining the jet-setting ways of this new government. Marles will be calling for stronger military ties between Japan and Australia, emphasising the need to strengthen the relationship between the two countries. Back in NSW, the state government there has unveiled its signature budget policy, which will allow private childcare operators to expand or build new centres, in the hopes of creating an extra 47,000 places across the state. Finally, prime minister Anthony Albanese is considering whether to attend a NATO summit in Madrid at the end of the month, and to support the alliance toughening its stance against Russia. There is still much going on, so let’s dive in."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2019/dec/29/rebecca-long-bailey-labour-party-britain","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2019-12-29T22:30:49Z","webTitle":"We can take the Labour party back into power.

Here’s how","bodyText":"In 1979, the year I was born, Thatcher’s election victory precipitated an attack on our working-class communities, picking apart the bonds that held us together and the institutions that made us proud. I grew up watching my father’s friends lose their jobs. The Shell oil docks where he worked, once a beacon of good pay and security for industrial workers in our area, was shut down, and my family was forced to relocate. We were lucky, but the same dogged pursuit of redundancy continued apace in his new workplace too. When I began my first job in a pawnbrokers, I saw people forced to give up family heirlooms so they could afford to feed their children. And now, as an MP, I have seen the devastating impact successive Conservative governments have had on communities like mine. This election was a historic chance to turn back that tide. But across the country, including in many of the areas hit worst by austerity, we failed. The country was sharply divided by Brexit, and our compromise solution satisfied too few. But we can’t blame Brexit alone, and we must recognise that it’s no good having the right solutions if people don’t believe you can deliver them. Over the next few months, we must have an honest discussion about why we lost and how we can win. Strategies designed in Westminster were partly to blame, but it’s also true that Labour’s support has been falling in many communities for a decade or more. We must rebuild trust, not only in our party but in the idea that change really is possible. This means we cannot return to the politics of the past. Our transformative agenda is principled and popular, while triangulation and soft pedalling will only take us backwards. There are many lessons to learn from the defeat, but it’s clear we didn’t lose because of our commitments to scrap universal credit, invest in public services or abolish tuition fees. Instead, we must pledge to upend the broken political system that has held back our communities for decades. Real wealth and power must be returned to the people of Britain, and their desire for control over their own lives and the future of their communities must be at the heart of our agenda. We also need bold, transformative solutions to both plunging living standards and the climate crisis. Working with campaigners, trade unions and experts, I have been proud to champion our party’s plans for a green industrial revolution to tackle the climate crisis through investment in good, unionised jobs and the reindustrialisation of our regions and nations. It will spark the growth of new industries as well as guarantee that the renewable technologies of the future, from electric vehicles to solar energy, are available to every home in Britain. Labour can deliver radical change. Over the next few years, our task is to rebuild the broad base of support that will get us into government and this work must begin immediately. From ex-miners in Blyth Valley to migrant cleaners in Brixton, from small businesses in Stoke-on-Trent to the self-employed in Salford, we have to unite our communities in all their diversity. Britain has a long history of patriotism rooted in working life, built on unity and pride in the common interests and shared life of everyone. This history is internationalist: as in 1862 when Lancashire’s mill workers supported Abraham Lincoln’s anti-slavery blockade of cotton from the American south. To win we must revive this progressive patriotism and solidarity in a form fit for modern Britain. While Boris Johnson criticises single mothers and likens Muslim women to bank robbers, we must stand for pride in our communities, dignity in our work and a common purpose that unites communities across the country. Labour’s trade unions and our party members will be crucial. They are our roots in every workplace and community. They bring with them a wealth of knowledge and experience. We can’t take them for granted, and our promise to democratise society will ring hollow if we can’t even democratise our own party. We must take the conversation from Westminster to the workplaces and social spaces of our communities, and the party must support Labour members and trade unions who are fighting back against the Tory assault on migrants, the vulnerable and our public services. To rebuild trust you have to turn up and Labour needs to be at the heart of communities making real, concrete change long before the next election. We can win again, but first our party must come together. We are strongest when we stand together as a pluralist Labour family. That is why I’m not only considering standing to be leader, but also supporting Angela Rayner as deputy. Leadership means leading a team, working with every part of our movement and using all our party’s talents to fight the Conservatives at every turn and map Labour’s route back to power. Millions woke up to a nightmare on December 13. It’s our duty to make sure that doesn’t happen again. • Rebecca Long-Bailey is Labour MP for Salford and Eccles, and the shadow business secretary"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2020/jan/26/inequality-climate-crisis-harder-tackle-poor-sacrifice-davos","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2020-01-26T12:27:14Z","webTitle":"Inequality makes climate change much harder to tackle | Larry Elliott","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/26/inequality-climate-crisis-harder-tackle-poor-sacrifice-davos","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2020/jan/26/inequality-climate-crisis-harder-tackle-poor-sacrifice-davos","fields":{"headline":"Inequality makes climate crisis much harder to tackle","bodyText":"For those perched at the top of the mountain, the view is perfectly clear. Climate change is the issue of the moment and has to be tackled without delay. Governments, companies and individuals are all going to have to adjust to the new reality. Anybody who is not with the agenda – for example, Donald Trump – is either mad or bad. There was a big US delegation to Davos last week but it found itself isolated – in public, at least – on the climate emergency. The annual meeting of the World Economic Forum found Greta Thunberg’s call to arms much more compelling. Later in the year there will be a much more important event than the World Economic Forum: the UN climate change summit (COP26) in Glasgow. In Davos it was hard to move without hearing the phrase “race against time”. Almost 15 years ago Nick Stern, then head of the UK Government Economic Service, produced a report on the economics of climate change in which he called the failure to deal with a heating planet the greatest market failure of all time. He argued that the benefits of early action outweighed the costs. Last week Prof Stern, now chair of the ESRC Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy and the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change at the London School of Economics, said the threat was now being taken a lot more seriously. There were four reasons for that. First there was evidence, after a 1C increase in temperatures since pre-industrial times, of the failure to act. “We are seeing some pretty nasty stuff already,” he said. Second, the scientific evidence was now clear that there was a big difference – for example, in the length of droughts – between a 1.5C and a 2C increase in temperatures. Third, the education system was producing a generation of young people across the world well versed in climate, sustainability and environmental issues, and they were putting pressure on their parents to act. Young people wanted to know why the economics profession had been slow to include climate risks into their models, which was a justifiable criticism, Stern said. Only a tiny fraction of the papers published in economics journals have related to sustainability. Finally, Stern noted, an awareness was growing that there is a more attractive way of doing things. The days of the internal combustion engine were numbered, the cost of solar energy had collapsed and there had been dramatic advances in battery-storage technology. Yet the chances are that Glasgow will not deliver as much as the scientists say is necessary. In part that’s because some important countries, including the US, Brazil, Australia and Saudi Arabia most prominently, will resist pressure to make the commitments that are needed. But it is also because the view from the bottom of the mountain is hazier than the view from the top. Consider why Emmanuel Macron did not show up at Davos this year. The French president took precisely the kind of action deemed necessary to tackle the climate emergency – whacking up the cost of driving fossil-fuelled vehicles – only to find the country erupt into protest. The message to Macron from those on low incomes was clear: don’t talk to us about the end of the world until you have told us how to make ends meet at the end of the month. Trump and his team see things through the lens of the yellow vest protesters. When Olaf Scholz, Germany’s finance minister, said his government was committed to taxing carbon emissions more heavily, the US treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, replied: “If you want to put taxes on people, go ahead and put a carbon tax. That is a tax on hardworking people.” It’s easy to dismiss Mnuchin’s comments as those of a politician with his head in the sand, but he has a point. Speedy action to tackle the climate emergency requires political action. But political action will only be possible if governments can carry their voters with them. And that is not going to be possible if the measures enacted appear to be all pain and no gain. The Stern report came out in 2006 and it is now 2020. In the intervening years there has been a whopping financial crisis, and a decade in which living standards for the majority of people have moved sideways. It is much easier to worry about the future of the planet if you are comfortably off and don’t have to rely on a food bank. The problem – and this goes to the heart of what is wrong with Davos – is that nobody really wants to confront the issue of inequality. There was plenty of hand-wringing about the climate crisis, much talk about the need for higher investment in new technologies, and a lot of head-scratching about weak growth. What there wasn’t – as usual – was any willingness to adopt the obvious solutions. Any sensible person observing the World Economic Forum annual meeting from the outside would come up with the following analysis: working people are going to be less terrified about new technology if they are represented by a trade union. Growth would be higher, and less dependent on debt, if workers were able to bargain collectively. Public support for more rapid action to fight global heating would be stronger under a more progressive tax system. Entrepreneurs would develop new green technologies more quickly if governments set more onerous targets for reductions in carbon emissions. All these notions are anathema to those running multinational corporations. They hate the idea of trade unions, they are ideological in their opposition to stronger states, and they recoil from the idea that they should pay more tax. But if poor people are expected to make all the sacrifices, expect some resistance. And expect the battle ahead to be long and hard. • Sign up to the daily Business Today email here or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2019/mar/29/renewables-produced-more-energy-than-brown-coal-and-gas-over-summer","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2019-03-28T21:43:20Z","webTitle":"Renewables produced more energy than brown coal and gas over summer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/mar/29/renewables-produced-more-energy-than-brown-coal-and-gas-over-summer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2019/mar/29/renewables-produced-more-energy-than-brown-coal-and-gas-over-summer","fields":{"headline":"Renewables produced more energy than brown coal and gas over summer","bodyText":"Growth in wind and solar energy over the past two years has almost entirely replaced the lost output from the Hazelwood power station during summer, a new report says. The latest Green Energy Markets report says renewable energy produced 128% more megawatt hours of electricity than gas and 23% more than brown coal over the 2018-19 summer in the national electricity market states. It also shows that output from solar energy alone exceeded that from brown coal and gas when averaged across the 9am-5pm period. Demand for electricity hits a peak between 11.30am and 5.30pm in the summer months. Green Energy Markets’ figures, which are drawn from data published by the Australian Energy Market Operator, shows output from solar exceeded both gas and brown coal every hour from 9am until 3pm. From 3pm to 4pm, it was exceeded by brown coal, and then from 4pm to 5pm, it was exceeded by both brown coal and gas. Black coal remains the dominant source of energy, but its output across the entire summer is below 2017-18 summer levels. Wind and solar output was 2,821GWh higher this summer than it was in the summer of 2016-17, prior to Hazelwood’s closure, according to the report. Most of this increase is attributed to new renewable projects coming online over the past year. Tristan Edis, a Green Energy Markets director, said this growth had almost completely made up for the drop in summer brown coal output of 2,908GWh since the Victorian power station’s closure. “I think what this data is illustrating is actually we have been able to replace the output from Hazelwood over the summer period,” Edis said. “If we were concerned about the closure of coal and not being able to have reliable electricity supply, what this demonstrates is [that] renewables have been able to fill the gap left by a pretty large electricity generator – and over the period where we have peak demand.” Edis said solar capacity was on track to double in the next three years, with a large amount of both rooftop and large-scale solar expected to be online by next summer. The report suggests output from solar will exceed that from brown coal and gas over the entire 9am-to-5pm period during summer by 2021-22. Edis said storage options would start to fill the gap left of an evening. “One of the points we’re seeing is what’s going to happen – fossil fuels will be pushed into a smaller and smaller period late in the afternoon and early evening,” he said. “At that point, you say we only need a few hours worth of storage and you fill that gap.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/live/2023/may/04/local-elections-2023-latest-results-reactions-polls-close-england-conservatives-labour-rishi-sunak-keir-starmer-lib-dems-greens-live-updates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-05T23:00:01Z","webTitle":"Local elections 2023 live: Labour becomes largest party in local government – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/may/04/local-elections-2023-latest-results-reactions-polls-close-england-conservatives-labour-rishi-sunak-keir-starmer-lib-dems-greens-live-updates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/live/2023/may/04/local-elections-2023-latest-results-reactions-polls-close-england-conservatives-labour-rishi-sunak-keir-starmer-lib-dems-greens-live-updates","fields":{"headline":"Local elections 2023 live: Labour becomes largest party in local government – as it happened","bodyText":"We are closing this blog now. Thanks so much for tracking developments with us. You can read all our local election coverage here. Labour is now the largest party in local government, surpassing the Conservatives for the first time since 2002. It has gained 632 seats while the Lib Dems have gained 417 seats. The Tories have lost over 960 councillors and have lost control of 48 councils with results still coming in. The Conservatives have been wiped out in Stockport, despite two of the three local constituencies being represented by Tory MPs. The council remains in no overall control, with the Lib Dems the largest party but increasing their seats from 28 to 30 out of the 63 up for grabs. Labour won 24 seats, up from 18. The council elections will not conclude until Tuesday after Redcar &amp; Cleveland, in North Yorkshire, stopped counting with just two results to come. After 18 hours of counting and four recounts, the final two seats up for grabs in the market town of Hertford have gone to the Green party. With its win in Mid Suffolk the Green party has officially taken majority control of their first council in the UK. A local election in Derbyshire has been abandoned after one of the candidates died while counting was under way. Gillian Lemmon, an incumbent Conservative councillor running for the Hilton ward in South Derbyshire, died on Friday. She was taken ill a few days ago and her condition “suddenly deteriorated”, her Tory co-candidate Sundip Meghani said. Saturday’s Guardian. Here is a selection of some of Saturday’s front pages starting with the FT. Conservative Tom Wootton defeated Liberal Democrat incumbent Dave Hodgson by just 145 votes to become the directly elected mayor of Bedford. The result was delayed until Friday night by a recount, with Wootton gaining 15,747 votes and Hodgson 15,602 with Labour’s Saqhib Ali third with 11,568. The contest used the first past the post voting system for the first time, with Wootton winning in 2019 after two rounds using the single transferable vote (STV) system. A local election in Derbyshire has been abandoned after one of the candidates died while counting was under way. Gillian Lemmon, an incumbent Conservative councillor running for the Hilton ward in South Derbyshire, died on Friday. She was taken ill a few days ago and her condition “suddenly deteriorated”, her Tory co-candidate Sundip Meghani said. Meghani was at the count when his co-candidate died at around 12.45pm. “We all gathered outside to be given the news, I think it was around 2ish,” he told the PA news agency. Because Lemmon died before the declaration had been made, the district council’s returning officer decided to abandon the count. A by-election will take place later this summer for all three seats in the Hilton ward. Here is the latest state of play in our graphic. The Tories have lost 959 seats while Labour have gained 625 seats and the Lib Dems are +420. Jonathan Carr-West, chief executive of Local Government Information Unit (LGIU),said: “With (nearly) all councils declared, we can look back at a day of steadily escalating drama. The Conservatives had looked to manage expectations with predictions of up to 1000 seats lost. That turned out to be the reality. “There’s been a steady drumbeat throughout the day of Conservative councils lost to No Overall Control but this has been punctuated by some more striking results. “Not only did Labour take some of their most ambitious target councils like Swindon and Stoke-on-Trent. But they also had unexpected gains in Medway and Bracknell Forest. Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats took control of previously Conservative councils like Dacorum, Stratford-upon-Avon and, most notably, Windsor and Maidenhead.” Lee Dillon, the Liberal Democrat group leader for West Berkshire, said the party is “absolutely delighted” with the results, where they gained a large majority over the Conservatives. The Liberal Democrats won a total of 29 seats, 13 more than they previously held. The Conservatives now hold 11 seats, the Greens two, with one gained by Labour’s Clive Taylor, who won by only one vote. Dillon said: “Honestly, it’s an amazing result. Having been a councillor in opposition since 2007, I’m absolutely delighted that we have been given this opportunity to make the changes people told us they need. “I just had a resident phone me. They went: ‘Well done, you’ve got the buggers out.’ I think residents will be happy when they log on and see the results. “We’ve clearly won the popular vote and I think that puts the Conservatives on notice that Newbury is up for grabs [at the next general election].” Laura Farris MP holds the seat for the Tories with a 16,000 majority, defeating Dillon who was the Lib Dems’ candidate for the parliamentary constituency in 2019. Sir Ed Davey hailed the Liberal Democrats’ “best result in decades” in the local elections. The Lib Dems said they had taken control of 12 councils, the highest number the party has gained since 1995. Davey said: “This has been an historic victory for the Liberal Democrats with our best result in decades. “It’s little wonder Rishi Sunak is running scared of a general election, because he knows the Liberal Democrats are set to take swathes of seats across the Conservative party’s former heartlands.” Labour is now the largest party in local government, surpassing the Conservatives for the first time since 2002. Labour has taken South Derbyshire after winning 23 seats on the council, which has a total of 36, with several results still to come. Previously Labour and the Conservatives had 16 seats each on the council, which is based in the former mining town of Swadlincote. Rishi Sunak has faced devastating losses of more than 1,000 Tory seats in the local elections, while Labour has said the party is on track to win power at the next general election, write Rowena Mason and Peter Walker. The prime minister conceded on Friday that the English council results were “disappointing”, but faced a scathing verdict from some of his MPs, and the first rumblings of a threat to his leadership from allies of Boris Johnson. Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, was buoyed up by the party winning more than 500 seats, and believing its projected vote share puts it on course to take power in 2024 for the first time in 14 years. The Liberal Democrats took South Oxfordshire, which had been a hung council, after winning 19 of the 36 seats, with six seats yet to be declared. The Lib Dems previously had 13 seats on the council, which is based in Abingdon. Results are now available from 200 out of 230 councils. The Conservatives lost 763 seats with Labour gaining 510, the Lib Dems gaining 338 and Greens 173, with independents and residents/ratepayers down by more than 300. The Conservatives lost control of 41 councils, with Labour gaining 19, the Lib Dems nine and the Greens one. Derby city council will remain in a state of no overall control following the local election. Labour has gained eight seats, taking its total to 23. While the party remains three short of a majority, it puts Labour in pole position to form a minority leadership. The Conservatives lost three seats, taking their total to 15. Reform Derby has taken six seats. The Liberal Democrats are the day’s biggest losers, winning four seats – half of what they had at the start of the day – while the Independents have one fewer, with three. It is the first time since Stockport was born as a local authority in 1974 that there is not a single Conservative councillor. The council remains in no overall control, with the Lib Dems the largest party but increasing their seats from 28 to 30 out of the 63 up for grabs. Labour won 24 seats, up from 18. Labour has won Brighton &amp; Hove from a minority Green administration in the city that has the only Green MP, Caroline Lucas. With 13 results to be counted, Labour had won 28 seats, on the 54-seat council, with the Greens only on four. The Conservative leader of Stafford borough council has lost his seat to the Green party, with the council now almost evenly split between Labour and the Tories. Labour gained three seats, meaning they now have 13, while the Conservatives lost six, leaving them with 14. The former leader of the council, Patrick Farrington, told the Guardian on Tuesday that he had detected political apathy among Conservative voters in the area but “I don’t see the Labour party making much of a dent from what I’ve heard on the ground”. The Green party gained four seats on the council, which was previously led by a Conservative-minority administration, while the Stafford Borough Independents have seven seats. Labour has won Cheshire West &amp; Chester from no overall control. Labour had been the largest party, and with five results to be declared had taken 36 of the 70 seats. All seats have now been declared in Central Bedfordshire with independent candidates leading the way. Labour is now the largest party in local government, surpassing the Conservatives for the first time since 2002. The Liberal Democrats said they “have won big” in Surrey Heath where the levelling up secretary, Michael Gove, is MP, taking control from the Conservatives. “This is the Michael Portillo moment of these local elections. Senior Conservative cabinet ministers are now looking nervously over their shoulders at the Lib Dems,” a party spokesperson said. The council elections will not conclude until Tuesday after Redcar &amp; Cleveland, in North Yorkshire, stopped counting with just two results to come. The council tweeted: “Following a second recount, candidates in the Longbeck Ward have agreed for a third recount to take place on Tuesday 9 May at Redcar and Cleveland House beginning at 10am.” In Central Bedfordshire, independent candidates have done considerably well in many wards. The council has been under Tory control since it was formed in 2009. As thing stand, independent candidates have 27 seats, up 11. Conservatives 20 (down 18) Liberal Democrat 10 (up 7) Labour 5 (up 4) Green 1 (their first councillor in Central Beds) Labour took overall control of York, winning 24 of the 47 seats in a city which has a Tory and a Labour MP. Rishi Sunak visited early in the campaign to try to boost his party, which gained one seat to Labour’s seven, with the Greens losing three and the Lib Dems losing two. The new council is Labour 24, Lib Dems 19, Conservatives three and independent one. The Liberal Democrats took control of West Berkshire after winning 23 of the 43 seats on the council, with the Conservatives on nine, and nine results still to come. The Conservatives previously had 24 seats and the Lib Dems 16 on the council, which is based in Newbury. Here is an update on the standings. Results have been declared from 180 of 230 councils. The Conservatives have lost 674 seats with Labour gaining 437, the Lib Dems gaining 281 and the Greens 149. The Conservatives had lost control of 38 councils with Labour gaining 16, the Lib Dems gaining seven and the Greens gaining one. The Tories have done worse, in terms of the swing against them towards Labour, in the south of England, according to the academic Will Jennings, who is working on the Sky News elections analysis. This chart shows the change from 2019, when these seats were last fought. That is all from me for tonight. My colleague Nadeem Badshah is now taking over. The Conservatives have been wiped out in Stockport, despite two of the three local constituencies being represented by Tory MPs. The council remains in no overall control, with the Lib Dems the largest party but increasing their seats from 28 to 30 out of the 63 up for grabs. Labour won 24 seats, up from 18. Stockport has been in no overall control since 2011, with the Lib Dems leading a minority administration for the last year, led by former MP, Mark Hunter. The Conservatives lost their final four seats — three in the wealthy Bramhall wards and another in Hazel Grove. The result bodes ill for Stockport’s two Conservative MPs. Hazel Grove is currently held with a 4,423 majority by William Wragg, who has announced he will not contest the next general election. Cheadle is represented by Mary Robinson, who won a slim 2,336 majority over the Lib Dems in 2019. Labour’s Navendu Mishra holds the third constituency, named simply Stockport. A leftwinger formerly on the Corbyn wing of the party, Mishra has been blamed for splitting the local Labour party and prompting the expulsion of councillor Matt Wynne, who went on to form his own hyperlocal party, the Edgeley Community Association, which won all three seats in Edgeley The Greens won three seats and the Independent Ratepayers won three in Heald Green. Labour say they are expecting to gain Thanet from the Conservatives. On Radio 4’s PM programme Prof Sir John Curtice, the BBC elections specalist, was asked what would happen in a general election on the basis of what has emerged from the results today. He was reluctant to be specific, and stressed the uncertainty, but settled on Labour being about 20 seats short of an overall majority as an answer. With its win in Mid Suffolk the Green party has officially taken majority control of their first council in the UK. Carla Denyer, the party’s co-leader, claimed the victory means the Greens have their first outright council majority in the northern hemisphere. Andrew Stringer was the first and only Green councillor elected in Mid Suffolk in 2003. He said: We always thought we could rewrite the rules of politics here in sleepy old Suffolk but we didn’t think it would be such a momentous, historic thing. We tried to rewrite the rules of local politics where the expectation of the electorate is that we do what we say on the leaflet. Stringer said the “backdrop of politic chaos” over the past few years had helped the Greens electorally, but support for the party has increased steadily in the past 20 years. Being the first Green council in the northern hemisphere means all eyes will be on us to deliver. We’ve now got four years to prove to the world that Green can be the way forward and deliver for our communities. Suzie Morley, the ousted Tory council leader who lost her seat to the Greens, said: “The one thing that as Conservatives we’ve always been able to rely on is our ability to manage the economy. Unfortunately, that hasn’t served us well from central government over the last six months. UPDATE: Later Denyer said her claim about this being the first council in the northern hemisphere to have an outright Green majority was wrong. An academic subsequently said this was the not the first outright Green majority in Europe either. Ben Houchen, the Conservative mayor of Tees Valley, and one of the most prominent champions of red-wall Conservatism in the party, has told Sky News that the party is currently performing at a C-plus level. This is from Sky’s Tom Larkin. Here is another set of election results that have come in within the last half an hour. The copy is from PA media. Labour has taken control of North East Derbyshire district council from the Conservatives. The new council has 28 Labour councillors, 19 Conservative councillors, three Lib Dems, two independents and one Green. One of the Conservatives to lose her seat was Angelique Foster, the Tory representative for Dronfield South and the Derbyshire police and crime commissioner, who was defeated by six votes. Labour has held Gedling borough Council, in Nottinghamshire, retaining 28 seats. The Conservatives gained two seats from independents, taking their total to nine. The Liberal Democrats have also retained their total of four seats. Labour says it has won Dover, which has been controlled by the Conservatives since 2007. It says it has gained six seats, and that the Tories have lost six seats. Labour has taken Broxtowe borough council, in Nottinghamshire, from the Conservatives. It gained 12 seats to take its total to 26 seats, while the Tories lost 10 seats, taking their total to the same number. The Liberal Democrats lost two seats, taking their total to five, while three seats remained independent. Liberal Democrats took control of Mid Devon after gaining 22 seats, with the Conservatives losing 12 and independents 11. The make-up of the new council, which was previously no overall control, is Lib Dem 33, Conservative five, Green three and independent one. Labour has a lead of nine points over the Conservatives on vote share on the projected national share (PNS) model calculated by Prof John Curtice for the BBC. Prof Michael Thrasher produces an alternative vote share figure, the equivalent national share (ENS), for Sky News. His final figures are not out yet, but his preliminary ones have the Labour lead over the Conservatives at between six and 10 points. Honestly, Succession has nothing on the drama of the closing moments in the battle for East Herts district council. After 18 hours of counting and no fewer than four recounts, the final two seats up for grabs (in the market town of Hertford) have gone to the Green party. Apparently votes in the final two seats had to be recounted four times, with the candidates finally separated by just one vote. So it is true – at least in this instance – that every vote counts. This means that the formerly true blue council – reminder that the Tories have run the council here since 1995, and won 100% of the seats in 2015 – is now much more of a muddy brown colour. The Greens are now the largest group on the council with 19 seats, the Conservatives bottomed out with 16 while the Lib Dems took 10 and Labour five. It can be seen as part of the Greens’ successful policy of targeting rural seats, a strategy that also saw them take control of their first ever council in Mid Suffolk. It’s a win so significant, as to have the team at Have I Got News For You making gags about it. This chart, from Steve Fisher, an academic who works with Prof John Curtice on the BBC’s elections analysis, shows how Labour’s lead over the Tories in these elections compares with the Labour leads (a minus figure means they were behind the Tories) in all local elections since the 1980s, when the Tories have been in power. Today’s lead is higher than in any year since the four years after Black Wednesday. It is quite similar to the Labour lead in 1990. But months after those local elections, the Conservatives changed their leader, which transformed their chances in the subsequent general election. Here are some of the results that have come through in the past 20 minutes or so. The reports are from PA Media. Greens have taken control of Mid Suffolk, winning 18 of the council’s 34 seats, with eight more results to be declared. It is the first council they have controlled outright. The Lib Dems have gained control of South Hams from the Conservatives, after gaining nine seats in the Devon council. The new council has 19 Lib Dems, seven Conservatives, three Greens and one independent, after the Conservatives lost nine seats. Labour have taken High Peak from no overall control after gaining eight seats in the Derbyshire council, with the Conservatives losing six. The new council is Labour 29, Conservative 10, Green two, Lib Dem one, independent one. The Conservatives gained Torbay from no overall control after gaining five seats in the Devon council, with Lib Dems gaining three and independents losing eight. The new council is Conservative 19, Lib Dem 15 and independent two. The Tories claim these PNS figures (see 3.24pm) mean Labour is not on course to win the next election. They point out that Labour in 1996, and the Conservatives in 2009, both had much higher leads in the year before they went on to win a general election. In 1996 Labour had a 16-point lead over the Tories in the local elections on the PNs measure. Labour were on 43%, and the Tories 27%. And in 2009 the Tories had a 15-point lead. They were on 35%, and Labour on 20%. Asked about the figures on the BBC, Chris Philp, the policing minister, pointed out that Prof John Curtice wrote an article for the Times earlier this week saying that Labour would need a double-digit lead to show it was on course for election victory. Curtice said: Labour enjoyed leads of 15 points or more between 1994 and 1996. The same was true of Cameron in 2008 and 2009. Doing quite as well as that might be thought a tall order. But registering at least a double-digit lead should not. Certainly, if Labour’s lead is anything much less than that we will be left wondering whether the party really have as yet sealed a deal with the voters. Prof John Curtice, the BBC’s chief election analyst, gave his take on the PNS figures. (See 3.24pm.) Here are the main points he made. Curtice said this was Labour’s best performance in local elections at least since 2010. But he said the size of the Labour lead was mainly a result of the Tory share of the vote being particularly low. Their share of the vote was even lower in 2013 (25%), he said. He said Labour’s 35% share of the vote was no higher than it was last year. He said that, with 20% of the vote, the Liberal Democrats had had their best result in local elections since 2010. Curtice was then asked if this was enough for Labour to be on course to win the next general election with a majority. He replied: It depends how you take those figures … What we then have to do is to say well, what is the swing implied by these [figures], how does it compare with the swing that the national opinion polls are showing? The national opinion polls have the Liberal Democrats much lower because the Liberal Democrats do much better in local elections. The implied swing here from 2019 is 4.5%. The swing in the most recent opinion polls is 5%. With a 16-point lead in the polls Labour would have enough to get an overall majority. [With a 4.5% swing], perhaps just enough, much depending on Scotland. So maybe, just – but only if you look at it in that particular way. The BBC has now released its projected national share (PNS) figures for the local election. This is the estimate of what the share-of-the-vote figures for each party would have been if elections had taken place in the whole of Britain. (There is little point looking at the raw figures in local elections, because in some years there are more elections in Tory areas and in some years more in Labour ones. For example, this year there were no elections in London, which is now strongly Labour.) The figures are: Labour: 35% Conservatives: 26% Lib Dems: 20% Others: 19% The last time Labour had a lead of at least nine points on this measure in local elections was in 1997, when it was 11 points ahead. Since then other highpoints have been 2001 and 2012 (both seven-point leads). The Green party say they have now made a net gain of 100 seats. The figure on our results page is lower, but that is because we use the Press Association’s results service, and they only record figures once full results from the relevant council are in. Labour has lost control of Slough, where the Conservatives have become the biggest party, with 21 of the 42 seats, PA Media reports. PA says Labour lost 17 seats, with the Conservatives gaining 16. Labour have taken control of Erewash council in Derbyshire from the Conservatives. Labour has gained Blackpool council, which was under no overall control. There are two target parliamentary constitutencies covering the town. Scott Benton won Blackpool South for the Tories in 2019 with a majority of 3,690, and Paul Maynard won Blackpool North and Cleveleys for the party with a majority of 8,596. There were no local elections in Scotland yesterday. But the SNP has been watching the results closely, and the party has been encouraged by the analysis from elections experts (see 8.35am and 2.13pm) saying the results imply Labour will win the next election, but without an overall majority. Stephen Flynn, the SNP leader at Westminster, said this shows Scots should vote SNP so Scotland can “pull the strings” of a minority UK government. In a statement he said: It’s increasingly clear that the SNP can hold the balance of power after the next general election – putting Scotland in prime position to pull the strings of a minority UK government. Voting SNP is the best way to beat the Tories in Scotland – and every vote for the SNP will be crucial to ensure Scotland wields real power and influence. With the pro-Brexit Labour party lurching to the right, and becoming indistinguishable from the Tories, the SNP will make certain that real change happens. The SNP would ensure the power to determine Scotland’s future is transferred to Edinburgh, that the cost of living crisis becomes the main priority of Westminster and that relations with Europe are rebuilt and renewed. The Liberal Democrats have gained Stratford-on-Avon, and Dacorum council in Hertfordshire. Dacorum was where Ed Davey drove a tractor through a “blue wall” of hay at the start of the election campaign. Prof Michael Thrasher, Sky News’ election expert, has said that his analysis suggests that these results show Labour is on course to be the largest party in parliament after the general election, but without an overall majority. Labour argues it could get an overall majority because the situation has changed in Scotland recently, and the collapse in support for the SNP meant it could gain enough seats there to get it over the line. Thrasher said this was a “reasonable argument”. But he said he could not take it into account in his model because he does not have fresh data for Scotland. The Conservatives are losing most in remain areas, according to an analysis of today’s results. These are from Will Jennings, an academic contributing to the Sky News analysis. Labour has taken control of Swindon, the BBC’s Faisal Islam reports. Labour gained eight seats on Swindon council. The town has always been a key battleground. Sir Robert Buckland, the former justice secretary, has a majority of 6,625 in South Swindon, and Justin Tomlinson won North Swindon for the Tories in 2019 with a majority of 16,171. Within the last half an hour or so, the Conservative have lost both Bromsgrove and Maidstone to no overall control. Carla Denyer, the Green party’s co-leader, has said that the “uninspiring” nature of Labour, as well as dislike of the Tories, have contributed to her party’s success (see 11.14am) today. She highlighted Worcester, where the party got the largest vote share (29%), and gained three seats from Labour and one from the Conservatives, despite some predicting that Labour would take overall control of the council. The Greens also gained seats on councils including Southend-on-Sea, Havant and South Kesteven, and are hoping to win outright control of their first council in Mid Suffolk later today. Denyer said her party was capitalising on “a deep dislike of the Tories and Starmer’s uninspiring Labour”. She went on: It is also clear that voters have responded positively to our practical solutions to meet concerns on issues such as the cost of living crisis, housing, underfunded and run-down public services and the state of our rivers. Labour says it has won East Staffordshire, where four years ago the Tories picked up 25 seats, and Labour just 10. A Labour spokesperson said: This is a hugely significant result that confirms we are on course for a majority Labour government. We have been going backwards in Staffordshire in recent general elections. With this gain and our win in Stoke, we are making real progress in the places we need to win the next election. Chris Poulter, the Conservative leader of Derby city council, said he expected the council to remain in a position of no overall control, PA Media reports. The council is currently led by a Conservative minority, with the Tories having 18 seats, while 26 are needed for a majority. Spirits are high among the Greens in Mid Suffolk, which could become the first majority-controlled Green council in the UK if the party wins at least five more seats. The council is currently controlled by the Conservatives. The Greens have gained four seats so far, ousting the incumbent Tory council leader in the process. The Greens currently hold 12 seats in the council. They need to win 16 to take control. Suzie Morley, the leader of Mid Suffolk council, was unseated this morning by the Green candidate Nicholas Robert Hardingham, who won 615 votes to Morley’s 419. Andy Mellen, the leader of the Mid Suffolk Green party, said: It’s looking very positive at the moment. It’s looking like we could end up with a Green majority here. Morley, the ousted Tory council leader, called the outlook for the party “challenging” and said “national government hasn’t done us any favours”. She went on: I think we’ll lose control of the council and it’s likely the Greens are going to take control. It’s upsetting but we will be a strong opposition. On Wednesday night, on the eve of the elections, Rishi Sunak clearly implied that if the Conservatives did badly, it would be because of the crises that hit the party in 2022 when Boris Johnson and Liz Truss were in charge. Interestingly, in his comment on the results this morning (see 8.04am), he did not repeat this argument. The Johnsonites may be in a relatively weak position (see 12.21pm), but it seems he does not want to provoke them any further. Tory MPs have not been criticising Sunak openly, but one “Conservative source” has attacked him anonymously this morning, telling the Telegraph: Sunak can’t blame these results on last year’s chaos. He started that chaos by knifing the most successful Tory election winner in 50 years. Sunak’s claim that stability has been restored is shot to bits. These results are on track to be catastrophic for the party and worse than before the change of leader. The Liberal Democrats think they have a chance of taking control of the councils in Surrey Heath and Stratford-on-Avon, which are represented respectively by the Tory MPs Michael Gove and Nadhim Zahawi. They say in that Surrey Heath it is neck and neck which party will take overall control, and that in Stratford-on-Avon they are “increasingly confident” of at least ousting the Tories from being in control. A party spokesperson said: We are now seeing Lib Dem votes piling up in unexpected areas. It’s going down to the wire, but Conservative big name MPs like Nadhim Zahawi and Michael Gove could have a Lib Dem-run council this time tomorrow. Conservative MPs across the blue wall will be petrified at these results. If we win in Stratford and Surrey Heath, there is nowhere safe in the blue wall. Police are being urged to investigate after a video emerged of Boris Johnson allegedly not wearing a seatbelt in what appears to be a moving vehicle, PA Media reports. PA says: In a video being widely shared on social media, the former prime minister is heard urging Derbyshire Conservatives ahead of Thursday’s local elections to “get as many people as possible to turn out and vote for us”. Johnson does not look to have been wearing a seatbelt in the 42-second clip which appeared to have been self-recorded. The Liberal Democrats have called on the police to investigate a “potential breach of the law”. The message was said to have been shared on Twitter by Derby North MP Amanda Solloway but seems to have since been deleted. Derbyshire police said there is “no information” to suggest the former Tory leader filmed the video while in the county. Rishi Sunak was fined by police after being spotted without a seatbelt in an Instagram video he filmed while travelling during a visit to Lancashire on 19 January. There was good news for Rishi Sunak on the Today programme this morning; he was slagged off by a former Tory MEP. The ex-MEP was David Campbell Bannerman, who was once a Ukip deputy leader and who is now chair of the Conservative Democratic Organisation, which campaigns for more grassroots democracy in the party but which is also widely seen as the ‘Bring back Boris Johnson’ campaign. Speaking about the local election results this morning, Campbell Bannerman said “the leadership” was a big factor. He went on: I think the way that we got rid of Boris, I’ve spoken to quite a few people who regret that on the doorstep. We’re putting up taxes, the highest taxes for 70 years. And there’s a price to be paid for that. We want to get back to more traditional conservative policies. Campbell Bannerman said the CDO was “not about bringing back Boris”. But he went on: It’s true that a lot of our members still like and rate Boris, as do many of the public, and given the scale of the challenge ahead, we shouldn’t rule that [bringing Johnson back] as an option happens as an option longer term. Why was this good news for Sunak? Because at one point it was assumed that bad results in the local elections would trigger a fresh bout of Tory infighting, with Johnon’s supporters arguing that he would do better than Sunak. If senior Tory MPs were saying this, or if the Daily Telegraph or the Daily Mail were making this argument, then Sunak would be in difficulty. But they’re not, and we have not heard a peep from Nadine Dorries or Jacob Rees-Mogg, who in the past have been two of the most enthusiastic Johnson supporters in the Commons. If the Today programme could have found a more prominent Tory willing to use the local election results to criticise Sunak, and talk up Johnson, they could have done so. But it seems they couldn’t, and so the fact they ended up quoting an obscure ex-MEP suggests Sunak is safe. The Greens in East Hertfordshire are also having a marvellous time this morning – unlike the Conservatives who have had a terrible night. The Tories have lost control of East Herts council for the first time since 1995 and only the second time in its 49-year history. In 2015 Conservatives won all 50 of the seats (last time round they managed a mere 39) – currently they have 16, with two seats in Hertford Castle too close to call and currently being recounted with results expected around lunchtime. With two seats to declare at East Herts, no one can reach 26 for full control, but the Greens are the largest party with 17 seats, the Tories are on 16, Lib Dems 10 and Labour on five. The Green co-leader Adrian Ramsay visited East Herts last month and rather optimistically suggested the party could take 10 seats; in fact they might get almost double that number if the final two seats go the Greens’ way. He told the Guardian this morning: It is a fantastic result in East Hertfordshire. To go from winning our first seats four years ago to having 17 seats now and the chance of being the largest party is really incredible. It is testament to the incredible hard work by local people there, but what it also shows is that people are looking for an alternative to the Conservatives, including in areas where they have been traditionally very strong. Elsewhere in the county the Tories lost 13 seats in Hertsmere, which the party had run since 1999. On Broxbourne council, the Tories held their nine seats and Labour kept their one, while in Stevenage – a key Labour target in the general election – Labour took nine of 13 available seats while the Tories and Liberal Democrats won two each. On Dacorum borough council in Hertfordshire, the Conservative leader Andrew Williams narrowly held on to his seat by 11 votes, saying: “A win is a win.” Many opposition MPs claimed that the real motive behind the decision to require voters to show photo ID was to suppress the anti-Tory vote. If that was the reason (and the Tories insist it wasn’t), it did not seem to work. (See 10.20am.) Another change to voting law introduced by this government has been the introduction of first-past-the-post for mayoral elections and for police and crime commissioner elections. Previously the supplementary vote system was used, which involves second preference votes being taken into account. This was also seen (perhaps with more justification) as a blatantly partisan move. In many areas rightwing votes go to the Tories, but leftwing votes are split between parties like Labour and the Lib Dems. In this scenario, first-past-the-post helps the Conservatives. But, as the elections expert Lewis Baston points out, in the Middlesbrough mayoral contest, the new system seems to have helped Labour. Here are the full results for the Middlesbrough mayoral election, from PA Media. Chris Cooke (Lab) 10,956 (40.20%, +17.46%) Andy Preston (Ind) 10,196 (37.42%, -21.76%) Jon Rathmell (Ind) 3,102 (11.38%, +1.39%) John Cooper (Con) 2,997 (11.00%, +2.90%) Lab maj 760 (2.79%) 19.61% swing Ind to Lab Electorate 99,034; Turnout 27,251 (27.52%, -3.56%) The Greens are cock-a-hoop this morning, after a better than expected showing and many results still to be declared. According to the party’s HQ, by 10am on Friday they had a record number of councillors and had made a net gain of 27, after winning 54 seats so far. They reckon they could gain as many as 100 seats when all the counting is done, with gains made in Worcester, Southend-on-Sea, Havant and South Kesteven, South Tyneside and Coventry. This morning co-leader Adrian Ramsay told me he was exhausted, but “jubilant”. He said: We’ve had a fantastic night that has surpassed our own expectations. Four years ago, we saw the first of several years where Greens achieved record results. So despite the fact that we were defending a record number of seats, we have still seen substantial gains. We’ve got a lot of excitement from our supporters to capitalise on. Ramsay said the party was anticipating strong results in Mid Suffolk and Herefordshire later on today. Those are the sorts of places – Bristol, Waveney Valley in Suffolk, Herefordshire – where we will be well placed to challenge for the seat at the general election because people can see we’re the main challengers on the ground. A flaw in the current electoral system has been exposed in Salford, where a sitting Liberal Democrat councillor has just been elected in the Cotswolds as well. The Manchester Evening News (MEN) reports that Chris Twells, who won a seat on Salford council last year in the Ordsall ward for the Lib Dems, stood as a “paper candidate” in the Cotswolds – and won. In the run-up to this year’s election, Salford’s Labour mayor, Paul Dennett, raised his concerns about Twells moonlighting in the Cotswolds. He was assured by Coun Alex Warren, leader of the Lib Dems in Salford, that: “His name is on the ballot paper as a paper candidacy because the Lib Dems were struggling to fill their slate. He will not win.” But win he did, taking 38% of the vote in the Tetbury with Upton ward, ousting a Conservative. Oops. Dennett called on Twells to “do the right thing” and resign his Salford seat to concentrate on representing his new ward in the Cotswolds. Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, told activists in Windsor that “time is up” for Rishi Sunak. He said: Voters across the country have sent a clear message in these local elections, a message so loud that even someone as out of touch as Rishi Sunak can’t ignore it. People are fed up with waiting hours for an ambulance, waiting in vain for the police to show up after a break-in, or for real action to bring down soaring energy bills and food prices. Conservative MPs are out of touch, out of ideas and out of excuses, and the British people are fed up with waiting for a chance to kick them out of office. Time is up for Rishi Sunak and his appalling Conservative government. We need a general election now. It’s clear that in many parts of the country, it’s the Liberal Democrats who can defeat the Conservatives and deliver a fair deal for the British people. Davey was in Windsor because taking control of Windsor and Maidenhead council from the Tories was one of his party’s best results overnight. The party says it gained 13 seats from the Tories, with swings of more than 20% in some wards. These were the first local elections where people had to provide photo ID to vote. According to Prof John Curtice, the BBC’s elections expert, this does not seem to have had a big impact on turnout, and it does not seem to have disadvantaged Labour (as some claimed it might, because the list of photo ID permissible was more suited to pensioners than students). Curtice told the BBC it was too early to draw firm conclusions. But he said three trends stood out. One, turnout is only slightly down on both 2019 and 2022, which at least is prima facie evidence against the argument that there was a significant loss of turnout as a result of the voter ID requirements. Secondly, we cannot discern any relationship between the fall in turnout, such as it was, and the proportion of people who, according to the 2021 census, don’t have a passport in the areas, which is one indicator of the availability of the requirement for voter ID. And, thirdly, we certainly can’t see any link between the extent to which turnout fell and how well or badly Labour did. In fact, if anything, Labour tended to do rather better in wards where turnout fell most, which certainly argues against the Conservative claim that Labour were simply doing better because their voters stayed at home. And equally [it] also argues against the Labour claim that they were going to be disadvantaged by the voter ID pilot. And this is what Keir Starmer told Labour activists when he spoke to them in Chatham just now about taking control of Medway council. He thanked the activists for their work, and said Labour was on course to win a majority at the next general election. He said: Thank you, all of you. You’ve done an absolutely stunning job here. You didn’t just get it over the line. You blew the doors off. The first victory here since 1998. An amazing, amazing set of results. I didn’t doubt it when I saw the energy and the commitment and the case that we were making. But what a fantastic result here in Medway. And we’re having fantastic results across the country. Plymouth – what a night they’ve had in Plymouth. And then Stoke, and up to Middlesbrough – all the places that we need to win, the battegrounds. And make no mistake – we are on course for a Labour majority of the next general election. Some of the country’s top election experts don’t agree. See 8.19am and 8.35am. Starmer also explained why he thought Labour was doing well. He said: It was all about the cost of living and we had a positive case to make. We understood what it’s like not to be able to make ends meet and we said what we would do to help people with their everyday bills. And the government, the prime minister said nothing. And that’s because they’re the problem, not the solution. And what we’ve shown together is that we can make change. We’ve changed our party. We’ve won the trust and confidence of voters and now we can go on to change our country. So change is possible. A better Britain is possible. Well done to all of you. Fantastic morning. Thank you so much. Keir Starmer is in Medway, where Labour won control of the council for the first time since 1998. He told supporters: “We are on course for a Labour majority at the next general election.” UPDATE: See 9.47am for the full quote. Boris Johnson did not campaign for the Conservatives in the local elections, Greg Hands, the Tory chair, told LBC this morning. As LBC’s Henry Riley points out, only last week, speaking to the Telegraph, Hands was saying Johnson was a great campaigning asset for the party. Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, told BBC Breakfast this morning that the election results for his party “exceeding expectations” and “groundbreaking”. He explained: We’ve taken control of the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead. And in what I call the blue wall seats, Conservative traditional heartlands, the Liberal Democrats are going to make big gains. We have yet to count in places like Surrey, Sussex, Hertfordshire and Oxfordshire. But I can tell you we’re very positive about our chances there. And it’s not just in traditional Conservative heartlands that the Liberal Democrats are making gains. In our own heartlands, in places like Devon and Dorset, I think we’re going to do really well. So we’re really happy this morning. I think it’s the voters who are both really angry with the Conservatives, but responding positively to the Liberal Democrat message. Conservatives have lost control of South Gloucestershire, where they previously held 33 of the 61 seats, losing 10 of them, with Labour gaining six and the Liberal Democrats three, PA Media reports. PA says: The new council is under no overall control, with 23 Conservatives, 20 Lib Dems, 17 Labour and one independent. This is the last of the councils that counted overnight to declare, with pauses at three councils until later on Friday. It means the next council result is not expected until around noon on Friday. There are 169 council results to come and three elections for mayors. It is a mixed picture for Labour across the north of England so far. The party will have been disappointed not to wrest back control of Hull from the Liberal Democrats, who tightened their grip on Humberside thanks to policies including “making bus lanes peak-time only”. Will the city of John Prescott turn yellow in a general election? Hard to tell, though Hull’s three Labour MPs will not be too cheerful this morning. Elsewhere, Labour are making solid but not sensational gains, winning enough seats from the Conservatives to become the largest party in Hartlepool and Bolton, both of which remain in no overall control. Keir Starmer’s crew in the north-east are cock-a-hoop after ousting Middlesbrough’s independent millionaire mayor, Andy Preston, on a near 20% swing. Councils to watch in the north later: Stockport, where the Liberal Democrats hope to wipe out the four remaining Tories (a very bad omen for whoever stands for the Conservatives in the Hazel Grove constituency now that William Wragg has announced his departure); and High Peak (officially the Midlands but spiritually extremely northern, sandwiched between Manchester and Sheffield), where Labour hopes to win enough seats from the Tories to take full control. In his clip for broadcasters this morning Rishi Sunak cited Bassetlaw in Nottinghamshire as an example of a place where the Tories had made progress. (See 8.04am.) Alastair Campbell, the podcast supremo and former Tony Blair communications chief, says Sunak was talking nonsense. And this is from James Naish, the Labour leader of Bassetlaw council. The leader of Sefton council in Merseyside said he was “appalled” to hear that some of the 850 people who had staffed polling stations had received abuse from the public, especially as a result of the new, national voter ID requirements that were in effect for the first time. Labour’s Ian Maher said: I want to say a huge thanks to everyone who was involved in the mammoth task of organising and managing the local elections, particularly with the government’s introduction of the new and in my mind needless ID requirements. But I also want to say how sorry I am that staff have been put in the position where they have had to endure abuse from the public, in no small part because of the new rules. We knew from the introduction of photo ID requirements that this change would not be well received by some of our communities but to hear that our hardworking staff, who are simply helping people have their democratic say, have been subjected to horrid abuse is frankly shocking. Prof John Curtice, the BBC’s elections expert, told the Today programme that the Tories could end up losing 1,000 seats by the end of the day. But he said that Labour’s share of the vote did not seem to be higher than it was 12 months ago (when Labour was on 35% in the local elections, according to Curtice’s projected national share calculation, and the Tories on 30%). Asked if he agreed with Labour that it was on track to win the next general election (see 7.23am) on the basis of these results, Curtice said “it depends what you meant by win”. He said the results certainly suggested Labour would be the largest party after the next general election. But he said it was still “uncertain” whether Labour was on course to have a majority government. This is very similar to what his Sky News rival, Prof Michael Thrasher, is saying. (See 8.19am.) The Conservatives lost control of South Kesteven in Lincolnshire, a council where the party had 36 of the 56 seats before polling day, PA Media reports. They lost 12 seats, leaving the council under no overall control, with 24 Conservatives, 22 independents, four Liberal Democrats, four Greens and two Labour. Prof Michael Thrasher, the elections expert who provides analysis for Sky News, has written an article this morning saying these could be the worst results for the Tories since 1995. He says: The Conservatives have lost a third of their council seats so far - a hammering by any standard. If that trend continues, the party is likely to post a final tally that rivals the debacle of 1995 that left them limping towards a massacre at the general election two years later. But Thrasher also claims Labour is not doing well enough to be on course to gain an overall majority at the next election. Gaining Medway for the first time, a council that Labour could not win in 1997, is a notable coup for the party and one which it will rightly publicise. It will also celebrate the rise in vote share in Rushmoor, where it even surpassed the 1995 figure. This is all evidence of Labour passing the test it’s been set. But there are other results, Hartlepool, Lincoln, Tamworth and elsewhere, where Labour’s progress falls short of a general election-winning performance. Even where it has done well, like Plymouth, the increase in vote share, though large, is not large enough for an overall majority at the next general election. This last sentence might be read by Labour supporters with incredulity. But the electoral arithmetic that lies behind the next parliamentary election is that the national swing from the Conservatives required for a Labour victory is greater than the party achieved in its 1997 landslide. This is because Labour posted one of its worst-ever general election performances in December 2019, and its recovery from that must be spectacular. Rishi Sunak has just delivered a statement to broadcasters about the election results. It is unusual for a PM to comment so early in the day, when most of the results are not yet in, but Sunak’s general message was that he was ploughing on anyway. When it was put to him that the former leader of Medway council said the Tories lost power there because of the government’s record, Sunak replied: We’ve only had a quarter of the results in. Actually, we’re making progress in key election battleground like Peterborough, Bassetlaw, Sandwell. But the message I am hearing from people tonight is that they want us to focus on their priorities, and they want us to deliver for them. And that’s about halving inflation, growing the economy. reducing debt, cutting waiting lists and stopping the boats. That’s what people care about. That’s what they want us to deliver. And that’s why the government are going to work very hard to do. Sunak was listing the five pledges he made in January. The former Tory leader of Medway council, Alan Jarrett, spoke to the Today programme earlier. In an interview with Times Radio, Greg Hands, the Conservative party chair, set out in more detail why he thought the results were not particularly good for Labour. He said: There’s areas where Labour really should have done better last night. We’ve actually gained councillors in seats which Jeremy Corbyn won in 2017, like Peterborough like in Sandwell, like in Bassetlaw. So I don’t think it’s a uniformly good picture for Labour. He also said taking control of Stoke-on-Trent council was not that significant for Labour. He said: Stoke-on-Trent sets a very low bar for Labour. You’ve got to remember that in 2017 under Jeremy Corbyn Labour won two of the three parliamentary seats in Stoke, so you know Stoke is a low bar for Labour to regain. Greg Hands, the Conservative party chair, has admitted that it has been a “disappointing” night for his party. He told GB News: We always said it would be a difficult night for the party, the independent projections were all that we were going to lose 1,000 seats. It’s still early days so far but if I might say, it’s not been that great a result for Labour in some areas. We’ve actually gained seats in Peterborough, Sandwell, Bassetlaw, other areas that Labour need to win at the next election. In fact, there was only one prominent independent projection suggesting the Tories would lose 1,000 seats. It was an estimate from the academics Prof Colin Rallings and Prof Michael Thrasher, published in the Local Government Chronicle in March, based on what polling at the time suggested. Labour believes the results so far shows it is on course to win the next election. (See 6.16am.) Here is an extract from the Labour party briefing explaining why the party thinks this. Based on the results declared so far, we are confident Labour will have an equivalent vote share lead of at least eight points which would represent our best result since 1997. If Labour had an 8% lead in a general election we would win a majority government, taking into account anticipated recovery in Scotland. We have gained key councils such as Plymouth, Stoke-on-Trent and Medway and gained the Middlesbrough mayor. All of these overlap with battlegrounds for the next election and represent several key areas of the country which Labour needs to win: southern marginals, Midlands, North Kent and Teesside. If Labour is to win the next election we need to be winning in these places – and we are … Not only have we won these constituencies, in some cases we have won them by a very large margin. For example in both Plymouth Moor View and Dudley South the swing from the 2019 general election to the constituency aggregate this year was 23%. In local elections, Labour has not been at least eight points ahead of the Conservatives on the national equivalent vote (NEV) share since 2001, when it was nine points ahead. On the alternative projected national share (PNS) calculation, Labour has not been at least eight points ahead since 1997, when it was 11 points ahead. Some experts thinks Labour would need to be at least 10 points ahead of the Conservatives at a general election to have a majority of one. But Labour’s recent recovery in Scotland is changing that calculation. Good morning. I’m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Helen Sullivan. Here are four elections experts on where things stand this morning with the results. From Keiran Pedley from Ipsos: From James Johnson, a pollster who used to work for Theresa May when she was in No 10: From Will Jennings, an academic contributing to the Sky News election analysis: From Patrick English from YouGov: That’s it from me, Helen Sullivan, for today. Thanks for following along – and stay tuned for the many more local election results to come. My colleague and politics blog mastermind Andrew Sparrow will bring you the latest news and analysis. Tory councillors suffered because at the end of 2022 the Conservative party as a brand was “certainly damaged”, Tory former minister Jonathan Gullis has said. Speaking to Sky News after Labour took control of Stoke-on-Trent, Mr Gullis said: “Look obviously it’s disappointing. I feel for those Conservatives councillors and candidates who, have sadly, I think, let’s be quite frank, suffered because at the end of 2022, the Conservative party as a brand was certainly damaged, obviously went through its own turmoil.” The Conservatives lost control of Boston, losing 10 seats in the Lincolnshire town, PA reports. The new council has 24 independents, five Conservatives and one Liberal Democrat. Britain Elects co-founder Ben Walker points out that Medway is a Westminster bellwether seat – and was key to Tony Blair’s victory in 1997. We’ve heard comparisons to 1997 from Labour tonight, too. But again: this is with around a third of the councils called. There are still many results to come. Labour has won a majority in the key council Medway for the first time since 1998, PA reports. Labour won 30 of the council’s 59 seats. With six seats still to be declared, the Conservatives are on 22 and there is one independent, but Labour now cannot be caught. “We will make sure the people of Medway who have chosen change will get the services they deserve,” says the newly elected leader of the council, Vince Maple. “More than a decade of austerity … has led to perilous situations,” he says. Here is the moment the results were announced: Think tank LGiU (Local Government Information Unit) is awake and has their take. Jonathan Carr-West, LGiU’s chief executive, says the results are broadly as expected that it has been a “good night for Labour”: With nearly all of the overnight results in, these elections are broadly conforming to expectations. So far, it’s been a good night for Labour with big wins in Stoke-on-Trent and Plymouth; key targets in very different parts of the country. The Liberal Democrats will also be pleased to be holding councils like North Norfolk, Hull and Cotswold. The Conservatives are losing seats and councils such as Tamworth, Brentwood and North West Leicestershire moving to no overall control. So far though, it’s a steady stream of losses not a tidal wave and is within the admittedly very pessimistic expectations they have set out. But, there is still a long way to go. A reminder of what is at stake today for the Conservatives and the opposition nationally: The task for Rishi Sunak in his first electoral test is clear. The tide is against his party, so he needs to set the bar low and hope disaster is at least averted. It does not help that his party are more exposed than usual with this year’s contests mainly on blue-leaning territory. Yet the Conservatives also had a weaker than usual starting position, thanks to the electoral wipeout they suffered in 2019, when nearly all of the seats being contested were last fought. The 2019 contest took place in the dog days of the May government, with Nigel Farage’s Brexit party surging in the polls. It was a disaster for the Tories, with more than 1,300 seats lost, but meltdown then means less exposure now. The Conservatives are defending fewer vulnerable seats and may even recover ground in some quarters. Every defence against the tide and unexpected gain will be seized upon as a sign of resilience. Keir Starmer’s task is equally clear: this local election offers the best opportunity for a show of strength. He needs Labour to convert clear poll leads into council clean sweeps. The past is also helpful for Labour – the 2019 local elections were a “plague on both your houses” cycle, where voters turned against government and opposition alike. Labour, like the Conservatives, lost votes and seats then. But Labour, unlike the Conservatives, have recovered strongly since. The opposition is therefore sure to advance even if the governing party does not fall further. While a Labour win in Medway looks likely, we’re still awaiting an official result. Labour hopes to win the unitary authority in Medway for the first time since its creation in 1998. It is “quite obvious” Labour will form the next administration at Medway, the Conservative leader of the council has said. Asked whether he was sure that Labour would gain Medway Council, Alan Jarrett told the BBC’s Elections 2023 programme: “Yes, pretty sure because although we haven’t had many seats declared, wards declared, it is quite obvious from the counting that Labour will form the next administration.” The Conservatives have lost control of Windsor and Maidenhead (a single council) after the Liberal Democrats made gains in the royal borough, PA reports. With 17 of the 41 seats still to declare, the Conservatives held only three seats, with the Lib Dems on 13 and independents on eight. The Conservatives had 22 seats on the council before polling day, with the Lib Dems on 10. The loss of this council is the Tories’ sixth loss so far. Labour is confident it will have its best local election results since 1997, PA Media reports, with an equivalent vote share lead of at least 8% over the Tories. The party believes the results so far suggest it is on track to win the next general election. Shabana Mahmood, Labour’s national campaign co-ordinator, said: “These results show that we are on course for a majority Labour government.” “We have spent the whole campaign talking about Labour’s plan to tackle the Tory cost of living crisis which is the number one issue for voters. “Rishi Sunak can’t talk about it because the Tories crashed the economy and they don’t know how to fix it. “These results have been a disaster for Rishi Sunak as voters punish him for the Tories’ failure.” Veterans Minister and Plymouth Moor View MP Johnny Mercer, described by Labour MP Luke Pollard as “toast” after the Labour gained control of Plymouth council: Voters have heard the pledges and promises of four Conservative prime ministers since the last time this set of authorities were up for election in May 2019. Theresa May faced enormous pressure to quit after a bad set of results and she resigned in June that year. Keir Starmer will be hoping to reap the rewards of Labour’s 18-point lead over the Conservatives. The Tories, who launched their local election campaign with little fanfare, have been in heavy expectation-management mode, predicting losses of more than 1,000 seats. Commentators predict that Tory losses of even 500 seats would mean trouble for Rishi Sunak’s authority. But Labour also has a lot to prove. The latest look at Brexit’s interesting impact on today’s results so far, according to politics researcher Will Jennings – Labour’s greatest gains are in areas that voted “Leave” in 2016. Areas that voted “Remain” are where the Conservatives have suffered their greatest losses: Transport minister Huw Merriman has suggested Boris Johnson and Liz Truss are to blame for the Conservative losses in local elections across England. Merriman told the BBC’s Elections 2023 programme: “When I was talking to my constituents on the doorsteps yesterday, they were talking about older news about former prime ministers, but saying your current leader seems to have what it takes. “He seems to be turning things around for us, but this is the opportunity for the electorate to give their vote on where we have been previously.” Asked if it was Johnson and Truss’s fault, Merriman said: “Certainly, on the doorsteps the feedback I got was that we are in a better place. The polls show that as well. People are reacting in a more positive way towards Rishi Sunak.” Davey will be happy to hear that the Liberal Democrats have held onto North Norfolk, even managing to gain a seat. The Tories gained two seats. Liberal Democrat Leader Sir Ed Davey said it had been a “groundbreaking night” for his party, PA reports. He said: “We are exceeding all expectations. We have delivered a hammer blow to the Conservative Party in the blue wall ahead of next year’s general election. “We’re making progress all over the country - including in the heart of the blue wall, where we’re confident of taking control of the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead. “From Bath to Brentwood, more and more communities are choosing Liberal Democrats to be their local champions. “The message from voters is clear: they are sick to the back teeth of Rishi Sunak and his out-of-touch Conservative Government. “At this election, it is the Liberal Democrats who are defeating the Conservatives and delivering the fair deal people deserve.” Meanwhile in Stoke-on-Trent: It is just after 5:30 am in the UK. With full results from 45 out of the 230 councils where elections were being held, here is where things stand: The Tories lost control of five councils, including Plymouth, and suffered a net loss of 102 councillors. Labour has gained control of two councils and put on 84 councillors. Labour has taken control of Plymouth council from the Conservatives, securing a key target in a battleground regarded as crucial to the party’s hopes in a future Westminster contest. Labour also gained the key “red wall” city of Stoke-on-Trent from no overall control. The Liberal Democrats have put on a net 30 councillors. Labour’s Chris Cooke won the battle to become mayor of Middlesbrough, defeating the independent incumbent Andy Preston with a swing of almost 20%, a result the party said was “beyond our expectations” and “exactly the kind of progress we needed to make in Teesside”. Labour claimed that, based on the aggregate vote, the party would have won Aldershot, which has been held by the Tories since its creation as a seat in 1918. Labour claimed it would also have won other Westminster constituencies, including Hartlepool, Stevenage, Dudley South, Ipswich, West Bromwich East, Great Grimsby and Aldershot, which has been held by the Tories for more than 100 years. The Lib Dems have held onto Hinkley &amp; Bosworth (a single council) and gained a seat. The Tories gained a seat here, too. The Tories have failed to retain their majority in East Lindsey after losing five seats. Independent candidates gained four seats and the greens gained one. The Conservative Party has lost control of Hertsmere Council after both Labour and the Liberal Democrats made significant gains, PA reports. With 37 out of 39 seats having declared, the Tories have won just 15 seats - well short of the 20 needed for a majority. The party began the night with 29 seats on the council, which includes the seat of Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden. Labour has almost doubled its seats, winning 13, while the Liberal Democrats have won nine. This makes five majority Tory councils lost so far – each to no overall control. Results are pouring in. Labour has held onto Bolsover and gained 11 seats. The Lib Dems hold onto Cotswold, gaining four seats. The Conservatives hold South Holland but have lost four seats to Independent candidates. A reminder that this is Helen Sullivan taking you through the latest. I have a fresh cup of tea and will be staying with you for a while still. You can get in touch with me or follow along on Twitter here, or via email at helen.sullivan@theguardian.com. The next key result we’re hoping to hear is Medway, where Starmer has campaigned twice in the run-up to polling day. Labour hopes to win the unitary authority* here for the first time since its creation in 1998. The council is currently 33 Tory and 20 Labour. We’ll also get the first glimmers of results from Stoke-on-Trent, Tameside and South Gloucestershire soonish. *For those who don’t know what a unitary authority is: County councils are responsible for functions such as transport, social care and education. District councils are responsible for matters including housing, planning and waste collection. Unitary authorities are responsible for all these functions within their area. Labour have gained nine seats in Bolton, but the council remains under no overall control. The Conservatives lost seven seats. Here are some of the key results so far, via PA: Plymouth: Labour gain This was one of Labour’s top targets in southern England and the party will be pleased with the result, taking overall control with seven gains. The council had previously been run by a minority Conservative administration, which had come in for criticism after chopping down 110 healthy city centre trees overnight - a decision that may be linked to the Tories losing five seats. Worcester: no overall control Worcester has remained in no overall control but the result shows the Conservatives, who were the largest party, faced a challenge from all sides. They lost a total of seven seats while the Greens gained four, the Liberal Democrats two and Labour one. The new council sees Labour the largest party with most seats (13), followed by the Greens (10), the Tories (eight) and Lib Dems (four). Tamworth: Conservatives lose to no overall control Labour made seven gains in Tamworth while the Tories lost five. This was enough to deprive the Tories of full control of the council and although they remain the largest party with 14 seats, Labour is now close behind on 10 while independents have six. Brentwood: Conservatives lose to no overall control This is another council where the Conservatives lost control, although here it was the Liberal Democrats who made the running, gaining three seats while the Tories lost three. The new council sees the Lib Dems and Tories tied on 17 seats, with two for Labour and one independent. North West Leicestershire: Conservatives lose to no overall control Labour gained 10 seats here, enough to leave them the largest party but short of an overall majority. The Lib Dems gained a seat, while the Conservatives lost 10 and the Greens lost one. This is the area of the country represented at Westminster by Andrew Bridgen MP, who was recently expelled from the Conservatives for comparing Covid-19 vaccines to the Holocaust. There are scenes of jubilation in Stoke-on-Trent: The Liberal Democrats retained control of Bath &amp; North East Somerset Council (that is a single council), PA reports, after winning 31 of the 59 seats. Worcester, which remained under no overall control, is a bellwether Westminster council; here, the Tories were previously the largest party and are now third, behind the Greens. The Tories lost seven seats this round. The Greens gained four seats, three from Labour and one from Conservatives, and topped the vote share at 29%, a Greens spokesperson tells me (Labour got 28%, Conservative 26%, Lib Dems 16%). “There was speculation that Labour would gain control of the Council, but Green wins have blocked this. With all-up elections next year, this is a place to watch and there is a promising future for the Green Party here,” says the spokesperson. The Liberal Democrats retained control of Cotswold, PA reports, taking 18 seats of the first 28 to declare, matching the number they held before polling day, with another six still to be announced. Back now to Brentwood and Tamworth, with a brief snap from my colleague and data cruncher Seán Clarke, who is running our live results tracker. Both councils have both been Tory heartlands in recent years, both electing Tory MPs on hefty majorities in 2019. To lose control of both, and through losses to a different party in each case, is a blow. The Tories have lost another council, with North West Leicestershire turning to no overall control after Labour gained 10 seats. That’s the third council to go from Tory to no overall control so far. Labour have won the 24 seats needed to take control of Stoke-on-Trent, turning the council from no overall control to Labour. It is a symbolic win – and one Labour will be very happy about. Brexit’s influence on the election so far, according to politics researcher Will Jennings: Jennings says, “the Brexit realignment appears to be partially unwinding, while the Conservatives are not regaining ground with … Remainers but instead continuing to lose support.” We’re expecting to have about 70 councils, or roughly a third, called by the end of the night. 37 of these have been called so far. It is almost 4.30 in the morning in the UK. A Stoke-on-Trent victory for Labour looking extra likely: The Tories have held onto Dudley and gained a seat. Labour has gained one seat in the council, too. The Tories have held onto Havant, a fairly safe council, but have lost five seats: two each to Labour and the Lib Dems and one to the Greens. PA reports that Labour looks likely to take control of Stoke-on-Trent after winning 19 seats of the first 24 to be declared. Labour needs another four to claim victory in the key red wall city. The BBC’s Chris Mason reports that Labour – looking at what the results could indicate for the party’s fortunes in the general election next year – believe that Hartlepool, Stevenage, Dudley South, Ipswich, West Bromwich East, Great Grimsby and Aldershot would have been theirs were this a general election: Labour’s Chris Cooke won the battle to become mayor of Middlesbrough, PA reports, defeating the independent incumbent Andy Preston with a swing of almost 20%. Cooke took 10,956 votes, 760 more than Mr Preston, who had a majority of 10,725 in 2019. Another independent, Jon Rathmell, had 3,102 votes, with Conservative John Cooper in last place with 2,997. This was the first time the first past the post system was used to elect a mayor, and three more contests will declare later on Friday. Tory MP Kelly Tolhurst says it will be a “difficult night” for her party in Medway, where Labour hopes to gain control of the council. She told Sky News: “I’ve been out campaigning for weeks on the doors, speaking to my constituents across the patch and yes, absolutely, there has been some dissatisfaction with the government and people have been frustrated.” But there were also local concerns about “unrealistic housing targets” and the Government’s levelling-up agenda, which was seen as focused on the northern England “Red Wall” rather than the south east. Veterans Minister and Plymouth Moor View MP Johnny Mercer is “toast” at the next general election, according to neighbouring Labour MP Luke Pollard. We heard from Mercer earlier – he said it had been a “terrible night” after Plymouth was called for Labour. Pollard (Plymouth, Sutton and Devonport) used a different adjective, telling LBC Radio’s Iain Dale: “It has been a stunning night for Labour in Plymouth. “We won every single seat in our target parliamentary constituency of Plymouth Moor View, sending a signal that the Conservative MP there Johnny Mercer is toast at the next general election.” “It has seen people come back to Labour in huge droves, not only showing that the carnival of chaos, the Tory council chopping down trees and cutting public services is unwanted, but the Tory Government is unwanted.” Labour has held onto Reading and Labour, maintaining their early streak of no councils lost. Here is a very happy Labour group in Plymouth: Labour’s voter share is growing, for now: Veterans Minister Johnny Mercer said it has been “a terrible night” after Labour took control of Plymouth Council, PA reports. Mercer, who represents the Plymouth Moor View constituency, told the BBC’s Elections 2023 programme: “It has been a really terrible night for us here in Plymouth.” “I think there has been a number of factors at play. I think, locally, it has been very difficult. The Conservative Group here has been through a very difficult time. We have seen that reflected on the doors, in the campaign and we have seen that reflected in the results tonight but you know, we take it on the chin.” With 35 councils called, the conservatives have lost more than 50 seats, with 53 lost overall, compared to 46 net gained for Labour. There are 230 councils up for grabs in this election – the councils counted so far represent 15%. As my colleague Robert Ford reported, the Conservatives are hoping for a net loss of 500 or fewer. In case you have missed Plymouth’s tree-gate, here is a brief explainer: On 14 March, the Tory council leader signed an executive order to fell 110 trees overnight on Armada Way, a major commercial street in the city centre, prompting a public outcry and ultimately the leader’s resignation. In response, the two Conservative MPs, Johnny Mercer and Gary Streeter, called for the Labour opposition leader to take over the council until this week’s local elections. The Guardian’s editorial at the time began: The decision taken by Plymouth’s Tory council leader, Richard Bingley, to chop down more than 100 mature trees under cover of darkness earlier this month was damaging to the city as well as the horse chestnut, silver birch, pear, apple and other specimens that were removed. … Clearly there are lessons here for Plymouth, where control of the council has switched between Labour and the Tories, and previous regeneration projects have produced good results. But there are wider lessons too. Cambridgeshire county council, which is run by a Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition, has just approved plans to cut down an orchard to make way for a road. In too many areas, and in local parties of different stripes, politicians’ actions are failing to live up to their climate pledges. Development that takes us further away from our climate and biodiversity goals should no longer be called by that misleading name. Meanwhile, the councils of Eastleigh and Peterborough have remained under Lib Dem and no overall control respectively. Labour gained seven seats in Plymouth, a key bell weather council. It is now under no overall control.. Five of these were taken off the Conservatives, one from the Greens and one from the Independent. Labour has taken control of Plymouth Council from the Conservatives. The party needed five gains to take overall control of the council, which had been led by a minority Conservative administration, and managed to make six gains tonight. Plymouth, as I’m sure you know, is the seat where trees have been a major election issue. The Conservative administration had been heavily criticised after cutting down 110 healthy trees in the city overnight, and Labour expected to make significant progress in the city. And here is what the Conservatives will be hoping to see: Good night: Armageddon avoided. More than 600 seats are lost, but this is offset by some gained back from local parties and independents for a net loss of 500 or fewer – a decline well below the electoral cataclysm briefed by government allies. The Conservative vote holds up in leave areas, and the BBC projects a national share above the 28% low point recorded in 2019. The Labour lead is kept in single digits and hope is kept alive. A bounce back with Sunak? Bad night: A slump in the Conservative vote, and more than a thousand seats lost. The BBC projected national share falls below 25%, making this the worst local elections result in four decades. There are big swings to Labour in leave and remain battlegrounds, but losses also to both the Lib Dems and Greens in suburban England as the Conservatives leak support to challengers from all quarters. More 1997 than 1992? Here is what Labour will be hoping to see (and not) tonight: Good night: Gains of 600 or more council seats point to a substantial red wave, with a strong advance registered in both strongly leave-leaning “red wall” territory and more moderate, traditionally marginal areas. Labour secures a BBC projected national share above 40% and a 10-point plus lead over the Conservatives – both performances are the best since Blair was opposition leader. Things can only get better? Bad night: The swing to Labour comes in below expectations, with 400 seats or fewer gained. Labour leaking support to Greens and Liberal Democrats in remain areas, and the Conservative vote holding up in leave areas. BBC projected national share of 36%, little better than last year, and below Ed Miliband’s best showing in 2012. High hopes are dashed, and anxious whispers return. With 30 councils declared – of the 230 up for grabs – here is the lay of the land. This represents 13% of this election’s councils: so it is by no means going to give us a clear picture of what the overall results will be. But nonetheless, one thing stands out: the Tories have lost 49 seats overall and Labour have gained 39. The conservatives have lost two councils, both to no overall control. Labour have gained none and lost none. It is 3.15am in the UK now. Plymouth is the next key result we’re expecting, on the our at around 4am. In the meantime, Kingston-upon-Hull and Worcester have not changed hands, with the former remaining under Lib Dem control and the latter under no overall control. The conservatives have lost seven seats in Worcester, however. The Lib Dems gained two in Kingston-upon-Hull. The Lib Dems have gained a seat in Portsmouth, but it remains under no overall control. Transport minister Richard Holden says that Labour is not gaining the seats that it would need to form a government at the next general election, PA reports. Holden told the BBC’s Elections 2023 programme a short while ago: “The truth is the seats that we need to win at a general election right across the country, you are just not seeing those Labour gains that they would need to do in order to form a government at the next general election at this stage.” Asked about the latest projections, Holden said people have had a “tough time” with the cost of living, adding: “The Government has had to put a huge package in there, but people are still feeling it. “You are going to have to look in different areas and if Labour are going to win in the next general election they are going to have to take some towns in Essex, they are going to have to take Peterborough as well.” On whether the Conservatives are going to change strategy if the local elections go badly, the Holden said the Prime Minister set out his “five key priorities” and “what people want to see is him delivering on them”. If voter share as it stands currently is replicated in next year’s general elections, a Sky commentator has just said, “Rishi Sunak’s party doesn’t stand a chance”. Again though, the night is young – we’ll start to get a clearer picture only well into Friday daytime. While the headline results in the councils called so far don’t look fantastic for anyone – the conservatives have lost two to no overall control, but otherwise the overall control (or no overall control) status remains the same – Labour has picked up 39 seats. And the Conservatives? They’ve lost 41 seats overall. The Lib Dems have gained nine, the Greens four. The BBC’s Chris Mason is obsessing over the word extent, he says – as in the extent to which Labour is having a good night and the Conservatives are having a bad one. It is a “miserable” night for the Conservatives, he says. “For the Tories, what seems to be happening so far is something of a pincer movement at their expense from at least three other parties: Labour yes, but also a buoyant and smiling collection of Liberal Democrats and in pockets like Worcester the Green Party too.” Labour has lost two seats to the Lib Dems in Lincoln, but still retains control of the council, with 20 seats. The Conservatives have gained two seats in Southend-on-Sea, but the council remains under no overall control. The Tories will seek to portray any defeat below that scale as better than expected, PA reports, although the loss of hundreds of councillors will not help morale within the Conservative ranks. Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris said the party had experienced a “bit of a blip” following the turmoil in No 10 which saw Boris Johnson and Liz Truss ousted before Mr Sunak took office. He attempted to present the expected losses as mid-term blues for the Tories, telling Sky News : “The British people are a very sensible group of folk and they understand what’s important. “Occasionally they like to give political parties a bit of a reminder of who the politicians serve. Certainly when you get into being mid-term in a government you get quite a bit of that.” The Tories are nervous about the situation in Bolton, where they were the biggest party, and they also fear for their control in Windsor and Maidenhead. The Liberal Democrats have retained control of Hull, and now hold 31 seats from a total of 57, with Labour holding 26. Voter turnout in Hull was just 22%. Labour has gained two seats in Sandwell and held onto he council. The Tories gained two seats, too. While the Conservatives have held onto the key seat of Thurrock, Tory council leader Mark Coxshall has lost his seat to the Labour candidate. Here is the moment the result was announced: Despite the turmoil in Thurrock, conservatives have held onto the council, another where Labour had hoped to make big gains. Labour managed to win five seats in the council, but the Conservatives still have 26, after losing only three. Results are coming in thick and fast now. Here are the headlines in six councils: Hart: Remains under no overall control with no seats changing hands Redditch: Conservatives hold on but Labour wins five seats Rushmoor: Conservatives hold on, Labour wins five seats Sefton: Labour holds on and gains five seats Exeter: Labour holds on, the Greens and Lib Dems gain one seat each Basildon, where voter turnout was just 24%: the Conservatives hold on and gain a seat We have our first key result of the night, and it isn’t good for Labour, who have failed to win North East Lincolnshire back from the Conservatives. The Tories have controlled the council since 2019. Labour managed to gain just one seat back, and two went to the Independents. The Tories have held onto 27 seats. Stevenage remains under Labour control and no seats have been gained or lost: Labour has 24, the Conservatives have nine and the Liberal Democrats have six. Here are some scenes from the night so far in Stoke on Trent: Some of the language of the Home Secretary is “damaging to our communities”, a Tory former minister has said. Rehman Chishti was asked by Sky News whether he was worried Suella Braverman’s rhetoric on illegal migration might have an impact on voters in the local elections. Chishti said Braverman’s comments and rhetoric are “damaging to our communities” and also it “feeds into the far right”. He added: “So what I would say to the Home Secretary, she needs to get on and do her job, address the big issues of the day.” We’re expecting the results from Thurrock any minute. Conservatives hold a majority in Thurrock with 29 councillors, which they are desperate to keep. But in December, Thurrock formally declared effective bankruptcy, as it grappled with a £500m deficit caused by a series of disastrous investments in risky commercial projects. The Guardia’s social security editor, Patrick Butler, reported at the time: The scale of the crisis in Thurrock has stunned the wider local government world, after revelations by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism showed that senior council officials had ignored warnings from financial experts over the “unprecedented risks” it was taking with public money. Thurrock had become one of the most indebted of all English local authorities in recent years after borrowing £1.5bn cheaply from the Treasury and fellow local authorities – 10 times its annual spending on local services – to enable a string of investments in solar energy and other businesses. One of the interesting things emerging tonight is the change in vote share. With 132 wards counted, Labour have gained 7.5% of the vote share since 2019, most of which is seems to be wrested from the Tories. The Lib Dems have gained 1.1%. It is still very early, and many of these are within the red wall, but this is still encouraging for Labour. The Tories have lost their second council, Tamworth, to no overall control after a strong result for Labour, which have won seven seats, five from the Conservatives, one from UKIP and one from the Independents. We’ve passed the ten-council mark and nearing 2am, which is when we hope to get a result from Thurrock, one of tonight’s key seats – the Tories have the seat and are hoping to hold onto it. If they don’t, it could spell trouble more widely. Here are the results so far: Brentwood is the only council whose fortunes have changed emphatically: it has moved from Conservative control to no overall control as the Lib Dems saw a strong result. Labour has held onto: Halton, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, South Tyneside and Sunderland. The Conservatives have held onto: Broxbourne, Harlow and Redditch. The Independents have held onto Castle Point. And Hartlepool and Rochford remain under no overall control. In Rochford, the Tories lost four seats, the Lib Dems gained three and the council remains under no overall control. Just a note to say that I made a mistake earlier, reporting that Labour had held Hartlepool – they have won five seats, but failed to secure a majority, so Hartlepool is under no overall control. The Independents have held onto Castle Point, gaining six seats from the Tories. Labour have held onto Newcastle-upon-Tyne but have lost two seats to the Lib Dems. The Conservatives have held onto Redditch, but Labour has had a strong result, gaining five seats. The Liberal Democrats have taken three seats from the Conservatives in Brentwood, which means that the council is now under no overall control – this is the first council leadership change of the night. Labour leader Keir Starmer visited Hartlepool on Wednesday – he focussed on crime. Starmer met with community members affected by anti-social behaviour, promising that Labour would tackle crime. Tonight’s result was strong, but not strong enough – Labour has failed to win a majority and the council has no overall control. As the result begin to come in, here are some scenes from earlier in the day: In what is the closest council result of the night so far, Labour has gained five seats, one from the Tories and four from other parties. But they have failed to secure a majority. (Earlier we reported that Labour had held onto Harlepool and have now corrected the above). The Government estimated that about 4% of Britain’s population – or two million people – were unlikely to have a valid form of photo ID to vote, PA reports. Turnout was just 22.01% in Hull, 22% in Basildon and 24% in Broxbourne, PA reports – a pretty dire result. It is still very early days, but here is where things stand at the moment – in short, no major surprises. Labour hold onto three of the five councils called, with Halton, South Tyneside and Sunderland. The Conservatives hold Broxbourne and Harlow. The conservatives have lost two council seats, the Lib Dems have gained one and the Greens have gained three. We’ve called South Tyneside for Labour, which has 38 seats – the Greens have also had a decent result, winning three seats from Labour for a total of nine. We’re expecting to see Hartlepool called shortly. The Conservatives have held onto Harlow, in Essex, and won a seat off Labour, according to the Guardian’s results tracker. Plymouth Conservatives “are predicting something approaching a wipe-out for them in the Devon city and a big majority for Labour,” the BBC’s political editor, Chris Mason, reports. Currently, three MPs cover the city in Devon: two Conservatives and one Labour. While there is no overall control, the council is governed by a Conservative minority administration. The Guardian’s Jamie Grierson wrote about the council’s tree-gate: If Plymouth’s relationship with politics had a Facebook status it would be “it’s complicated” – and that’s before you mention the trees. In the past 25 years or so in Britain’s Ocean City, there have been four Conservative majority administrations, five Labour majority administrations and, as there is now, there have been four periods of “no overall control”. And then the trees happened. On 14 March, the Tory council leader signed an executive order to fell 110 trees overnight on Armada Way, a major commercial street in the city centre, prompting a public outcry and ultimately the leader’s resignation. In response, the two Conservative MPs, Johnny Mercer and Gary Streeter, called for the Labour opposition leader to take over the council until this week’s local elections. Science minister Paul Scully has said “we clearly need to see” the impact that the voter ID requirement has had on the local elections, PA reports. Asked about the statement by the Electoral Commission on the BBC’s Elections 2023 programme, Scully said: “I think the chief exec of the electoral returning officers has said in his view that it has worked pretty well. It hasn’t had much of an effect. “But we do need to see. We clearly need to see after this,” he said. “I think when it was introduced by a Labour government in Northern Ireland, the then-Northern Ireland minister said at the time it was introduced, it had no effect on suppressing the vote there.” He added: “But what we have got to find out is whether those people weren’t able to vote at the time or whether they went back and got their ID. We have heard a couple of examples, but it is not good enough to use anecdotes.” British political scientist Sr John Curtis has told the BBC that turnout is down compared with 2022 and 2019, which might be the impact of the new voter ID rules. Senior political correspondent Aubrey Allegretti explained previously that the new voter ID rules were brought in by ministers in what they said was an attempt to crack down on a handful of allegations of in-person voter fraud, the move means political parties are having to work harder than before to “get out the vote”. Previously, people in England, Scotland and Wales could attend a polling station and simply give their address to vote, with some choosing to bring along their poll card. Voter ID is already used in Northern Ireland because of previous examples of organised and mass voter impersonation by sectarian groups. But elsewhere in the UK, cases of voter impersonation have been rare. Already one of the key themes of this election is voters being turned away for not having photo ID. The new requirement has left a number of people, often from more marginalised groups, unable to cast ballots in local elections – although as the Guardian’s deputy political editor, Peter Walker, and Midlands correspondent, Jessica Murray report, the widespread chaos feared by some officials did not materialise. Though again, as my colleagues note, opposition MPs and some administrators said a lack of conclusive data collection for the numbers who were unable to vote could mean the problem was notably worse than it appeared. As you can see from the Guardian’s results tracker, Halton council has been declared for Labour, which has also managed to gain a seat from the Conservatives, while the Conservatives have held onto Broxbourne. If you’re just joining us, here are the key results to watch out for before dawn, and what times we can expect them. In between, we’ll have context and analysis from the Guardian’s reporters and elsewhere, news and pictures of dogs waiting outside polling stations. It is currently midnight in the UK. Below are the key results – but altogether we are expecting the results from about 60 councils overnight. 2 am: Thurrock, currently held by the Conservatives who have 29 councillors in the seat –and are desperate to cling on. 3 am: North East Lincolnshire: a key Labour battleground, controlled by the Tories since 2019. 4 am: Plymouth City Council: led by a Conservative minority administration, from whom Labour is hoping to grab it 6 am: Things speed up. First up we have Medway, where Starmer has campaigned twice in the run-up to polling day. Labour hopes to win the unitary authority* here for the first time since its creation in 1998. The council is currently 33 Tory and 20 Labour. We’ll also get the first glimmers of results from Stoke-on-Trent, Tameside and South Gloucestershire around now. *For those who don’t know what a unitary authority is: County councils are responsible for functions such as transport, social care and education. District councils are responsible for matters including housing, planning and waste collection. Unitary authorities are responsible for all these functions within their area. The Lib Dems have also won a seat off the Conservatives in Sunderland, making them the official opposition party in the council: Labour has retained control of Sunderland City Council after winning 13 seats, PA reports. The council has so far declared 18 out of the 25 seats up for election, including two gains for Labour and one for the Liberal Democrats. Labour went into the election with control of the council and now has enough seats to retain its majority. We’re expecting to see Sunderland, the first council result of the night, called any minute. Hello, this is Helen Sullivan taking the reins – I’ll be bringing you the overnight results as they happen. You can get in touch with me or follow along on Twitter here, or via email at helen.sullivan@theguardian.com. Voters who feel they have been wrongly refused a ballot paper should contact their local elections office, the Association of Electoral Administrators said. Chief executive Peter Stanyon said: “The initial picture is that polling day has run as smoothly as usual, without any major issues. This is testament to months of planning and hard work from returning officers and electoral administrators. “We’ve seen many anecdotal reports of people not having been able to vote because they didn’t meet new voter ID requirements. If anyone feels they have been wrongly refused a ballot paper, we would encourage you to contact your local elections office with details so they can look into it. “It is still too early to gauge how introducing voter ID has gone. Data will be released at local council level in the coming days, but the main focus for now will be counting votes.” You can follow all the results throughout the night on our graphic: Labour’s shadow education secretary said she was “confident” the party had made progress in key battleground areas during the local elections. Bridget Phillipson told BBC’s Newsnight that Swindon, Darlington, Hartlepool, Telford and Gravesham were areas where Labour is looking to make gains. Labour have gained a seat in Sunderland. Catherine Hunter won a seat in the city’s St Anne’s ward, unseating Conservative Pam Mann. Labour went into the election looking to consolidate its control of the council, where it held 43 out of 75 seats. The Northern Ireland secretary, Chris Heaton-Harris, said the Conservative party had experienced a “bit of a blip” and that “fantastic councillors” were set to lose their seats following the local elections. Heaton-Harris, asked which out of Rishi Sunak, Liz Truss and Boris Johnson were to blame for the Tories’ low opinion poll ratings, told BBC’s Newsnight programme: “We are a government that is in mid-term, and mid-term after 13 years. “And yes, we had, you could say, a bit of a blip and we’ve been trying to make sure we win people’s trust back, and we’ve been doing that by talking about and acting on people’s priorities.” Told a Savanta survey found 25% of Tory councillors were dissatisfied with the party’s leadership, Heaton-Harris replied: “We know we’ve got work to do and it is going to be a tough set of results for us — we are in no doubt about that.” Jonathan Carr-West, chief executive of Local Government Information Unit (LGIU) said: “With polls now closed in these local elections, a huge thanks must be given to the countless council staff and volunteers who made today happen. Local democracy works because of these individuals. “With an added layer of complexity from the introduction of voter ID this year, these teams have gone above and beyond. And, they will be continuing to work tirelessly through the night and days to follow to ensure each and every vote is counted. “But our research shows a worrying disconnect between how important local elections are and how well people understand them. While more than half of people (56%) see the council as the institution that has the biggest impact on their quality of life - only 34% of people understand how decisions are made and what the role of elected councillor is. “Given this, it’s unsurprising that turnout in local elections is always less than 40%. We hope today has bucked that trend.” Prof Rob Ford, an elections specialist, has written an article for the Guardian trying to assess what would be a good result and a bad result for the political parties in the local election. You can read it here: Results from more than 60 councils are expected overnight with the remainder expected to trickle in throughout the day on Friday. Shabana Mahmood MP, Labour’s national campaign co-ordinator, said: “We are proud of the positive campaign we have run, focused on the issues that matter most to voters. “This is a cost-of-living election. We have set out the choices we would make to help people through the cost-of-living crisis, cut crime and cut NHS waiting lists, but the Tories have been silent on the issues that matter most. “If the Conservatives go backwards from their disastrous 2019 local election results, the voters will have sent a damning message about Rishi Sunak’s leadership. “It’s going to be a long night and the full picture of results will not form until well into Friday afternoon but we expect to make gains and show we’re making the progress in the places we need to win at the next election.” Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper said: “I have knocked on countless doors in recent weeks and heard real anger and frustration from voters who are sick and tired of being taken for granted by this Conservative government. Tonight, their voices will be heard. “I want to take this opportunity to thank Liberal Democrat councillors, candidates and volunteers who work tirelessly for their communities. They are true local champions who stand up for their local areas, and have done the party proud.” A Tory spokesperson said: “This will be a tough night for the Conservatives. Any government which has been in power for 13 years is highly likely to lose seats.” The Conservatives have sought to manage expectations by pointing to forecasts by academic experts Profs Colin Rallings and Michael Thrasher which suggest they could lose more than a thousand seats if things go badly. The Tory spokesperson added: “Independent experts Rallings and Thrasher have said we could lose over 1,000 seats. “But if Labour want to be in with a chance of taking office after the next general election as they did in 1997, they need to be making very significant gains as they did in 1995 – the last most comparable election – anything less than that will pose serious questions for Labour HQ.” The analysis by professors Rallings and Thrasher suggest gains of more than 700 for Labour would represent Sir Keir Starmer’s party’s best performance for at least a decade, which could put them on the path to becoming the largest party at a general election – even if short of an overall majority in the Commons. The Green Party said it was clear on the doorstep that many people are “appalled” by the Conservatives and are “deserting the party in droves”. “But also, there is no enthusiasm for Labour because they’re not offering any inspiration or practical solutions to the crises we’re facing,” the party added. Campaigners opposed to the photo ID requirement said it had been a “dark day for democracy”. Tom Brake of Unlock Democracy, who is leading a coalition of groups opposed to the move including the Electoral Reform Society, Fair Vote UK and Open Britain, said “many thousands” of people were estimated to have been turned away. “Today has been a dark day for British democracy. Reports from all over the country confirm our very worst fears of the impact of the disastrous policy which has been made worse by the shambolic way it has been introduced,” he said. “One voter turned away is one too many, but early estimates point to many thousands of people being turned away and denied their right to vote. “Too many people were unaware that they needed photo ID or weren’t clear on exactly what type of ID was required. “The buck for this attack on democracy rests squarely with government. This policy was always a sledgehammer looking for a nut to crack.” The Electoral Commission said “our initial assessment is that overall, the elections were well run” however “some people were regrettably unable to vote” because of the new photo ID requirement. It added it had started work to understand the impact of the new photographic ID requirement. An Electoral Commission spokesman said: “These were the first set of polls to take place since the voter ID requirement came into force. “Our initial assessment is that overall, the elections were well run. “Across the country, votes were cast throughout the day and in line with the law. “This is in large part thanks to the dedication of electoral administrators, who have worked hard to prepare for today and for the implementation of this new measure. “Confidence in the overall picture, however, should not overlook other impacts which can only be revealed through detailed data collection and analysis over the coming weeks. “We already know from our research that the ID requirement posed a greater challenge for some groups in society, and that some people were regrettably unable to vote today as a result.” The Guardian’s Midlands correspondent Jessica Murray spoke to voters in Stafford before the local elections and found there was a mixed outlook in the “blue wall” town. While some voters were turning away from the Tories, they were not necessarily turning towards Labour. She writes: All 40 seats on Stafford borough council are up for grabs, and Labour is hoping a combination of anger over national political scandals and frustration over local issues could give it the advantage it needs to wrest overall control from its rivals. But the view among voters on Tuesday was decidedly mixed. “This will be the first time I’ve not voted Tory in my life,” said Phil Howard, 75, a retired driver for GEC, once a major employer in the town. “This year is a totally different ballgame. Since the Boris Johnson affair it seems like the party have gone to pieces. Just look at immigration, cost of living, and even locally, the town feels dead. But I don’t know who I will vote for. All I know is it won’t be Tory.” You can read her full dispatch here: Voting has closed in local elections which marked Rishi Sunak’s debut as an electoral figurehead for the Conservatives, as well as for the full rollout of new rules obliging people to show photo identification at the polling booth. The ID regulations saw reports of dozens of people being turned away for lacking the necessary documents, but did not result in the chaos or potential disorder feared by some electoral officials. More information about how many voters were put off should come in an interim study by the Electoral Commission next month, although opposition parties have warned the total numbers disfranchised may never be known. The polls for the local elections in England have now closed. Voters have decided who will run services in 230 local councils with around 8,000 councillors’ seats. Four local mayoral posts are also up for grabs in Bedford, Leicester, Mansfield and Middlesbrough. These mayors are the directly-elected leaders of their local authorities. Commentators predict that Tory losses of even 500 seats would mean trouble for Rishi Sunak’s authority. But Labour also has a lot to prove, with more than 8,000 council seats across 230 authorities in England up for election on Thursday. Here are the key seats and timings to look out for. Early hours of Friday 2am Results from Thurrock will begin to emerge, where the Conservatives hold a majority with 29 councillors, which they are desperate to keep. 3am North East Lincolnshire has emerged as a key battleground for Labour, as the council has been controlled by the Tories since 2011. As results flow in, Starmer’s allies will be keen to see whether “red wall” voters are willing to really give Labour a chance. 4am Labour will hope to steal an early victory as results emerge from Plymouth city council, one of its targets. It is led by a Conservative minority administration, after Richard Bingley was sacked after a row over tree-felling. Labour is confident it can make gains in the bellwether council, but an outright majority could be difficult given only a third of the council is up for grabs. Friday morning 6am Starmer has campaigned in the Conservative-run council of Medway twice in the run-up to polling day to insist the party is “positive and united” and has a “fighting chance”. Labour will hope to win the unitary authority for the first time since its creation in 1998. The council is now made up of 33 Tory councillors and 20 from Labour. Results from Stoke-on-Trent, Tameside and South Gloucestershire will also start to emerge at around this time. Friday afternoon Noon Results from Solihull will arrive, where the Conservatives are defending a narrow majority which is under threat from the Green party and the Liberal Democrats. 2pm The Conservatives will be keeping a close eye on whether they can make gains in Torbay council, which is run by a coalition of the Lib Dems and independents. 4pm Labour has a slim majority of 1 in Gravesham and will be looking to retain and strengthen it. Labour would love to gain a toehold in Kent, where the Tories hold 16 out of 17 constituencies. The Greens will be hoping to become the largest party in Mid Suffolk. In the 2019 elections, the Greens managed to pick up 34% of the vote share, almost double their count in 2015. The Liberal Democrats hope to overturn several slim Tory majorities in the south-east council of Cherwell. Friday evening 5pm Results from Bolsover will show whether Starmer has boosted Labour. A failure to win this council, which has a mix of independent councillors, will be deemed a bad result for the party. Eyes will be on Leicester’s mayoral election when results are due in from the traditionally Labour-held council, nicknamed “Red Leicester”. The party has held overall control of the city council since 2007 and it holds 47 of the 54 seats. Sir Peter Soulsby has held the mayoral role since 2011 but the party may struggle this year – with all of its council seats and mayoral role up for grabs – after 19 sitting councillors, the majority of them from black, Asian or minority ethnic backgrounds, were deselected by Labour’s national committee. 6pm In Cheshire West and Chester council, Labour is the single largest party and will be hoping to win an outright majority. Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the local elections across England. With more than 8,000 seats up for grabs, we will bring you the latest results, reaction and analysis after voting has ended in 230 local authorities across England. Before polls opened, Rishi Sunak said Conservatives were braced for a hard night. He blamed his predecessors, Boris Johnson and Liz Truss, saying that Tory councillors would lose their seats because of the “box set” psychodrama that enveloped the party last year. He said: Good councillors will lose their seats because of all that has happened over the past year. I’ve only been prime minister for six months but I do believe we’re making good progress. Just think about where we were then and where we are now. Our economy is in much better shape. Our politics doesn’t feel like a box set drama any more. And our friends and our allies know that we are back. This local election was the first in England where voters had to produce photo ID. And there were some reports during the day on Thursday that people without ID were being turned away from polling stations. Other people are saying the photo ID rule has been an inconvenience, because it stopped them voting when they otherwise would have done. Meanwhile, Labour are hoping to sweep the election in a test of the party’s wider chances before a general election next year. We’ll bring you all the latest news, key results and developments as counting progresses through the night."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2020/may/03/trouble-with-gas-the-coalition-is-betting-on-the-fossil-fuel-for-recovery-but-the-sums-dont-add-up","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2020-05-02T20:00:31Z","webTitle":"Trouble with gas: the Coalition is betting on the fossil fuel for recovery – but the sums don't add up","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/03/trouble-with-gas-the-coalition-is-betting-on-the-fossil-fuel-for-recovery-but-the-sums-dont-add-up","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2020/may/03/trouble-with-gas-the-coalition-is-betting-on-the-fossil-fuel-for-recovery-but-the-sums-dont-add-up","fields":{"headline":"Trouble with gas: the Coalition is betting on the fossil fuel for recovery – but the sums don't add up","bodyText":"The agency that runs Australia’s electricity last week gave its verdict on how to deliver what would have seemed fanciful not that long ago – a power grid that within five years should at times be able to run on 75% wind and solar energy. The Australian Energy Market Operator delivered a report on integrating renewable energy into the system with an optimistic message. As described by its chief, New Yorker Audrey Zibelman, the technical capacity was already there, but markets and regulations would have to be adjusted. There were no “insurmountable reasons” why the grid could not take even higher levels of renewables, as it will need to for Australia to meet the Paris agreement goal of zero greenhouse gas emissions. The minister in charge of both energy and cutting emissions, Angus Taylor, chose a different emphasis. In a statement issued as the study was released, Taylor said it had highlighted the challenges of increased amounts of solar and wind given the system needed continuous inertia – support from constantly running “synchronous generation” – to ensure grid stability. He suggested that inertia could come from gas-fired power. The market operator’s report does not mention gas generation, but the fossil fuel – often described as having half the emissions of coal, though recent studies have suggested it could be much more – is clearly on Taylor’s mind. A few days earlier he had given interviews to Nine newspapers to support the idea of a “gas-fired recovery” from the Covid-19 pandemic, suggesting it may be a focus of future economic stimulus measures. This is not new terrain for the government. It followed the prime minister, Scott Morrison, in January claiming there was “no credible transition plan” for Australia that did not involve greater use of gas, and requiring New South Wales to promise to try to substantially boost the amount of gas available as part of a $2bn energy deal. But with a climate transition plan yet to materialise, analysts and investors say Taylor’s push suggests the government may lock in long-term support for the fossil fuel without explaining what it will mean for emissions, and despite increasing evidence there are cleaner and cheaper alternatives. Gas demand dives during Covid-19 crisis The outlook for gas has changed significantly since Morrison gave a speech on energy to the National Press Club three months ago. As Guardian Australia has reported, the price of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in Asia crashed by nearly two-thirds, prompting the industry to shelve decisions on tens of billions of dollars worth of proposed investments in export projects. Consultancy EnergyQuest has projected a 40% fall in revenue from the $50bn LNG industry, which has driven most of the increase in national emissions in recent years. While most industries have been affected by the pandemic, gas has been harder hit than renewable energy. The International Energy Agency this week reported that clean electricity was holding up through the worst global energy shock in 70 years, but demand for gas was down 5% and coal 8%. Cost plays a major part in this. Analysts at BloombergNEF found solar and wind are now the cheapest source of bulk electricity generation for at least two-thirds of the global population, Australia included. Meanwhile, Australia’s biggest oil and gas companies, Woodside Petroleum and Santos, are under siege from shareholders concerned about the financial risk of them backing long-term investments at odds with a zero emissions world. On Thursday, more than 50% of Woodside investors supported a non-binding resolution from the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility that the company should be setting targets to not only cut its own emissions, but those that result from the gas it sells to be burned in Asia. A similar motion at Santos’s annual general meeting won 43%. Both Woodside and Santos have resisted the push, and argued that gas is a “clean” fuel and part of the climate solution. Like Taylor, they claim Australian gas exports are an environmental good as they reduce coal in Asia. Neither the government nor industry have provided evidence to back this up, and officials have acknowledged the competition in Japan – still Australia’s biggest gas market – is increasingly with zero emissions nuclear and renewable generation. Andrew Grant, head of oil, gas and mining with London-based financial thinktank Carbon Tracker, says the global view of gas has flipped from it being seen as a cleaner fuel than coal, to it being the second-least desirable source of electricity. He points to analysis by the International Energy Agency that found global gas-fired power generation must begin to decline later this decade under a sustainable development scenario. “Better than coal is not exactly a ringing endorsement,” Grant says. The Paris deal’s implicit goal of zero emissions by mid-century has been acknowledged by Woodside and Santos’s European counterparts, particularly BP and Dutch Royal Shell. Shell, for example, has targets to cut its own emissions to net zero by 2050, and to reduce the “scope 3” emissions released by customers when using its products by two-thirds by moving into clean energy. In contrast, Woodside’s chief executive, Peter Coleman, dismissed the likelihood of billion-dollar investments in renewable energy and the chairman, Richard Goyder, said the company primarily saw itself as “a gas company, with some assets in oil”. Arguments over the future of gas are complicated to some extent by the different ways in which the fuel is used. In Australia, there are three main uses – for power generation, as a feedstock and source of heat in industrial processes, and for heating and cooking by households and businesses. All have been hit by skyrocketing gas bills since an LNG export hub opened at Gladstone in Queensland mid-last decade, linking local prices to those in Asia. The government has been focused on lowering prices to help local users, mostly by pressuring states and territories to increase supply. New gas onshore fields were being proposed and considered when the pandemic hit, sending the global oil and gas prices tumbling. While the fall has offered welcome cost relief for gas users, the government has a different view to some analysts and agencies on the extent to which gas is likely to remain cost-competitive and vital to Australia’s needs. In a written response, Taylor did not answer directly a question about the role he believes gas will play as a transition fuel, or mention emissions reduction or climate change, but emphasised the “essential” role the fuel plays in energy reliability. “[It] could be even more important through a gas-fired recovery,” he said, reinforcing an earlier call for new “fast-start” generators that run only when required. But there is little evidence that the Australian electricity grid will need more gas power. Last year, it provided about 9% of generation. The market operator assessment suggested this could fall to near zero in the second half of this decade before returning in a much smaller amount – less than a third of what it is now – in the 2030s if the grid was to run at lowest cost. In terms of the flexibility in the system needed to “firm up” variable solar and wind energy, the market operator listed pumped hydro, batteries and “demand-side participation” – schemes that offer energy users incentives to scale down consumption when required – as likely sources. On gas, it said only that it may also play a greater role if prices fall. It is an option, but not the only one. Simon Holmes à Court, senior advisor to the Climate and Energy College at the University of Melbourne, says the services needed for a secure power grid are increasingly available from sources other than gas, including government-backed large batteries and potentially through adjustments at wind or additions at solar farms. Tony Wood, the energy program director at the Grattan Institute, believes fast-start gas is likely to have a role in the power grid but says it should live or die on its own merits, and not be boosted by the government through its $1bn underwriting program for new energy projects or any other support. He is just as dismissive of suggestions the government may support new long-distance gas pipelines, which have previously been touted by Nev Power, the former Fortescue Metals executive now heading the federal government’s Covid-19 Coordination Commission. It is broadly accepted gas could be replaced by cheaper electricity in heating and cooking, but is likely to have a longer role in heavy industry and manufacturing. Wood says potential replacements such as green hydrogen are not affordable today, though that could change sooner than expected not long ago, possibly within the next decade. In all its uses, he says, the role of gas is “heading in the same direction”, just on different timeframes, and it should not be the role of government to boost it. “If Angus is right, if he was an all-seeing and all-knowing god who knows gas is part of the answer, then that would be different,” Wood says. “But I don’t think he is.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2020/may/11/green-steel-industry-could-secure-jobs-future-for-australias-coalmining-heartland","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2020-05-10T17:30:31Z","webTitle":"Green steel industry could secure jobs future for Australia's coalmining heartland","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/11/green-steel-industry-could-secure-jobs-future-for-australias-coalmining-heartland","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2020/may/11/green-steel-industry-could-secure-jobs-future-for-australias-coalmining-heartland","fields":{"headline":"Green steel industry could secure jobs future for Australia's coalmining heartland","bodyText":"A new Australian green steel industry could create tens of thousands of jobs in regional areas reliant on coalmining, particularly in central Queensland and the Hunter Valley, giving them a future as demand for carbon-intensive goods falls. That is the conclusion of a report by the Grattan Institute, a thinktank linked to the University of Melbourne, which examined claims Australia has the potential to become a green energy “superpower”. Assessing the viability of clean manufacturing possibilities, the institute found green steel made with renewable hydrogen could become a multibillion-dollar export industry employing 25,000 people in regions likely to be hardest hit by global steps to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Tony Wood, the institute’s energy program director, said Australia had not typically been good at globally competitive manufacturing, succeeding instead at “digging stuff out of the ground”. But he said the rapid fall in the cost of solar and wind energy and the country’s world-leading clean energy resources was a “fundamentally significant change”. “We have the potential for competitive renewable energy to drive manufacturing in a way in which we wouldn’t have imagined not long ago,” Wood said. “If we get this right, we will resolve the great climate conundrum that has stretched our political fabric for more than a decade.” Options for diversifying Australia’s fossil fuel-intensive energy industries as the globe aims to cut emissions include exporting renewable energy, either as electricity by sub-sea cable or as hydrogen, and developing low-emissions commodities, such as metals, chemicals or biofuels. Rather than exporting renewable hydrogen, the analysis found the most economically viable path appeared to be to use it within Australia to produce steel with near-zero emissions. “Green steel” is created using hydrogen to trigger a chemical reaction with the oxygen in iron ore to create iron metal and water. The metal is then refined and cast into steel. Hydrogen-based direct reduction of iron ore is not yet commercial, but the report says it is based on a proven technology involving gas. Pilot plants are being built or planned in Germany and Sweden, where steelmaker SSAB recently has set a target of green steel production by 2026, a decade earlier than was previously considered possible. German manufacturer Thyssenkrupp made headlines in November when it demonstrated that a steel blast furnace could in part run on hydrogen. A future for carbon workers The institute’s report focuses on the future of “carbon workers” – people and communities in fossil fuel-reliant industries whose jobs will be threatened by global steps to tackle the climate crisis to meet the goals of the Paris agreement. There are nearly 100,000 carbon workers in Australia, 55,000 of them in “carbon-intensive regions” likely to face more acute social and economic challenges than people in major cities. More than 23,000 live in central Queensland, where they make up 15% of the workforce, mostly mining coal. Another 16,300 are in the Hunter Valley. The report says carbon-intensive electorates recorded bigger swings than average to the Coalition at the 2019 federal election, when it was emphasising it would do less to combat the climate crisis than Labor. While it may have helped it last year, it says the Morrison government’s approach of supporting only modest climate targets cannot protect jobs in the face of global climate action, and does not help the country seize new low-carbon opportunities. Wood and co-authors Guy Dundas and James Ha conclude this stance – stressing the short-term costs for those affected by climate policy while ignoring the cost of inaction – ultimately works against Australia’s national interest. It says both Coalition and Labor leaders have claimed Australia should and will continue to export fossil fuel products for decades while committed to the Paris agreement. In reality, the future for coal, gas, oil and products created with them was much less certain. “Australian governments need to be honest with carbon workers: their attempts to protect carbon jobs from global forces will ultimately fail,” the report says. “You don’t have to be a card-carrying climate activist to think this is a good idea. You just have to be someone making an assessment about risk,” Wood added. “Our practical plan could be a win-win-win. It would create a new export industry, support carbon workers and cut emissions.” Call for government support The report is published as global institutions, industry groups, investors and civil society leaders call on governments to use stimulus programs needed to drive the economic recovery from Covid-19 to also address the climate crisis. Wood said a green steel industry would take time to develop, but unlike other options being considered was an area in which Australia had a competitive advantage. Currently, Australia mostly ships the raw iron ore and metallurgical coal used in steel production to Asian countries, where it is processed. But the institute found Australia was likely to have a cost advantage in manufacturing iron metal, and possibly refined steel, in a low-emissions world due to its access to cheap clean energy and the high cost of shipping hydrogen. Creating a green steel manufacturing industry at a global scale would demand big industrial workforces, such as those found in coalmining regions in central Queensland and New South Wales. The report says lower labour-costs meant it would be cheaper to make green steel in those places than in the Pilbara in Western Australia, even once shipping iron ore from the west to east coast was factored in. It says investment would need to come from the private sector, but calls on the federal government to fund a low-emissions steel “flagship” program to build local skills and capability over the next decade, possibly by using low-cost gas from WA to make steel with lower emissions as green steel developed, or by helping existing steel plants at Port Kembla and Whyalla modernise and survive. Other government support could include federal funding for studies into the geological potential for hydrogen storage and, at a state and local level, programs to help workers retrain. Why not just export hydrogen? There has been optimism about the possibility of exporting hydrogen, but the report says its prospects are uncertain, in part because it is hard to transport. It must either be liquefied by cooling it to -253C or converted into a chemical such as ammonia. For exports to be viable, Australian hydrogen would need to be far cheaper than from other countries. The report says while an industry may develop, “the uncertainties mean that it is unlikely to be Australia’s most significant clean energy opportunity”. In terms of jobs, there were likely to be far more if Australia used its cheap clean energy to produce commodities for export than if it just sent renewable energy offshore. Manufacturing is far more labour-intensive than electricity generation, and its jobs generally better paid. The report says green steel is likely to cost more than fossil fuel steel for the foreseeable future, but if the cost of renewable hydrogen was to reach US$2 a kilogram it would add only 1% to the cost of a typical car or house, and 0.5% to a railway or road. It said there were also attractive, but probably smaller, opportunities in creating a sustainable biofuels industry and, to a lesser extent, development in renewable ammonia and exporting electricity via sub-sea cables, as proposed by the $20bn Sun Cable project backed by billionaires Andrew “Twiggy” Forrest and Mike Cannon-Brookes, which hopes to sell solar energy from the Northern Territory to Singapore. It said the federal government should consider requiring a share of domestic aviation fuel come from non-food biofuel sources, saying it could create hundreds of jobs in Collie, Portland and the Latrobe Valley. “These opportunities are not certain and will generally rely on either international policies to reduce emissions, or customers being willing to pay a ‘green premium,” the report says. “But these opportunities are credible, particularly if the world moves away from fossil fuels.” Partnering with competitors Tennant Reed, from the Australian Industry Group, said the report did a great job fleshing out the abstract idea of the advantages Australia may have in a clean energy world, and laying the foundations for future policy and development work. He said people had different views of where future opportunities would lie, with some excited by exporting bulk hydrogen, others aluminium, others steel, but the report illustrated how big the latter opportunity could be. He said the Grattan Institute envisaged a huge increase in Australia’s share of global steel production, a shift that would not be easy in a world in which countries may look to increase domestic manufacturing. It would require working closely with other nations. “It will be a lot harder if we are just trying to cut these countries and their companies out of the global steel industry rather than partnering with them,” Reed said. The energy and emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, did not mention steel specifically when asked for his response to the report, but said clean commodities made with hydrogen would help the country become a world leader in that industry. He said the government had committed $370m to developing it through the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the Australian Renewable Energy. Labor’s climate change and energy spokesman, Mark Butler, said the report showed the jobs and industry benefits of embracing a clean energy future, and accused the prime minister, Scott Morrison, of actively opposing going in that direction. “A Covid-19 recovery plan which brings forward investment in new renewable projects like green hydrogen will create tens of thousands of new jobs, stimulate regional economies and deliver cheaper power prices,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2019/sep/26/brexit-party-meps-are-eus-biggest-earners-in-second-jobs-study-finds","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2019-09-26T14:23:37Z","webTitle":"Brexit party MEPs are EU's biggest earners in second jobs, study finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/26/brexit-party-meps-are-eus-biggest-earners-in-second-jobs-study-finds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2019/sep/26/brexit-party-meps-are-eus-biggest-earners-in-second-jobs-study-finds","fields":{"headline":"Brexit party MEPs are EU's biggest earners in second jobs, study finds","bodyText":"Brexit party members earn more from second jobs than any other group in the European parliament, according to transparency campaigners who are warning about potential conflicts of interest. An annual study by Transparency International showed that Nigel Farage is no longer the best-paid British MEP by second job. Now in seventh place among the 227 MEPs with outside earnings, Farage earns about €360,000 (£319,000) a year from his media company, Thorn in the Side. The Brexit party’s London member Ben Habib is the EU’s best-paid MEP. Elected in May, Habib declared €960,000 annual earnings from First Property Group, the property fund manager he founded. Three other Brexit party MEPs make the top 10 ahead of Farage. At No 3 is Ann Widdecombe, who declared a second income of €240,000-€480,000 a year. The former Tory minister and reality TV contestant makes between €5,000 and €10,000 a month writing her Daily Express column, with a further €20,000 a month coming in from speaking and broadcasting. The Brexit party chairman, Richard Tice, has annual earnings of between €264,000 and €360,000 from his business interests. In 12th place is the Conservative Brexit evangelist Daniel Hannan, who is paid at least €5,000 a month to advise the machinery manufacturer JCB. Chaired by the Brexit-supporting Lord Bamford, JCB paid Boris Johnson £10,000 in January and has also had the former Brexit secretary David Davis on the payroll. Another prominent name in the top 10 is the European parliament’s Brexit coordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, who earns between €180,000 and €426,000 for sitting on company boards and giving speeches. All the outside earnings figures cited were before tax. Transparency International said the Brexit party contingent were “the top earners by a long way”, with its 28 MEPs earning a total of between €2m and €4.7m on top of their monthly MEP salaries of €6,825 after tax. The exact figures are unknown, as MEPs are only required to declare outside earnings in approximate amounts. The study reports MEPs annual earnings, but if Brexit goes ahead on 31 October, British MEPs would have sat for only four months of the current five-year term. About a third of the parliament’s 748 sitting MEPs declared income from second jobs. “Based on some of the details, including in some of the declarations of the Brexit party, it is impossible to judge what some of these companies are engaged in and therefore the exercise of determining if there is a potential conflict of interest is impossible to undertake,” said Nick Aiossa of Transparency International’s Brussels office. “Particularly with the sums of money involved with the Brexit party.” The group argues that the current system is too lax, fears fuelled by revelations that Farage failed to declare lavish funding from the Brexit tycoon Arron Banks. Aiossa said that MEPs breaking the European parliament’s code of conduct in previous years had never faced sanctions. “There is simply no deterrent for MEPs to take this exercise seriously,” he said. “Until there is a sanctions regime that accompanies an ethics reform … we will continue to see declarations that are misleading, incomplete or fail to record [important details].” The Brexit party did not respond directly to questions about a potential conflict of interest, but issued a statement from the West Midlands MEP Rupert Lowe, who has the fourth-highest income from a second job. He earns between €204,000 and €444,000 from companies including a business running cancer treatment centres and another involved in solar energy. “Isn’t it wonderful that Brexit party MEPs earn more money than arch-federalist Guy Verhofstadt, and get a lot more votes than him as well,” said Lowe, who is one place ahead of the Belgian MEP. “Many Brexit party MEPs are successful in the work that they do, the decisions they make, and the earnings list reflects that fact. It’s important that voters who wish to attain the goal of leaving the EU have capable, experienced people to represent them to the best of their ability.” A spokesman for Verhofstadt said he had “nothing against the establishment of an ethics body as proposed [by Transparency International]”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2019/jun/30/solar-panels-smart-export-guarantee-is-it-still-worth-it","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2019-06-30T07:00:11Z","webTitle":"Under new rules for selling solar power, is it still worth it?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/jun/30/solar-panels-smart-export-guarantee-is-it-still-worth-it","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2019/jun/30/solar-panels-smart-export-guarantee-is-it-still-worth-it","fields":{"headline":"Under new rules for selling solar power, is it still worth it?","bodyText":"Householders keen to install solar panels are weighing up their options after the government unveiled new plans for the way people will be paid for supplying renewable energy. The scheme, which will be launched in January next year, works in a different way to its predecessor – and is likely be less lucrative. With solar photovoltaic (PV) panels – the most popular domestic option – costing between £5,000 to £8,000, and six months before the new scheme is up and running, should consumers buy now, wait or skip it? What is the scheme? All energy suppliers with at least 150,000 domestic customers (including the big six, such as EDF Energy and Npower, and smaller companies such as Ovo and Bulb) will be required to buy surplus solar, wind or other renewable energy generated by its customers under the smart export guarantee (SEG). The companies will be able to set their own price for this energy. In the past, they paid into a shared pot to buy the renewable energy domestic households sold or “exported” to the grid. The export price paid was fixed by the government. How did the old system differ? It was called the feed-in tariff (FiT) and there were two payments – a “generation tariff” and an “export tariff”. The scheme was launched in April 2010 and closed for new customers at the end of March this year. Those with existing contracts are not affected and continue to be paid. The “generation tariff” paid for all the electricity that households generated. Rates were set by the government and depended on when you signed up to the scheme and the size of your solar PV system. Rates were much higher in the early years – some paid more than 50p per kilowatt hour, but were cut over the years and fell to around 4p for new customers by March this year. Once you had secured a rate it was fixed for the life of your contract, typically 20 or 25 years. The “export tariff” paid homeowners for the surplus energy they exported to the grid. Rates were fixed by government for the entire contract term and were around the market rate for electricity. It was 3.82p/kWh until August 2012 and then 5.38p until the FiT scheme ended. For all households under the FiT this rate is paid on 50% of all the energy generated by the solar panels. The actual amount exported to the grid is not measured, so everyone gets this regardless of how much electricity they actually export. By way of example, if a property’s solar panels generate 2,000kWh of electricity in a year and the owner has a FiT contract paying a fixed rate of 20p/kWh (for the generation tariff), they will be paid £400 for all the energy generated. Under the export tariff the same household is then paid a fixed rate (5.38p/kWh) on half of the energy generated (1,000kWh) – £53. The household will also be using much of its own solar energy, a saving potentially worth hundreds of pounds a year. Is the SEG less generous? It would seem so. Homeowners will only be paid for the energy they export back to their energy supplier. A smart meter is required to show exactly how much. There is no longer a “generation tariff” so it is likely to take much longer (potentially 20 years) before the initial costs are covered by the SEG payments and energy savings. Unlike the FiT, the export price is not set by government and there will be no long-term contracts. Typically, consumers will be able to secure short-term fixed rates or opt for a variable rate which will pay the “market rate” for energy at the time it is exported. Should I still get solar panels? Energy companies do not have to start making payments under the SEG scheme until January 2020, but one company – Octopus Energy – has already launched two tariffs. The first pays a fixed rate of 5.5p/kWh and the other a variable rate. Solar panels installed now will be eligible for the scheme and consumers can sign up to suppliers as and when they offer tariffs, or wait until 2020. One benefit of installing now might be to avoid an increase in tax – from October this year VAT on solar panels and batteries will rise from 5% to 20%. Natalie Hitchins, head of home products and services at Which?, expects solar installations will slow this year, but says that people invest in them for a number of reasons and often it won’t be about making the money back quickly, instead seeing the environmental impact as the most important thing. “Anyone hoping to make money under the smart export guarantee should think carefully. We don’t know what rates or contract terms will be offered and rates might vary widely between energy companies,” she says. Anthony Kyriakides, head of renewables at the Energy Saving Trust (EST), agrees there is significant uncertainty. “How will people search for different tariffs and compare offers?” he says. “It is understandable that many homeowners will hold off until things are clearer.” Can I store my solar energy? A great idea – but it costs a lot more. One downside of solar panels is that you can only use the energy generated immediately – that is, when you are at home putting lights on and running appliances. With a battery system you can store electricity to use later or sell back to your supplier – either way making savings. But battery systems cost at least £4,000, so it will mean even longer until you have paid off the initial outlay. ‘You need to stick with it’ Staying in a property for a long time is key to maximising the benefits of solar panels, according to a couple who have had them for the last four years. Ross Power, 38, and his wife Abi Gilchrist, 41, both professional musicians who run London and Kent Soul Choirs, installed PV panels at their home in Whitstable, Kent, in 2015. They got a fixed 12.8p/kWh rate under the generation tariff and earn about £600 annually. They also use the panels to heat a water tank and are paid the export tariff. Together with savings from using their own power, that adds up to around another £600 a year. Yet despite the loss of the FiT scheme for new customers, they maintain there are still savings to be made - but you need to stick with them. “It does appear there is less incentive to install panels,” says Ross. “But if you want to be greener, do it. We have seen huge savings in our energy bills regardless of the money earned through the feed-in tariff.” There are downsides: “The panels become less efficient over time, so earning potential will fall. You have got to keep the panels clean and this costs about £100 each year.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2022/oct/12/australia-news-live-updates-bali-bombings-anthony-albanese-terror-attacks-nato-ukraine-indigenous-voice-politics-economy-recession-budget","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-12T07:38:09Z","webTitle":"Lidia Thorpe to lodge press council complaint over voice report; attorney general says pursuit of Assange has ‘gone on long enough’ – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2022/oct/12/australia-news-live-updates-bali-bombings-anthony-albanese-terror-attacks-nato-ukraine-indigenous-voice-politics-economy-recession-budget","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2022/oct/12/australia-news-live-updates-bali-bombings-anthony-albanese-terror-attacks-nato-ukraine-indigenous-voice-politics-economy-recession-budget","fields":{"headline":"Lidia Thorpe to lodge press council complaint over voice report; attorney general says pursuit of Assange has ‘gone on long enough’ – as it happened","bodyText":"We will leave the live blog there for tonight.

Qantas staff apply to take protected industrial action Qantas domestic cabin crew have applied to the federal industrial umpire to take protected action over fatigue concerns and claims of outsourcing, AAP reports. The Flight Attendants’ Association of Australia (FAAA) says Qantas management “have threatened employees that they will not have access to work on new aircraft unless they sign onto new enterprise agreements that dramatically cut conditions”. In May, Qantas ordered 20 Airbus A321XLR aircraft as part of the first tranche of its domestic fleet renewal which will replace its Boeing 737 aircraft. The association says the airline would extend shifts from 10 to 12 hours for crew on the new Airbuses and cut rest time between shifts. “To force crew to work even longer and harder than they already are with no additional break between shifts would cause more to go off sick with fatigue, causing further disruption to an already chaotic Qantas flight schedule,” said the association’s general secretary Teri O’Toole. But Qantas denies the union’s claims, saying the “grounds for taking this step towards industrial action are misleading”. “The shift length changes we’re asking for are the same that apply to crew working at other domestic airlines in Australia,” a Qantas spokesperson told AAP on Wednesday. They also denied any plans to outsource the attendants’ shifts. “The FAAA signed off on these conditions as part of agreements for those airlines, so it’s bizarre they’re now claiming they’re unsafe.” If the FAAA’s application is successful cabin crew will then vote on industrial action which Qantas says cannot take place before mid-November. Animal Justice party says Ruby Roo ‘would have been shot’ We can add the Animal Justice Party to the list of people who are a bit bemused by Tourism Australia picking a kangaroo as its new mascot. Animal Justice party MP Mark Pearson said: I suppose we should be grateful to Tourism Australia for creating a CGI-animated kangaroo to promote Australia and its iconic animals, because, at the rate the Australian government is allowing kangaroos to be slaughtered for leather and pet food, cartoon kangaroos are all we will have left to show tourists and future generations. If Tourism Australia’s brand ambassador Ruby Roo was real, she would have been shot as part of a government ‘kangaroo management plan’ and hung up by her leg on the back of a ute. Tourism Australia’s new brand ambassador Ruby Roo is a heartrending fiction: the Australian government despises kangaroos. If Ruby Roo was real, she would have been labelled a pest and shot in the head. Where the bloody hell is your sense of hypocrisy, Tourism Australia?” Meanwhile, in Perth. A class action against BHP over a 2015 Brazilian dam collapse that killed 19 people can proceed despite not all of the claimants being Australian residents, after a high court ruling. AAP reports the group of more than 29,000 people held BHP shares on the Australian Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Johannesburg Stock Exchange before the Fundao Dam failure. The village of Bento Rodrigues was wiped out when the dam in southeastern Brazil collapsed, killing 19 and displacing 700. The Australian class action covers a period from October 2013 until the dam failure on 9 November, 2015. The claimants alleged they suffered losses because BHP failed to meet its stock exchange disclosure obligations and because the mining company was misleading or deceptive. BHP argued any claimants who were non-Australian resident shareholders could not legally be part of the class action. But Australia’s high court on Wednesday dismissed BHP’s appeal, ruling the legislation does not restrict a claimant’s geographical location or residence. “BHP’s construction [of the law] ignores the Constitution and the legislation passed by the Commonwealth Parliament... and rewrites the Federal Court of Australia Act,” the High Court justices said in their judgment. “BHP’s construction would signal a ‘radical departure’ from the accepted bases.” BHP told AAP it remained committed to defending the shareholder class action in Australia. Lawyers from Phi Finney McDonald and Maurice Blackburn, who are representing the claimants, said Wednesday’s decision promoted access to justice. Everyone is getting along very nicely in the new parliament. Richard Boyle hearing adjourned The hearing that will decide whether tax office whistleblower Richard Boyle is immune from prosecution has been adjourned until next Wednesday. Boyle is facing 24 charges including for recording private phone calls and taking photographs of taxpayer information, actions he says were part of gathering evidence as he prepared to make a public interest disclosure about the Australian Tax Office’s actions. Judge Liesl Kudelka will determine whether Boyle is protected by the Public Interest Disclosure Act. If she decides not, he faces a trial and potential prison term. In the past week, Boyle has told the South Australian district court he grew increasingly concerned about what he called maladministration in the tax office. He alleges employees were told to use heavy-handed tactics to recover debts from taxpayers, including by forcing third parties such as banks to hand over money. Vulnerable taxpayers were at risk of suicide, he said, when the tax office ignored their claims of hardship and insisted on pursuing debts. On the other hand, Boyle said, he had been told that usually the ATO wrote off about $1bn every year in debts to reduce their debt level, and that in 2017 that went up to $3bn, which was unusual. He was concerned that taxpayers were having debts written off, but were then receiving tax credits on their income tax, instead of the credit being applied to their written off debt. He described that as a potential breach of the tax legislation. Boyle says he tried to raise his concerns internally, then eventually turned to the media to expose them. This is the first test of the whistleblower laws, and advocates fear the hearing and possibility of a trial will have a chilling effect on other potential whistleblowers. Nicholas Robinson KC, acting for the director of the office of public prosecutions, pressed Boyle on why he couldn’t just take notes of conversations. Boyle’s response was that a tape recording “would be unequivocal and objective evidence, rather than my hand taken notes”, and expressed scepticism that the ATO would produce the written records if needed as evidence. Boyle has told the court that he faced “reprisals” and bullying for drawing attention to the tax office’s actions, that it constituted “psychological abuse” and had left him with post traumatic stress disorder. Lawyers for both sides will now prepare written and oral submissions for the judge. Richard Marles aiming to build friendship with Papua New Guinea during visit The deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, says he will “reaffirm our close and enduring friendship with Papua New Guinea” during a visit to the country from today until Friday. Marles, who is also the defence minister, is expected to meet with PNG’s prime minister, James Marape, and other senior ministers. The agenda includes talks about “priorities and opportunities in national security, infrastructure, agriculture, and economic cooperation”. The government said Marles would also “take a friendship walk along part of the Kokoda Track to mark the 80th anniversary of the pivotal Kokoda Campaign during the Second World War”. The trip comes amid efforts by the Australian government to strengthen ties with Pacific countries. Earlier today the foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, said she would travel to the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the Republic of Nauru. Marles said: My visit to Papua New Guinea reflects the importance Australia places on our friendship with our closest neighbour, and reaffirms the government’s commitment to partnering with Papua New Guinea through the PNG-Australia Comprehensive Strategic and Economic Partnership (CSEP). I am looking forward to meeting with prime minister Marape and some of his ministers, to discuss our respective priorities and how we can better align our efforts, partnership opportunities, and reaffirm the importance of working with our Pacific family. Many know that I have a close affection for PNG, and am very much looking forward to what will be one of many visits to our close neighbour. Greens Senator Lidia Thorpe says she will be making a complaint to the Australian Press Council over what she alleges was false reporting in the Australian on Tuesday about her meeting former Liberal candidate Warren Mundine about their joint opposition to a referendum on the voice. Thorpe said yesterday she would not be joining the “no” campaign and today confirmed said she would lodge a press council complaint over the alleged false report. She said the meeting with Mundine was a meeting of members of the crossbench to discuss the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Guardian Australia contacted News Corp Australia yesterday about Thorpe’s claim. The federal government services minister, Bill Shorten, and the federal emergency management minister, Murray Watt, have announced residents in 27 local government areas are eligible for the disaster recovery allowance following severe storms and flooding in NSW in September and October. The allowance will be available from 2pm tomorrow to the following LGAs: Blayney, Bogan, Burke, Brewarrina, Cabonne, Cowra, Dubbo, Edward River, Forbes, Gilgandra, Glen Innes Severn, Greater Hume, Gunnedah, Gwydir, Lachlan, Lithgow, Liverpool Plains, Moree Plains, Mid-Western, Narrabri, Narromine, Tamworth, Upper Lachlan, Walgett, Warren, Warrumbungle and Weddin. The allowance is available to employees and sole traders who experience a loss of income as a result of the disaster and is payable up to 13 weeks. The payment will also be available to eligible NZ citizens affected by the floods. People can lodge claims through myGov, or call the Australian Government Emergency Information Line on 180 22 66. Only one in eight medical students choosing general practice The health minister, Mark Butler, tells ABC’s Afternoon Briefing patients are saying it’s never been harder to see a GP, and GPs are saying that their businesses are under real threat in terms of financial viability because of six years of Medicare rebate freezes under the former government. He said: It’s not just the pressure today, it’s what I described as a terrifying trend which is only one in eight medical graduates today is choosing general practice as their career. It used to be four in eight. Now it is one in eight. That pipeline of new GPs to replace the baby boomer generation of general practitioners while considering retirement today is not just there for us so that’s why want to talk to medical students themselves. He says he wants to hear from the students what needs to change to attract them to general practice. Tasmanians warned of wild weather The Tasmania State Emergency Service (SES) has warned Tasmanians, particularly those in the north and north-west, to be ready for intense rainfall, damaging winds, and potential flooding from tonight. Tasmania SES acting director, Leon Smith, said: The state is already very wet, which means that rain over the next few days could lead to flooding in the forecast areas. It’s imperative that Tasmanians heed the warnings and take note that intense rainfalls could lead to significant flooding within the north-west, north, and north-east areas of the state. Of concern in the first instance, modelling shows impacts on the north-west townships of Railton, Latrobe, Wivenhoe, Burnie, and Sheffield. This is a dynamic situation of significance that we are monitoring, but inevitably we will see flooding in some areas within the forecast areas over the coming days. If you know that you live in a low-lying area that is prone to flooding; if you were in areas of the north-west in the 2016 floods; and you are aware that your property, or the property of someone you know, has been previously impacted by flood, there is a high chance flood impacts will be seen during this event. Tourism Australia boss defends use of cartoon kangaroo Tourism Australia’s managing director, Phillipa Harrison, is on ABC’s Afternoon Briefing to speak about the controversial use of a cartoon kangaroo called Ruby to sell tourism to Australia overseas. She says Tourism Australia spent a lot of time researching what overseas markets love about Australia, and at the moment people are still staying close to home, so there needed to be an extra impetus given for people to take those long flights to Australia. She says the research showed people recognised the kangaroo more than anything else, and people loved the “warm and welcoming” nature of Australians, so the campaign is designed to remind people Australia is open and “warm and welcoming”. She says while Australians are very interested in how they’re represented internationally, ultimately the campaign is not marketed to Australians. Disaster recovery allowance available in NSW The federal emergency management minister, Murray Watt, has just posted that disaster recovery allowance is now available for people in 27 council locations in NSW. I am just chasing down where those councils are and will bring more for you when I have it. And with that, I am going to hand you over to Josh Taylor who will take you through the evening!

Scientists discover ‘exciting advancement’ in potential Alzheimer’s disease treatment Queensland researchers have forged a path to delivering Alzheimer’s drugs directly to the brain in a major scientific breakthrough, AAP has reported. Scientists at the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute created models of the human blood-brain barrier, a wall of cells that protects the brain from pathogens and toxins, and successfully opened it. The barrier works as a natural shield and blocks 98% of disease-fighting drugs from entering the brain. QIMR Berghofer scientists created blood-brain barrier models using stem cells from Alzheimer’s patients and successfully unlocked the barrier using focused ultrasound. “It’s a very exciting advancement in the therapeutic ultrasound field,” researcher Dr Lotta Oikari told AAP. “We are able to model the blood-brain barriers of people who have a high risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease in the laboratory setting and increase the delivery of therapeutic Alzheimer’s antibodies. Federal inquiry hears long Covid clinics inundated Hello everyone – this is Cait Kelly, and I will be with you for the next hour or so. A big thank you to Natasha for taking us through the morning! First up, I have this from AAP: Long Covid clinics across the country are being inundated with requests for assessments from patients struggling with ongoing symptoms, an inquiry has heard. Doctors told the federal parliamentary inquiry into long Covid and repeated Covid infections on Wednesday they are struggling to keep up with demand and waitlists are increasing. At least ten million Australians have been infected with Covid and it’s estimated 3 to 5% will develop long Covid at some point. Long Covid is characterised by long-term health issues including heart palpitations and extreme fatigue, three months from the onset of Covid, with symptoms lasting at least two months, according to the World Health Organisation. “Our waitlist is increasing because what we’ve observed is that it can take some time for the recognition of post-COVID conditions, particularly with the fatigue-predominant types, to reach us,” Royal Children’s hospital Associate Professor Shidan Tosif told the inquiry. Thanks for your attention, that’s it from me for today. I hand you over to the lovely Cait Kelly. Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi has visited the Multicultural Council of Wagga Wagga (MCWW). In a bit of mid-afternoon blog joy before I sign off, here is the MCWW’s mascot Bennie.

Research grants favour men, minister for women says The minister for finance and women Katy Gallagher says the government is committing funding targets to ensure gender equality in research opporunities. The attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, has reaffirmed the government’s view that the pursuit of Julian Assange has “gone on long enough” and has alluded to private talks with the Biden administration about the issue. At the National Press Club in Canberra today, Dreyfus was asked about the US attempt to prosecute the Wikileaks co-founder. Assange is fighting a US attempt to extradite him from the UK to face charges in connection with the publication of hundreds of thousands of leaked documents about the Afghanistan and Iraq wars, as well as diplomatic cables. Press freedom advocates and human rights groups have raised fears the prosecution of Assange under the US Espionage Act sets “a dangerous precedent”. When asked today whether he thought it was in the public interest that the prosecution of Julian Assange continue, Dreyfus said: Mr Assange’s case has gone on long enough. The prime minister has said this. The foreign minister has said this. I’ve said this. I will say it again: it has gone on long enough but we’re not going to conduct our representations to the government of the United States in public. I’ll say no more about that. Australians attend Bali bombings memorial service in Denpasar The assistant minister for foreign affairs, Tim Watts, has laid a wreath in Bali as part of a memorial service to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the Bali bombings. The event was held at the consulate in Denpasar’s memorial garden and attended by Australian families of those killed, survivors themselves, diplomatic members of the Australian consulate to Indonesia and members of the Australian Federal Police, who were part of the investigation after the bombing. Watts gave a speech talking about the attack, recognising the courage of the many first responders, rescue teams and volunteers who worked for days to help people affected by the bombings. He said: 20 years later, the pain is still felt. That night remains seared into the national memories of Indonesians, Australians and so many others. We will always remember these 202 innocent people, most under the age of 40, the youngest just 13 years old. Today we pay tribute to those who died. Race to document ancient boab carvings Sue O’Connor, a professor of archaeology at the Australian National University, says it’s “a race against time” to record 12 ancient boab trees bearing carvings that tell the Dreaming story of the king brown snake, or Lingka. No one knows how old these trees are. But if they were 500 years old at the time they were carved, which is conceivable, then they may not live for that much longer.” It’s impossible to know the age of the carvings found on the trees, in a patch of the Tanami straddling the border of Western Australia and the Northern Territory, AAP reports. But some, high on the bulbous trunks of the slow-growing heritage trees, give a sense of how long they might have been there. Almost all the carvings are of snakes and their location matches the Lingka Dreaming track Indigenous owners speak of, stretching from south of Broome and into the territory. O’Connor says: The Dreaming track is where the traditional owners believe the Lingka, or king brown snake, travelled across the country. Prof O’Connor, colleagues, traditional owners including Jaru woman Brenda Garstone and historian Darrell Lewis have just published a new paper in the journal Antiquity about their two years of field work to document the 12 trees. The carvings on the 12 trees have been meticulously recorded using photogrammetry with the hope of staging a 3D exhibition to offer all Australians a sense of the trees’ history and power. Prof O’Connor believes there are more carved trees yet to be found. She just hopes it’s before they are destroyed by lightning strikes or bushfires, damaged by hungry cattle that like to gnaw on boab bark, or collapse with old age. Garstone, who was also on the mission and co-authored the paper, hopes money can be found to fund another search and save more of her family’s ancestral heritage. She said: I think it’s really important to go to all lengths to be able to preserve this ancient icon, that is a symbol of our ancestral dreaming. It connects to the fact that it’s the oldest living culture. This is another piece of proof that this has been continuously passed down through generations. Bureau of Meteorology releases weather update for Victoria, Tasmania and southern NSW Russian and Belarusian players will be able to compete in the Australian Open in 2023, but not under their country’s flags. It comes after they were controversially banned from Wimbledon. At the launch event today, Australian Open director Craig Tiley confirmed the Association of Tennis Professionals’ ruling that players compete as ‘neutrals’ after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine would extend to the Open. At this point, Russian and Belarusian players will be eligible to play in the Australian Open, and they, like every other player, will have to go through the (entry) process. The only difference will be that they cannot represent Russia - they cannot represent the flag of Russia. They cannot participate in any activity such as the anthem of Russia and they have to play as independent players under a neutral name. - with AAP Australian Open organisers will not lobby government for Djokovic visa Australian Open tournament director, Craig Tiley, says he will not lobby on behalf of the unvaccinated Serbian player, Novak Djokovic who was dramatically deported from Australia on the eve of this year’s tournament. The Tennis Australia (TA) boss - who was heavily involved in the saga that saw Djokovic locked up in a quarantine hotel - at the time blamed the changing Covid-19 landscape for miscommunication with federal authorities, AAP reports. The former world No.1 is subject to a three-year ban from entering Australia but can apply for an exemption from new immigration minister, Andrew Giles. Speaking at the launch of the 2023 tournament, Tiley said he would not be involved in the process this time. Tiley told reporters today: At this point ... Novak and the federal government need to work out the situation and then we’ll follow any instruction after that. It’s not a matter we can lobby on. It’s a matter that definitely stays between the two of them and then depending on the outcome of that we would welcome him to the Australian Open. Tiley said he had so far had no communication with the federal government about Djokovic. The tournament director said he spent time with the 21-grand slam title winner at the recent Laver Cup and Djokovic told him he was keen to return to Melbourne Park. He said that he’d obviously love to come back to Australia, but he knows it’s going to be an ultimate decision for the federal government. He’s accepted that position. It’s a private matter between them but we’d like to welcome Novak back - he’s a nine-time champion - provided he gets the right entry requirements into Australia. Tiley said TA had brought on external immigration specialists to help deal with the demand from players and their entourages, with double the applicants of last year. Nine news is reporting that a man has been shot in Sydney’s west, following a separate shooting in Cabramatta last night. Government considering greater transparency measures ahead of referendum, attorney general says My colleague Josh Butler has asked the attorney general Mark Dreyfus at the National Press Club about what is happening about funding with the yes and no campaigns for the referendum on the voice to parliament. Butler: I wanted to ask but the Voice to Parliament, will there be public funding given to the respective sides of the debate and, related, does the Government have concerns about influx of private money into the respective campaigns, potentially from overseas political interest groups, what could the Government due to ensure that voters get transparency about who was bankrolling the respective sides of the campaign? Dreyfus: It’s a great question. We are looking at all of the arrangements about how this referendum on the voice is to be conducted. We have committed to accepting the generous offer made in the Uluru Statement from the Heart, I hope everyone in this room, and I hope everyone in Australia has read the Uluru Statement from the Heart, it is a wonderful national opportunity to recognise our Indigenous Australians in our Constitution and I’m looking forward to the referendum happening. Before that we have to pay attention to the machinery that surrounds the conduct of a referendum. We haven’t had a referendum in Australia since 1999. We haven’t had a successful one since 1977. Ancient history, almost. If you are under 40 you haven’t voted in a referendum. And we need to look really hard and we are looking really hard on these deliberations now within government as to what the arrangement should be. One of those questions is just just goes to your question, Josh, which is achieving transparency in donations, possibly to a greater level than we presently have in the electoral process. Another question, a machinery question is how to make a very antiquated referendum machinery provisions look more like the electoral process that we have in Australia, which is what Australians are familiar with. So that’s ahead. But we will see more in coming months about what the arrangements we are proposing are. Butler reminds Dreyfus about the part of his question about whether the government has concerns about overseas groups funding campaign. He says “it is a concern” because he can’t think of a reason for overseas groups to be funding this campaign. Speculation about soaring electricity prices brightens solar outlook Power prices are in the news again thanks in large part to Jeff Dimery, the head of Alinta Energy warning on Monday (as noted in this blog) that electricity tariffs may rise as much as 35% next year. (Actually, it’s rather early to make so precise a figure, but anyways...) One consequence of such chatter is that more people make inquiries about solar energy, and a portion of those go on to install panels (since the economics are pretty good - not to mention avoided carbon emissions). And that’s what we’ve seen. According to Green Energy Markets, there was a fair uptick in installations in August and lately, September. (Commercial demand picked up even more than residential.) And it’s a pattern across much of the nation. Higher prices for systems had started to hit PV installations, but we should keep in mind demand had soared during the Covid lockdowns when people were spending a lot of time staring at the ceilings at home - and apparently their rooftops. We look more at the market trends in this piece that has just gone live, including how Dimery’s comments have set off another spike in solar PV inquiries, according to SolarQuotes: Separately, given that solar offers some “insurance” against higher bills, it’s worth looking at the latest size of turnover within the National Electricity Market (which serves 80% of the nation’s populace, mostly in the country’s east). Looks like we might be talking about electricity (and gas) prices for some time to come. Greens question government stance on private anti-corruption hearings We brought you what the attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, has been telling the National Press Club in Canberra a couple posts ago about the National Anti Corruption Commission (Nacc). Greens senator David Shoebridge has taken to social media welcoming the new government’s position in contrast to the previous government, but he questions Dreyfus’s reasoning when it comes to private hearings. The criticism comes after other members of the crossbench also expressed their concerns that the hearings won’t be public. Penny Wong to visit to the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the republic of Nauru The minister for foreign affairs, Penny Wong, will this week travel to the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the Republic of Nauru. In the Republic of the Marshall Islands, Wong will officially open Australia’s embassy which commenced operations last year. In a statement Wong said: I will also be putting to air the first Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) radio program on the Republic of the Marshall Island’s national broadcaster in six years. I look forward to meeting His Excellency President David Kabua, Foreign Minister Kitlang Kabua, other members of parliament, and community leaders to discuss climate action and enhance our security, environmental, cultural and economic partnerships. In Nauru, I will meet newly elected President His Excellency Russ Kun to discuss our shared priorities such as climate-resilient infrastructure, connectivity, economic opportunities and pandemic recovery. I will also launch a new partnership with Nauru and the Australian Football League to support young athletes in Nauru, Papua New Guinea and Fiji. This will be Wong’s eighth visit to the Pacific as foreign minister, and the first ministerial visit to the Republic of the Marshall Islands since 2018. Wong says the visit demonstrates “the priority the new Australian government places on our region” and will further strengthen Australia’s ties with “our Pacific family.” Major flooding likely in Victoria’s northern catchments The attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, is addressing the National Press Club in Canberra, and knows his audience. He moves onto what the Nacc will mean for press freedom. Dreyfus: Shortly I will be introducing separate reforms to the public interest disclosure act to improve whistleblower protections with the aim of having these reforms in place when the commission commenced operation. Many of those present have a strong interest in press freedom. So do I. For this reason the legislation establishing the national anti-corruption commission contains strong safeguards to protect the identities of journalist sources and to uphold the clear public interest associated with a free press. As attorney general I’m acutely conscious that any newly created power brought onto our statute books must not interfere with the important work of the press in holding those in authority to account. At this point a member of the audience applauds (my colleague Josh Butler who’s in the room informs me this comes from the chief executive of the press club, Maurice Reilly. Thank you, I thought this might be one audience that might appreciate those sentiments. There’s even more! The legislation expressly provides that journalists and their employers will not be required to answer questions or provide information that will enable the identity of their sources to be identified. The commission’s access to search and surveillance powers will be subject to additional safeguards to protect press freedom and the identity of journalist’s sources. And the work does not end there… the Albanese government intends to progress further legislative reform as a priority, including responding to important reports on press freedom from the parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security and is Senate standing committee on environment and communications both from the last parliament. Nacc “is not a court”, Mark Dreyfus says Let me be clear, the national anti-corruption commission is not a court. It is an investigative body. Its primary work is rooting out and exposing corruption. At the conclusion of an investigation the commissioner will be able to publish a detailed report. That report would set out the commissioner’s findings and recommendations supported by evidence, including evidence obtained in private hearings, providing transparency and a comprehensive, public account of the commission’s investigation. The attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, is addressing the National Press Club this lunchtime. He is speaking about one of the details in the government’s national anti-corruption commission (Nacc) which has proved most contentious – that most hearings will be private, with public hearings only held in exception circumstances. The experience of state anti-corruption commissions is that a very small proportion of all hearings are actually public, including the well-known New South Wales independent commission against corruption. There are important reasons why some hearings need to be conducted in private, including to avoid prejudicing an ongoing investigation or related criminal proceedings, to protect the privacy of witnesses or to ensure national security information is protected from disclosure. The decision to hold hearings in public or in private will be made by the independent commissioner. The commission will use hearings to question witnesses and obtain critical evidence about alleged serious or systemic corruption on the way to making findings and recommendations. There will be times when the commission’s investigations will be done in public and other times investigations investigations will benefit from being done in private. The Australian government says it has signed a $322m contract with Raytheon Australia as part of upgrades to the existing Collins-class submarines. Defence issued a press release saying the five-year contract contract will ensure “in-service support for the Collins-class submarine combat system during Australia’s transition to nuclear-powered submarines”. Both major Australian parties have long flagged the need to extend the life of the existing submarines given that the new nuclear-powered submarines could be decades away. The Department of Defence’s deputy secretary for naval shipbuilding and sustainment, Tony Dalton, said the support would include a life-of-type extension beginning in 2026, ongoing sustainment, and selected capability enhancements. Dalton said in the statement: The ongoing sustainment and upgrade of these boats will help maintain a capability advantage and ensure our fleet is ready to meet the challenges across our strategic environment. We are committed to working closely with industry to sustain our Collins class submarines, an important task that currently supports over 1600 jobs across South and West Australia. It’s not a new role for Raytheon Australia: the government says the company “has been providing a range of support services for the Collins-class submarine combat system since its introduction into service”. Clive Palmer announces United Australia party’s new Victorian leader The United Australia party founder, Clive Palmer, is trying to get some candidates up in the Victorian state election, and has announced former Liberal MP for Frankston Geoff Shaw as the party’s leader in the state. Shaw hasn’t been in parliament for almost eight years (or two terms). He resigned from the Liberal party in 2013, which ultimately led to the then premier, Ted Ballieu, resigning after facing internal pressure. The turmoil the Liberal party faced resulted in the party being turfed out of office after just one term, and Victoria has now had eight years of the Daniel Andrews Labor government. High fire danger predicted for south-west Queensland tomorrow Kangaroo advocates are claiming Tourism Australia is cashing in on the beloved species to lure tourists to the country, while turning a blind eye to their demise. Tourism Australia today unveiled a computer generated souvenir kangaroom, Ruby the Roo, as the mascot for its “Come and Say G’day” campaign, voiced by Australian actor Rose Byrne. Former Australian Test cricketer and Kangaroos Alive ambassador Jason “Dizzy” Gillespie said the federal and NSW governments are happy to use the iconic animal to promote tourism on billboards around the world, while at the same time, ignoring concerns about the commercial killing of kangaroos. A NSW parliamentary report into the health and wellbeing of kangaroos examined the management of the commercial kangaroo industry, and found evidence of an unsustainable animal welfare crisis which forced the NSW and federal governments to admit no one is monitoring how the animals meet their end. The inquiry recommended greater transparency of kangaroo management plans, programs and practices. Gillespie said: Tourism Australia even said we’re so lucky to have a globally recognisable and adorable icon in the kangaroo. We need to learn to value these international icons and acknowledge that they are worth much more to Australia alive. Our tourist industry relies on them. The kangaroo is on our Australian coat of arms, it’s the Australian made symbol and it is a much loved animal not just here in Australia but all over the world. Queensland researchers unlock Alzheimer’s barrier Queensland researchers have forged a path to delivering Alzheimer’s drugs directly to the brain in a major scientific breakthrough, AAP reports. Scientists at the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute created models of the human blood-brain barrier, a wall of cells that protects the brain with pathogens and toxins, and successfully opened it. The barrier works as a natural shield and blocks 98% of disease-fighting drugs from entering the brain. QIMR Berghofer scientists created blood-brain barrier models using stem cells from Alzheimer’s patients and successfully unlocked the barrier using focused ultrasound. In a remarkable breakthrough, the scientists opened the barrier to drugs that can combat Alzheimer’s disease. The group’s leader, Prof Anthony White, said: It’s a major breakthrough in terms of understanding the way that we can deliver drugs to the brain. We’re really on the cusp of being able to make some kind of difference in people with Alzheimer’s disease. Stem cell researcher Dr Lotta Oikari said the results were very consistent and researchers were able to replicate the experiment a number of times. She said the model can potentially identify previously tested drugs that might have failed and attempt to deliver them more efficiently with the new method. Fellow researcher Joanna Wasielewska hoped the research would be a therapeutic breakthrough for Alzheimer’s patients. She said: The very first clinical trials show its safety in human patients. We are really at this last step of breaking the ultrasound-mediated drug delivery to patients suffering from brain disorders. Researchers are already working on developing models for motor neurone disease and childhood dementia. Victoria’s severe weather warning expanded to Melbourne and north-east Indonesian ambassador speaks at Canberra memorial, paying tribute to victims and partnership between two nations Indonesia’s ambassador to Australia, Siswo Pramono, has spoken at the memorial in Canberra marking the 20th anniversary of the terrorist attacks in Bali. Twenty years ago today a hideous crime struck and it was one of the saddest days in Indonesian history. Twenty years ago a group of terrorists tried to enforce their belief on to others by way of violence, which resulted in 202 people were killed and 209 people were injured. Pramono acknowledged the Australian and Indonesian victims of the attack, as well as the “overwhelming grief” their loved ones were left with. However, he said that the terrorists couldn’t take away “our love and compassion to others and the idea of people are equal in rights and freedoms”. Pramono also spoke about the cooperation between the nations in the aftermath of the attack to bring the perpetrators to justice: In the days that followed the attacks, Indonesian law enforcement officers assisted by the Australian police put in a relentless effort to bring the perpetrators to justice. Indonesia and Australia are nations of resilience and vigilance rising out of the terrorist attack we have a better and stronger bond among us. Indonesia and Australia developed the Jakarta Centre for Law Enforcement Cooperation. This reflects the determination of both governments to build a better law enforcement institution and system in Indonesia and other countries as well. This initiative wins active support from partner governments and international law enforcement agencies. The relations between Indonesia and Australia improve from strength to strength. In the latest development, the two countries have managed to further strengthen the bilateral ties and politics on economics, defence, culture, and people to people. The visit of Prime Minister Albanese to Indonesia and the delegation last June has further strengthened this strategy partnership. Indonesia and Australia are not just neighbours, but most importantly we are also partners. As the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, did his media rounds this morning, he revealed Australia is considering offering training to Ukraine troops. We brought you some of his comments earlier on the blog, and now my colleagues in Canberra Amy Remeikis and Daniel Hurst bring you the full story here: Severe weather warning for NSW expanded to include Alps Intense rain and flood warnings for Tasmania People in Tasmania have been urged to prepare for widespread heavy rain and potentially dangerous and life-threatening flash flooding in parts. A severe weather warning is in place for the island state’s north and central regions, and the east coast, which is tipped to be hit by dangerous winds. Heavy rain is expected from Wednesday evening to Friday, with the north expected to cop the worst, including intense local falls. The Bureau of Meteorology says 24-hour totals on Thursday are expected to reach 60 to 120 millimetres, with isolated totals up to 180mm over higher terrain. Potentially dangerous and life-threatening flash flooding, with 100mm of rain falling within six hours, is possible in the Great Western Tiers. The SES says widespread minor or moderate flooding is likely from Thursday and major flooding is possible at some locations. Acting director Leon Smith said: People are encouraged to be aware of the forecast and prepare their property before the rain arrives. This means knowing your flood risk and understanding whether your property is prone to flooding. With the ground being saturated in many areas of Tasmania, rivers will rise quickly over coming days. Heavy rain is tipped in Australia’s east and south in coming days. Readers following the political debate around the voice to parliament will be aware there’s been some confusion over the past 24 hours or so about the Greens. On Tuesday, a report in the Australian newspaper suggested the party’s First Nations spokesperson, Lidia Thorpe, had telegraphed backing the no case to businessman Warren Mundine. Thorpe later told my colleague Sarah Martin that report was false. She would not be backing the “no” case. Throughout this debate, the Greens have signalled it is important for the government to act on the three elements of the Uluru statement – voice, truth and treaty. Thorpe repeated that view yesterday. Today, Thorpe’s colleague Sarah Hanson-Young was asked to clarify the Greens position. Hanson-Young again articulated the party’s position on the three elements, but also made it abundantly clear she and “my colleagues” would be supporting the yes campaign for the voice to parliament. Here, for the record, are her comments in full. Hanson Young: As Lidia Thorpe has said, she is not going to be backing the no campaign and the Greens support the full implementation of the statement from the heart, and we want the parliament to respond to that request from First Nations people to act, to give voice, to give treaty, to give truth. Our party is committed to backing the Uluru statement and doing everything we can to make sure First Nations people are listened to and responded to in the way they have asked [for] out of that statement of the heart. That’s a really important message to the rest of the Australian community. As Lidia Thorpe has said, she’s not backing the no campaign, and I am looking very much forward to supporting the yes campaign. I’m going to be supporting the yes campaign, my colleagues are going to be supporting the yes campaign and we need to make sure this delivers for First Nations people. There are a lot of issues First Nations people deal with every day that this parliament has not dealt with and we need to and our leaders need to. I want to be really clear about this: I support the yes campaign and I’ll be doing everything I can to support it. Penny Wong recognises first responders to Bali bombings The minister for foreign affairs, Penny Wong, has spoken at the Canberra memorial. She acknowledged the 202 lives “so callously taken” including 88 Australians, 38 Indonesians and citizens of 20 other countries. As well as the victims, Wong acknowledged the contribution of first responders in attempting to save the lives of victims as well as the Australian government in acts like arranging the last phone calls of victims with loved ones. Ultimately, the terrorists failed. Because, while an act of terror might shake us, it cannot change us. Those who attacked us wanted to divide Australia and Indonesia, to shatter the bonds between two great democracies, painstakingly built on multi-faith, multicultural foundations. And to strike at what makes us all human. But the worst of humanity brought out the very best. Out of that dark acts, were bored such radiant acts of courage and of love. The story of that night is also one of great courage and resilience, a story that many of you here know so well. Survivors became saviours, somehow overcoming their pain. First responders, among them medical staff, police, embassy and cultural officials, and local volunteers, ran towards the devastation. Rescuing everyone they could. Going back time and time again to help the injured and comfort the dying. In the face of exhaustion and horror, hospital staff in Bali worked around the clock to save lives and treat catastrophic injuries. There were outstanding contributions that night and afterwards from across the Australian government. People like Australia’s consular general advice consul David Chaplin both with us today. They were among the first of the scene. They comforted the victims, including those who could not be saved, desperately arranging phone calls so loved ones could speak with them in their final moments. Civilian and military aircraft mobilised to transport the victims regardless of nationality to Perth, Darwin and other specialised bird units. Australian medical staff including Dr Fiona Wood undertook life-saving surgery at medical treatment on the many dozens of seriously injured victims, keeping them alive when hope seemed lost, and blessing them through their pain. Attack failed to drive Australia and Indonesia apart: John Howard At the same time as that memorial in Sydney, another is taking place in Canberra. Former prime minister John Howard, who was the country’s leader at the time of the Bali bombings, has reiterated the message of solidarity with Indonesia like Anthony Albanese. Albanese returns to the heavy toll the attack took and the difficulty of grief which does not abate with time, 20 years after the attacks. But they did take life. They left survivors to rebuild themselves physically and mentally. They left families and friends struggling with loss. For them, and for so many people here today, the world could never be the same again. 20 years on, so pretty hearts are still tethered to that cool night. Every beach tempered by an abiding sorrow. Many currents were stopped in the great river of life that night. Some are still stranded on the back, unable to walk away. Grief is its own creature. Grief does not travel in straight lines. Grief may soften with time, but it does not fade. As my predecessor Julia Gillard put in a decade ago, “Bali is a place like London and Gallipoli were something of the Australian spirit dwells upon another shot.” It is a beloved shore. Indonesian people have reached out to generations of Australians as friends and neighbours. They felt our great pain that night and we felt there … families, friends and community. Its three parts are bowed in sorrow but they hold each other because, it unity, we find strength and we find hope, and we find love. We find each other. And that is how we come together, including today. Our hearts filled with everyone who never came home and card to be with us. It feels also with everyone who never came home the same, everyone who still carries the loss and every survivor that we have lost since. We hold onto their names and faces, and we will never let them fade. Let them live in eternal peace. After Albanese’s speech, Coogee local Joe Sullivan performed You will never walk alone, with many in the audience at the memorial breaking down in tears at the emotional rendition. Bali bombing terrorists could not defeat Australian ideals, PM says Albanese goes on to pay tribute to those people who stepped up amid the horror: We think of those who survived, and we think of those who helped. What they saw that night will never leave them. In a minute, all the very worst of circumstances brought out the very best in people. It brought out compassion, selflessness, it brought out heroism. That night, the terrorists could not achieve their aim stop what they struck, they could not defeat, because what they struck at was the idea of us. The great fabric of dreams and ideals and compassion and fairness that make us who we are as Australians. Indonesians, Australians, people from all over the world, they struck at the friendship between us, they struck at the joy of a free people. They struck at humanity, but we remain. In the end, they reminded us of what is so important to us, and to not take for granted what we have built and nurtured over generations. They sought to create terror, but people around towards the terror to do what they could for friends and strangers alike, because what drove them was a higher, more human instinct than those who attacked them. What the architects of this slaughter achieved was to make us reflect on what we must truly value, and to hold onto its more tightly than ever before. No terrorist could take this from us. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is speaking in Sydney where a commemorative service is being held on the 20th anniversary of the Bali bombings. He acknowledges the other leaders who are present, including opposition leader Peter Dutton, but says he wants particularly to acknowledge the family and friends of those who lost loved ones 20 years ago today. Albanese highlighted the effects the attack had on many Australian sporting clubs whose members were in Bali during the attacks. The service in Sydney is being held in Coogee, where the rugby league club the Coogee Dolphins lost six members. 20 years ago, the shock waves from Bali reached our shores. 20 years ago, and acts of malice is calculated depravity robbed the world of 202 lives, including 88 Australians. 20 years on the ache does not diminish. For most of us, what happens on that fateful night is beyond imagining. The sudden, terrible light followed by the sudden, terrible darkness. The awful postscript of fire, alongside the local workers and residents were teammates, enjoying the end of season holiday. Members of the Kingsley football club, the Sturt football club, the Southport Sharks and the players from my electorate. I know that Debbie Borgia’s husband is here today who lost his wife, and the youngest victim, his daughter, in that tragedy, Abbey Borgia. And of course the Coogee Dolphins, in an act of remembering teammates. We think of them with the ache of knowing that they should still be here. That senses filled with everything that we feel now. The salty tang of the air, the sea, in its ancient rhythm, primary against beach and cliff, the tapestry of voices for which they were all such an electrical part. So many futures were stolen on that night. We think of every conversation ever had, every moment of love never known. Nine News have some images of how bad flooding is in Victoria. Meteorologist Jane Bunn posted this map which shows the extent of the further heavy the deluge on the way for the state: Man dies in NSW flood waters The body of a missing man has been found in his submerged car in the state’s central west following flooding. The death of the 46-year-old comes as much of New South Wales braces for further inundation, with more than 100 flood warnings in place, AAP reports. The man was last seen at Essington, south of Bathurst, about 11am on Sunday, with a search launched when he failed to return home on Monday. About 10.30am on Tuesday a police helicopter crew found his car fully submerged in Campbells River at Charlton and State Emergency Service crews recovered the vehicle with his body inside. Parts of already sodden NSW are predicted to cop as much as another 65mm of rain by week’s end. The Bureau of Meteorology says a trough approaching from the west is expected to bring thunderstorms to the central and southern inland on Thursday and Friday as it crosses the state. Senior forecaster Jonathan How said from late Thursday into Friday, heavy rain would push into Victoria’s north-east and across the western slopes of NSW. This may cause renewed flooding along rivers in parts of the central west and southwest from Friday, many of which are already full due to heavy rain in recent months. How told ABC TV today: But thankfully for those flood-affected communities including Bathurst, Gundagai and Forbes ... the heaviest rain will be further south. But of course, we are expecting to see some local creek and river rises. SES volunteers have responded to more than 1,000 calls for help since Friday evening. RBA outlines how it determines elusive ‘neutral’ interest rate The Reserve Bank of Australia this morning has opened up on how it works out the “neutral” interest rate. It’s effectively the Goldilocks rate that is neither contractionary for the economy nor expansive, Luci Ellis, an assistant governor, says. But we’re not at the neutral rate just yet. The cash rate is at 2.6% after last week’s surprisingly small rise of 25 basis points rather than the 50 basis points most economists expect. Investors have been again lifting their expectations of how high the rate will go, and are toying with a 4% rate in about a year’s time. Anyway, back to that Nirvana of cash rate neutrality – the RBA targets that elusive level over time. Given the expectations of where inflation is going lately, it’s good that they take a long lens. Ellis says: Current inflation is very high, and expected to stay high in the short term. But beyond the next year, inflation expectations remain well anchored inside the target range, both here and overseas. If that anchor were to loosen, that’s another story. In recent decades, the neutral rate has been sinking, for some interesting if unclear reasons. One issue, post global financial crisis, is that prospects for global growth over time have dimmed, so businesses saw little incentive to invest in expansion (and bought back their own stock instead). (If China ends up in a real estate derived funk, there goes the dynamo that kept Australia and much of the world’s economy humming after the GFC.) Ellis says economic theory tells us the neutral rate is “real” because inflation-adjusted interest rates matter for people’s saving and investment decisions. People look through the expected inflation component of nominal rates; lenders expect to be compensated for it, and borrowers expect to have to provide that compensation. Not surprisingly, there is no magic number that tells us what the neutral rate is, or will be, since conditions are always shifting. So where does it leave us? To the RBA, the neutral rate is just “a pole-star to guide us”. “[A]s we navigate the narrow path to our intended goal, we welcome any faint light that those stars may cast,” Ellis says. Former deputy New South Wales premier John Barilaro has entered a not guilty plea to assault and malicious damage after an alleged altercation with a Channel Seven camera operator in July. In a brief hearing at Manly local court on Wednesday morning, at which Barilaro was not required to appear, his lawyer, Danny Eid, entered a not guilty plea on his behalf. Barilaro was charged with assault and malicious damage following an alleged run-in with the cameraman, Matt Costello, at Manly on 23 July. Outside court on Wednesday Eid said Barilaro would “definitely” be defending the charges. He said: We’re not laying low on this one. Despite reports Barilaro also faced a civil suit brought by Costello over the alleged damage of his camera equipment, no case has yet been brought, and Eid said he was “not aware of any civil proceedings”. The case is due to return to the court early next year. Australian leaders pay tribute to Bali bombing victims and survivors The minister for Indigenous Australians, Linda Burney, will say in a major speech tonight that opponents of a voice to parliament will make “false claims” and peddle misinformation ahead of the referendum on a voice to parliament. Speaking about the voice to parliament and why it matters to Australians, Burney will use a keynote speech to the 25th anniversary dinner of Australians for Native Title and Reconciliation to outline the steps ahead for enshrining the voice in the constitution in this term of government, including proposed changes to the Referendum Machinery Act. Burney said she is often asked what the voice is, and that fundamentally it “means consulting with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people about the matters that affect us”. It’s a once in a generation opportunity to create lasting change Burney said there was already misinformation about the voice in the media, pointing to “myths” that it will operate as a third chamber to parliament and have veto powers. Let me warn you, our opponents will make more false claims about the voice to parliament as we get closer to the referendum. Burney will also say that the referendum working group and referendum engagement group, made up of more than 60 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, will meet again in late October in Canberra to consider changes to the Referendum Machinery Act 1984 and the wording of the question that will be put to the Australian people. The act needs changing to “modernise how we conduct referendums in this country”, she will say, with the law pre-dating the internet age, and including provisions for written pamphlets for each side of the campaign. Burney will say the critical question to answer is “why” the voice is needed, pointing to the omission of Indigenous Australians in the constitution as something that can not be accepted. The constitution is our founding document, the rule book for how we are governed, and since its inception in 1901 it has not included Indigenous Australians. Despite inhabiting this land for more than sixty thousand years – we have no place in the constitution. It’s like we never existed. Never mattered. Never counted. Unfairness and discrimination was built into our systems – that’s how they were designed. The voice to parliament will mean that governments of all persuasions will need to consult and listen to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people on the issues that affect them. I want to take this country forward – opponents of the voice want to hold Australia back. Teachers around New South Wales are today protesting against the state government’s plans for a new three-year award, which they say amounts to a tangible wage cut. In a statement released this morning, the NSW Teachers Federation president, Angelo Gavrielatos, said the government wants to secure pay increases of 2.53% a year at the Industrial Relations Commission. However, the new award would be “far below” the rate of inflation running at around 6%. Gavrielatos pointed to a NSW upper house committee survey that showed 60% of teachers want to leave in the next five years because of the “crippling workload” combined with uncompetitive salaries. Water market reforms broadly supported While the federal government will introduce legislation and a mandatory code of conduct to deliver integrity safeguards, the states will still maintain some responsibility and will need to take action to ensure transparency. Daryl Quinlivan said that in his consultations with basin states, the advisory group and affected stakeholders, the reforms were broadly supported, despite the adjustments that will be needed. As part of the reforms the Bureau of Meteorology will design new data standards and a new national water data hub and website, which will automatically capture, transfer, and publish existing and new data to improve transparency and inform trade-related decisions in water markets. The inspector general of water compliance will take on responsibility for the regulation of water market data. The federal water minister, Tanya Plibersek, said on Tuesday: We want to ensure that the markets are fair for buyers and sellers, that there is clear information, and that water is going where it should be – that the market is not dominated by speculators buying up water in the hope of making a quick buck. The water market reforms are likely to be the least controversial of the agenda items at the meeting, which will also be discussing the future of the Murray-Darling Basin plan and the likely failure of NSW and Victoria to meet their obligations. Federal takeover of water trading markets Unlike Australia’s financial markets, water markets, which trade about $2bn of water entitlements each year, are poorly regulated and lack the features that make comparable trading markets work effectively and transparently. For example, unlike in financial markets, there is no regulation around broker behaviour, insider trading, no prohibitions against market misconduct, and few reporting obligations. This lack of regulation, transparency and data means that farmers and irrigators are unable to be sure that they are dealing with brokers who are acting in their best interests. There are also few penalties for bad behaviour. A report by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission identified failings in the market in 2020 and suggested a federal takeover of water markets. The government then asked Daryl Quinlivan to design a roadmap to implement the findings. Water trading markets will be pulled into line with the standards of other financial markets after the federal government committed to reforms designed to ensure greater transparency, better broker behaviour and fairer markets. The federal water minister, Tanya Plibersek , said she had agreed to all 23 recommendations of former bureaucrat Daryl Quinlivan, and will seek the support of states and territories to implement the shared recommendations at the Murray-Darling Basin ministerial council meeting today. Victoria and NSW prepare for heavy rainfall The New South Wales Bureau of Meteorology says Thursday will be the day of heaviest rainfall over a wet next four days, which will see renewed river rises. Victoria’s emergency management commissioner, Andrew Crisp, has warned Victorians, particularly north of the divide, to prepare for the deluge. Government ministers will today be commemorating the Bali bombings at different services across the country for the 20th anniversary of the terrorist attacks. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, will attend a service at Coogee in Sydney, while the minister for foreign affairs, Senator Penny Wong, will host a memorial service at Parliament House in Canberra. In Canberra, victims’ families, survivors and first responders will be joined by the governor general, David Hurley, and John Howard, who was the prime minister at the time of the attacks. The assistant minister for foreign affairs, Tim Watts, will attend a commemorative ceremony at the Australian consulate general in Bali. In a joint statement, Albanese, Wong and Watts said: We recommit to the ongoing work shared by Australia and Indonesia to counter the scourge of violent extremism, and reaffirm the respect and cooperation between our peoples. The attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, has also paid tribute to the 88 Australians and 38 Indonesians were among the 202 people murdered, as well as the many who survived and still live with the scars of those bombs. ‘We renew our resolve to thwart acts of terrorism’, Peter Dutton says The leader of the opposition, Peter Dutton, has released a statement paying tribute to the victims of the Bali bombings on 12 October 2002, the largest loss of Australian lives from a single terrorist attack. As well as remembering the victims, Dutton highlighted the role played by Australian health professionals, police, the department of foreign affairs and the defence force. As a place of holidaying became hell, strangers of all nationalities helped care for the wounded and transport them to Indonesian hospitals. Australians in the AFP, Dfat and the ADF provided support on the ground and from home, working hand-in-hand with their Indonesian counterparts. Doctors and nurses in Australian hospitals, especially in Darwin and Perth, worked heroically around the clock to treat patients and conduct life-saving procedures. Those darkest hours forged new collaborations and enduring friendships. To the families who lost loved ones, and to the survivors of the Bali bombings: Most Australians will never be able to comprehend what you have gone through, what you are going through today, and what you will endure for the rest of your lives. But we are inspired by how you have lived your lives in spite of your suffering, your loss and your heartbreak. Every day of endurance is a magnificent blow to an odious ideology. Every year of courage is the confident roar of freedom in defiance of cowardly evil. And every decade of achievement is a triumph over terrorism. On this 20th Anniversary of the Bali Bombings, through remembrance we pay our respects to those Australians who tragically lost their lives. Through commemoration we commit to never forgetting this national tragedy. And through tribute we renew our resolve to thwart acts of terrorism whatever form they take. Training Ukraine troops would take place ‘outside of Ukraine in Europe’: Albanese As mentioned earlier on the blog, the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has spoken with Ukraine’s leader, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, overnight. Ukraine’s president urged Australia to provide more security assistance to his country, including a request Australians help train Ukrainian soldiers. Albanese told ABC News Breakfast: Well, the suggestion isn’t going into Ukraine. The suggestion is whether Australians could provide support for training outside of Ukraine in Europe, and we’ll give consideration to that as we’ll give consideration to the other requests. President Zelenskiy asked for me to convey the thanks of him and the Ukrainian people for the Australian bush masters, for the other support that Australia has given up to now. New Australia Tourism campaign draws on tradition of g’day-themed ads The tourism and trade minister, Don Farrell, earlier told ABC Radio that Tourism Australia’s new mascot, Ruby the Roo, is “the new Paul Hogan”. I’m not sure how Hogan would feel about being compared to a computer generated kangaroo, but Farrell might have been drawing on the fact the two ads use the same g’day tagline. Hogan urged tourists to “come and say g’day” – though it was the “shrimp on the barbie” line that stuck, of course. US security expert says chances of Putin using nuclear weapon are “small” During his visit to Canberra, the chief executive of the Washington-based thinktank the Center for a New American Security, Richard Fontaine, weighed in on the US president, Joe Biden’s recent comments that the world could face “Armageddon” if Russia’s Vladimir Putin uses a tactical nuclear weapon to try to win the war in Ukraine. Biden said last week that Putin was “not joking when he talks about potential use of tactical nuclear weapons or biological or chemical weapons because his military is, you might say, significantly underperforming”. Fontaine said: I seriously doubt that anybody handed the president a set of written talking points that had the word Armageddon on it. On the other hand, there is very grave concern about the rattling of the nuclear sabre, because the chances, I think, of Russia using even a tactical nuclear weapon are small, but they’re higher than they were. And they’re probably higher than any time since 1962 with the [Cuban] missile crisis. The use of nuclear weapons is one of these low probability, extremely high consequence events. So even if the probability is relatively small, the consequences would be so grave. If they were to do this, we would wake up in a different world the next day. A former senior US national security official says Washington would welcome a move by Australia to help train Ukrainian troops. The defence minister, Richard Marles, said yesterday that training Ukraine’s military forces was “one option that’s on the table” for further Australian support – effectively repeating comments he made more than a month ago during a visit to the UK. In an exisiting operation conducted in the UK, a number of nations including New Zealand are assisting with training. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, said if there were to be a training mission it would not involve Australian troops going into Ukrainian territory. Dutton said the Coalition would support Australian trainers going to “adjoining or adjacent countries or third countries otherwise, where we could deliver assistance to Ukraine soldiers and to those on the ground to help them get the most out of the equipment that we are delivering to try and keep people safe in that part of the world”. The chief executive officer of the influential Washington-based thinktank the Center for a New American Security, Richard Fontaine, said during a visit to Canberra that further Australian contributions “would be welcomed in a significant way”. Fontaine is a former foreign policy advisor to the late Republican senator John McCain and has worked at the State Department, the National Security Council and on the staff of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Asked whether Washington would welcome Australia stepping up in into the role of training Ukrainian troops, Fontaine said: Yes, absolutely. Every country really has a dog in this fight, because what we’re talking about here is a violation of the fundamental rules of international order, the cardinal element of which is the prohibition against territorial conquest by force. And that’s exactly what we’re seeing here. Tourism Australia says new brand ambassador will help country ‘stand out’ The new Tourism Australia’s global campaign ‘Come and Say G’day’ has been unveiled to the world on a major digital billboard in Tokyo, kick-starting a world tour introducing the new brand ambassador, CGI kangaroo Ruby the Roo. Tourism Australia’s managing director, Phillipa Harrison, said the new campaign will support the tourism industry as it rebuilds post-pandemic by “converting the pent-up demand for an Australian holiday.” We know that Australia consistently ranks high on people’s consideration list but we need to get travellers to take that critical next step and book their holiday to Australia to experience everything we have to offer. Harrison said this new instalment of Tourism Australia’s “There’s Nothing Like Australia” global brand platform “will cut through and make Australia stand out today and in the long term”. Tourism Australia’s chief marketing officer, Susan Coghill, said the campaign will remind travellers of Australia’s iconic destinations and friendly faces. Why a CGI kangaroo? The use of an animated character in Ruby was a deliberate move that aims to cut through the clutter of destination marketing internationally and it is backed by research. In Australia, we’re so lucky to have a globally recognisable and adorable icon in the kangaroo and to bring that to life through CGI animation creates a uniquely Australian brand ambassador in Ruby, who translates across both English and non-English speaking countries. If it’s looking familiar, there is a passing resemblance to this classic tourism campaign from the 1980’s “G’day from WA”. A computer generated kangaroo is following in the footsteps of Paul Hogan, Lara Bingle and Chris Hemsworth. Ruby the Roo, voiced by actor Rose Byrne, has been unveiled as Australia’s new tourism mascot. The trade and tourism minister, Don Farrell, is speaking to ABC Radio about the news: Ruby the roo is, if you like, the new Paul Hogan. We have in the past had very, very successful campaigns to attract overseas tourists to Australia. We now need to do that again. Farrell is speaking from Japan, where he says Ruby is already featuring on billboards in the country newly opened up to tourists but that the “full official launch” will be in New York next week. Farrell says the price for US tourists coming to Australia remains a barrier, but is one of a “combination of issues” seeing less tourists from America. Angela Lansbury dies aged 96 Former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull has paid tribute to his cousin Angela Lansbury after the beloved stage and screen actress died, aged 96. The Australian defence force does not have the capacity to rapidly deploy its planned new infantry fighting vehicle to overseas conflicts, a report warns. The army wants to acquire up to 450 infantry fighting vehicles at a total cost probably between $18bn and $27bn. The government is expected to decide in coming months between proposals from German contractor Rheinmetall and South Korean contractor Hanwha. Dr Albert Palazzo, an adjunct professor at the University of New South Wales Canberra and formerly a director of war studies for the Australian Army, looks at the project in a report published by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute today. He says the government faces “a big decision” on the project – known as LAND 400 Phase 3 – because the vehicle chosen and the number purchased “will affect the combat capability of the army for a generation”. The project aims to replace the army’s fleet of ageing light armoured vehicles, including the M113 armoured personnel carrier. The army has used the M113 since 1965 – including in the Vietnam war – but this older vehicle is now “hopelessly obsolete for contemporary combat conditions”, the report says. Palazzo raises broader logistical challenges associated with the project. He says the ADF “lacks significant sea and air lift with which to deploy the army” and it may need to obtain additional capacity from hired commercial vessels or from the US. But there’s no guarantee that the US will be able to meet such a request because it will naturally meet its own needs first ... To guarantee the availability of shipping, one option would be for Australia to create a national fleet of merchant ships suitable for conversion to military use and at call for government service. The ships would be available for take-up by the government, as was done in the two world wars and the Vietnam War. It’s hard for a defence force to predict how it will fight in the future, because a nation never knows the kind of war it will face. Wars come in a multitude of forms with many levels of intensity and danger, ranging from the risk of nuclear annihilation to wars such as those fought in Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq. What’s consistent is that no one ever gets the war they want or expect. Those who believe that Australia will never need to fight a major war against a peer competitor are likely to be wrong; no one would want a resumption of the Korean War, but the potential for the conflict’s resumption can’t be ignored. Budget to see spending cuts some could consider ‘risky’, Albanese says On ABC radio RN, Anthony Albanese says there will be spending cuts in the budget and concedes that some, as the treasurer said yesterday, could be considered “risky”. He said: Well, of course any cut is a risky decision and there will be spending cuts in the budget. It will be a responsible budget. As we’ve consistently said we’ve gone through line by line in order to ensure that what you don’t need at this time is monetary policy and fiscal policy working against each other. And and that’s why in the inflationary period, which is a global inflationary period that we’re seeing we’ve seen the fastest synchronised tightening of monetary policy that we’ve seen from central banks in decades. And that of course, is is a response to those international circumstances and the Australian government has to respond to that as well in a way that’s consistent. Australians more conscious of terrorism threat after Bali bombings – PM October 12 is the 20th anniversary of the Bali bombings, an event Anthony Albanese said made Australians much more conscious of the threat of terrorism. He said: The ache hasn’t dimmed from that 20 years on. Albanese told Patricia Karvelas the “nature of the threat has changed but the need to be diligent has not”. There are still of course, threats from the terrorist organisations that you’ve named but there are so many others offshoots and we see a rise as well of the individual act. Getting information online putting together weapons and carrying out these cowardly attacks against humanity. What has occurred over the 20 years is that our security agencies really have done a remarkable job to keep us safe. Albanese sends condolences to Ukraine in overnight meeting with president The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, spoke with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, overnight in what he said was a “very good discussion”. There have been reports Australia could help train Ukrainian soldiers. Albanese did not confirm that but said Australia is considering “all requests”. I conveyed to him but the condolences of the Australian people for the quite horrific actions that were taken against civilian targets by Russian forces in recent days. And I also conveyed to him our ongoing commitment to give every support that we can to Ukraine will give consideration to all requests that are made. This is a struggle not just about Ukraine and its sovereign borders. This is a struggle about the international rule of law, about whether it is respected. And that is why the struggle of the Ukrainian people is so inspirational against a much larger country with a much larger military, but they are determined to defend their nation and they are making great sacrifice to do so. And that’s why democracies both in Nato and outside of Nato are providing training. On the request for additional Bushmasters, the armoured vehicles Ukraine forces have been using as part of their defences against Russian invaders, Albanese said a decision would be made in the coming days. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has spoken with the president of the Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, overnight. Albanese did not confirm reports Australia could help train Ukrainian soldiers, but said Australia is considering “all requests” on ABC Radio this morning. The request is about training and we’ll give consideration to that and make an announcement at an appropriate time. The prime minister also paid tribute on the 20-year anniversary of the Bali bombings, ahead of attending a memorial service in Sydney. He said the attack’s shockwaves “reached our shores” making Australians more conscious of the threat of terror. Commemorations will be held in Bali, Canberra and Perth, as well as other memorial services around the country. Water ministers will meet in Canberra today to finalise the Murray-Darling Basin plan where it is expected that South Australia will call on the government to buy back water. More data from the 2021 census was released today. Taken during the pandemic, the second release of its results showed more Australians were working from home. You can read about some of the other more surprising trends to emerge from my colleague Caitlin Cassidy here: A new report from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute warns the Australian defence force does not have the capacity to rapidly deploy its planned new infantry fighting vehicle to overseas conflicts, suggesting our country may need its own fleet of merchant ships. My colleague Daniel Hurst will bring you more on that shortly.

I have an update on today’s shark attack from AAP: A man’s arm was almost severed when he was attacked by a shark while spearfishing off the Pilbara coast in Western Australia. Paramedics were called to Port Hedland on Friday to treat the man aged in his 30s, who sustained serious injuries. He was taken to shore by boat and an ambulance rushed him to Hedland Health Campus under priority one conditions. Fisheries officials said the man had been bitten after spearing a fish, but the species of the shark was unknown. A Royal Flying Doctor Service spokeswoman said the man had sustained multiple injuries and his left arm had “nearly been severed”. A crew will be dispatched from Meekatharra to collect the man in Port Hedland. He is expected to arrive in Perth for treatment on Friday evening. The WA Country Health Service said the man was in a stable condition at the Hedland hospital. NT bans use of ‘inhumane and dangerous’ spithoods on youths in police custody From AAP: The announcement on Friday has divided opinion while bringing the NT into line with other Australian jurisdictions. NT minister for police Kate Worden said the hoods would continue to be used on adults in watchhouses when required and police would adopt a safer version of the device. The NT Council of Social Services said it was a step in the right direction but the change needed to be legislated for children and adults. “It is an inhumane and dangerous practice,” chief executive Deborah Di Natale said. The Aboriginal Medical Services Alliance Northern Territory agreed the ban needed to be legislated and said it should be extended to cover people in custody and detention. “There is no place for the use of spithoods in a modern justice and corrections system, full stop,” chief executive John Paterson said. Opposition leader Lia Finocchiaro said the ban would lead to more police being spat on while on duty. “It is a dark day for our police and another win for the lobby groups and criminals,” she said. Walkley Foundation appoints counsel to advise on award for Andrew Laming story The Walkley Foundation has appointed William Houghton KC to provide independent legal advice about the status of the 2021 Walkley award for TV news which was awarded to Channel Nine journalists Peter Fegan and Rebeka Powell. The story, about the former MP Andrew Laming, has been the subject of legal action by the ex-Liberal/National politician, who has reached a confidential settlement in a defamation case he brought against Nine over a broadcast in March last year. Nine Entertainment agreed to pay Laming an undisclosed amount and apologise for the story on Nine News Queensland which falsely accused him of taking an “upskirting” photograph of a woman while she was on her knees stacking a bar fridge. “The Walkley Foundation considers that there are particular circumstances to be considered in respect of this award and subsequent litigation concerning one of the reports. Interested parties in relation to this particular award have been invited to provide materials in respect of whether the award should be revoked, annulled or there should be some other outcome,” it said in a statement on Friday. Money from fuel subsidies could be used to install more than 72,000 electric vehicle charging stations, Climate Council says From AAP: With the federal budget two weeks away, the Climate Council is calling on the Albanese government to replace $11.6 billion spent on fossil fuel subsidies with “structural” environmentally friendly investments that could lower costs for households. In a report released on Friday, the Climate Council says the government could use money from fuel subsidies to install more than 72,000 electric vehicle charging stations – one for every 12 kilometres of road – or install solar panels to power 1.5 million low-income households. Climate Council advocacy head Dr Jennifer Rayner said the organisation based its figures on fossil fuel subsidies paid in the 2021-2022 financial year and five projects it considered “better bets”. In addition to solar panels and EV charging stations, Dr Rayner said the funds could be used to replace all diesel buses in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane, create 138 renewable energy storage facilities similar to Victoria’s Big Battery in Geelong, or fund another 15 pumped hydro projects to shore up the energy grid. Dr Rayner said each of the projects was environmentally friendly and some would offer cost savings to households under financial pressure. “If we’re giving solar panels to lower-income families, that’s going to help with their bills and reduce the cost of living,” she said. “This is an opportunity to make big structural changes.” Richard Marles: Australia’s focus is on delivering ‘current contribution’ of military supplies to Ukraine The Albanese government says it is considering further ways to support to Ukraine “over the long term” but its current focus is on delivering the military supplies it has already promised. Guardian Australia understands an announcement about another round of defence support is not imminent. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, told the Lowy Institute last night he was “very grateful” that Australia was preparing “a significant package” that would include “not only small arms but some heavy weapons as well”. When asked today about the issue, a spokesperson for the deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, said: Whilst Ukraine is a long way from Australia, we are committed to protecting the rules-based order. At the moment the Australian government is committed to delivering on its current contribution to Ukraine, including 60 Bushmasters and 28 M113AS4s Armoured Vehicles. Work across government is continuing to look at how Australia can best provide support to Ukraine over the long term. It is understood the majority of the promised Bushmasters have arrived in Ukraine, but officials are not revealing the exact numbers for operational security reasons and some of them have not reached the country yet. Deliveries of the other armoured vehicles are also ongoing. The opposition’s defence spokesperson, Andrew Hastie, said lives depended on the assistance arriving quickly: Russia’s illegal and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine is a bloody and brutal reminder of the threats to peace and prosperity posed by desperate authoritarian regimes like Russia ... In government, we responded quickly and strongly to Ukraine’s requests for assistance – Mr Marles has for some time foreshadowed additional assistance for Ukraine, what is holding up this assistance? This government and Mr Marles must confirm today what this assistance will look like and when it will be delivered – lives depend on it. AAP reports some suburbs received 30 millimetres of rain in as little as 20 minutes on Friday. As of 4.30pm, authorities were concerned about two dams in Craigieburn in the city’s north, with fears a large private dam could collapse and affect local roads. There were also moderate flood warnings for the Murray River downstream of the Hume Dam in the state’s north and the Loddon River at Laanecoorie, near Bendigo. Authorities are bracing for major flooding on Saturday along the Avoca River at Charleton, north-west of Bendigo. The Friday deluge followed a night of wild weather, with the SES receiving more than 600 calls for help in 24 hours. The Avoca and Maryborough areas in regional Victoria received 50 to 65mm in an hour, which is roughly one month’s worth of rain. Areas around Frankston, Bayside, Woodend and the Maryborough district were also hard-hit. Kyle Sandilands apologises for slurs Radio announcer Kyle Sandilands and radio network ARN have apologised for comments made by the presenter on his leading FM breakfast program, which included the slur “spazzes”. “ARN does not endorse or condone the comments made by Kyle Sandilands, nor the language that was used or the context with which it was spoken during a segment broadcast on Thursday 29th September,” the network said on Friday. Campers in for a wet weekend at Bathurst 1000 Campers at the Bathurst 1000 are bracing for muddy, stormy and potentially dangerous conditions as a large rain band crosses central and eastern NSW, AAP has reported. A trough and cold front moved across the state on Friday, bringing further widespread rain to the eastern half of NSW, including the western slopes and ranges, central NSW and the south coast. The weather bureau has placed many eastern catchments on flood watch, including Hunter and the Greater Sydney regions, as it waits to see exactly where the most intense rainfall occurs. “Behind the rain band, there is a lot of convection which means we’re getting some really decent thunderstorms,” a bureau spokesperson told AAP on Friday. Up to 100mm of rain could fall at motorsport mecca Mount Panorama over the weekend, potentially leading to flooding along the Macquarie River in Bathurst. Man fined for destroying trees on NT sacred site A NT court has fined a man $32,000 after he backed his truck into dozens of trees in a sacred site as part of road works in remote Arnhem Land. On September 10, 2020, William Hayes was working near Mount Catt as part of his company Hayes Enterprises (NT) Pty Ltd when he drove a front-end loader onto Aboriginal Land Trust land and knocked down more than 60 trees inside a sacred ceremonial site. Hayes pleaded guilty to conducting the works without approval under the NT Aboriginal Sacred Sites legislation. Dr Sophie Creighton, A/CEO of the Aboriginal Areas Protection Authority (AAPA) said landholders can not “recklessly” clear country. “The immense suffering and harm done here could have been avoided. Pastoralists need to listen, and to work with custodians to protect these cultural places of national significance.” Senior custodian Kenny Murray said in the statement by AAPA that he welcomed the conviction but the damage is irreparable. The site is a culturally sacred ceremonial ground for the Gunapipi peoples and holds special meaning for many people connected across Arnhem Land. “The damage that has been done to our trees, it is like physical harm to our family because the spirits of our elders are in those trees,” Murray said. Not sated by his tilt at AGL (see earlier post), Mike Cannon-Brookes has added another renewable-energy feather to his hat (or is it baseball cap?). Already a “cornerstone” investor in Sun Cable, the company planning to build giant solar farms in the desert to power Darwin and Singapore (and possibly Indonesia) via a giant cable, MCB has now taken on the role of a director and inaugural chair. Sun Cable’s projects could be worth as much as $30bn, and investors such as MCB have already agreed to tip in at least $210m. Not just whimsy, in other words. “Mike is a visionary leader whose demonstrated passion and commitment for the energy transition strongly aligns with Sun Cable’s mission,” said David Griffin, founder and CEO of Sun Cable. MCB is similarly upbeat as you might expect, referring to the main PowerLink project as “world-scale infrastructure”. “It will unlock incredible value for all countries involved, work to decarbonise three major economies and transform how giga-scale solar energy gets built,” he said. Just over a week after AGL announced it was bowing to demands from investors by bringing forward the closure date of its coal-fired power station in Victoria, another battle is brewing with the company’s biggest shareholder Mike Cannon-Brookes. The Atlassian billionaire has amassed an 11.3% stake in Australia’s largest electricity generator and last month issued through his family company, Grok Ventures, a list of the four directors he wanted added to AGL’s board. Since the board has five members now (surprisingly few for a firm so big), accepting MCB’s Fab Four potentially would have given him control. One of the current five, Miles George, is seen as particularly renewables friendly for this past role as head of Infigen Energy, a windfarm operator. Anyway, AGL has rejected that three of the proposed members, telling shareholders today it would only recommend Mark Twidell, a solar veteran whose roles have included a stint with Tesla, for the board. Adding all four “would not add to the overall effectiveness of the board”, it said. Since the board can only have a maximum of ten members, taking on all of MCB’s picks could also limit AGL’s ability to lure talent with “priority skills”, AGL said. Those overlooked are Kerry Schott, the industry veteran who until recently chaired the Energy Security Board, as well as John Pollaers and Christine Holman. Not surprisingly, Grok isn’t impressed and plans to engage “directly” with AGL’s 150,000 shareholders in the lead up to its 15 November Annual General Meeting “to explain the merits of looking to fresh faces to provide a broader mix of skills and experience - as well as additional capabilities to undertake the monumental amount of work required by the board”. “It makes no sense to us – or a growing list of shareholders – that the board is rejecting highly qualified, independent directors who are committed to helping them make AGL the leading green gentailer in the world,” Grok said. Somewhat ominously, Grok said the rejection was “yet another poor decision that doesn’t seem to be rooted in logical business decisions and certainly ignores the threats and opportunities facing AGL”, adding to previous comments that it had “reservations” about the appointment of Patricia McKenzie as AGL’s chair. AGL’s share price, meanwhile, was down almost 3% for the day in late trading compared with a 0.5% decline in the benchmark ASX200 index. I have a bit more information for you on the shark attack in WA here: Guardian Photographer Ellen Smith was just down at Dights Falls in Melbourne and, oh boy, look at these pics! Australian athlete Georgia O’Callaghan was down there too, having some serious fun: The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has left the door open to potentially amending the already legislated stage-three tax cuts, not expressly ruling out making any changes when asked point-blank if reforms could be considered. Treasurer Jim Chalmers also said his upcoming federal budget would be about “following the responsible path; not the path of least resistance”, as the Coalition braces for a fight if the government looks to tinker with the Morrison-era tax changes. Albanese has kept a low media profile this week as debate raged publicly and privately inside the government on the $244 billion stage-three changes, which will go to taxpayers earning over $45,000 but will overwhelmingly benefit those on higher incomes. After just one solitary radio interview since last Friday (when he was asked about cricket and Midnight Oil, not the news), Albanese told a brief press conference that the government’s view hasn’t changed. “There’s been meetings, obviously, this week about [the expenditure review committee] and our processes. We’ll continue to get on with making sure that we deliver a budget that is responsible, that acknowledges the pressures that are on it,” Albanese said, when asked about the tax debate. When asked if he would guarantee no changes to the stage-three tax cuts, the PM responded: “what I have said is that the Government has not changed our position.” He did not rule out making changes in future. In a speech in Brisbane, Chalmers said the government would “have to make some difficult decisions with this budget. Difficult decisions for difficult times.” He didn’t speak specifically about tax cuts, but said the government would make “the right calls for the right reasons... We must be serious about rebuilding our budget buffers – particularly given the deteriorating global outlook.” There are concerns a private dam in Melbourne may burst, with the road currently closed between Greenvale and Craigieburn. The Department of Transport’s Chris Miller told 3AW that the SES and police were on the scene. “The concern is that the bank will actually burst and obviously if that gives way, huge amounts of water will come out,” he said. Unconfirmed reports of shark attack in WA Emergency services are attending to an incident at Port Hedland, in Western Australia, that has been reported - although not confirmed – to involve a shark. Details are scant at this stage but emergency services confirmed to Guardian Australia that the person involved is alive. Multiple agencies are on the scene. Experts from WA’s Department of Primary Industries are investigating the incident and if it is confirmed to be shark-related, will issue a “shark watch” alert as soon as possible. Victorian emergency services received 600 requests for assistance A member of the Victorian SES (who was not introduced by name) has said they have received 600 requests for assistance: With that rainfall that we’ve seen in the storms overnight, SES volunteers and our emergency services have now responded to over 600 requests for assistance. Some of the busiest areas for that has been around Frankston and the bayside suburbs, also across Woodend and the Maryborough districts. Over 330 of those have related to flash flooding impacts or leaking roofs and the like. We had over 120 requests for assistance representing to building damage associated with some of the damaging winds with those storms and thunderstorms and we have seen a further 100 requests for assistance for trees down. He says they have seen people drive through floodwaters: We know the single largest death or cause of death in flooding is people attempting to drive through floodwaters. In the last 24 hours, we have seen 15 people attempt to drive through floodwaters both here in metropolitan areas and also in the areas of Maryborough… and the like. Again, we can’t appeal enough to people that driving through floodwaters could be the last decision you make. We are just heading to Victoria where authorities are giving an update about the weather Hello everyone this is Cait Kelly, before we get going – a big thank you to Natasha for her great work this morning taking us through all of the headlines. First up, I have this important story from Lisa Cox: I leave you now in the very excellent hands of Cait Kelly, so I can watch Fat Bear Week’s livestream unfettered by political pressers. Huge lineup of contenders for Fat Bear Week In exactly the news Australians needed following those grim economic predictions from the treasurer, Fat Bear Week is under way with the lineup of contenders confirmed. Each year, Alaska’s Katmai National Park celebrates how well its brown bears have packed on the weight ahead of winter hibernation, with fans invited to vote for which bear “is the fattest of the fat”. I will be backing Bear 164, a small adult male because I can’t resist an underdog – or underbear as the case may be. Katmai National Park says that, “instead of competing for established fishing spots like most bears, 164 invented his own”. You can check out who the contenders and find out a bit about each bear’s biography here, and see them in action hunting and catching pink salmon around Brooks River and Falls thanks to the park’s live stream. Treasurer announces series of investor roundtables, starting with social and affordable housing The treasurer Jim Chalmers is delivering that speech which Guardian Australia’s chief political correspondent, Sarah Martin, previewed on the blog earlier this morning. Further to outlining the five biggest pressures on the budget (interest payments on servicing government debt, aged care, disability care, hospitals and defence) he has also announced the government will host a series of investor roundtables. Today, I can announce that the government will host a series of investor roundtables from November 2022 to September 2023. Each one – held every three to four months – will focus on a different area of national priority investment. The first, in November, will address social and affordable housing. To make sure our conversations are targeted, productive and have a degree of continuity, the roundtables will have twenty core participants. They include the CEOs of our big four banks, along with the heads of some of our largest superannuation and investment funds. Participants in the roundtables represent institutional investors, including super funds, with over $2 trillion in assets under management. And all participants have the smarts, insight, and diverse range of experiences, to make these roundtables a success. Cars skidding off wet track as Bathurst 1000 goes ahead despite flooding The Bathurst 1000 supercars event is going ahead today despite the town in central west NSW being one of the worst affected by flooding from the intense weather system moving across the east of the country. Up to 100mm of rain could fall at Mount Panorama over the weekend, potentially leading to flooding along the Macquarie River in Bathurst. Event organisers released a statement yesterday saying the event would go ahead as normal despite conditions. Today, footage from the event shows cars sliding off a very wet track. - with AAP Despite speculation the government could be considering scrapping the stage-three tax cuts in its upcoming October budget, Albanese and Chalmers, in respective press conferences in Sydney and Brisbane, say the government hasn’t changed its position. Just circling back to Albanese’s presser, here’s what the prime minister had to say. Reporter: The Opposition has accused you of going missing on the issue of tax cuts this week. Could you clarify once and for all whether you plan on seeking to amend the stage-three tax cuts? Albanese: The Government hasn’t changed our position … and I’ve been out and about this week. This weekend, I’ll be in Western Australia. I’m here in western Sydney today. It appears that the Opposition haven’t got quite the memo. They’re still looking for areas of disagreement, of playing the old politics. What we’ve been about is development, there’s been meetings obviously this week about ERC and our processes. We’ll continue to get on with making sure that we deliver a budget that is responsible, that acknowledges the pressures that are on. Reporter: Is that a guarantee there will be no changes to the stage-three tax cuts? Albanese: That is exactly what I have said is that the Government has not changed our position. Football Australia has handed a life ban to a second Sydney United 58 fan who was caught performing “a fascist salute or similar gesture” during their Australia Cup final loss to Macarthur FC last Saturday night. National Premier Leagues NSW side United were the first second-tier outfit to reach the knockout competition’s decider, but the achievement was overshadowed by the behaviour of a section of supporters, who performed Nazi salutes and chanted songs with fascist links. Some also booed through the Welcome to Country. It comes two days after FA gave a life ban to another fan for the same offence. Both are now banned from attending any matches sanctioned by FA, including NPL, A-Leagues, Australia Cup and national team matches. “The ban is effective immediately,” the governing body said in a statement. “As with the first ban issued by Football Australia on Wednesday, the conduct in question relates to a fascist salute or similar gesture conducted during the match and captured on the host broadcast.” FA also expects to receive submissions from United on Friday in relation to a show-cause notice issued because of crowd behaviour during the Cup final. It’s official - the Covid pandemic is ending in Victoria. Kind of. Victoria’s premier, Daniel Andrews, on Friday has confirmed the state’s pandemic declaration will end at 11.59pm on 12 October. This is in line with national cabinet’s decision to end Covid-19 isolation from October 14. Andrews said in a statement: Victorians have done an amazing job over the last three years – and this new framework will give people the choice to do what is right for them and their community following the unanimous decision taken at national cabinet. We’re making sure there are still requirements in place to protect our dedicated healthcare workers and vulnerable Victorians in high-risk settings like aged care, disability settings and hospitals Victorians will no longer be required to isolate after testing positive to Covid-19 but isolation is strongly recommended. Some healthcare workers, aged care and disability care workers will continue to be required to isolate if they test positive to Covid-19 and will be financially supported by the government to do so. The department of health will also issue directions to ensure healthcare workers are vaccinated against Covid-19. These directions – which are already used each year to require healthcare staff to be vaccinated against the flu – will allow for vaccination requirements in public, denominational and private hospitals, as well as public sector aged care facilities, day procedure centres and throughout ambulance service. Powers also exist under OH&amp;S laws to require vaccinations for people in workplaces. ‘We don’t need more development on flood plains’: Albanese We’re going back to Albanese in Sydney where the prime minister is holding a media conference after delivering his speech. He’s fielded a question about the Warragamba Dam. Reporter: Premier Perrottet said that he wants to raise it and says that it is a critical state infrastructure project. Do you consider that a waste of money if developments don’t start in the first place? Albanese: Quite clearly, we don’t need more development on the flood plains or indeed, in flood plains in general. It makes no sense to do that. With regard to an economic case, that needs to be made. Melbourne rain leaves two people stranded on car roof We’ve been bringing you news about the wild weather lashing the east of the state. In Melbourne, flash flooding has left two people stranded on the roof of their car under the York Street bridge in South Melbourne. Treasurer thanks retiring APRA chair on behalf of government and community And on Wayne Byres stepping down as chair of the Australian regulation prudential authority (APRA), Chalmers said: I’ve had the opportunity this morning to meet with Wayne Byres, the outgoing chair of the Australian regulation prudential authority. I had the opportunity to thank Wayne for a remarkably long period of dedicated service to the nation as chair of APRA and before that as well. That’s not an easy job, being the chair of APRA, given what the financial system has been through the last couple of decades. But he’s done a really quite remarkable job. We’re very grateful to Wayne Byres for the contribution that he has made over a long period of time now. He’s been supported and appointed by governments of both political persuasion, and he’s decided to move on and to do other things. I really wish him well. And I’m glad I got the opportunity today to thank him. On behalf of myself, but on behalf of the government and on behalf of the broader Australian community as well, for all of that effort and all of that dedication and diligence that he has provided regulating our financial system. ‘Every Australian heart goes out to the parents’ in Thailand: Treasurer I mentioned in that first post Chalmers had paid tribute to the shooting and stabbing in Thailand. These were his words: Can I say about that horrific tragedy in Thailand, how heartbreaking, how heart-wrenching it is to think all of those little kids dropped off at childcare that day who won’t be going home - I think that every Australian heart goes out to the parents, the families and the communities impacted by what is really an unspeakable and unfathomable tragedy. And I know that that community and those families will be going through a horrific time as they contemplate the loss, the thieving of those little souls, and what that means for those who’ve survived it. Treasurer says government hasn’t changed its position on stage-three tax cuts Chalmers is asked: Can you categorically state you may scale back or change those stage-three tax cuts? Treasurer: I’ve been clear throughout the course of the week. We haven’t changed our position on those tax cuts. What I’ve tried to do is to level with the Australian people about the complex combination of challenges that we confront as we put the finishing touches on the budget. And no responsible government can ignore the fact that the risks to the global economy are rising rather than decreasing, the pressures on the budget in a persistent structural way are growing rather than dissipating, and the pressure on household budgets from interest rates is putting on more, not less, pressure. Treasurer says the ‘world economy is a dangerous place right now’ The treasurer Jim Chalmers has begun speaking in Brisbane at an investor event. He begins his speech acknowledging the tragedy in Thailand and thanks Wayne Byres as he steps down as chair of the Australian regulation prudential authority. He moves onto saying there have been “two important developments overnight” as the government finalises its budget to be delivered later this month. Overnight, the IMF managing director has pointed out that the risks of a global recession are intensifying. She has warned against the ongoing damage that would be done by a prolonged recession around the world. We share the IMF managing director’s concerns about the deteriorating global economy. The global economy has deteriorated significantly even over the course of the last few weeks. And that’s been reflected in the increasingly concerned and concerning commentary from the IMF managing director overnight. The world economy is a dangerous place right now. The storm clouds are gathering in the global economy. And no response government could ignore that as they finalise a budget. This morning as well, the Reserve Bank has put out their financial stability report and, in doing so, they have made what I think is an obvious point - and that is that the higher interest rates go, the more they will sting ordinary Australians. Some Australians have a buffer in their personal finances, but many don’t. And so, six consecutive interest rate rises in six months - which began before the election and continued after the election in expected-but-still-difficult ways will, and is, having an impact on the finances of ordinary Australians. The backdrop for the budget that I hand down in less than three weeks’ time will be high inflation and rising interest rates, a deteriorating global economy, and persistent structural pressures on the budget which will not be compensated for by higher commodity prices. And in this environment of high and rising inflation, difficult global economic conditions, and persistent spending pressures, we will put a premium on what is responsible and affordable and sustainable, and best targeted to this complex combination of economic conditions that we confront. Albanese said he was approaching the upcoming budget “responsibly and methodically” and was willing to make difficult decisions that take into account global and domestic challenges. He said: Our priority is an economy that works for people, not the other way around and this is why my colleagues and I are approaching the upcoming budget responsibly and methodically, taking full account of the increasingly uncertain global economic outlook and recognising the long-term fiscal pressures of funding vital programs... as well as the growing costs of servicing a record national debt, when interest rates are rising. We will make sure we do what we can to help families with their cost of living in a way that doesn’t push up inflation or add pressure to demand. We are prepared to make difficult decisions, to get Australia through hard times and to ensure our fiscal policy provides a sustainable path forward in the immediate circumstances, as well as the longer term. There were 2,720 new cases in the weekly reporting period, and three people are in intensive care. There were 7,970 new cases in the weekly reporting period, and two people are in intensive care. PM backs moving SBS to western Sydney The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has thrown his support behind moving multicultural broadcaster SBS to western Sydney in a speech at Accor Stadium on Friday. He said the feasibility study on the move commissioned by the communications minister, Michelle Rowland, would first have to be completed. Speaking at a luncheon hosted by the Western Sydney Leadership Dialogue, he said: We’ll wait and see what the study says but it certainly makes sense for such a fast-growing, multicultural community to be the home of the broadcaster that celebrates and serves Australia’s diversity. It would be an important cultural investment in western Sydney. Migration is about more than skills shortage, prime minister says Albanese says people in western Sydney “instinctively” understand reforming migration is about more than solving skills shortages; it’s about helping people put down roots. Albanese said New Zealand and Australia both closed their borders during the Covid pandemic. But while our neighbours encouraged migrants to stay with supports, Australia encouraged migrants to leave and then “wondered why there’s skills shortages when we wanted to open up the economy again.” ‘Take the politics out of planning’: Albanese The prime minister has also reiterated the importance of better planning for infrastructure projects in western Sydney, including taking into consideration the risks presented by floods and other natural disasters. Albanese said the development of a western Sydney expert panel would help with this. He said: We need to better plan our infrastructure. We need to take flood and other extreme weather events into account when planning infrastructure investments. To guide future decision making and to take the politics out of planning we will establish a western Sydney expert panel to review and report on western Sydney’s infrastructure needs. There were 536 new cases in the weekly reporting period, and one person is in intensive care. Western Sydney airport more than a third complete Albanese says: Western Sydney is the centre of aspiration in this country and we all benefit from it … but we need to get the planning right. Infrastructure isn’t an end in itself, we don’t build for the sake of it. Albanese then brings these remarks back to western Sydney airport, saying it will bring prosperity to a range of sectors, as well as jobs for the population. He says the project’s progress is tracking well – it’s more than a third complete and on time. Albanese said that the airport will be as important as the advent of Western Sydney University. Anthony Albanese speaking in western Sydney The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is giving a speech at the Western Sydney Leadership Dialogue. He says that western Sydney is home to the largest Aboriginal populations in urban Australia and thanks Western Sydney Dialogues for being one of the many organisations backing the constitutionally enshrined Indigenous voice to parliament. Our constitution is our nation’s birth certificate and it is inadequate. Cyber breaches risk weakening banks: RBA The central bank is warning that significant cyber breaches like the one levelled against Optus have the power to send shock waves through Australia’s financial institutions, AAP is reporting. The Reserve Bank of Australia says the threat of further cyber incidents remains high and has the potential to destabilise the financial system by increased fraud. Financial fraud from stolen data could then undermine confidence in banks and the banking system, the RBA says in a report. The recent Optus breach and other large-scale hacks of personal data highlight the need for regulators and financial institutions to continue strengthening their cyber resilience, it says. In response to the Optus breach, the government is moving to reduce red tape on the sharing of information with banks to allow them to implement better safeguards and monitoring systems. The changes, announced on Thursday, would let the telcos temporarily share key information such as driver’s licence, Medicare and passport numbers with financial service firms. Optus would also be able to share identifiers with Commonwealth, state and territory agencies to prevent fraud. The changes are due to be presented to the governor-general on Friday. RBA report sheds light on future prospects for China and climate Two other quick takeaways from the RBA’s report is some pessimism about China’s prospects - important of course for the price of Australian commodity prices (plus, of course, the livelihoods of 1.4bn people). Despite government efforts, “the property sector remains under considerable stress,” the RBA said. This threatens to expose longstanding vulnerabilities affecting local governments, the shadow banking sector and small banks. And just in case you thought the RBA was worried about the here and now: [C]limate change and extreme weather events have the potential to affect economies and societies on a global scale, and thereby present a systemic challenge for private institutions and policymakers,” it said. “Both physical and transition risks could result in large losses for financial institutions that are yet to put in place adequate risk controls and resilience strategies. On second thoughts, given the storms in Victoria today and the worsening flood situation in NSW, perhaps those concerns are about both the here and the now. What will tighter financial conditions mean? The impact, of course, would worsen, along with interest rates. Were the cash rate to increase by another 100bp (as indeed investors are now betting), the share of households forking out at least 30% to repay their mortgage would rise to about one in four, the RBA says. For now, there’s a similar tale of businesses coping with higher rates ... although the construction sector is among those doing it tougher (as indicated by that earlier post about a record rise in material costs). An indication, though, that the squeeze is yet to trigger much of a rise in bankruptcies is that banks have been reducing the amount they are setting aside for bad debt. As for those global conditions, things could “tighten further” the RBA says, not least because of rising inflation, slowing growth, “heightened geopolitical tensions” – and so on. Should that tightening happen, there’s the potential for increased financial stability risks, “including the potential for a disorderly decline in asset prices and for high leverage and liquidity mismatches in some investment funds to amplify strains in global funding markets”. (There’s even one mention of troubled Swiss investment bank, Credit Suisse, which the RBA notes is facing investors wanting more protection against a possible default.) Of course, most Australians are focussed on the home front, and what the RBA thinks about household pain as interest rates rise. For context, they provide this handy chart, which shows where real estate prices are falling - and where they aren’t, yet. Households, companies and banks are generally in a “a strong financial position” as they enter “this more challenging environment”. But resilience is “unevenly distributed”, as you’d expect. The Covid lockdown period allowed some folks to save a lot more and make early payments on their mortgages. About a quarter, though, have little buffer at all. The RBA said: A small number of borrowers have both high debt relative to their income and low saving and equity buffers; these households are particularly vulnerable to shocks. The Bureau of Meteorology is predicting up to 25mm of rain to fall across Melbourne today, with flood warnings issued in parts of Victoria. You can check the warnings here: Rescuers try to free whales caught in QLD shark nets Rescuers are attempting to free two humpback whales entangled in a shark net off a Sunshine Coast beach, AAP has reported. The whales - reportedly a mother and her calf - became trapped in the same net as they made their annual migration south. Humane Society International marine biologist Lawrence Chlebeck said the current migration season had involved about double the number of entanglements seen in previous years. “A mother and calf in the same net, stressed and tangled, is a worst-case scenario,” he said in a statement on Friday. Animal rights groups have previously warned of increased risk as the migrating humpbacks head south with their newborn calves and want the shark nets removed. “The shark nets must be removed in favour of new technological solutions, already successfully trialled by Queensland and New South Wales governments, that can better reduce the risk of shark bite without endangering migrating humpbacks and killing dolphins and turtles,” Mr Chlebeck said. “There’s a better way.” For everyone not in Melbourne right now, let me tell you – it is very wet: Six new solar farms approved for Victoria Six solar farms to power 300,000 homes across Victoria will be built, as the state pushes on with plans to power all government operations with green energy, AAP reports. Energy minister, Lily D’Ambrosio, said six new solar farms and four big batteries were approved as part of Victoria’s second renewables auction. The projects in Bridgewater, Fulham, Ouyen, Traralgon, Horsham and Glenrowan will generate 1460 gigawatt hours of energy each year, enough to power 300,000 homes. Victoria aims to power its entire public sector infrastructure – including government schools, hospitals and the entire Melbourne train and tram network – with renewable energy by 2025. D’Ambrosio told reporters in Glen Waverley: The projects will also deliver $1.5 billion in investment and will create almost 1000 jobs right across the state. It comes a week after energy giant AGL announced it would close its brown coal-fired Loy Yang power plant by 2035, up to 10 years earlier than planned. NSW Young Liberals express ‘strong disagreement’ with Teena McQueen The criticism of Liberal Party vice president Teena McQueen continues overnight, with word that the NSW Young Liberal council called on her to resign and the party’s executive to take “appropriate action.” McQueen told the CPAC conference that attendees should “rejoice” at the defeat of “lefties” in the party at the last federal election - which has been interpreted to mean celebrating the loss of moderates like Dave Sharma, Tim Wilson and Trent Zimmerman. Sharma and Wilson fired back yesterday, while shadow foreign minister Simon Birmingham said McQueen should resign. We’ve contacted McQueen through the Liberal Party several times for comment but heard nothing back. We’re told the NSW Young Liberals passed the following motion overnight: That the NSW Young Liberals: 1. Express its strong disagreement and disappointment with the comments made by Liberal Federal vice president Teena McQueen’s at the recent CPAC conference. 2. Note that the comments made by Ms McQueen are not representative of the NSW Young Liberals or the NSW division. 3. Remind Ms McQueen that the role of federal executive members is to work towards the election of endorsed Liberal candidates and a Federal Coalition government. 4. Call on Chris Stone and the federal and state executives of the Liberal party to investigate the comments and take appropriate action to prevent any further damage to the party’s reputation and electoral chances. 5. Call on Teena McQueen to resign from her position as federal vice president. MPs asked to weigh into Essendon saga Sky News is asking Hume and McAllister about the Essendon saga. McAllister says she isn’t going to weigh into the matter (unlike the opposition leader – see Josh Butler’s earlier blog post) but she does remark Australia as a nation has been “pretty intolerant of intolerance”. You want a country for people to be able to get ahead no matter who they love, where they live or who they worship. She highlighted an inclusive society was the key message of the prime minister’s speech on the night of his election victory. Labor MP says government will not be ‘lectured’ by opposition on stage-three tax cuts Sky News has shadow finance minister Jane Hume squaring off against assistant climate change minister Jenny McAllister. The topic is stage-three tax cuts. Hume is coming out with her new favourite verb “crab-walk” to describe Labor’s speculated U-turn, which she was using in her media round yesterday too. However, crabs usually walk sideways, not backwards but no one seems to have asked Hume to explain what she actually means by the term then. If Labor crab walks away we’ll see their true colours. McAllister says that the government is “working through all those issues” on stage-three tax cuts. Two days away from the 10th anniversary of Julia Gillard’s anti-misogyny speech, McAllister has echoes of the former Labor leader when she responds to Hume: We’re not going to be lectured to people who were unable to make an energy policy, address the skills crisis for 10 years. NCA bomber Perre jailed for life National Crime Authority bomber Domenic Perre has been jailed for life and will be in his 90s before becoming eligible for parole after being sentenced for the 1994 Adelaide attack, AAP reports. Perre faced the South Australian supreme court today with Justice Kevin Nicholson confirming his mandatory life sentence for the murder of Detective Geoffrey Bowen and the attempted murder of lawyer Peter Wallis. With Perre already behind bars for drug offences, Nicholson extended his existing non-parole period by 30 years and seven months. That means the 65-year-old will be aged over 95 before being able to apply for release. Nicholson said Perre’s targeted murder of a serving police officer was violent, barbaric and ruthless. The judge said: Your conduct was brutish. That is totally devoid of any human sensibility. Your conduct was motivated by matters that do you no credit. It was not just premeditated but intricately devised and planned over a lengthy period of time and was executed in cold blood. Bowen died from horrific injuries, including the loss of his left arm, when a parcel bomb built and sent by Perre exploded in his office. Wallis, who was standing nearby, lost an eye and suffered severe burns in the blast. He died in 2018. Handing down his guilty verdicts in June this year, Nicholson found that Perre had intended to kill Bowen or anyone else who happened to open the package or be close by when it detonated. Perre was first charged with murder soon after the bombing but the case against him was dropped six months later because of a lack of evidence. He was arrested again in 2018 after a joint investigation, lasting more than two years, by a number of state and federal authorities including the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission. In an incredibly detailed and complex case, prosecutors argued the bombing was a personal attack on Bowen. They said Perre’s hostility towards him had grown because of their interactions following the seizure of a multimillion dollar cannabis crop in the Northern Territory in August 1993. Bowen’s son Simon, who followed his father’s footsteps into the police force, was just seven at the time of the blast. He told Perre in a victim impact statement last month: I struggle with the motive and relevance of your actions. You caused so much irreparable damage and suffering all so you can grow some dope and walk about South Australia like a would-be gangster with your big black glasses. Bowen’s widow Jane Bowen-Sutton said her husband was killed on their ninth wedding anniversary and she had experienced never-ending grief. That day I told my seven and five-year-old sons that their much-loved dad had been killed and we would never see him again. I’ve relived that conversation for 28 years. Genevieve Wallis, who was eight years old when her father was injured, said the attack had left him traumatised, depressed and debilitated. Wallis said: The bombing had torn any sense of safety, belonging and privilege of being a child and it sickens me that a blatant disregard for human life can exist within another human. In defence submissions, Perre’s lawyer Gilbert Aitken told the court that his client sympathised with the families of the victims but maintained his innocence. He has lodged an appeal against his convictions. Melbourne Zoo marks 160th anniversary with pledge to continue fighting wildlife extinction RBA financial stability report to reveal rate-increase stresses We’ll soon get the Reserve Bank’s semi-annual financial stability review, which should update the central bank’s assessment of how households and businesses are coping with the higher interest rates. Their last such report landed, of course, before they started lifting the cash rate in May, with the increase now reaching a round 250 basis points with last Tuesday’s hike. While we await the report, CoreLogic has released September quarter data tracking how much more it is costing to build a new home. Their Cordell Construction Cost Index (CCCI) showed such costs were rising at a record rate in the 12 months to September – if you exclude the bulge in costs after the GST was introduced by the Howard government in March 2001. According to index, residential construction costs increased by 11% over the 12 months to September, quickening from the 10% annual pace for the June quarter. On a quarterly basis, the jump was 4.7% or about double the 2.4% increase in the April-June period. So much, then, for the easing of Covid restrictions producing some relief on the home-building front. The federal opposition leader, Peter Dutton, has said Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, “is well and truly past his use-by date,” in a stinging attack over the issue of Essendon football club and Andrew Thorburn. He also flagged the Liberal party, under his leadership, would more strongly speak out about social and culture issues like freedom of speech. Dutton appeared on Sky News last night, where he was asked about the Thorburn case, where the former banking executive quit as Essendon CEO after just a day following the surfacing of sermons from the church that he chaired likening abortion to concentration camps and claims that “practising homosexuality is a sin”. Andrews criticised Thorburn, Dutton then criticised Andrews, then Andrews criticised Dutton for criticising him. In the next round of the circular sledging match, Dutton took aim back at Andrews again last night. Dutton told Sky host Andrew Bolt: If ever there was a time for a change of government, it’s now in Victoria. I hope and pray that they can change government down there because Daniel Andrews is well and truly past his use-by date and the gratuitous comments that he provides, I mean, there’s nothing substantive in what he says. He doesn’t argue the merit, you’ll notice, he attacks the person and that’s how he gets away with skating over the issues where he’s had a complete failure. Dutton again called on Andrews to throw his support behind Thorburn: “He would say that he’s in favour of inclusion, he would say that he’s in favour of freedom of choice and freedom of speech and instead he’s supported a decision which has crucified somebody for their religious beliefs.” The opposition leader flagged he would have a big focus on social and cultural issues such as the Thorburn case – and more broadly, freedom of speech and individual rights – as this term of government plays out. He said: The Liberal party has very strong values, particularly around the rights of the individual and I’ll take every opportunity to assert those because people will know by the time of the next election that there is a big difference between the Liberal party and the Labor party – not just on social issues, but on economic and national security issues as well. The Australian defence force’s contribution to the national response to Covid-19 concludes today, as the ADF announces an official end to “Operation Covid-19 Assist”. The pandemic saw over 19,000 ADF personnel deployed at border checkpoints, testing and vaccine hubs, quarantine hotels and aged care facilities. The ADF said in a statement that across more than 26,000 deployments helped assist the “most vulnerable to the effects of the virus” as well as critical supply chain management. Deputy prime minister and defence minister, Richard Marles, had these words of thanks for the ADF: We are extremely proud of Defence’s response to the pandemic which tested the resilience of all those involved. As it did during the outbreak of Spanish influenza over a century ago, the Australian defence force rose to the challenge imposed by Covid-19, offering a significant capability to deal with the impacts of the disease. Defence personnel enhanced services, provided relief to organisations under pressure, increased the effectiveness and speed of the national response and, importantly, provided reassurance to a concerned public. I thank our Defence personnel for their commitment, compassion, patience and professionalism during one of the most challenging periods in Australia’s contemporary history. Sydney’s Warragamba spill to pick up this weekend More rain is falling today across the sodden inland regions of NSW. The coast, though, including Sydney, will feel dry, certainly compared with the 91mm in the 24 hours to 9am Friday that tipped the city into wettest-year-ever territory with about a lot of 2022 to set a new high bar. The lull, however, won’t last, with the weekend looking damp, particularly on Saturday when as much as 50mm will fall in Sydney and 70mm in the city’s west. For the Warragamba Dam region, falls should approach 60mm on Saturday and as much as another 30mm on Sunday. The dam has again been a focus of attention, with the NSW premier Dominic Perrottet this week repeating his determination to lift the dam wall even though it’s highly contested. (With the bill likely to top $2bn, the NSW government will be hoping half the funds will come from the feds. A tad unlikely.) According to WaterNSW, Warragamba has so far been spilling only about 8 giga (or billion) litres a day since last Thursday (continuing an off and on again spill pattern for months). Warragamba’s expected peak outflow will reach 275GL/day (based on a relatively low 25% chance), likely by Sunday PM. As of 6am today, inflows were at 36GL/day, and the spill was 30GL/day. The dam, which is about 80% of Sydney’s capacity, holds 2000GL, and since March 2021 has received enough water to fill 2.2 times. Since November 2021, WaterNSW has made controlled releases of 1,000GL (or two Sydney Harbours’ worth). As for the big inland NSW dams – Burrendong, Wyangala, Copeton and Burrinjuck – they have enough spare capacity with only modest spills based on the current forecasts. Those spills, of course, would be larger if conditions turn out a lot wetter than predicted, WaterNSW said. They’ve been helped by the midweek rain being less than has been forecast, giving WaterNSW a chance to release water in those dams to gain “air space” to accommodate what’s coming in the next 48 hours. Large policing operation supporting Bathurst 1000 event amid flooding Superintendent Bob Noble also spoke at that press conference about the Bathurst 1000 event going ahead amid the threat of flood: Obviously we’ve got a very large event in Bathurst this weekend. It is really important from an economic and social point of view, not just for this district but for the whole state. We have a very large policing operation around that support the event. On the mountain itself, in and around Bathurst and on our roads in surrounding districts and that is to ensure that we have a safe event, everyone does well and everyone get as way safely. What we don’t need is people entering flooded causeways and water across the road. It wasn’t very long ago that we had a five-year-old boy, not far from here who was killed, drowned in a car washed off the bridge. You can imagine how devastating that is for that family. It is a terribly hard way for a lesson to be learned by society. NSW SES receive 24 calls for assistance, including four flood rescues SES operational readiness officer, Joshua Clark, is providing an update: We are looking at quite a significant weather event that is moving across the state from the west to the east at the moment. The areas of impact and concern for the SES are Gunnedah, Bathurst, Forbes, Warren and most of inland New South Wales. This weather event has the potential to bring some significant heavy rainfall and as a result New South Wales SES and our partner agencies have provided and pre-positioned resources right across inland. We have here in relation to Bathurst, we have an additional flood rescue team from fire &amp; cue, we have PolAir based out of Orange with helicopter support, aviation assets across New England and the north-west and a lot of those activities are reply and, resupply and flood and rescue support as and when required. Thankfully, only 24 calls for assistance over New South Wales. Of note, four have been flood rescues. A press conference is happening in Bathurst giving an update about the state’s deteriorating weather conditions expected over the next 36 hours. Paul Toole, the deputy premier and member for Bathurst, one of the areas being hit by flooding, is the first to speak: Over the coming days, we are expecting to see consistent rainfall across various parts of New South Wales. We are expecting to see significant rainfall around the Bathurst area, the Gunnedah area and also around Forbes. Please, everybody, do the right thing over this weekend as we are continuing to see significant rainfall across the state. Toole also warned drivers returning from school holidays to prepare for traffic: We are expected to see congestion on the Great Western Highway, on the Princes Highway and on the M1 Motorway. We are asking people to plan their trips, to take their time. There will be congestion. It means that people will have delays. We also want people to drive to the conditions. There will be wet weather, so therefore when you’re braking, it will take extra distance to actually brake before you come it a stop. The timing of the severe weather is also particularly bad for Bathurst, which is holding their annual supercar event which kicked off yesterday and continues through this weekend. Toole said: I also want to point out that here in Bathurst, we have a major event this weekend as well. This is the Bathurst 1000. We are expected to see thousands of people here in the city enjoying the car race. But, again, we want to remind campers to not set up alongside the river. Do not set a campsite up underneath a tree. This is for your safety. NSW emergency services minister Steph Cook said: We are in the middle of two wet-weather systems at present and the next 24-36 hours we are likely to see increased rainfall across southern inland places like here in Bathurst and also across Sydney. So here we are expecting weather conditions to deteriorate over this time and on that basis, we are asking communities to work with us over this time, and particularly those communities in the Hawkesbury-Nepean area – we are very aware of the fact that your communities have experienced four floods within an 18-month period and acknowledge the anxiety that some of you will be feeling at this time. I want-to-reassure communities across New South Wales that the SES are very well prepared. Poll shows over-50s feel ageism pain On ageism awareness day, national polling has been released showing nearly 70% of people over 50 agree that ageism against older Australians is a serious problem. Australians in their 50s and 60s are significantly more concerned about ageism than older people, AAP reports. Nearly three-quarters of over-50s believe Australia is not doing enough to raise awareness about ageism and fight against it, while 58% want a government awareness campaign. However, people in their 50s and 60s are more likely than those in their 80s or 90s to think ageism is a serious problem, according to the research by RedBridge Group for the EveryAGE Counts campaign. Nearly three-quarters of people in their 60s believe ageism is a serious problem, and 37% of people in that age bracket are most likely to have experienced ageism in the past year. That was compared with about a quarter of over-50s generally, and 15% of people in their 80s. EveryAGE Counts campaign director Marlene Krasovitsky said: The way most polling has traditionally lumped ‘older Australians’ together into one monolithic group is ageist in and of itself. What this new research shows is that attitudes to ageism and experiences of ageism vary significantly across a very diverse ‘over-50’ group. Nearly 30% of people over 50 have been ignored or made to feel invisible, according to the research. Among those in their 50s, 28% had been rejected for jobs because of their age, and a quarter of people in their 50s and 60s had been made to feel like they are too old for their work. Krasovitsky said those in their 80s and 90s, conversely, are more likely to report experiencing ageism in the health system, either by being denied treatments or by being ignored in favour of a carer. The research was based on a representative national sample of more than 1,040 Australians. There were 9,230 new cases in the weekly reporting period, and nine people are in intensive care. There were 10,767 new cases in the weekly reporting period, and 23 people are in intensive care. Australian army chief warns Putin’s nuclear threat must be taken ‘very seriously’ Australia’s new army chief Lieutenant General Simon Stuart has warned the prospect of nuclear war in Europe must be taken “very seriously”, as the world enters a strategic era different to the past 80 years. In an interview with the ABC Stuart was asked whether Russian President Vladimir Putin’s recent threat to use nuclear weapons was a real possibility. He said: I think we have to take it very seriously. We live in an era of strategic competition where the great powers are nuclear-armed is something that we need to understand, because it is different to the strategic environment we’ve been living in for the past 80 years. Earlier this week, during the Land Forces conference in Brisbane, Stuart said that restoring trust in the army following the Brereton inquiry is one of his immediate priorities in his new role. You can read Guardian Australia’s defence correspondent Daniel Hurst’s most recent revelations regarding inaction on the Brereton inquiry here: Weather warnings for Victoria Here are the warnings that Victorian emergency services have issued for the Melbourne area, and northern parts of the state. Flood watches are also in place for a number of Victorian rivers, including the Yarra. Australia’s peak medical body has warned it’s “too early” to scrap Covid-19 isolation requirements, with the nation set to be hit by another wave of infections, AAP reports. National cabinet agreed to dump the five-day isolation period for positive cases at their last meeting in September. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, announced the changes will come into effect on 14 October. Australian Medical Association president Prof Steve Robson told AAP it was “too early” to ease these protections for the community. All the signs are that we’re looking at another wave of Covid. We’re coming out of one of the biggest waves of Covid yet and it has absolutely crushed [the] hospital workforce and left us with a massive logjam and backlog in hospitals at the moment that has to be dealt with. If we have another wave over the holiday season, then it spells bad news for the country because we can’t tackle that backlog. Robson said information from the northern hemisphere showed the newer variants won’t be affected by immunity from previous infection or from vaccinations. We’re seeing a major wave beginning again in the northern hemisphere, we’re very concerned that this doesn’t happen in Australia. The federal health department will release its weekly Covid-19 case notifications report on Friday. Dutton accuses government of not giving straight answers in throwback to Rudd and Gillard The defence minister, Richard Marles, followed by the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, spoke to Nine News this morning. Marles was asked whether the government would “break the promise” of its commitment to stage-three tax cuts. He said: Our position hasn’t changed. We are facing a really difficult situation in terms of the budget. Every dollar of debt that Peter left us from the former government are now costing the budget a whole lot more. Dutton then criticised the government’s lack of a clear answer on the question: Richard’s words this morning – he couldn’t give you a straight answer, which is exactly how Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard behaved, and we’re seeing echoes of that, which should be deeply disturbing. Feminist writer Clementine Ford is speaking to ABC Radio about how romantic love has been oversold to women as a project to get them back into the home post-WW2. What a vibe. Australian politicians react to Thai massacre Condolences are flowing in from the Australian parliament following the horrific massacre in Thailand overnight. Prime minister Anthony Albanese earlier tweeted “it’s impossible to comprehend the heartbreak”. Foreign affairs minister Penny Wong said she was “devastated”. Opposition leader Peter Dutton called it a “senseless massacre” and “difficult to comprehend”. Environment minister Tanya Plibersek, shadow foreign minister Simon Birmingham and Nationals MP Michael McCormack also shared messages of condolence. Assistant treasury minister Andrew Leigh called the incident “evil”. Independent MP Allegra Spender has called for the Labor government to announce a tax system review as part of this month’s federal budget, as debate over the fate of the $244bn stage-three tax cuts continues to rage. Spender, the member for the affluent Sydney seat of Wentworth, tweeted this morning that it would be “courageous” for treasurer Jim Chalmers to start a “balanced discussion” about tax settings. She previously told the Sydney Morning Herald she supported the stage-three tax cuts but has long called for a review of income, company and payroll taxes. She tweeted: The treasurer is right to highlight cost pressures in the budget, but government also has control over how to spend money smarter. The government hasn’t decided on any changes to the stage-three tax cuts, which will overwhelmingly benefit high-income earners when they come into effect in 2024, and may eventually decide to make no changes at all to the settings legislated by Scott Morrison’s government. However, there are some in Labor agitating for changes, with calls for some of the large benefits to the richest Australians to be pared back. The Coalition opposition is already setting this up as a test for the Albanese government, pointing out that the now prime minister repeatedly promised not to touch the tax cuts during the election. Here’s Coalition frontbencher Dan Tehan: Albanese says trust between Australia and Solomon Islands vital The prime minister’s office has released some images of Anthony Albanese hosting Manasseh Sogavare at The Lodge in Canberra for dinner on Thursday night, after his formal meeting at Parliament House earlier in the day. At that meeting, Albanese said “building up trust” between the two nations was critical. He said Australia regards itself as being part of the “Pacific family”: Like families, we won’t always agree on every single item but what we will agree on is common interests wherever we can. Climate Council issues pre-budget wishlist With the federal budget less than two weeks away, the Climate Council is calling on the Albanese government to replace $11.6bn spent on fossil fuel subsidies with “structural” environmentally friendly investments that could lower costs for households, AAP reports. In a report released today, the Climate Council claims the government could use money from fuel subsidies to install more than 72,000 electric vehicle charging stations – one for every 12km of road – or install solar panels to power 1.5 million low-income households. Climate Council chief executive Dr Jennifer Rayner said the organisation based its figures on fossil fuel subsidies paid in the 2021-2022 financial year and five projects it considered “better bets”. In addition to solar panels and EV charging stations, Rayner said the government could use the funds to replace all diesel buses in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane, create 138 renewable energy storage facilities similar to Victoria’s Big Battery in Geelong, or fund another 15 pumped hydro projects to shore up the energy grid. Rayner said each of the projects was environmentally friendly and some would offer cost savings to households under financial pressure. Climate Council economist Nicki Hutley, who prepared the report, said investing the funds in electric vehicle charging sites could also make it easier for Australians to avoid rising petrol prices. Australia has a network of more than 3000 public electric vehicle charging stations but, with an $11.6bn investment, Hutley estimates the country could roll out 72,500 EV chargers - one for every 12km. By comparison, Norway has an EV charger for every 50km of roads at 17,000. KPMG has flagged climate change as a key concern in the October budget. Western Sydney to receive 70mm of rain Saturday alone The federal government has today announced that the budget blowout and unanswered questions of the $14.5bn inland rail project be investigated in an independent review. This is a project which was the subject of a major investigation by Guardian Australia’s rural network earlier this year: The federal government today announced former Energy Security Board chair Kerry Schott would lead the review. Infrastructure minister Catherine King and finance minister Katy Gallagher have released a joint statement this morning: The Coalition left Inland Rail in a mess. We inherited a project over budget, behind schedule and with no plan for where it will start or end. The review will consider the process for selecting the Inland Rail route, including stakeholder consultation, and assess the project’s scope, schedule and cost. The review will also assess options for the new Inland Rail intermodal terminals to be built in Melbourne and Brisbane, and improving rail links to the ports in these cities. The review will have regard to existing studies, such as the Toowoomba to Gladstone Inland Rail Extension Business Case. Inland Rail is an important part of building additional capability and capacity to increase the resilience of Australia’s freight supply chain and meet our growing freight task, which is forecast to grow by up to 35% by 2040. Moving freight off the roads and on to rail will help with the task of decarbonising while helping regional cities grow by providing more opportunities for jobs and industries. The independent review is necessary because Inland Rail is too important to stuff up. The project has already gone over budget and a senate inquiry was told final costs for the infrastructure project could surpass $20bn. ‘Impossible to comprehend the heartbreak’: Albanese sends condolences to Thailand The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has expressed his condolences to Thailand on behalf of Australia following the news of mass stabbing and shooting at a preschool. Thirty-seven people have been killed, most of them young children, in an unprecedented gun and knife attack at a preschool centre in the country’s north-east. Bandt says systemic cost of living relief will help Australians more than stage-three tax cuts RN Breakfast host Patricia Karvelas now turns to asking Greens leader Adam Bandt about the stage-three tax cuts, amid speculation the government could be reconsidering their commitment. Bandt has been outspoken about the need to scrap the tax cuts which will largely benefit the wealthiest Australians, arguing that the savings could be better spent on Greens policies like bringing dental under medicare. Karvelas asks Bandt if he would support changes to the stage three tax cuts so people on lower incomes keep the tax cut. However, Bandt’s argument is that the government spending on “systemic cost of living relief” is what will best serve Australians. The proposed tweaks that the government has been floating ... still result in billionaires getting thousands of dollars a year in tax cuts – our view is there are better ways of dealing with the cost of living crisis. People who are on low and middle incomes need cost of living relief, in the form of government support to reduce the cost of living, getting dental into medicare. The concern is that with wages going up so slowly and the cost of everything rising quickly, a small tax cut today is gobbled up by energy prices tomorrow. This is about what government can do to make peoples lives better. Greens to push government on safeguard mechanism in the Senate Greens leader Adam Bandt is now speaking to ABC Radio. My colleague Sarah Martin brought you the news a little earlier about that new analysis out from the Greens which shows that big emitters can easily pay for their emission offsets instead of reducing them. Bandt: The government has said that … they’re now going to take steps to put a new rule in place to cover the coal and gas corporations. What we’re concerned about that under the discussion paper the government has released, these big corporations that are bringing in billions of dollars a year in revenue won’t actually be forced to cut their pollution instead they’ll just be able to pay to offset it. [Our analysis] suggest that many of these big polluters won’t have to cut their pollution at all and given that call and gas is what’s fast tracking the climate crisis, that is a real concern to us. The government’s safeguard mechanism has to deal with this question of new coal and gas projects … the government has said it would … if we come up with a scheme that allows new coal and gas to keep opening then it’s going to make the climate crisis worse. Are the Greens willing to hold up other legislation to strengthen the safeguard mechanism? They’ll need the safeguard mechanism to have the support of the Senate.. so this is where we will push the government to tackle this question of coal and gas. This is an area I think we can get the government to shift, that’s why a record number of people voted for us. Fifty-seven flood warnings in place for NSW as SES receive 800 calls for help NSW SES assistant commissioner Dean Story is speaking to ABC News Breakfast this morning about “a concerning couple of days ahead” for the state’s weather: There is currently 57 advice or watch and act warnings in play from the SES effecting a large part of the state. That number is set to increase in the next 24 hours as well. We’re really asking the communities and those effected areas to stay informed, monitor your local weather forecasts and the warnings. A lot of people on the roads with the school holidays ending and events taking place around the state. Avoid unnecessary travel if you are in the effected areas. If you need to travel, plan your trip accordingly. You can use live traffic.com as a good tool to do that and never drive through flood waters. Story says there have been “almost 800 requests for assistance” since Monday. SES volunteers have responded to 24 flood rescues during that time also. The rainfall forecast over the next 24 hours is really concerning from a flash-flooding risk. Where the flood waters and people attempt to go drive through them, particularly in the city areas, can really ramp up that activity and increase that risk. We’re urging the communities to stay vigilant and make the smart safety decisions for themselves and their families and one of the smartest decisions they can make is never drive through floodwaters. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, says Australia is facing the possibility of a new “global slowdown” and the 25 October budget must be framed to prepare for any coming economic shocks. Amid the debate over whether to proceed with the stage-three tax cuts, Chalmers said the budget would include “difficult decisions for difficult times” amid a worsening global economic climate and spending pressures domestically. He will say in a speech at the Queensland government’s investment showcase later today: The right calls for the right reasons – following the responsible path; not the path of least resistance. We must be serious about rebuilding our budget buffers – particularly given the deteriorating global outlook. So, we’ll put a premium on affordable, responsible, sustainable, spending. Not fancy or flashy – but fair and future-focused. Above all else – this budget will be about responsible economic management at home at a time of uncertainty around the world. The budget will show that Treasury’s global growth forecasts have been downgraded by 0.75 of a percentage point in 2022, 1 percentage point in 2023 and a 0.5 of a percentage point in 2024. He says: This means that global output will be around $2tn lower in US dollar terms by the end of 2024 than previously expected. We aren’t being spared from the deteriorating global outlook and we shouldn’t hope to escape further storms unscathed. Chalmers will say that the global financial crisis became a demand shock, the Covid pandemic crisis became a supply shock, and the third would be “an inflationary shock and a hard landing brought about by rapidly tightening monetary policy.” Each is different in meaningful ways; the response should be different too. This time our response will be more targeted, more measured, and more supply-side focussed so it isn’t counterproductive and doesn’t put extra pressure on the independent RBA. He will also use the speech to highlight the spending pressures facing the government, with interest payments to grow at around 14% per year on average over the next four years, defence spending to grow 4.4% each year, the NDIS 12.1%, hospitals 6.1%, and aged care 5%. The Greens are releasing new analysis today looking at how big polluters could “easily pay for offsets” under the proposed changes to the safeguard mechanism mooted by the government. The analysis, informed by research from the parliamentary library, shows that at current and forecast prices of carbon permits, the biggest emitters in the coal and gas sector would only have to pay “the tiniest fraction of their profits” to offset their emissions. This will lead big polluters to buy carbon credits rather than investing in real emission reductions at their own facilities, the party claims. Using the Capcoal thermal and metallurgical coalmine in Queensland and the North-West Shelf LNG project as case studies, the analysis looks at two measures of possible liabilities as envisaged in the government’s consultation paper: a minimum 3.5% annual decline in emissions out to 2030 or a maximum 6% decline. Under either scenario, the cost of abatement would range from as low as 0.014% of annual profits to 1.35% of just one year’s profit for a five-year obligation. Greens leader Adam Bandt said the liability would amount to “just coins down the back of the couch” for these coal and gas corporations. He says: Coal and gas are the main causes of the climate crisis, but Labor’s proposed scheme lets coal and gas keep polluting by paying a pittance. Under Labor’s proposed scheme, new coal and gas mines can still go ahead. Coal and gas corporations make obscene profits and pay very little tax, and on the current proposal, they’ll easily buy their way out of the scheme. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, will today outline the five biggest pressures on the budget he is due to hand down on 25 October. The interest payments on servicing government debt tops the list, alongside aged care, disability care, hospitals and defence. The Australian Financial Review is reporting the treasurer will use the occasion to “escalate his push to pare back the stage-three tax cuts.” In other political news, the Greens are releasing new analysis today showing how big polluters will choose to pay for rather than cut their emission offsets under the proposed changes to the safeguard mechanism mooted by the government. The Greens’ leader, Adam Bandt, will be speaking with ABC Radio shortly and we’ll bring you what he has to say. In weather news, wild conditions continues to lash eastern Australia with flood warnings in place across several states. There are 55 flood warnings across in NSW, 14 of which are watch and act. More than a dozen rivers set to flood with concern for inland towns in the state’s north and central west. There are also warnings for heavy rainfall, thunder and flooding in Victoria, as well as a flood watches in Queensland and Tasmania.

Homeowners who install new rooftop solar panels from 1 January 2020 will be able to lower their bills by selling the energy they do not need to their supplier. A record was set at noon on a Friday in May 2017, when solar energy supplied around a quarter of the UK’s electricity. However, solar panel owners are not always at home on sunny days to reap the benefit. The new rules will allow them to make money if they generate electricity for the grid. Some 800,000 householders with solar panels already benefit from payments under a previous scheme. However, the subsidies were controversially scrapped by the government in April, causing the number of new installations to fall by 94% in May from the month before. Labour accused the government last week of “actively dismantling” the solar industry. The sector will still struggle this summer as the change does not come in for another seven months, so homeowners have no incentive to buy panels this year. Chris Skidmore, the minister for energy and clean growth, said the government wanted to increase the number of small-scale generators without adding the cost of subsidies to energy bills. “The future of energy is local and the new smart export guarantee will ensure households that choose to become green energy generators will be guaranteed a payment for electricity supplied to the grid,” he said. The government also hopes to encourage homes with solar panels to install batteries. Greg Jackson, the founder of Octopus Energy, said: “These smart export tariffs are game-changing when it comes to harnessing the power of citizens to tackle climate change”. A few suppliers, including Octopus, already offer to buy solar power from their customers. “They mean homes and businesses can be paid for producing clean electricity just like traditional generators, replacing old dirty power stations and pumping more renewable energy into the grid. This will help bring down prices for everyone as we use cheaper power generated locally by our neighbours,” Jackson said. Léonie Greene, a director at the Solar Trade Association, said it was “vital” that even “very small players” were paid a fair price. “We will be watching the market like a hawk to see if competitive offers come forward that properly value the power that smart solar homes can contribute to the decarbonising electricity grid,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2019/nov/28/tories-left-on-ice-in-tv-debate-as-leaders-vie-for-climate-credentials","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2019-11-28T21:49:40Z","webTitle":"Tories left on ice in TV debate as leaders vie for climate credentials","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/28/tories-left-on-ice-in-tv-debate-as-leaders-vie-for-climate-credentials","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2019/nov/28/tories-left-on-ice-in-tv-debate-as-leaders-vie-for-climate-credentials","fields":{"headline":"Tories left on ice in TV debate as leaders vie for climate credentials","bodyText":"Opposition leaders attempted to outbid each other on Thursday night with their climate credentials in the first ever election debate focusing on the environmental emergency, in which the absent Boris Johnson was replaced by a melting ice sculpture. In place of the prime minister, Channel 4 placed an ice sculpture, representing, they said, the emergency on planet Earth. A second ice sculpture took the place of Brexit party leader Nigel Farage, who also refused to take part. The Conservatives accused the broadcaster of bias for not allowing Michael Gove to take Johnson’s place, accusing them of “conspiring” with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to block the party from making their case. Gove had turned up to the studios but was turned away by Channel 4 who said the debate was for party leaders only. In a response designed to overshadow the programme, the Conservatives immediately complained to broadcasting regulator Ofcom and threatened to review its broadcasting licence. The opposition leaders met as the EU declared a global climate and environmental emergency and urged all EU countries to commit to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, the SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, Siân Berry from the Green party, Jo Swinson, leader of the Liberal Democrats, and Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price participated in the televised debate. Johnson’s officials had told the campaigners behind the debate, We are Possible, when he was first invited that he would not take part because he did not want climate change to be “siloed”. The leaders were challenged on what they would to do reduce carbon emissions from food, transport, domestic heating and the biodiversity crisis. All pushed manifesto commitments to cut carbon emissions to zero by dates from 2030 to 2045, a few years before the Conservatives’ pledge for net zero by 2050. The expansion of Heathrow airport – passed by MPs last year – and the HS2 rail link were all discussed. Siân Berry, the Green party leader said they were the only party who wanted to cancel HS2. She said more than half of Labour MPs voted for Heathrow Expansion while the SNP abstained. She said a minority of people took most flights and should be targeted. “The question now is how we share out the flights that we can take more fairly. It means targeting those 15% of people who took 70% of the flights,” said Berry. Challenged on whether people should stop flying, Sturgeon said: “Do people have to fly less? Yes where we can, half of fall international flights are taken by 10% of population.” “Where flights are necessary we have set a target to decarbonise all flights within Scotland by 2040,” said Sturgeon. The Labour leader said he voted against Heathrow expansion. Rather than stopping people from flying, he said there had to be investment in rail services to reduce number of short-haul flights to Europe and the expansion of railways all over the country, and train travel had to become cheaper. “I think we do it better by offering a sensible alternative which is also about improving bus and rail services all over the country,” he said. More than half of UK emissions are from buildings and domestic homes, reducing this is one of the biggest challenges to meeting any net-zero targets. Corbyn said tackling emissions from domestic heating could be done: “We can and do retrofit homes, we can generate electricity from solar energy and wind, but it does require a determination which is why our manifesto sets out a very large green investment fund.” Hundreds of thousands of people, including Johnson’s father Stanley Johnson and climate expert Lord Nicholas Stern, had signed a petition urging the prime minister to take part. But on Thursday night, Stanley Johnson – who was present at the studio – said Channel 4 should have let Gove debate, saying he “would have made a big, big contribution”. He insisted that Gove’s appearance at the studios had not been a stunt, saying that the Conservatives had been given the impression that he could appear. Johnson showed journalists a text message from the prime minister saying: “Gove on!” On leaving, Gove was confronted by a 15-year-old climate activist, Izzy Warren, about Johnson’s failure to attend and the Tories’ green policies. Speaking to the Guardian, Izzy said: “I asked Gove why, if the Conservatives think this is a priority, the prime minister wasn’t here today.” He told her that it shouldn’t matter who was there to speak and that they had the most ambitious manifesto ever on climate change. “This is a party that has been in power for 10 years and we haven’t seen climate action,” she said. Asked if he looked surprised, she added: “I think older men, quite frankly, aren’t used to being challenged by teenage girls. Which makes it all the more fun when you get to do it.” The scale of the task facing any new government was made clear this week when scientists warned that the world may have already crossed a series of climate tipping points, resulting in “a state of planetary emergency”. To meet net-zero targets by 2050, analysts say, would need as much as £20bn a year in investment to remove up to 130m tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Sturgeon was challenged on her failure to support the Green party call for the decommissioning of oil rigs in fossil fuel rich Scotland. “If we were to stop tomorrow in terms of oil production, we would make ourselves more reliant on imports so that transition has got to be done in a way which decreases our emissions,” Sturgeon said. Swinson, who is promising an emergency 10-year programme to reduce energy consumption from all buildings, linked the fight to tackle climate change to Brexit. “Brexit is a climate crime, it is morally wrong to leave our seat at the table and give away our influence to create change,” she said. Price said there was no choice but to cut to net zero by 2030: “We have the technology now to reach carbon neutrality by 2030 what is lacking is the political will.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2019/nov/12/xi-jinping-comes-to-greeks-bearings-gifts","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2019-11-12T02:17:13Z","webTitle":"Xi Jinping comes to Greeks bearings gifts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/12/xi-jinping-comes-to-greeks-bearings-gifts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2019/nov/12/xi-jinping-comes-to-greeks-bearings-gifts","fields":{"headline":"Xi Jinping comes to Greeks bearings gifts","bodyText":"A landmark visit to Greece by China’s president Xi Jinping has cemented what both countries are calling a “new era” in bilateral ties amid western concern over Beijing’s growing global assertiveness. Athens rolled out the red carpet for Xi as its centre-right government sought to capitalise on Greece’s burgeoning role as China’s “gateway” to Europe. “This visit opens a new chapter of decisive importance in the already excellent relations between China and Greece,” said the Greek president, Prokopis Pavlopoulos, addressing a dinner held in honour of the leader Monday night. “[It] fundamentally upgrades our strategic partnership,” he added after the two sides signed 16 trade deals in areas as diverse as banking, tourism and solar energy. The three-day tour is Xi’s first to Athens. It comes barely a week after the Greek prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, returned from Shanghai where the Chinese president raised the prospect of Greece becoming “a logistics centre” for the trans-shipment of western-bound Chinese goods. Meeting Mitsotakis earlier on Monday, Xi vowed to “deepen cooperation” between two countries he firmly believes are closely bonded by a shared sense of historical heritage. “We are both ancient civilisations and should join hands to deliver greater benefits to our peoples,” he told the Greek PM. The exchange of such high-level talks has illuminated the significance Beijing now gives Greece as Xi forges ahead with his signature foreign policy goal of bolstering Chinese connectivity with the world through the Belt and Road Initiative. Fears of China’s spreading influence have grown dramatically since Cosco, the state-run shipping company, won a 35-year concession to take over and manage cargo piers in Piraeus. The strategic port has become emblematic of the country’s investment in Greece. A decade later an estimated 10% of Chinese exports to Europe are thought to move through Piraeus, making it a direct competitor to continental ports further north such as Hamburg and Rotterdam. Within hours of bilateral discussions getting under way on Monday, Athens formally endorsed Cosco expanding operations in the port with a €600m project or “masterplan” that will see Chinese investment approach €2.5bn in Greece. The project is aimed squarely at accelerating Piraeus’ role as a hub for Chinese containers that can now save millions in shipping costs travelling from Asia to Europe via the Suez Canal. Mitsotakis, who visited the Cosco piers with Xi, said the two seafaring nations were united in wanting to make Piraeus “not only the largest port in the Mediterranean but in Europe.” In an editorial published in Kathimerini on the eve of his arrival, the Chinese president described the investment “as the dragon’s head.” With Greece’s debt-stricken economy only slowly recovery from financial crisis, Athens is eager to tap China’s massive market with exports such as olive oil and wine. The pro-business government, which assumed power barely four months ago, is also keen to attract further foreign investment viewed as vital to generating growth and jobs in a EU member state where unemployment remains extraordinarily high at 17.3%. The visit has also required the Greek prime minister to walk a diplomatic tight rope. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, warned the Nato ally during a trip to Athens in October against accepting Chinese deals that look “too good to be true”. In a keynote speech he accused China of “using economic means to coerce countries into lopsided deals that benefit Beijing and leave its clients mired in debt”. Greek interaction with Beijing – including Athens’ refusal under its previous leftist-led government to endorse a EU statement deploring human rights violations in China – has fed suspicion in western capitals. Fears were raised further when the former prime minister Alexis Tsipras announced in April that Greece would join the Beijing-led “17 +1” cooperation platform of central and eastern European countries despite vocal EU criticism of the grouping undermining the bloc’s unity. The move came less than a year after Athens also agreed to sign up to China’s flagship Belt and Road initiative. “Geopolitically, western partners are concerned that Greece’s flirtation with China may weaken the south-eastern flank of Nato and the EU,” said Plamen Tonchev, head of the Asia unit at the Institute of International Economic Relations in Athens. “Mitsotakis will have a hard time convincing them that Greece is not a Trojan horse. He will have to deliberately double down to ensure that business with China does not undermine Athens’ allegiance to the west.” Before leaving on Tuesday, Xi was given a tour of the sculptures that once graced the 5th century BC Acropolis, the highlight of his visit, according to members of the Chinese delegation. “In the east civilisation sprang from China, in the west it sprang from Greece,” enthused Luo Tong, a prominent Greek scholar who guided China’s former president Hu Jintao around the monument when he visited Athens in November 2008. “Together we are a bridge of history,” she told the Guardian, standing within view of the site. “We Chinese know that if we want to connect with the western world we have to understand Greece.” Signalling that cultural diplomacy would reinforce blossoming Sino-Greek relations, Xi declared that Athens had Beijing’s full support in its campaign to win back the Parthenon marbles from the British Museum. “Not only do I agree [with their repatriation] but you also have our support,” said the Chinese president when prompted by his Greek counterpart to take a stance on the issue during a tour of the Acropolis Museum. “We, too, have our own [treasures] outside the country and are doing everything we can to get them home.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2019/sep/29/elmley-nature-reserve-kent-thames-cottages-and-cabins","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2019-09-29T10:00:41Z","webTitle":"Elmley Nature Reserve, Kent: a peaceful retreat on the Isle of Sheppey","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2019/sep/29/elmley-nature-reserve-kent-thames-cottages-and-cabins","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2019/sep/29/elmley-nature-reserve-kent-thames-cottages-and-cabins","fields":{"headline":"Elmley Nature Reserve, Kent: a peaceful retreat on the Isle of Sheppey","bodyText":"Beyond the glass wall of the shepherd’s hut, a vast flat landscape stretches to touch wide open skies. A yellow wagtail takes wing in a flash of colour and the long grass quivers as a hare emerges, glances our way and then scarpers. To the east lie salt marshes, mudflats and glistening waters of the Swale, a tidal channel of the Thames estuary, its far bank dotted with industrial buildings, adding an edginess to the stark natural beauty. Elmley nature reserve on the Isle of Sheppey in Kent is just over an hour from London, yet there’s a sense of peaceful isolation. The 3,300-acre site is the only family-owned and managed national nature reserve in the UK – Georgina Fulton, daughter of pioneering farmers and conservationists Philip and Corinne Merricks, runs it with husband Gareth – and it’s the only one you can stay overnight. By day it welcomes walkers and birdwatchers; stay on, though, and you’ll have it all practically to yourself. We arrive late afternoon, via a bridge from the mainland – until the 1940s a ferry was the only way across. As islands go, Sheppey isn’t a conventional beauty; a medley of marshland, industrial sprawl and holiday camps, it is the butt of many a Kent mainlander joke. But as soon as we turn into Elmley’s two-mile driveway – made by Canadian soldiers garrisoned here during the second world war – I’m bewitched by its empty, echoing charm and darting birdlife. There are six huts to stay in on the reserve. Made of sustainable wood or corrugated iron, with epic views and nice touches like hot-water bottles and chunky woollen throws (some have kitchenettes too), they are spread out to ensure privacy and full nature immersion. The reserve’s 18th-century farmhouse is now open after renovation: marrying sweeping views of the reserve to a high-spec modern kitchen with glamorous vintage vibe, it can be rented in its entirety (sleeps 12, plus two children) or as individual rooms for B&amp;B stays during the week. There’s a new cottage too, sleeping 10, with wraparound windows and a spacious living area. At the heart of the reserve is a beautiful 19th-century barn: popular for weddings, it also serves as a communal space for guests with board games and movie projectors for rainy days, and there’s an honesty bar stocked with local wines and beers. Solar energy powers the whole place. After checking out the hut we’re staying in, the Ferryman’s (with room, too, for a couple of kids on a hammock or pull-out bed, and an outdoor shower as well as indoor bathroom), we’ve time for a pre-dinner stroll through Elmley’s wildlife-rich marshes and meadows. We follow a gravel track along the seawall to the first of the reserve’s four hides and gaze out over one of the most important sites in the UK for breeding waders. In winter, tens of thousands of lapwings (a particular success story here), redshanks, golden plovers, teals and wigeons fill the skies, while short-eared owls are also common; birds such as oystercatchers and marsh harriers can be seen here all year round while autumn sees migrants such as green sandpiper and whimbrel stop over en route to Africa. Further on, other hides offer more unbroken views over shallow ponds, wetlands and grasslands. Spitend Hide, on the eastern tip, overlooks the Swale Estuary – and those who make the 3½-mile walk will find a hamper there filled with blankets and treats. We wander back before nightfall, clouds of dragonflies dancing in the early evening light, the sound of marsh frogs filling the air. There’s no on-site restaurant at Elmley but homecooked meals, made using local produce, can be delivered in hampers to your hut. We dine outside on delicious rich veggie and beef stews and chocolate cake, sitting around the firepit as the stars come out, and sleep with the curtains open, waking to see the sunrise. After breakfast Gareth takes us on to the Swale on his boat to visit the Edith May, a spectacular, restored 1906 Thames barge which recently started offering sailing trips (from £15). Barges like this were once used to transport grain and bricks along the Swale to the centre of London, returning with horse dung for the fields. (Thames barges were the last trading vessels in Europe to carry cargo under sail alone, finally finishing commercially in 1970.) It’s a great way to take in the wild expanses of a corner of Kent that deserves more love. • The trip was provided by Elmley Nature Reserve.

It’s a sunny noontime and the insect flexes, absorbing solar energy, keeping wing patterns moving to ensure its profile is never still enough to be identified in any bird’s-eye view. The hedge has been flailed, its branch ends shattered and raw, the result of savage violence that makes the small tortoiseshell appear so vulnerable, like a child on a highway. Butterflies are not as delicate as they look. This one has survived the winter, roused from torpor by a warm spell only to be blasted by chill winds and having to retreat again into the half-death of hibernation. Predation from mice (in sheds) or great tits (in tree holes) can make hibernating deadly. Wings with bold orange, black and white markings edged with blue dots on top for intimidating flight, and dead leaf camouflage beneath for invisibility – the small tortoiseshells have adapted to predators well. But this has not saved them from Sturmia bella, a fly that lays its eggs on nettles, their main food plant; the spiny fetish caterpillar ingests the eggs, which hatch and feed on juices inside their host until it pupates, dies and the flies emerge. The small tortoiseshell population has crashed by 75% since 1976 – last year was its worst – though the fly was not recorded in Britain before 1999. There will be other contributing factors such as climate change, insecticides and other chemical pollution. The small tortoiseshell, Aglais urticae, gets the second part of its scientific name from Urtica, the stinging nettles that support two or three butterfly generations a year; big clumps in full sun are best, but so many nettle patches have been cleared and sprayed. Aglais are the brush-footed butterflies – which include the peacock butterflies also bursting through April sunlight – so essential for pollinating. As the blackthorn winter – the white blossom pulse at the end of March/beginning of April – fades, flowers such as dandelion, ground ivy and celandine receive the attention of butterflies that, despite the hardships they’ve endured, look so vivid of colour and vital of movement. Let’s hope this is a better year for them."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2019/oct/12/how-real-saudi-arabia-interest-renewable-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2019-10-12T11:00:20Z","webTitle":"How real is Saudi Arabia's  interest in renewable energy?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/12/how-real-saudi-arabia-interest-renewable-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2019/oct/12/how-real-saudi-arabia-interest-renewable-energy","fields":{"headline":"How real is Saudi Arabia's  interest in renewable energy?","bodyText":"It was the largest renewables project ever announced: $200bn (£158bn) worth of solar panels stretching across hundreds of square kilometres of the Saudi Arabian desert. The massive solar initiative was billed by the kingdom’s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, as a “huge step in human history” when it was unveiled in March last year. It was cancelled by October. The collapse of the project was typical of the ambitious renewable schemes touted by Saudi Arabia in the past decade, analysts say. Headline-grabbing announcements have often been followed by limited progress. At the same time, the country has ramped up its fossil fuel production and continued to lobby to soften the terms of global carbon emissions-reduction agreements. Middle Eastern oil producers used to be open about how renewables were a threat to their prosperity. “Back even in 2010, you couldn’t talk about the energy transition or playing a positive role in climate negotiations in those countries,” says Glada Lahn, a senior research fellow at Chatham House. That resistance has lessened, Lahn says, though not necessarily out of concern for the environment. Saudi Arabia, for one, has come to see the value of renewables to supplement the huge volumes of oil and gas used to desalinate the kingdom’s water supply and keep the country’s population cool during the summer. Less consumption at home means there will be more oil and gas to sell abroad, Lahn says, or to hold in excess as a means of regulating the world’s supply. Renewables also mean new jobs: a crucial goal of the kingdom’s plan to future-proof the Saudi Arabian economy by relying less on the vast oil reserve beneath its sands. The recasting of green energy as a national interest, coupled with record low prices for solar and wind power in particular, has raised hopes that this latest push by the kingdom to build renewable capacity might be more successful. Saudi Arabia recently tripled its renewable energy target and has successfully tendered for large-scale projects in wind and solar energy. Yet alongside this, over the past decade, Saudi Arabia has increased its oil production by 2m barrels a day. Even the United Arab Emirates, a frontrunner in the region responsible for nearly 70% of all installed renewable capacity in the Arab Gulf in the past four years, has increased its oil production by 800,000 barrels a day over the past decade. “You always have that paradigm between what the governments [in the region] say in terms of energy policy – that they want to get away from oil dependence, for environmental as well as for financial reasons – and what they do,” says Homayoun Falakshahi, an oil and gas equity analyst at the energy intelligence firm Kpler. “In practice, they are actually increasing their production capacity and putting out tenders for more work to be done in their oilfields.” Steep curbs on fossil-fuel use, of the kinds scientists say are required to prevent catastrophic increases in global temperatures, would significantly hurt the bottom lines of the region’s state-owned oil companies. Saudi Arabia’s state-owned oil giant Aramco, the greatest contributor to global carbon emissions of any company in the world since 1965, said as much in a 469-page prospectus it issued in April before the company’s first international bond offering. Under “risk factors”, it warned investors that popular concerns about the climate crisis, as well as its physical impacts on the planet, “could shift demand to lower carbon intensity fossil fuels … [and] have a material adverse effect on the company’s business”. Aramco directed questions about the prospectus to the Saudi Arabian government. The kingdom’s ministry of energy has been contacted for comment. Wealthy oil states have played a key role in shaping global negotiations about how sharply and quickly carbon emissions are to be reduced. “The Saudis in particular, but others along with them, have been active since the beginning of this process,” says Alden Meyer, the policy director at the Union of Concerned Scientists, who has attended every session of the UN’s climate negotiations since they commenced in 1991. That year, Meyer says, the Saudis and the Kuwaitis worked with fossil-fuel industry lobbyists to argue for provisions in the interests of gas and oil producers, for example mandating that every decision had to be taken by consensus of all 195 parties, rather than by a large majority. That remains the way the negotiations are conducted, allowing wealthy oil states but also major coal exporters such as Australia to carve out exemptions and water down agreements. “[The consensus rule] has stacked the international regime in favour of the laggards, the profiteers and the status quo,” says Richie Merzian, a former climate negotiator for the Australian government who now directs the climate programme at the Australia Institute, a progressive thinktank. The oil-rich states were also instrumental in introducing the idea of “response measures” into climate negotiations: the idea that states should not just be compensated for the impacts of climate change – rising sea levels, extreme weather, record-breaking heat – but for the revenue fossil-fuel producers will lose as the world transitions to less carbon-intensive energy. At best, response measures have become a channel for discussion of how to ease this transition for people such as fossil-fuel industry workers who might lose their jobs as a result of climate action. But it also means critical time is spent at many negotiations discussing how to assist some of the wealthiest countries and corporations in the world, says Merzian."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2022/dec/08/australia-news-live-updates-politics-tanya-plibersek-environment-protection-agency-energy-anthony-albanese-chris-bowen-penny-wong-china-us-diplomacy-covid","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-08T07:50:02Z","webTitle":"Andrews on track to surpass 2018 result – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2022/dec/08/australia-news-live-updates-politics-tanya-plibersek-environment-protection-agency-energy-anthony-albanese-chris-bowen-penny-wong-china-us-diplomacy-covid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2022/dec/08/australia-news-live-updates-politics-tanya-plibersek-environment-protection-agency-energy-anthony-albanese-chris-bowen-penny-wong-china-us-diplomacy-covid","fields":{"headline":"Andrews on track to surpass 2018 result – as it happened","bodyText":"That’s where we will wrap up the live blog today on a busy day of news. Here’s the key points for today: After a meeting of energy ministers in Brisbane today, Chris Bowen announced an agreement on a “capacity mechanism” which he said would be “keeping the lights on” so there were fewer outages when there was high demand. This comes ahead of the national cabinet meeting tomorrow where it is expected the federal government will seek an agreement with the states on a cap on coal to lower energy costs across the country. The NSW energy minister, Matt Kean, indicated NSW was close to an agreement but stressed the state was not seeking compensation for missed royalties, but for the impact it would have on families and businesses. A former Department of Social Services official told a royal commission he was “directed” to water down legal concerns about the robodebt scheme when the policy was been designed in early 2015. The federal government announced overhauls to Australia’s environment laws, including plans to establish an environmental protection agency. The Greens said they would use their boosted numbers in the parliament to push the government to ensure the environmental protection agency is independent and has teeth, while the Coalition expressed concern it would be detrimental to business ahead of a briefing on the plans tomorrow. The home affairs minister, Clare O’Neil, announced the government would embark on a new cybersecurity strategy led by three eminent Australians, the former Telstra CEO Andy Penn, Cyber Security Cooperative Research Centre CEO Rachael Falk and Air Marshal Mel Hupfeld. O’Neil also announced two new department-led reviews looking at Australia’s national resilience and democracy resilience. The federal government is looking at counterterrorism legislation to see whether it adequately covers far-right extremism. John Pesutto has been chosen to lead the Victorian Liberal party after defeating Brad Battin in a party room ballot. The NSW government will support an Indigenous voice to parliament being enshrined in the constitution. Until tomorrow, enjoy your evening. ‘Convivial’ energy ministers' meeting a ‘universe away’ from Morrison times Energy ministers are heading for Brisbane airport (save Mick de Brenni, Queensland’s minister), generally satisfied with the “team Australia” outcomes today. What might be surprising is that the issue of coal and gas price caps barely got a mention at the event. Federal, state and territory ministers focused on medium- to long-term issues, leaving the immediate issue of price caps and compensation (if there is any) to the “first ministers” when they meet tomorrow. Indeed, whether the price of coal will be capped at $125 a tonne and gas at $8-$12/gigajoule (or lower than the $13/GJ being bandied out) remains to be seen. “Numbers were studiously not mentioned” in the chatter on the sidelines of the event, one participant tells Guardian Australia. The federal energy minister, Chris Bowen, and NSW counterpart (and treasurer), Matt Kean, were “quite convivial” throughout, said our insider. Indeed, the whole meeting was of such a mood. “It’s a universe away from what it used to be,” this person tells us, adding such gatherings during the previous Coalition government of Scott Morrison had been “a complete waste”. The main achievement was the creation of a capacity investment scheme as noted in earlier posts, which effectively kills off work done by the Energy Security Board to create a capacity market that might have paid mothballed coal- and gas-fired power plants to stay in business. Other work to watch includes a National Renewable Energy Supply Chain Action Plan (not a very snappy name) that will create job opportunities in manufacturing. It is to be developed by the end of 2023, and is being led by Queensland’s de Brenni. Landholders petition NSW energy minister over Santos Narrabri gas project More than 200 concerned landholders have petitioned the NSW energy minister to stop Santos from entering farming land for its proposed 400km underground gas pipeline, AAP reports. The Hunter gas pipeline would connect the $3.6bn Narrabri gas project on NSW’s northern tablelands to Newcastle and the east coast market. However, oil and gas giant Santos can’t proceed with land surveys without approval from the energy minister, Matt Kean. Farmers and environmentalists on Thursday delivered a petition from 215 landholders along the pipeline’s route to Kean’s office. The petition said the pipeline would disrupt and jeopardise high-value farmland and become a stranded asset as the energy sector transforms. Victoria Congdon, whose property in the Upper Hunter Valley touches the 30-metre-wide pipeline corridor, said the project would require substantial environmental damage. “It’s an obscene imposition on landholders, who have to modify their lives for a project that is outdated and not wanted,” she said. The western Liverpool Plains beef farmer Margaret Fleck said the gas pipeline could upset the delicate environment in the area, particularly groundwater feeding the Great Artesian Basin. Santos has said the proposed land survey activities would be undertaken by specialist consultants operating under the company’s supervision. “Before any survey works commence, Santos will meet with landholders to obtain consent on the areas of property to access and on what and when this will occur,” it said. Victoria’s Andrews government is set to surpass its 2018 historic “Danslide” on Friday with Labor claiming the seat of Pakenham on Thursday afternoon. Emma Vulin, Labor’s candidate for the newly created seat, in Melbourne’s south-east, claimed victory on Thursday afternoon. The electorate equals 55 seats in the lower house for Labor – the same landslide victory the party achieved in 2018. Vulin won the seat on a two-party preferred basis by 307 votes with a margin of 0.39%. In a Facebook post, Vulin vowed to advocate for the “diverse community” and ensure infrastructure met the area’s needs: I would like to thank the people of the Pakenham district for putting their faith in me. I will advocate for our community in Spring Street with the same fight that saw me rehabilitate after my stroke. I am eager to meet everyone and listen to the needs of our wonderful fast growing and diverse community and ensure we have the services and infrastructure that we need as we grow. Labor is also ahead in the seat of Bass – the final seat to be called – but the Victorian Electoral Commission said the formal distribution of preferences would be finalised on Friday. Capacity plan would unlock $10bn in new clean energy, Bowen says As we flagged, the energy ministers have agreed on a capacity investment scheme that will drive as much as $10bn of investment into “new renewable dispatchable capacity” for the grid. Critics have sought to deride the intermittency of wind and solar energy as meaning they were fundamentally less reliable than “baseload” coal and gas-fired power plants (when the latter don’t break down). Anyway, under this new arrangement, the commonwealth will open tenders for projects that add storage and even new generation projects themselves. There will be an agreed minimum payment for the winning bidders as a way to underwrite them, and also a “ceiling price” should revenue exceed a certain level (and the profits shared). Critically, fossil-fuel plants, existing or future, would not be eligible to apply. (No mention of small modular nuclear reactors but presumably that’s a problem to resolve in a decade or later.) States like NSW and Victoria reckon the capacity investment scheme will be very good for their existing programs to ramp up renewables – as do the other states or they wouldn’t have signed up. Groups like the Smart Energy Council have applauded the results as finally delivering a national plan for renewable energy generation and storage. “That means cheaper, cleaner and more reliable power for all Australians,” the council’s CEO, John Grimes, said. He called on governments to turn their gaze now to a small-scale scheme that would roll out batteries for homes, much like a similar program accelerated the take-up of rooftop solar panels that now dot about one-third of Australian homes. Likewise, Kane Thornton, the CEO of the Clean Energy Council, hailed today’s approval as likely to “unlock the next wave of renewable energy projects”. “Energy storage will play a crucial role in supporting the massive amounts of new wind and solar needed for the future,” Thornton said. “While measures to accelerate storage rollout are important, we also need to develop the markets and technical frameworks that will enable stable, long-term investment in storage.” Here is today’s Afternoon Update if you are looking to catch up: Medibank to go offline this weekend for system overhaul Medibank is advising it will take its systems offline for Medibank and ahm customers from 8.30pm AEDT Friday 9 December “as we undertake some maintenance to further strengthen our systems and enhance security protections”. It’s the first major overhaul of the company’s systems since the massive cyber-attack resulted in the personal details of close to 10 million current and former customers being posted on the dark web, including the personal medical claims for 210,000 customers. Medibank has advised customers this is “a planned operation with Microsoft and is the next necessary phase of our ongoing work to further safeguard our network”. The systems will be back online by Sunday 11 December, the company has said, but while they are down, customers won’t be able to access Medibank or ahm services online or through the app, and on-the-spot claims won’t be available. Retail stores and customer contact centres will be closed on Saturday and will reopen on Monday. Amplar Health services will not be affected. Melissa Caddick’s jewellery and designer clothes a hit at auction The fraudster Melissa Caddick’s extensive array of jewellery has sold at auction in Sydney for more than $800,000, with some items attracting as much as three times their estimated value, AAP reports. Buyers overwhelmed Smith &amp; Singer auction house on Wednesday night for a chance to bid on the 53-piece collection once owned by the con artist, as well as a selection of designer clothes and accessories. Caddick, 49, disappeared in November 2020 after federal authorities raided her home as part of an investigation into a $23m Ponzi scheme she had been running. With the notoriety likely to have intensified interest in the items, a number fetched far in excess of their reserve. The most spectacular piece, a Canturi necklace with diamonds surrounding 13 black sapphires, went for $130,000. Caddick originally bought the Stella necklace for $370,000 in 2015. The matching Stella ring sold for $14,000, while the accompanying earrings fetched $7,500. Her 18-carat gold, diamond and emerald Geometric Lace earrings, valued at between $2,500 and $3,400, went for $10,000. Another pair of white gold Canturi Cubism earrings sold for $8,500, despite a starting price of $2,000. A matching bracelet, valued at $7,000, sold for $24,000. Caddick’s artwork, luxury goods and designer clothes have also gone under the hammer with the profits to be returned to her scam victims. Four artworks alone sold for a total of $48,000. Victoria’s First Peoples’ Assembly urges Labor to raise the age Victoria’s First Peoples’ Assembly has urged the re-elected Andrews government to raise the age of criminal responsibility from 10 to 14 ahead of a meeting of the nation’s attorneys general on Friday. Raising the age of criminal responsibility will be on the agenda when attorneys general from federal, state and territory governments meet virtually on Friday. The assembly – the body democratically elected to negotiate an Indigenous treaty framework in Victoria – says the state government is “now on notice” to move on the law reform. The co-chair of the assembly, Geraldine Atkinson, says the reform should not wait for the state’s formal treaty negotiations which are due to kick off next year: I’m bitterly disappointed that there’s been no movement, so the government is now on notice. Our children will not be used as bargaining chips, the reform needs to happen and it needs to happen now ... Ten years old, that’s so young. It’s like a baby to me. Our children need love and a helping hand, not to be thrown into concrete cells. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, this week said his government backed a nationally consistent approach on changing the age of criminal responsibility. The Northern Territory has become the first jurisdiction to raise the age of responsibility from 10 to 12 but Indigenous and legal advocacy groups say it doesn’t go far enough and still locks children in detention. State energy ministers hail capacity mechanism agreement The Queensland energy minister, Mick de Brenni, says the new scheme to underwrite renewables will be the death of “Angus Taylor and Scott Morrison’s CoalKeeper”, and will be sensible market reform resulting in new energy insurance on the grid: This is about prices, because only when the market is dominated by clean, renewable energy will we see wholesale energy prices come down permanently. Secondly, Australia’s renewable energy transformation is our opportunity to bring back manufacturing to Australia. The NSW minister, Matt Kean, thanks Bowen for constructive discussions. He says on coal caps that NSW is not seeking compensation for lost royalties, but financial assistance for families and businesses for doing what needs to be done to lower bills. He says they’re close to landing a deal but will say more tomorrow. After Kean, there’s the Victorian minister, Lily D’Ambrosio, who says the deal signed today will help Victoria meet its renewable energy targets: Victoria has always had a strong view when it comes to the creation of a capacity mechanism. That is it was to have no fossil fuels incentivised for a future that has to be carbon emissions free. Today, I am really pleased we have all agreed on a capacity mechanism that will do just that. Thank you very much, Chris, it has been fantastic working with you today, it will enable us as a state to meet our ambitious renewable energy target. No more coal generation by 2025, but importantly also supporting our nation-leading energy storage targets that we announced back in September. Tomorrow’s national cabinet to discuss power prices, Bowen says Bowen adds there will be more coming out from national cabinet tomorrow, where possible ways to reduce power prices will be discussed. It is no secret we are also engaging with the states. Frankly, particularly with those states with coal production, New South Wales and Queensland, about the right model going forward to ensure the impact of Vladimir Putin’s war does not flow through without a response from Australia’s government on energy prices. The fact of the matter is we have certain powers at the federal level, states have certain powers, and we have been working together to work out how those powers can come together. It is not the fault of Australians our power prices are so high. The cost of production hasn’t gone up. What is happening, because every country around the world, every government is dealing with these challenges, and we are dealing with them as well, and I look forward to further discussions and announcements tomorrow. It is fair to say that governments are working very closely together. After a meeting of energy ministers in Brisbane today, the federal climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, announces an agreement on a “capacity mechanism” he says will be “keeping the lights on”. Bowen says: The capacity mechanism, which we will implement in partnership with the states and territories, will see the commonwealth call options, for bids, for the special renewable energy that the commonwealth will underwrite going forward. This is a sensible, carefully designed mechanism which will unleash investment in clean, dispatchable energy right across Australia. It will firm up our grids, providing extra capacity as more and more power stations leave the power grid, as more and more coal-fired power stations close, we will firm the grid going forward. As we know, in the last decade four megawatts of energy left the system and only one came in. He says there will be more detailed discussion about the design elements but today is a big step forward. I’m delighted with the conversation we had around the table, delighted with the support from state and territory colleagues as always. It is one team working together to get the job done. Environmental law reforms aren’t balanced enough towards business: Coalition After Hanson-Young, there’s the Coalition’s environment spokesperson, Jonathon Duniam. He says he is “very concerned” there isn’t enough balance towards business in the environment package, but notes it is light on detail. At a time when energy prices are going up and you hear all this rhetoric around no new coal and gas, and shutting down certain elements of the economy, that is not good legislative reform. We’ve got to get a balance here, that’s what the minister promised, and I’m concerned that’s not what we’re going to get at the end the process. He mentions he hasn’t had a briefing yet – but will tomorrow. He is also concerned about an independent agency having the powers to make decisions separated from ministers or the parliament. It’s a big problem if you don’t design it properly. I don’t know what the minister has in mind. A number of business groups, individual businesses and other sectoral interests have gone to the minister and suggested she look at a better decision process. A five-year appointment perhaps, this person can only be removed in some the most extreme circumstances. To interpret whatever information they have before them. Again, at the end of the day, will the green groups and others who are opposed to certain elements of economic activity take this to the courts? We have to find balance. It’s what we’ve been promised and I’m looking desperately for it but yet to find it. Environmental law reforms ‘a long time coming’: Greens The Greens’ environment spokesperson Sarah Hanson-Young is on ABC’s Afternoon Briefing to discuss the government’s announced plans for a federal environmental protection agency and associated law reforms. Hanson-Young says the law reforms are “a long time coming” but the devil will be in the detail as to whether the agency will have teeth to act on putting the environment first. One of the problems we’ve had now is that our environment laws have really been servicing the needs of business and development. Meanwhile our forests, bushland, native animals have suffered. We are now in an extinction crisis, we have to hold that and turn it around, we need to end native forest logging and put a climate trigger in these environment laws to make sure we can put a stop to those damaging, more damaging to loosen from new coal and gas. She said the timeframes outlined today were too long, and the Greens would be using their power with the balance of power in the Senate to push the government further on it. We are not rubber-stamping anything, we will use our power in the parliament to make sure we look to push the government to go faster and stronger. She says the laws need to be strong enough, and enforced, and the agency must be independent, and stresses “the environment is in crisis. We need to go faster sooner”. This is core business for the Greens. We are in the balance of power, we do have clout, and we want to work with the government, we want to work with the government to fix our environment laws and make sure this package delivers for the environment. They are meant to be environment protection laws, not business protection laws. Energy ministers’ meeting extended as capacity plan gets nod The federal, state and territory energy ministers meeting in Brisbane today have added another half hour to their planned five-hour gathering to get through their lengthy agenda. Guardian Australia understands a plan to provide incentives to accelerate the take-up of new storage has got the nod from the ministers. Many jurisdictions now have targets to introduce new batteries and other forms of storage to help stabilise electricity supplies when the proverbial “wind doesn’t blow and sun doesn’t shine”. More shortly, when the ministers turn up for a media conference at 3.30pm local time (4.30pm AEDT). In the meantime, you can follow along here too: Flood-affected tourism operators open for business Flood-affected tourism operators along the Murray River are open for business and want to spread the word to holiday-makers, AAP reports. At Echuca on the Victorian-NSW border, Campaspe Lodge owner David Connally said businesses were facing cancellations and trepidation from tourists. “People are just unsure,” Connally told AAP. “If the media could start to give us some positive press that we are open and it’s all good, that would be great.” The motel owner said road closure notifications were often out-of-date and flood warnings painted a pessimistic picture for tourists. “You’re driving around and the radio station is saying minor flood warnings for Echuca and downstream from Rochester, which is probably accurate as measurement goes, but not accurate by what is happening,” he said. Connally, whose motel overlooks the Campaspe River, said bookings were significantly below typical early summer levels. “We have had cancellations for sure,” he said. “When people Google you they’re like, ‘Oh gee, they’re right next to the river’.” Between October and December, floods in Tasmania, NSW and Victoria have led to $477m in insured losses across 17,200 claims, according to Insurance Council of Australia data. Tourism operators face a third summer without a peak season since the Covid-19 pandemic began in 2020. A Murray River Tourism Board survey found almost 80% of tourism and accommodation businesses had suffered at least a 40% reduction in bookings for the upcoming high season. Board acting chief executive Will Flamsteed said tourism businesses no longer had the financial buffers to withstand the disaster and one in five had been forced to stand down staff. “As many as two-thirds of tourism businesses in the region have only minor infrastructure damage or were not directly inundated,” Flamsteed said. “But they are severely impacted by the lack of visitors and summer booking cancellations, resulting in an estimated $128m in lost income.” The board and the Victoria Tourism Industry Council welcomed state government assistance to date, but they have called for more support to cover lost income for cancelled bookings and public events, and to drive the industry’s recovery in 2023. “If we want a tourism industry along the Murray next Easter, we need to step up and support these businesses,” council chief executive Felicia Mariani said. Emergency services reported a relatively settled 24-hour period overnight, with 84 requests for assistance, including 55 trees down across Victoria. Emergency Victoria has issued a final flood warning for the Campaspe River downstream of Rochester, where no further flooding is expected. Ross River virus and Barmah Forest virus have been detected in mosquito populations in Campaspe, Horsham and Loddon local government areas. The chief health officer has warned people in or travelling to those areas to cover-up, use repellent and remove stagnant water from around the home. A major flood warning remains in place in northeastern parts of Mildura in northwest Victoria. Authorities warn it is not safe to return for residents of Nichols Point, Bruces Bend and surrounding areas. Storms worsening in Queensland Glenn Alderton, the director of Queensland Fire and Emergency Services, told ABC News that they had 40 jobs overnight as a result of mostly wind damage. He said people should prepare for the coming storms this afternoon. It is anywhere from I guess Rockhampton through the Central Highlands and down through the Sunshine Coast, Brisbane, Gold Coast and out through the Lockyer Valley. So anywhere in the area, severe thunderstorms are probable. Just outside of that, some possibility of some severe thunderstorms as well. It is quite a large area. Whether the whole area gets affected or not, we will wait and see, but generally if you are in south-east Queensland, even the Sunshine Coast area, urge you to do some preparation this afternoon should we see them tonight. Calls for Queensland to slash ‘absolute rip-off’ learner’s permit fee Queensland drivers pay more than any other state or territory for a learner’s permit, prompting calls for the government to slash the $186.55 fee, AAP reports. Young drivers are slugged more than seven times the permit cost of other states in what Liberal National leader David Crisafulli labelled an “absolute rip-off”. In comparison, a permit costs $25 in the Northern Territory and $26 in NSW and Victoria. “Queensland learners pay the highest fee in the country by a country mile to get their learners,” Crisafulli told reports on Thursday. “These learner drivers are starting out in life ... the learner’s is a key to opening up a future for a young person. It’s the ability to take a step towards getting your own job and your own independence. “It is time to end this rip-off, and it is time to stop the madness of Queenslanders paying the highest fees in the nation to get their learners.” Crisafulli said Queenslanders were already feeling the pinch as everyday costs spiral out of control. “It’s time this government gave these kids a break,” he said. Transport minister Mark Bailey transport confirmed the costs were being scrutinised. “A review is now under way into all Queensland licence fees, including C class, R and RE class, P class, L class, and others,” Bailey said. However, the minister fell short of promising to lower licence fees, saying “I’ll let the department conduct that review and provide an update to any potential changes to licence fees as soon as possible.” Baggage handlers filmed throwing luggage fired The ABC is reporting two of the baggage handlers who were filmed throwing luggage and slamming bags onto a conveyor belt at Melbourne airport have been fired. The men were employees of Qantas subcontractor Swissport, which Qantas uses to perform “ground handling services” at Melbourne airport. The men were stood down pending an investigation by Swissport, and Qantas would not have allowed them to service Qantas airlines again. Former social services official voiced robodebt concerns with DHS officials [continued from previous post] Whitecross said he had earlier articulated his concerns about the proposal in a meeting with DHS officials including Mark Withnell, who was involved in drafting documents explaining the plan. I felt very strongly about this issue and I wanted to convey the strength of my feelings [about the lack of quality of the proposal],” he said. [Withnell] seemed to be particularly unhappy that I was suggesting we wouldn’t be able to realise the level of savings he’d estimated. I formed the impression there was an attachment at more senior levels to that level of savings. It was that sort of sense that the [$1.2nbn] number was not a number that had come out of a methodology, but that the number itself was a goal of the process. Whitecross assumed Golightly had been among those attached to the plan. He couldn’t comment on whether Campbell was also when asked. But the inquiry heard yesterday the ultimate policy proposal “misrepresented” the nature of the robodebt scheme, apparently paving the way for it to be implemented without legal change. Halbert will give evidence later today while Withnell is scheduled to give evidence tomorrow. The royal commission continues. A former Department of Social Services official has told a royal commission he was “directed” to water down legal concerns about the robodebt scheme when the policy was been designed in early 2015. Andrew Whitecross, a former mid-level official at DSS, had been involved in commenting on what became the initial plan for the robodebt scheme that was briefed to the then social services minister Scott Morrison. The royal commission heard Whitecross and a colleague, Murray Kimber, had fiercely criticised the proposal in January 2015, questioning its legality and fairness as well as the estimated budget savings. But Whitecross said he was told to water down those concerns by his boss, acting deputy secretary, Catherine Halbert, before the feedback was passed onto the Department of Human Services (DHS), which was formulating the plan. Whitecross claimed Halbert had said she had spoken to her counterpart at DHS, Malisa Golightly, who had “expressed her concerns about the strength of DSS’ comments”. “She [Halbert] wanted me to tone down the comments that Murray had provided in his response,” Whitecross said. “I took it as a direction,” Whitecross added. “We had a disagreement in the conversation about that. I believed the policy wasn’t well developed and lacked merit … and we should be fairly forceful in communicating that.” Whitecross subsequently provided new comments that watered down the advice, though his revisions still noted the robodebt plan would need legislative change. Those proposals were sent to Morrison in February 2015 after being finalised by Golightly and the secretary of the department, Kathryn Campbell. [continued] NSW ‘almost ready to sign up’ to coal price cap, Kean says Matt Kean, NSW’s treasurer and energy minister, has told reporters in Brisbane that his state is “almost ready to sign up” to a price cap on black coal. The comments, made as Kean arrived at an energy ministers’ meeting with his federal counterpart Chris Bowen, came a day before the premiers and chief ministers are due to discuss ways to lower energy prices. Guardian Australia understands the coal price cap being discussed is still $125/tonne, with a $12-$14/gigajoule price being discussed at the “first ministers” level. “It’s not about royalties, it’s about consumers,” Kean told the reporters, in comments broadcast by Sky News. “NSW is prepared to take the hit” by not seeking compensation. Such a move would no doubt be welcomed by the Albanese government – if that is indeed NSW’s position. The Queensland government anticipates it will come under pressure to back down on its compensation claims should its southern neighbour offer concessions. Separately, the energy ministers’ meeting remains on track to agree to the next steps for a capacity investment mechanism. That scheme is likely to set up a minimum price to support the acceleration of new batteries and other storage to be added to the grid. Related renewable energy may also get added incentives. Anyway, we’ll get more details at 4pm AEDT (3pm in Queensland) when the energy ministers’ meeting breaks up. Queensland receives funding for plan to use drones to collect patient samples Pathology test times would shorten by up to six hours under a plan for drones to collect samples from hard-to-reach patients in south-east Queensland, AAP reports. The project between Mater Pathology and drone logistics company Swoop Aero has been awarded $1.8m in federal funding to expand operations. Faster deliveries are predicted to slash times for urgent blood samples and other tests at Mater’s Springfield laboratories, with patients on islands off the Queensland coast among those to benefit. The new drone fleet is expected to collect more than 80,000 samples a year. “There’s no doubt that drones can help to improve a range of health services for Queenslanders ... especially those living in remote or hard to access locations,” Mater director of innovation Maree Knight said. The service will cover patients at the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Community Health Service on Stradbroke Island, as well as other patients across Russell Island, Macleay Island, the Redlands and Hope Island on the Gold Coast. Mater general manager Deb Hornsby said it would be the first pathology service in Australia to collect samples with drones. “Drones are safe, reliable and so much faster than ferries and cars, which means we save valuable time in diagnosing and treating vulnerable patients,” she said. The Emerging Aviation Technology Partnerships funding will also provide end-to-end logistics services to the Darling Downs Health and Hospital Service and Pathology Queensland. Infrastructure minister Catherine King said the program will improve health services for regional communities, while also enhancing the capability of Australian businesses to deliver more complex aviation operations. Swoop Aero CEO Eric Peck said the partnership will support “the world’s first and largest fully integrated drone logistics network”. Australia raises concerns with Indonesia after Bali bomb maker’s release The Australian government has sought assurances from the Indonesian government that Bali bomb maker Umar Patek will be subject to ongoing supervision and says his release from prison will “deeply hurt” many Australians. The government also says it has raised concerns about Patek’s release with the Indonesian government numerous times. Patek, 55, was jailed for 20 years in 2012 after being found guilty of mixing bombs that killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, in 2002. He was released from prison in Surabaya yesterday morning. The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has issued the following statement: Many Australians will be deeply hurt by the release of Umar Patek. Today our thoughts are with the victims and survivors of the Bali bombings and their families. We have registered our concerns about Umar Patek’s release with the Indonesian Government on multiple occasions. Umar Patek’s release is a matter for the Government of Indonesia and its domestic legal processes, but we have sought assurances from the Indonesian Government that he will be subject to ongoing supervision and monitoring, in accordance with Indonesia’s approach to de-radicalisation. Australia condemns acts of terrorism and those who perpetrate violence on innocent victims, and will continue to work closely with the Indonesian Government on counter-terrorism cooperation. Earlier, the minister for home affairs, Clare O’Neil, told the National Press Club it was a “horrible” day for families of the Bali bombing victims. Australians would be feeling aggrieved by the development, she said. With those adorable images of Pocock with baby animals, I bid you adieu and leave you in the excellent hands of Josh Taylor. Pocock supports inclusion of native forestry logging in new environmental laws ABC’s Ros Childs also asked David Pocock about two of the issues that the Australian Conservation Foundation flagged they wanted to see the government go further on – applying the laws to all industries, including native forest logging, as well as the need for a climate trigger to give the minister the option to block fossil fuel projects. Pocock is on the same page as the ACF, saying he would support both. On logging: That was very clear in the Samuel review, we have to ensure that our regional forestry agreements are brought under our environmental laws. It is potentially something that can be done relatively quickly while the big consultation and drafting process happens. I would absolutely support that. There is a whole bunch of species that are now endangered that rely on habitat that could potentially be logged. On a climate trigger: I’m on the record saying that the minister should absolutely have that ability. So many of our endangered species are heat sensitive. You look at something like the greater glider – climate change is and will affect them. The Great Barrier Reef affected by climate change. Graeme in his review, his view was that a climate trigger or that sort of mechanism could be elsewhere. We currently don’t have it elsewhere so it would make sense even in the meantime to include that environmental law while we do the bigger piece of work drafting environmental laws that are fit for purpose. We have to be looking after environment for future generations, Pocock says We brought you the news earlier of David Pocock’s response to the new federal environmental laws, urging the Albanese government to commit enough funds to deliver on the environment minsiter Tanya Plibersek’s promises. In his interview with ABC News, Pocock said committing funds to stop extinction is an investment in the future. It’s a sentiment that was underscored for him at a press conference he held specifically on the occasion of the release of the Samuel Review, which featured baby wombats, possums and humans. Pocock told the ABC: Seeing the way that kids light up when they see our wildlife up close, we have to be looking after it for future generations. We are [only] spending about 15% of what we need to spend to halt extinctions. It’s a bold commitment but it is something that we absolutely should be doing. Nathalia warned to stay indoors as chemical hazard warning issued The town of Nathalia in northern Victoria is being warned to stay indoors after a chemical hazard warning was issued by authorities. ‘We stood up to a bully and we won’: home affairs minister on Medibank hacker O’Neil is asked about the Medibank hacker group’s last upload to the dark web saying it was the final tranche of stolen information. I think the best evidence that we have at the moment is that the hackers have dumped the remaining data and walked away, seeing that they are not going to get payment out of the attempted situation that they tried to create. But one of the most disturbing aspects of these incidents is that once stolen, the data is gone. And this is the same with Optus. However, she goes on to praise the way the nation reacted to the attack: As cybersecurity minister, I felt so proud of how Australia handled that situation. There was data circulating about Australians that was extremely sensitive and hurtful. I did not see any of it printed in newspapers, didn’t see it circulating on social media, and I didn’t see anyone seriously argue that Medibank should have paid the ransom and then we could have all gone off into our fairyland thinking that would solve the problem. From my perspective we stood up to a bully and we won. Guardian Australia’s very own Josh Butler asks about rightwing extremism. Where does this issue rank in terms of threats that you have to address in your portfolio and what work is being done in this area generally and specifically about hate speech and radicalisation online? O’Neil: One of the trends I just referred to earlier is this proliferation of ideologies that are driving people to violence. We see big groups of people who are still on a religious fundamentalism pathway but now a very large group of people who are of interest who subscribe to various forms of rightwing nationalism, Nazism, those sorts of things and it’s obviously enormously concerning. We had the Christchurch bombing which was an Australian committing a heinous act of terror in Christchurch and New Zealand and so this is a problem that I do take very seriously. We are actually looking at the way we think about and manage terrorism in Australia to consider whether it is appropriate for these new forms of terrorism that we are seeing. There was a lot of legislation passed in the second half of the last decade which was very targeted at a specific type of terrorism and some of the elements or features of the criminal law require features that are not present in the way that rightwing groups organise themselves. Mark Dreyfus and I are working together to look at some of those laws and see whether there are legal changes that will be needed to capture violent conduct in the rightwing terror world which perhaps isn’t being caught by what is going on in religious fundamentalism. Albanese government still committed to Redspice cyber security investment Circling back to the national press club address, O’Neil is now taking questions. David Crowe chief political correspondent for The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age asks: You had some quite alarming figures there on the number of cyber-attacks we are seeing. Can you put, in a budget perspective, because over the last couple of years there has been more money allocated to cyber defence of Australian federal budgets, $9.9bn in this year’s budget. There were projects such as Redspice. Are you banking that money and repurposing it all and putting it toward other functions? Is any money being returned to consolidated revenue or are you keeping the funding being given there to your department over time, and given the scale of the challenge you have outlined, are we going to need to spend more money on this overtime? O’Neil: I’m not in the habit of lavishly praising the former government but one important thing they did was make this Redspice investment run through the Australian signals directorate and important thing for the security of our country and our government is 100% committed to it. We are not spending enough on cyber defence at the moment so one of my challenges is how will we address that problem. One of the elements of this is that it is going to be expensive as securing government infrastructure. We talked a lot and thought a lot in the public sphere in recent months about cybersecurity in the private sector, will have to come at that discussion with a bit of humility because government has its problems as well, so part of the cyber strategy, one of the four goals is to establish how we’re going to lift and fund the security of Australian government infrastructure, and it is going to require more money. Pesutto wants to deliver policies with broad appeal New Victorian Liberal leader, John Pesutto, is now holding a press conference after he was elected by the party room this morning. He says his priorities is improving the Liberal party as an organisation and delivering policies with broad appeal: Organisationally, we will work hard to make sure that we build our membership and our presence across the Victorian community, not just in inner city seats and suburbs but the outer suburbs, the regions and rural areas. We will work hard to make sure we are a strong presence right across our state. On policy, we will take the time that’s available to us to work every day to make sure we present the Victorian people with good constructive alternatives when we face the serious challenges that we have. And as a leader, I will be consultative, and I will work with my colleagues to make sure we push ourselves to be our very best. The review into the Reserve Bank has generated a lot more interest than when it was formally launched after the May election. Let’s say the RBA’s popularity – and that governor Philip Lowe – has been on the slide with each interest rate hike, and of this week we’ve had eight in as many months. The government, which is expecting to receive the review’s final report by March - has today published 78 submissions. (No sign of one from the federal opposition, unless I missed it.) And as part of the data release, the RBA itself has published an 84-page report of its responses to requests for information. There’s a bit to go through but among the perhaps expected points, the bank remains in favour of maintaining its 2%-3% target range for inflation over time. “A higher target has been seen as running the risk that inflation will affect decision-making, as occurred in previous decades in Australia when inflation was higher,” it said. “Changing the target (in either direction) could damage long-term credibility if it were not done in an appropriate way.” Again, they admit the increase in inflation since mid-2021 “has been a very large surprise relative to earlier expectations”. In August 2021, the RBA was forecasting that inflation over 2022 would be 1.75% and it now expects it will be 7¾%. “Other forecasters have recorded similar forecast errors for inflation, with a similar experience across most advanced economies,” it says (not without reason). Submissions and comments about the review have stressed the need to examine the make-up of the board and whether the ratio of votes in favour of the monthly rate decisions should be published (as is the case in some other nations). The bank noted, however, that at “each of its meetings over the past decade the Board has voted in support of the recommendation made by the staff”. In other words, the bank’s own view has carried the day for the past 100-plus meetings (the RBA board meets 11 times a year on rates). As for the media’s view of the RBA, sentiment has been “largely neutral”, except when it wasn’t, and then coverage was “more negative than positive”. The central bank gets about 3000 enquiries a year from the public with about 6% complaints. Odds favour that ratio rising. Something else on the rise are global temperatures. To that end, the bank “has recently created a Climate Analysis &amp; Policy section to bring together climate-related streams of work and created two new dedicated positions”. That’s a section likely to be expanded in the future. O’Neil says Australia needs to stand up for our system of government We cannot allow the global debate to settle into the lazy thinking of equivalency is where somehow or political systems are morally equal. They are not. People should choose their leaders. To me, to us, that is a truism. But democracy is not just a political system, it is a mindset about community, pluralism, tolerance, rationality, choice and freedom. And yet, trust in democracy is in substantial decline in Australia and around the world, and populism and polarisation are on the rise. And we cannot stand by and do nothing. I have had many discussions with global democracy experts over the last months. This is a much admired problem. Many can explain the shapes and contours but no one seems to know what to do and in this, I want Australia to lead the way. What can we do, concretely, about the problems our democracy faces so Australia can be the light on the hill. The home affairs minister, Clare O’Neil, announces two new reviews. The first review will examine national resilience. That will be the home front implications of the climate and security environment Australia faces. The second will focus on the resilience of democracy, which O’Neil says is a national security issue. In our quest to keep Australians safe in the coming decades, our democracy will be our biggest national asset and we need to protect our national asset. And because competitor countries are seeking to undermine our democracy, and we need to fight back. Their intention is to justify authoritarianism by making it look like democracies are inherently dysfunctional, and to weaken countries like ours and constrain us from responding to global events that our adversaries may create. The taskforce will be completed in 2025 and will be undertaken in partnership with University of Canberra’s director of democracy, Prof Mark Evans. O’Neil says foreign interference, misinformation and disinformation are on the rise, and the review will look at what government can do with tech companies to reduce the spread of polarisation and falsehoods. Australians can get pretty down on our democracy. There are good reasons for that and indeed a bit of Australian scepticism in the world of politics is a very, very healthy thing. But politicians like me need to tell a better story about Australia’s world-leading democratic history. We are the sixth oldest democracy in the world. We are the great democratic innovator, the inventor of the secret talent, one of the first countries in the world to give women the right to vote. We have very high participation in our democracy and a strong and independent Electoral Commission and politicians do their part and respect the results. We have a brilliant independent media which despite its many challenges does a bloody good job. Disaster management needs to be a well practised function of government: O’Neil O’Neil says disaster management under the Albanese government is a centralised, well-coordinated function of the Australian government. It is time for us all to stop feigning shock at supposedly once in a generation floods and fires and storm. The world has witnessed a tenfold increase in the number of natural disasters since the 1960s and this is going to get worse as the world warms further. We need disaster management to be a routine, seamless, well practised function of Australian government so that when multiple disasters strike, government and the community are not completely consumed by them. Australia is the developed country in the world most at risk from the warming climate and the former government’s unwillingness to acknowledge this reality of climate change was flawless, dogmatic and reckless. O’Neil singles out former home affairs minister and current opposition leader, Peter Dutton, for approaching the portfolio he created with “a posture that was reactive to the issues and reactionary and the politics”. It didn’t make us any safer and I would like to change it. We know a lot about their national security environment we are heading into. Almost one million unprocessed visas when Labor came to government: O’Neil O’Neil says when Labor came to government, there were almost one million unprocessed visas waiting while Australia is in the middle of the “biggest labour shortage we have experienced since the second world war”. The result was large numbers of temporary lower-skilled workers were brought in and churned through the labour market and Australia now has a “large underclass of undocumented migrant workers” who are extremely vulnerable to exploitation, she says. That is not what a world-class migration system looks like and it’s completely out of step with Australia’s hugely successful historical focus on migration based on permanency, on citizenship and on fair rates for workers no matter where they come from the determining who should be invited to join us in our national endeavours is one of the most important thing is that the Australian government does and we are going to take a run at fixing it through a big piece of work being led by former secretary of the treasury and prime minister and Martin Parkinson. O’Neil: diaspora communities are best asset in fight against foreign interference On the topic of foreign interference, O’Neil says the former government’s approach was “overpoliticised and frankly a bit xenophobic, and any security expert will tell you that that approach deeply counter-productive for our national security”. She says the “loved and loyal” diaspora communities are the best asset in the fight against foreign interference. My experience in dealing with this problem so far is that for most people who would be targets of foreign interference, albeit that’s all that thought about politicians, community leaders, academics, they desperately want to fight this problem and one of the next phase of a policy response will be to start to open up a bit and focus on arming the people who need to understand this problem with usable information. So we will do that through a program of direct engagement with possible targets of foreign interference to help them understand what foreign interference looks like – how does it present? What does the playbook look like? – so we can help them understand what they can do to protect themselves so they can help us protect our country. Turning to cybersecurity, the home affairs minister, Clare O’Neil, says all businesses and citizens need to change how they engage with the internet. “The truth is, in cybersecurity, we are unnecessarily vulnerable. We did not do the work nationally over the last decade to help us prepare for this national challenge,” she says. O’Neil says it was an “absolute shocker” that the former prime minister, Scott Morrison, abolished the cybersecurity ministry, and points to what the Albanese government has done so far – a new joint taskforce between the AFP and Australian Signals Directorate, and passing new data breach penalty laws. She says she feels for people caught up in the Optus and Medibank data breaches, noting she has family affected by both. O’Neil announces the Albanese government will develop a new cybersecurity strategy: The cybersecurity strategy will help Australia bring the whole nation into the fight to protect our citizens and to protect our economy. It will help us strengthen critical infrastructure and government networks. It will help us build sovereign capabilities in cybersecurity, because this is something Australia must be able to do for itself. And it will help us strengthen our international engagement, so Australia can play a leadership role on the global stage, and work in partnership with our Pacific neighbours to handle cybersecurity across our region. The project will be led by Andy Penn, former Telstra CEO, Rachael Falk, CEO of the Cyber Security Cooperative Research Centre, and Air Marshal Mel Hupfeld. In addition to this amazing group of Australians, some of the biggest cyber guns from around the world love the scale of our ambition [and] they have agreed to help. Former UK Cyber Security Centre CEO and … Oxford University professor Ciaran Martin will lead a global cyber-expert panel, who will ensure our work really is world-leading. Across government, finance minister Katy Gallagher will work with me on the government-facing aspects of the strategy and assistant minister Tim Watts will lead our international focus. We’ve got the platform, we’ve got the mandate for change, we’ve genuinely now got the best minds on the problem, and now it is time to translate that into a more cybersecure Australia. Treasurer welcomes parliamentary budget office’s report The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, has had a look at the report and he has thoughts: While these are not the government’s forecasts, we welcome the report from the independent parliamentary budget office and the contribution it makes to the public debate around the long-term sustainability of our nation’s finances. The report underscores the challenges facing the economy and the budget from high inflation, rising interest rates, an uncertain global environment and mounting structural pressures. Since coming to office, the Albanese government has been upfront about the challenges facing our economy and our budget. After inheriting a trillion dollars in debt and deficits as far as the eye can see, our October budget began the hard yards of fiscal repair by making sensible savings, keeping real spending growth flat and returning more than 90% of revenue upgrades to the bottom line. As a result of our restraint, debt is lower in each year of the forward estimates than under the previous government. We’ve been clear about the structural pressures weighing on the budget, including the five big growing areas of spending – health, the NDIS, aged care, defence, and the cost of servicing the former government’s debt. The government will continue its responsible and disciplined approach to economic management in the May budget and beyond. Which is not exactly an answer, but it is an acknowledgment (if you read between the lines) that someone is going to have to come up with some answers soon. Global security challenges entering Australians’ everyday lives: O’Neil The home affairs minister, Clare O’Neil, discusses the rise of China, and of the rise of “big state politics” and democracies versus authoritarian regimes. She says Australians are facing the “most dangerous set of strategic circumstances since the second world war: During past periods of intense global competition, the security of Australians wasn’t really affected until we actively joined a conflict. But today, new tools of statecraft are bringing what would otherwise be global security challenges into the everyday lives and homes of our citizens. It’s felt in our economy where we are waking from a cyber slumber, it is felt in our private lives where our identities are under threat and personal information is at risk, it is felt in business and research, with Australia’s hard-won innovations are at constant risk of theft. And it is felt in our democracy, where foreign actors are trying to influence decisions in our parliaments and universities, subjecting Australians to online misinformation and disinformation campaigns which spread like viruses around our communities. The home affairs minister, Clare O’Neil, is speaking at the National Press Club. She says climate change is an increasing national security risk. When Home Affairs was first created, the discussion about climate change in national security was largely academic and, indeed, derided by the former government. Five years on, climate change is a … growing part of Australia’s national security picture. Climate change is creating massive movements of people that may become unmanageable. Already, national disasters are forcing about 21.5 million people each year from their homes. In our region, this, alongside foreseeable food and energy shortages, will be big vulnerabilities that we will need to work with our neighbours to address. Climate change is creating natural disasters at rolling frequency. For affected Australians, these disasters can be life-shattering, and from a security perspective, their management is a hugely consuming task for government and the community, and this in itself is a national security risk. O’Neil says what she is most concerned about is “cascading disasters”. Imagine a future January where we see Black Saturday-sized bushfires in the south-east, a major flood in the north of our country, and then overlay a cyber-attack on a major hospital system on the west coast – government would be fully absorbed in the management of that crisis, and then consider how capable we would be responding to and engaging with a security issue in our region. Parliamentary budget office says costs of climate change becoming increasingly apparent The parliamentary budget office has released its report, Beyond the budget, which looks at the economic conditions Australia is headed into. The PBO is not the government. It is an independent body which uses the Treasury figures and comes to its own conclusions about the numbers. It is used during the election by oppositions to cross-check their budgetary numbers for election commitments, but it also keeps an eye on the forecasts and does a lot of very handy reports looking at the numbers away from government spin. (If you are not already checking out the PBO reports, you should.) This report builds on some previous work the PBO has done, and it includes that Australia’s fiscal position is likely to remain sustainable under most circumstances. Huzzah. BUT. It also points out that the costs of climate change are becoming increasingly apparent and makes the point that Australia’s ageing population is a ticking budgetary timebomb. And most of the revenue increases in 2025/26 are coming from income tax. Which is also not sustainable (although the stage three tax cuts are not the answer, for reasons we have laid out previously in the Guardian). UK releases first coinage of King Charles III The UK has released the first coinage featuring King Charles III into circulation but Australia will not see the new monarch on our money until next year. Across the UK a total of 4.9m 50p coins will be distributed from 9,452 post offices throughout the next month. The coins will be given out as change when customers make purchases and will circulate alongside the Queen’s coins. Australians should expect to see the face of King Charles on their coins “sometime in 2023” the federal government announced back in September. The assistant minister for Treasury, Andrew Leigh, said the face will look left, following the UK – which is a change from the Queen’s face looking right. Leigh said: It will be a remarkable moment when Australia moves from having, not a Queen on the coin, but the King. It is understood the Royal mint will make an announcement about the coins in the coming weeks. Gallagher highlights treatment of some women in Senate estimates Katy Gallagher continued her speech to include the parliament – where she singled out the treatment of some women during senate estimates as an example of where progress still needed to be made. Gallagher said: Whilst estimates is an important scrutiny role to ensure good governance, I don’t believe it should be used as a platform to pursue political campaigns that target individuals – often women outside the parliament, with personal attacks, especially where there is no right for those individuals to reply or defend themselves. I saw several examples of this just in the last round of hearings. And whilst estimates is a robust forum – believe me, I’ve had plenty of robust exchanges there – our behaviour as leaders and standard setters is public and on the record for all to see. We hold privileged and powerful positions. And with that should come great responsibility and the highest levels of personal conduct about how we choose to use that power. Perhaps the codes of conduct for MPs and senators will change and improve some of this behaviour. If not, it’s something the Senate should examine. There is still a long, long way to go on this issue. But at least we are now talking about it at a national leadership level. Gallagher made clear she was “not taking aim at the justice system and this is not a reflection of any one individual case”. Criticisms of women’s experience of the justice system are well documented and understood. The challenge is what can be done about it? If we continue to see women retraumatised by simply trying to seek justice – the hard work to empower women to report cases will be lost. The right to a fair trial is fundamental – as is the presumption of innocence – there’s no argument there. But it is a problem if we are operating in an environment that re-traumatises plaintiffs, victims-survivors and claimants. We have duty to look at our systems and processes. To understand where and why people who may access those systems see them as a deterrent to seeking justice. We have a responsibility to ensure that women feel comfortable and supported to report any act of violence against them. We are clearly not there yet. Katy Gallagher says more protections needed for women in legal system Hello from Canberra! Overnight, the minister for women, Katy Gallagher, reinforced her commitment to help bring about gender equality in Australia. You may have heard some of her comments on ABC radio RN Breakfast yesterday – well, in a speech in Melbourne, Gallagher doubled down, saying Australia had a problem when it came to gender equality and more needed to be done to help protect women in the legal system, as well as through examinations like Senate estimates. You may remember it was senate estimates which kicked off the Christine Holgate affair. Labor was asking the questions then, but it was Scott Morrison who picked up the baton and ran with it, including with his infamous “she can go” speech in the parliament. Gallagher says the whole thing needs a review, including what happens when women speak up. In the legal system and beyond. She said: While increased reporting shows that there is more public awareness avenues and encouragement for women to report, these statistics also show that we are not living up to our responsibility to ensure that when women do speak up. That they are supported. There are too many stories of women who tell us that when they report violence, particularly sexual violence – they feel abandoned, victimised, put in the spotlight. Every day, women around Australia are experiencing sexual violence and seeing the justice system as an extension to their trauma, not a response to it. Brad Battin, who was unsuccessful in this morning’s Liberal leadership ballot, has made a brief statement to media: It’s obviously a tough time when you come out and you do lose in a selection battle. Sometimes they can get quite emotional because the fact that we are all friends within the party room – that might bring some smiles to people’s faces, I know – but the one thing that I committed to at the start of this challenge was to ensure that it was kept clean and my integrity stayed in place. Let me assure you, I walk out of that party room today with my integrity in place. I will back John Pesutto 100%. The party has chosen John Pesutto to move forward and I’ll get behind him. I’m a very proud Liberal. The only message I send to all of my colleagues: Get behind John. Never take the Liberal logo off any of your signs. I don’t care what electorate you’re running. I’m a proud Liberal, I believe in our values, and I believe in our future. Pesutto ‘humbled’ by Victorian Liberal leadership win John Pesutto, flanked by his leadership team, has briefly spoken to media following the party room meeting: We’re very humbled by this result. It means a lot to be given this opportunity by our party colleagues to do the best we can by our party, but more importantly to do the best we can for the people of Victoria. These next four years are going to be really challenging for the people in Victoria and we need a government that is pushed to do its level best. We’ve just had an election, and although that election has sorted out the results, I want to make it clear that the challenges we face as a state remain. We will be a constructive opposition, but we will apply scrutiny when it’s necessary to do so. I’ll have more to say to you in a very short while but I might just confer with my leadership colleagues and we’ll schedule a time in the next few minutes for when we can have a bit more of a conversation with you. The independent senator for the ACT, David Pocock, is speaking to ABC News following the unveiling of new federal environment laws by the environment minister, Tanya Plibersek. The legislation will go before parliament next year and the Senate’s support will be crucial to getting the new laws passed. Pocock proved pivotal in getting the government’s industrial reform passed in the last sitting week of parliament. So what does the senator, known for his strong stance on the environment, make of the government’s proposed reforms? I’m yet to read all 60 pages, but it’s a great thing to have an environment minister that is committed to turning things around. Clearly our environmental laws are not working and minister Plibersek has committed to no new extinctions, which is a huge commitment and is going to take reforming environmental law, having an independent agency but then crucially, having the kind of investment in nature, investment in conservation it is necessary to actually deliver on that promise. We have to ensure that the prime minister and cabinet back her on this and provide the sort of investment that is going to be needed every year going forward. Ros Childs: So of what you have seen so far, you would support this in the Senate? Pocock: I will wait for the details – this is a really big piece of work and as the minister said earlier, there isn’t the fine details yet, that will happen over next year – but we have to ensure that we look back on 2023 as a year that we did turn things around when it comes to the environment here in Australia. Price caps to feature at today’s energy ministers meeting in Brisbane Energy ministers began sitting at 10am Queensland time this morning for a scheduled five hours’ chinwag about all things energetic. We expect, among other things, for the federal, state and territory ministers to sign off a plan to provide incentives to accelerate the take-up of new storage in the market. We previewed the event in this piece, in case you need a primer: The form of the incentives such a guaranteed base price remains to be seen, but it does seem the states are advancing some big projects as it is, such as a whopping 4000MW-hour battery being considered for WA, as RenewEconomy reported here. (Back in 2017, the Hornsdale battery in SA was considered big with its 129MW-hour size, although that looks almost titchy now.) While the main horsetrading over a price cap for gas and electricity is likely to sit with the premiers and the prime minister tomorrow, it’s understood the issue will be discussed at today’s gathering. (Probably better to get through the set agenda first in case things get feisty.) FWIW, it looks like electricity is so cheap this morning it’s being given away with renewables supplying well over half the power – and rooftop solar alone generating a quarter of it. Those ample renewable supplies are currently (pun!) generating negative wholesale spot prices across all mainland states in the national electricity market. Looking ahead, we might see some strains on electricity supplies as that huge heatwave builds and bakes northern Australia. (Queensland has the odd electricity shortfall alert for next Tuesday and perhaps more will follow.) Our colleague Cait Kelly details what’s ahead for some remote communities in this piece: We’re already seeing the hottest temperatures so far in this warming season in the southern hemisphere and perhaps we’ll collect a few unwanted heat records before the heatwave ebbs. Flood-damaged roads to cost $3.8bn to fix With the cost of repairing Australia’s flood-damaged roads estimated at about $3.8bn, there are calls for a new approach to road construction, maintenance and funding. The president of the Australian local government association, Linda Scott, says thousands of kilometres of local roads across NSW, Victoria South Australia and Queensland have been severely damaged by recent flooding – with some washed away. The ALGA estimates the damage bill at $3.8bn but Scott says the cost of rebuilding roads to the same standard will only cost more in the long term. She said today: We can’t simply rebuild our local infrastructure – including roads, footpaths and cycleways – to current standards. We need a fundamental shift in the way we fund, deliver and maintain these assets. Councils want an increase in federal roads to recovery funding from $500m to $800m a year to help invest in new technologies and build more resilient roads. - from AAP Queensland SES receive 20 requests for assistance after lightning storms in south-east EPA will be ‘a tough cop on the beat’ operating independently: Plibersek More from the Plibersek press conference. Central to the overhaul of federal environment law is this plan for a federal protection agency, which will shift responsibility from politicians to this legislated body. The environment minister gave more detail about the agency taking questions, saying it is important it will operate independently from the government. One of the reasons that we are establishing it in this way is to make sure that it is transparent, that it is answerable to our democracy; people can see the decisions are being made, and why they are being made, and how they are being made, and have confidence that there is integrity in the system. The details of the design are, again, something that we will continue to work through with stakeholders over coming months. But this is an exciting Australia first and it delivers on an important promise that we made during the election to have a strong independent EPA, a tough cop on the beat that is operating at arm’s length from the government. John Pesutto will lead the Victorian Liberal party after defeating Brad Battin, sources have told Guardian Australia. Pesutto, a former shadow attorney general, narrowly reclaimed the inner east seat of Hawthorn, which he lost at the 2018 state election. He has argued the Liberal party needs to develop attractive policies that have broad appeal if it is to be successful come 2026. He is the Liberal’s fifth leader since Daniel Andrews secured the leadership of the Victorian Labor party in 2010 and it’s the party’s third leadership spill since March last year. Plibersek says understanding can be reached between forestry and conservation We just heard from the Australian Conservation Foundation that the native forestry industry needs to be included in national environmental standards, to protect Australia’s animals and forests. Moving on to questions at that Brisbane press conference, here is Plibersek’s response on the issue of forestry: That is something that we will be working through very closely with stakeholders, with the forestry industry and environmental organisations. We want to have a forestry industry here in Australia. We want a strong and sustainable forestry industry, both because we need the products that are produced and because we need the jobs as well. And we also know that we have some critical areas where there are threatened species and working cooperatively, collaboratively. I am sure that we can come to a common understanding of how we have a strong forestry industry and we better protect our environment, but that is something we will work very closely with the industry on. The New South Wales government will support an Indigenous voice to parliament being enshrined in the constitution. The state Aboriginal affairs minister, Ben Franklin, confirmed the Coalition’s position on Thursday after his federal Nationals counterparts last week announced they would not be supporting it. He said: We support in principle enshrining an Aboriginal voice in the Australian constitution. Obviously we want some more information from the federal government about how we work, how it will operate. We know how important it is that Aboriginal voices be heard across the state. We know that it’s critical for Aboriginal voices to be considered at the heart of government and that’s why we’ve expressed our in principal support for a voice to parliament. Franklin said he expected more details to be revealed by the federal government in coming months. He said he had not heard from federal Nationals leader, David Littleproud, since making the announcement, nor would he be asking him to reconsider. I’m not going to comment on the federal National party and the decisions that they’ve made. We’ve made it very clear what our position is. We look forward to having more information about how it will work before we land, of course on our final position when you see all the details, the logistics on the table and then we’ll be able to go forth and continue to consider the issue. Environmental standards must include native forest logging and climate trigger, ACF says The Australian Conservation Foundation has welcomed the environment minister’s announcement. Paul Sinclair from ACF also stepped up to speak at that press conference in Brisbane saying “Australian environmental law is busted and mistrusted … failing to protect our wildlife and the habitats they depend on.” Having a minister willing to fix a broken system is a great thing and we are appreciative of that endeavour. With national environmental standards, we need to see those standards incorporating all sectors, including the native forrest logging sector. For too many years, that sector has been excluded from national environmental laws at great expense to species and some of the world’s greatest forests. We are disappointed that we don’t see reflected today a climate trigger in what is proposed. A climate trigger would assess the damage that is being done by burning coal and gas on the amazing places of Australia – from the Great Barrier Reef in the east to Ningaloo reef in the west to the seagrass meadows in the south and the wetlands in the north. However, Sinclair says he is optimistic these details can be worked through with the potential to create the best environmental law this country has ever had. There is a heap more detail to work through over the next six month. We are really excited and optimistic that together with the minister and stakeholders like the [Business Council of Australia], that we can work together to create a strong, positive national environmental law, the best that this country has ever had. The test of success of that law is going to be the degree to which you can stop the extinction of species like the amazing koala or the black cockatoo. Following the sweeping changes to Indonesia’s criminal code, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has updated its travel advice for Australians travelling to Indonesia. It has warned travellers of the new laws, flagging this includes penalties for cohabitation and sex outside marriage. But noted the laws do not come into force for another three years. It advises Australians to subscribe to the travel advice to stay up to date. The advice said Australians are subject to Indonesia’s local laws and penalties, including those that seem harsh by Australian standards. The overall advice for Australians travelling to Indonesia is to exercise a high degree of caution. However, this encompasses a number of other risks for Australians travelling to Indonesia, including the eruption of Mount Semeru in East Java on 4 December. Indonesia is Australia’s most popular overseas travel destination with more than 1m visits a year. Queensland to focus on urban development, rare-earth minerals and renewables The Queensland environment minister, Meaghan Scanlon, steps up at the media conference after Plibersek. Scanlon says Queensland called on the former Morrison government to address the Samuels review recommendations – “not just cherrypick recommendations” – and welcomed the Albanese government releasing the report today “to appropriately respond to recommendations”. She says the Queensland government will be working with the federal government on the recommendation to deliver bio-regional plans. It works like a traffic light system, it looks at a landscape scale how we can protect, restore and allow sustainable development. So it looks at that cumulative impact not just projects one by one, but looks at the whole landscape scale. Looks at where we need to preserve wildlife corridors and where sustainable development can occur while not compromising biodiversity. She says the Queensland government will work with the federal government focusing on three key areas: The first will be around urban development, particularly in the south-east and the other two areas will be around rare-earth minerals as well as renewable energy. When it’s incredibly clear that if we are going to preserve biodiversity that we need to take action on climate change. But we need to make sure that doesn’t compromise on biodiversity. This regional planning is about making sure we can do both. Environment plan will be ‘good news for businesses’ – Plibersek Plibersek says business will be happy with the plan as it will deliver “more certainty, saving time and money with faster clearer decisions”. Regional plans will identify the area that we want to protect, areas that can be fast-tracked for development and areas where development can proceed with caution. Today, I am announcing, that we are kicking off this regional plan in process in partnership with Queensland … Other states are interested as well. That means less red tape, it means easy paperwork, it means less duplication, streamlining and speeding up assessment processes. Our nature positive plan is a win for business and win for the environment. I’m really looking forward to continuing to work with the business community, with environmental groups, with the First Nations people to give better environmental protection and faster decision-making. Pesutto arrives at Liberal leadership ballot Dipping out from Plibersek to head to Victoria … Liberal leadership hopeful John Pesutto has just arrived at parliament ahead of a partyroom meeting, flanked by supporter upper house MP Georgie Crozier. It’s his first time back since 2018, when he unexpectedly lost his seat of Hawthorn to Labor. He told reporters: It’s good to be back. It’s been a long, four years working my way back and I’m humbled and grateful to the people for the endorsement they gave me as the member for Hawthorn. I’m also grateful to all my colleagues for the time they’ve given me over the last couple of weeks … I’m encouraged I’m feeling positive, but it’s really now up to the party room to make a decision. I want to emphasise whatever the decision, we’re all going to get behind it. We’re going to work hard together in a unified way. We’re going to make sure that the Victorian people see an opposition that holds the government to account and that is ready to govern. Nature positive plan will deliver stronger environment laws – Plibersek Plibersek says the government will build legislation on three basic principles: Clear national standards of environmental protection. Improving and speeding up decisions. Building trust and integrity. She says: Our nature positive plan will be better for the environment by delivering stronger laws designed to repair nature, to protect our precious plants and animals and places. For the first time, our laws will introduce standards that decisions must meet. Standards described the environmental outcomes that we are seeking, This will ensure that decisions that are made will protect our threatened species and ecosystems. And of course, a new environment protection agency will make developments decisions and properly enforce them. ‘Environment laws are broken’: Plibersek unveils nature positive plan’ The environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, is unveiling the response to the Samuel review right now in Brisbane. Opening her speech, she says: Australia’s environment laws are broken. Prof Graham Samuels’ 2020 review into the environment protection biodiversity conservation act found – and I’m quoting now – the EPBC Act is outdated and requires fundamental reform. Australians do not trust that the act is delivering for the environment, for business or for the community. Nature is being destroyed, businesses are waiting too long for decisions. That is bad for everyone and it has to change. Labor today is delivering on one of our key promises by responding to Prof Samuel’s review and announcing our nature positive plan, better for the environment, better for business. We want an economy that is nature positive to holt destruction and repair nature. The Albanese government has committed to establishing a new environment protection agency with powers to decide whether or not developments proceed and to enforce laws designed to protect and restore nature. Releasing the government’s response to a review of national environmental laws, the environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, confirmed the government would also introduce new national environmental standards against which conservation, protection and major development applications will be measured. It comes two years after the former competition watchdog Graeme Samuel delivered his review to the former Morrison government. The Coalition never formally responded. Plibersek said revamped environmental laws would set standards that decisions about developments must meet and would “describe the environmental outcomes we want to achieve” to ensure better protection of threatened species and declining ecosystems. She said: Our nature positive plan is a win-win: a win for the environment and a win for business. Our reforms are seeking to turn the tide in this country – from nature destruction to nature repair. The response, released at an event in Brisbane, includes proposed changes to conservation planning – formerly known as recovery planning – and a new three tier system to guide where development can and cannot occur. The government has also proposed applying the new national standards to regional forest agreements, which have been exempt from the current laws and expanding the water trigger – which assesses the impacts of coal and coal seam gas developments on water resources – to include all forms of unconventional gas. However, the government will not establish a long-called for climate trigger and its response did not provide any detail of additional government funding to meet its aims of environmental restoration and zero new extinctions. More to come on the Guardian Australia website shortly. ‘The party room is like fight club’: Victorian Liberals arrive for election contest Liberal MPs have begun arriving at parliament ahead of a party room meeting to elect its new leader. The contest is between moderate John Pesutto, who recently reclaimed the inner-city seat of Hawthorn for the party, and Brad Battin, an outer suburban MP who has the support of several conservative in the party. The duo have offered alternative solutions to grow the Liberal’s constituency. Battin said if elected leader he would focus the Liberals’ efforts on “aspirational” voters in Melbourne’s growing outer suburbs and multicultural groups, while Pesutto said the party needed to develop attractive policies that have broad appeal. Former Liberal leader Michael O’Brien, who is believed to be supporting Pesutto, told reporters the party could not afford to sacrifice any areas: No, you win government by gaining the trust of more people, you gain government by building communities of support, not by abandoning communities. It should never happen under any party that wants to be a party of government as opposed to a party of protest. Asked what went wrong at the election, O’Brien said: We didn’t win enough votes, we didn’t connect with enough communities. And clearly, the message we were putting out didn’t resonate with enough people. And I don’t think the people delivering message were trusted by Victorians. Rowville MP Kim Wells described the loss as “embarrassing”. He said he expected Thursday’s ballot to be close. Upper house MP, Matt Bach, believed to be backing Pesutto but told reporters: The party room is like fight club and the first rule about fight club is you don’t talk about fight club. Bev McArthur, Richard Riordan and Ryan Smith, believed to be backing Battin, said the future of the party was bright.

Four emergency flood warnings in place in NSW The New South Wales SES has clocked more than 20,000 requests for assistance since record flooding commenced across inland NSW, almost three months ago. These areas include central western NSW, along the Lachlan River which received more than 3,000 requests (Forbes and Condobolin) and northern NSW, along the Namoi (Wee Waa) and Mehi (Moree) rivers which received more than 1,600 requests. UN biodiversity summit ‘vastly more important’ than Cop27, researchers say Yesterday the Cop15 UN biodiversity summit kicked off in Montreal, and no biggie, but it’s where leading scientists say the “fate of the entire living world” will be determined. The gathering of the world’s nations is “vastly more important than Cop27”, the recent high-profile UN climate meeting, according to researchers. They said: We say this because of the many dimensions of anthropogenic global change … the most critical, complex and challenging is that of biodiversity loss. It comes as closer to home, the environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, will respond to a review of national environment laws by the former consumer watchdog Graeme Samuel (see Lisa Cox’s earlier post). The report was handed to the Morrison government two years ago but the Coalition never formally responded. You can read the full story on the Cop15 from Guardian’s environment editor, Damian Carrington, here: More than 100,000 lightning strikes in six hours in south-east Queensland The Bureau of Meteorology says it amounted to roughly seven strikes a second, with the risk of severe thunderstorm persisting into the afternoon. Merri-bek council votes to no longer hold citizenship ceremonies on 26 January A Melbourne council has voted to abandon holding citizenship ceremonies on 26 January, arguing the national celebration must be “inclusive” to all. In 2017 Merri-bek in Melbourne’s north became the city’s third local council to cease referring to 26 January as Australia Day and stopped holding celebrations on this day. But citizenship ceremonies were still held on this date. On Wednesday night the council passed the motion to stop holding citizenship ceremonies on the national day. But one councillor attempted to overturn the decision, meaning a final position will be reached later this month. The motion will ramp up pressure on the Albanese government to reverse a decision by the former Morrison government that requires local governments to hold citizenship ceremonies on 26 January. Queensland senator denies claims in Niki Savva’s book The new book from journalist and commentator Niki Savva, Bulldozed, has made some big revelations about the Morrison government – including that the former prime minister’s close confidante Alex Hawke thought he was “addicted to executive authority” and that Josh Frydenberg was “staggered” by the multiple ministry scandal. But one Coalition member has pushed back on a claim in the book. Queensland senator Susan McDonald has denied reports that she was planning to cross the floor on the then government’s religious discrimination bill earlier this year (which passed the house, but never made it to the Senate after a moderate revolt where several Liberal MPs crossed the floor to oppose it). McDonald claimed in Twitter and Facebook posts that the claim she would have voted against the bill in the Senate was “categorically untrue” and said it was an “important issue”. The new Labor government has pledged to make their own religious discrimination reforms in this term of parliament. Program bringing Pacific workers into aged care homes praised About 100 workers from Fiji and Samoa have gained aged care qualifications in the past year under a pilot program being trialled by the government, ABC’s 7.30 program reported last night. The new program is intended to meet the shortfall in the aged care sector by recruiting workers from Pacific island nations. After the success of the trial, a further 500 workers will be placed in aged care jobs next year. The minister for international development and the Pacific, Pat Conroy, praised the scheme: It’s a scheme that fills skills shortages here and it’s a scheme that’s critical to deepening relationship between Australia and the Pacific. On average a worker will send home $15,000 a year, and that’s in a context where more than a third of Pacific Islanders live on less than $1,000 a year. Despite historical problems of exploitation within the broader Pacific Labor Scheme, Conroy says there is “strong” oversight when it comes to this new program: That’s a key focus of the Australian government is lifting the paying conditions for Australian aged care workers. It’s early days with this trial but I am confident we’ve put in place a good system. They have to be paid as Australians do in the job, there’s random audits, the employers are pre-screened and really a strong oversight is put in place. ‘Difficult day’ for Australians after Bali bomb maker release, Marles says The Australian government is seeking assurances from its Indonesian counterparts that a man convicted of making the bombs used in the 2002 Bali terrorist attacks will continue to be monitored after his release from prison. Overnight, Indonesia released Bali bomb maker Umar Patek from prison on parole after serving little more than half his sentence. The attacks killed 202 people, including 88 Australians. The deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, said the news would bring a “difficult day” for Australians and families who lost loved ones in the Bali bombings. He told ABC radio the government had advocated against Patek’s early release and would urge the Indonesian government to ensure he had “constant surveillance” while on parole. The energy minister, Chris Bowen, said the development was concerning but the government respected Indonesia’s legal system. He said it was important to keep dialogue open between the two nations, telling ABC News: Indonesians and Australians were killed by these terrible murders, Indonesians and Australians went through this terrible ordeal together. Now we are dealing with the ramifications together, understanding and respecting that Indonesia has their own legal system … [which] does tend to lead to long sentences with early release. – from AAP The Victorian Liberal leadership ballot will be taking place later this morning (around 10am). The contest is between Brad Battin and John Pesutto following Matthew Guy’s stepping down after the party’s election loss. My colleague, Guardian Australia’s Victorian state correspondent, Benita Kolovos, describes the contest on a “knife-edge” with both men confident they will emerge from the ballot successful: The ballot has been described by several Liberal MPs as the “fight for the soul of the party” following its crushing loss at last month’s state election. The Liberal party went to the election hoping to improve its lower house representation after the 2018 “Danslide” but its total number of seats will probably remain unchanged. Its primary vote has also dropped below 30% for the first time since the 1950s and there are fears demographic shifts could see this further deteriorate. Both Battin and Pesutto have argued the Liberal party struggled to articulate its values at the election, though they have offered alternative solutions to grow its constituency. Battin said if elected leader he would focus the Liberals’ efforts on “aspirational” voters in Melbourne’s growing outer suburbs and multicultural groups, while Pesutto said the party needed to develop attractive policies that have broad appeal. Read the full preview here: Australia, US and UK vow to be transparent with Pacific about Aukus Australia, the US and the UK say they will be open and transparent about Aukus, in an apparent bid to answer concerns from some countries in south-east Asia and the Pacific islands. A joint statement issued after a meeting of defence ministers and secretaries at the Pentagon today said the three countries “committed to continued openness and transparency with international partners on Aukus”. They further emphasised that Aukus is a strategic partnership focused on enhancing regional stability and safeguarding a free and open Indo-Pacific where conflicts are resolved peacefully and without coercion. They confirmed that Aukus will complement Aukus partners’ engagement with existing regional architecture, including Asean and the Pacific Islands Forum. A lot of the focus of public debate has been on Australia’s plan to acquire at least eight nuclear-powered submarines, but the Aukus partnership also includes collaboration on advanced technologies. Today’s statement said the Aukus countries wanted to “accelerate near-term delivery of technologies that will meet our militaries’ requirements to enhance capability and increase interoperability”: These include initiatives for advanced trilateral maritime undersea intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities and use of each country’s autonomous systems to enhance maritime domain awareness. They further noted the role recent exercises have played in demonstrating and testing advanced capabilities, and approved plans to pursue additional demonstrations of several collaborative initiatives – including hypersonic and autonomous systems – in the 2023-2024 timeframe and beyond. As part of this work on advanced technologies, Australia, the US and the UK plan to intensify targeted engagement with defence industry and academia next year. ‘Expect a big softening of the economy next year,’ treasurer says After the release of GDP figures yesterday, the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said there were “some really pleasing aspects in yesterday’s national accounts” including wages growth. But he says the figures don’t capture all the pressures, particularly when it comes to the global economy. These global economic challenges aren’t behind us. They’re ahead of us. And our prospects next year will be largely determined by some combination of the war in Ukraine, the Chinese economy what happens in the US to UK and Europe when these interest rate rises bite in our economy because they hit repayments immediately, but they hit the economy sometime after. And also we’ve got to be conscious about the prospects for the weather and natural disasters as well. Do expect a big softening of the economy next year, partly as a consequence of these rate rises, but also because the global economy is slowing considerably as well. Government yet to cap wholesale coal price, but still aiming to land ‘before Christmas’, treasurer says The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, is speaking to ABC Radio. RN Breakfast host Patricia Karvelas asks him: Has the government resolved to cap the wholesale coal price at $125 a tonne and the gas price at $13 a gigajoule? Chalmers: There hasn’t been a concluded view reached yet, and that’s because this is a challenge of such complexity and such consequence for industry and for Australians around the country, that it needs to be a genuine partnership between governments and that requires all sides to come to the table in a reasonable and a constructive way, which recognises that one level of government can’t fix this all on its own. He says the government is still aiming to “land something before Christmas”. The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, has hailed “great progress” in talks on Australia acquiring nuclear-powered submarines. He also reiterated a pledge to ensure Australia “acquires this capability at the earliest possible date”. This morning Austin joined the Australian defence minister, Richard Marles, and the UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, at the Pentagon for the first Aukus defence ministerial meeting. The meeting comes a day after annual high-level talks between Australia and the US. Austin told today’s meeting that Australia, the US and the UK’s trilateral security partnership was an “historic endeavour”: The need for Aukus is even clearer today. More than ever, our three countries share of similar outlook on the key challenges and opportunities confronting our world. Aukus will enhance our shared ability to sustain peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific, and since creating this trilateral security partnership our defense forces, industries, and scientific communities have been hard at work. Over the past 15 months we’ve made great progress toward identifying a pathway for Australia to acquire conventionally armed and nuclear-powered submarines. Today on behalf of President Biden, I want to reaffirm the US commitment to ensuring that Australia acquires this capability at the earliest possible date, and in adherence with the highest nonproliferation standards. Marles told the meeting Aukus reflected “a shared mission between our three countries to work together to pursue advanced military capability, and do so at a time where the strategic circumstances faced by the world are as complex and precarious as really we’ve seen since the end of the second world war”: And central to that is Australia being able to acquire a nuclear-powered, highly capable submarine and we are deeply grateful for the work that we’ve been able to do with both the UK and the US to enable Australia to acquire that capability. And it’s not lost on us the significance of the US and the UK, working together and transferring this technology to Australia. And there has been an enormous amount of work being done by our officials to bring this about, and obviously to bring today about. I think as we talk today, we’re all going to speak to the fact that we’re on track to be able to make this announcement in respect of what will be the optimal pathway for Australia to take in the first part of next year, which is what we have always intended to do. Wallace said the UK would “do everything we can in our capability to help support you, get you that capability, to bring to the best Australia’s skills and its workforce to do so”. Government will not ‘stand by’ as energy companies profit off war: Bowen ABC News Breakfast’s Madeleine Morris asks Chris Bowen more about the truth of those news reports on energy: As you say, it is largely down to the invasion of Ukraine that we have seen this spike in energy prices, as you say. There are other factors as well. If what is being discussed, which is compensation, in some sense to states, but also to fossil fuel companies, as we understand. Why should the taxpayer be compensating fossil fuel companies who haven’t seen their input costs go up, it’s just the prices they can get on the wider international market are going up. Why should we pay for that? Bowen: I have seen lots of stories written about what we have been discussing. Morris: Is that untrue? Bowen: Some of them have had truth to it and some of them haven’t. That is the way of the world. That doesn’t worry me. I will say this: you’re right, it is not acceptable simply for some companies to make massive profits because of the invasion, make profess off a war situation and for other Australian businesses, heavy industries relying strongly on gas and energy costs to pay the price and in some cases have their viability threatened. Governments cannot and will not stand by and let that happen. Energy ministers to discuss ‘capacity mechanism’, Bowen says Chris Bowen is speaking to ABC from Brisbane where he is meeting with the state and territory energy ministers to try to bring down energy prices. He says there is a “spirit of cooperation around the table, recognising that we must work together on these big challenges”. As they attempt to secure an agreement to cap coal and gas prices, he says there are “two processes under way”: Our main job today is to settle something that has been in the too-hard basket for too long, what is called a capacity mechanism to keep the lights on and ensure our transition to renewables happens more quickly and in a more orderly fashion … I will be looking to take that agreement to the next step with my colleagues today. Separately, the prime minister and premiers are meeting tomorrow. … The prime minister will be talking to the premiers, particularly the coal state premiers about sensible interventions and responses. I have read various things in the newspaper, most of which haven’t been accurate about where the discussions are at. They will continue over the next 24 hours because it is our job as governments to work together to ensure that the worst impacts of Putin’s invasion of Ukraine on the world energy markets don’t flow through to Australian industries and business without a response. ‘Australians have every right to be disappointed’ but dialogue with Indonesia important, Bowen says While he says “strong representations” from the Australian government are necessary, Chris Bowen does not believe Umar Patek’s early release will have repercussions for our relationship with Indonesia: I think it is important that Australia maintains strong dialogue with Indonesia, so we can have those discussions and that is exactly what we will do. These issues do come up in the relationship, between all countries but particularly between Australia and Indonesia with different legal systems. It is appropriate that the Australian government makes strong representations to the Indonesian government which we have done and will continue to do. Australians have every right to be disappointed and concerned by this news. We understand and respect the differences with the Indonesian system so therefore it is best we just engage in that dialogue with them to ensure all the necessary protections, all possible protections have been put in place. Hello, Natasha May now on deck with you. Indonesian authorities have released the chief bomb maker behind the Bali bombings, Umar Patek, after only serving half his 20 year sentence. It comes despite lobbying from Australia to keep him in jail for his full term. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has said his impending release would cause further distress to bomb victims. Authorities deliberately postponed his release until after the bombing anniversary and last month’s G20 summit in Bali. But he has now been released on remission for good behaviour with authorities saying they no longer have the right to detain him as he has fulfilled the conditions for parole. The federal energy minister, Chris Bowen, is appearing on ABC News Breakfast and asked about the early release: I think all Australians would be concerned about this and the Australian government is concerned about this on their behalf. We have made, as you would expect, appropriate representations to the Indonesian government. Early release is not uncommon in Indonesia. Our particular representations have gone to seeking reassurances that he will continue to be monitored and appropriate protections will be in place. We have made appropriate representations through the normal channels and that dialogue with our friends in Indonesian government will continue. Government likely to consult on threatened species The Albanese government’s approach to developing new national environmental standards is likely to be done in stages. The highest priority standards, such as a standard that would apply to matters of national environmental significance including threatened species and world heritage sites, are expected to be consulted on first. It is also expected Tanya Plibersek’s announcement in Brisbane will outline the government’s proposed timeline for introducing a package of legislation for reform. Regional planning approaches have been discussed as a way to potentially deal with the cumulative environmental impacts of development. The Coalition proposed a shift to regional planning this year and had been considering locations for a pilot project. But its preferred model attracted criticism for being too focused on fast-tracking development in certain areas and not enough on conservation. Documents released to Guardian Australia under freedom of information laws show the Albanese government has been in talks with the Queensland state government about the potential for a regional plan for south-east Queensland, an area where koala habitat and sites such as the Moreton Bay wetlands are under development pressure. Emails from federal environment officials in July this year state Queensland’s environment department was “keen to explore a regional plan approach for their future planning of SEQ (south-east Queensland)“ and was undertaking “preparatory work” for further discussions with the commonwealth later this year. A note from a meeting in July with the Places You Love Alliance of environment groups states Plibersek was “interested in how regional approaches, offsets, and natural capital markets could reinforce each other”. The environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, will give the first insight into how the Albanese government plans to rewrite the national environment laws this morning as she makes a major announcement in Brisbane. Plibersek will respond to a review of national environment laws by the former consumer watchdog Graeme Samuel that was handed to the Morrison government two years ago. The Coalition never formally responded. The response will include what the government plans to do on introducing uniform national environmental standards to guide conservation protection and the assessment of major development proposals – a key recommendation of the Samuel review. The minister is also expected to reveal the government’s preferred structure for a new national environment protection agency – an EPA – and to outline a proposal for regional approaches to environmental planning, which would guide where development can and cannot occur. The Australian Conservation Foundation’s chief executive, Kelly O’Shanassy, said the country needed strong national standards and an EPA that was independent, had decision-making powers, and was properly funded. The national campaigns director at the Wilderness Society, Amelia Young, said community appetite for major environmental reform had never been higher. The natural world needs a lot more attention than governments have been giving it and the time to rectify this is now. Infrastructure will be one of the themes of the day, with the federal minister for infrastructure, transport, regional development and local government, Catherine King, due to unveil the revamped Infrastructure Australia body later today. The minister will also attend the Boomtown property and infrastructure summit in Sydney today with the New South Wales premier, Dominic Perrottet. The summit is seeking to promote the development of western Sydney. Amy Remeikis reports: Infrastructure Australia is dead. Long live Infrastructure Australia. The creation of the body by the Rudd government in 2008 forms part of the prime minister, Anthony Albanese’s legacy. Albanese has long had a love of nation-building infrastructure projects, and Infrastructure Australia was designed while he was in the portfolio, as a way of identifying and fast-tracking projects which would add value, help future-proof communities, or provide missing links within existing infrastructure frameworks. At the time, Albanese described it as “replacing neglect, buck-passing, and pork-barrelling with long-term planning where governments predict and anticipate infrastructure needs and demands, not merely react to them”. But the body set up to help identify and see through nation-building projects became increasingly sidelined, an independent review ordered by the new Albanese government found, and was seen as “reactive” rather than proactive. That has led to projects languishing, or the states moving forward without all the pieces. One of the first acts of the Albanese government was to review Infrastructure Australia. King had signalled an overhaul would be a priority of a Labor government ahead of the election, after former deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce appointed the retiring mayor of Tamworth to chair the body. The review having been returned, King will unveil the revamped IA at an event later on Thursday. The government plans on overhauling the body, giving it a clear and legislated mandate, which will define its responsibilities and role, as well as shift from an advisory body governed by committee, to a new governance model. Good morning and welcome to our live blog. Natasha May will be along soon to take you through the day but before then here are a couple of stories making news overnight. The Australian Medical Association has blasted “weak political leadership” for what it sees as the premature relaxation of anti-Covid measures, saying that the health system is “not prepared” to deal with long-term issues stemming from the pandemic. The peak doctors’ body is so concerned about the lingering impact of long Covid on the population and the health system that it thinks governments should reconsider mask mandates to address the problem. One expert thinks long Covid could affect as many as 1 million Australians by next year. Australia’s energy ministers are expected to sign off on a scheme to accelerate the take-up of giant batteries to support the decarbonisation of the grid when they gather in Brisbane today but are unlikely to make a decision on any Albanese government proposal to impose price caps on coal and gas. There were reports last night that the government was pushing the states to cap the price of coal at $125 a tonne, less than half the market rate, but Guardian Australia understands no decision is expected before Friday’s national meeting between the prime minister, premiers and chief ministers. Also today the environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, is due to make a major announcement on new national environmental standards, which will include Australia’s own environment protection agency. It is in response to a review of national laws that was handed to the Morrison government two years ago. Australia’s foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, will use a speech in Washington today to urge China to embrace US plans to prevent growing tensions from spiralling into war, while rejecting claims that Australia’s plan to acquire nuclear-powered submarines is driving a regional arms race. She will urge China to take up a US offer to put in place “guardrails” to prevent growing tensions from spiralling into war and suggest both sides learn from diplomacy spurred by the Cuban missile crisis."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2019/jul/06/ethical-investing-energise-africa-a-solar-scheme-with-the-power-to-change-lives","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2019-07-06T07:34:53Z","webTitle":"Solar power: how investing can help to change lives","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/jul/06/ethical-investing-energise-africa-a-solar-scheme-with-the-power-to-change-lives","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2019/jul/06/ethical-investing-energise-africa-a-solar-scheme-with-the-power-to-change-lives","fields":{"headline":"Solar power: how investing can help to change lives","bodyText":"Fight the climate crisis and earn a return of 5% at the same time, plus enjoy a guarantee on your investment. That’s the offer from an ethical investment scheme that allows people to put money into companies providing African families with access to clean, affordable solar energy. It’s notable that this scheme is supported by UK aid money from the Department for International Development (DfID), and offers a guarantee, although this only covers the first £100 of capital invested and applies to first-time investors. Energise Africa enables ordinary people to invest in bonds issued by solar companies, allowing them to provide “life-changing” solar home systems to low-income families in countries such as Kenya, Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Tanzania. With a minimum investment of £50 and expected annual returns that have in the past typically ranged from 5% to 7%, this is a potentially straightforward and accessible way for people to make sure their money is doing some good. And the guarantee on offer to new investors will definitely provide reassurance. However, above and beyond that guarantee, your capital is at risk, and the returns are not guaranteed. In the worst-case scenario, if there is some kind of disaster, crisis or bankruptcy, you could lose some or all of your capital and would not be able to get redress from the UK’s Financial Services Compensation Scheme or complain to the Financial Ombudsman Service. So this is not going to be for everyone. Energise Africa was launched in 2017 and is the result of a link-up between Ethex, a UK-based ethical investment platform, and Lendahand, a Dutch-based crowdfunding platform. It boasts a community of more than 1,800 investors and partners who have so far raised more than £8.9m. The platform says it has successfully closed more than 60 fundraising projects, which means its investors have helped about 350,000 people to access affordable, clean energy. An estimated 600 million people in sub-Saharan Africa live without access to electricity. Many use traditional energy sources such as kerosene lamps, candles and batteries but these can be dangerous as well as costly. Having a solar system can allow children to read and study in the evening, and enable a person to install a fridge so they can sell cold drinks. In terms of the investment offer, this involves putting money into unsecured bonds that are not listed on a public market. Essentially, you are lending money to businesses that sell small solar home systems to African families, with a typical term of two to three years. At the time of writing, there were two projects on the Energise Africa website open for investment: both two-year bonds with an expected interest rate of 5% a year. The company behind the two-year product is Cambridge-based Azuri, which has set an investment target of £200,000. The company says each £200 invested will enable one Kenyan family to buy an Azuri SolarPlus home system in affordable instalments. Meanwhile, the firm behind the other bond is Sollatek, based in Mombasa, Kenya, which is seeking to raise £65,000. At the moment, all first-time Energise Africa customers are being offered a guarantee on the capital they invest, up to £100 in one project. In the event of the issuing company defaulting on its repayments, the guarantee would be called on to repay the investor their £100. Assuming there is no call on the facility, the funds will be available to provide a guarantee to other first-time investors once the bond has been fully redeemed. Energise Africa is supported by UK aid money, Virgin Unite (the nonprofit foundation of the Virgin Group), the Swiss-based Good Energies Foundation, and P4G"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"environment/2019/sep/15/to-save-the-planet-fossil-fuels-need-to-stay-underground","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2019-09-15T15:48:26Z","webTitle":"To save the planet, fossil fuels need to stay underground | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/15/to-save-the-planet-fossil-fuels-need-to-stay-underground","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2019/sep/15/to-save-the-planet-fossil-fuels-need-to-stay-underground","fields":{"headline":"To save the planet, fossil fuels need to stay underground","bodyText":"Fiona Harvey is surely right when she says “adaptation alone won’t save us from climate disaster” (Journal, 12 September). She gives an apt metaphor that adaptation “while continuing to burn fossil fuels is like trying to mop up an overflowing sink while the taps are still running”, but she still talks of mechanisms for “better economic growth”. Political leaders worldwide need to recognise the causal connection between economic growth and global heating, manifest in fossil fuel consumption. To save the planet, fossil fuels need to stay underground – unused by the greed of humankind. Our energy must come from wind, wave, hydraulic and solar sources, but this will be insufficient to maintain many of our industries and, consequently, many jobs will be lost. Societies need to adapt so that acquisitive individualism is replaced by cooperative community life. Partly self-sustaining communities need to be created where home workers (ie, non-wage workers) can find worthwhile activity in home care, environment care, vegetable gardens, allotments, orchards, community social activities and other unpaid pursuits. To alleviate the potential poverty of those losing jobs, universal citizen’s income will be needed – recovered in taxation from those in wage-paying work. Come the next general election, would-be MPs should tell us how they propose to tackle climate change and how they intend to engage in worldwide discussion of necessary measures. Michael Bassey Newark, Nottinghamshire • Does Fiona Harvey go far enough in her judgment that emissions reduction, adaptation and coastal protection constitute the main “tools in the box” for averting such a disaster? An analysis of the stress exerted on our climate and ocean system by the growing excess of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere suggests an aim which is fundamentally more appropriate: the retrieval of this overload, with the goal of returning carbon dioxide’s concentration to its stable and pre-industrial level of 280 parts per million, from the present, and growing, 408ppm. Ultimately, taking care of the stressor would take care of the raised temperatures which we so rightly fear. Such a policy would demand a great deal of money, more perhaps than the public and financial institutions are currently willing to part with. And it would necessitate the worldwide adoption of technologies in which fossil fuels would no longer play a part. These technologies are known to many, and are already developing fast. We need to displace fossil fuels and embrace all that solar energy has to offer in the forms of electricity, heat and hydrogen derived from solar-electrolysed water. And we need to develop forms of enhanced photosynthetic growth, in expanding forests and in harvesting specially planted grasses, ensuring that the carbon thus embedded in their tissues is never returned to the atmosphere. Mike Koefman Director, Planet Hydrogen, Manchester • Fiona Harvey stated two profound truths. The first in the title; the second in the words: “As long as we continue to pump CO2 into the air, we are fuelling rises in temperature.” But it is the second truth that identifies the fundamental solution – to pump CO2 out of the air faster than the rate at which it is being pumped in. This is known as greenhouse gas removal, the subject of a 2018 report from the Royal Society, in which we read that “reducing emissions is not enough – we must also actively remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere”. So perhaps Fiona Harvey should be less dismissive of geoengineering. Funding a major project to develop large-scale ways to extract greenhouse gases from the atmosphere will save the planet. Dennis Sherwood Rutland, East Midlands • Fiona Harvey says: “Melting permafrost releases methane, a greenhouse gas many times more powerful than CO2.” While the levels of methane gas should certainly be reduced, that phrase demonises methane over CO2. According to Simon Fairlie in his Meat: A Benign Extravagance, methane doesn’t stay in the atmosphere for longer than 12 years, while the same value of CO2 has its effect spread out over two centuries. By demonising methane, it will be more likely that rural communities whose modest lifestyles include a few ruminants and timber-fuelled sources of energy would be penalised over industrial-scale CO2 producers and users. This would be patently unfair. Ann Spencer Harefield, Middlesex • Fiona Harvey is absolutely right that there is going to be no wall high enough to keep out the consequences of inaction on greenhouse gas emissions. All the more disappointing therefore that she seems to buy into the Global Commission on Adaptation’s assumption that investment now is about buying us “trillions of dollars in potential growth”. That’s a priority one might expect from Bill Gates, but the work of thinkers from sociologists like Jem Bendell to economists like Tim Jackson now suggests that we won’t really get started on adapting and building resilience until we accept that growth of any kind is over. The planet simply cannot cope with any more of it. The vitally urgent need now is to find a just and viable post-growth way of life.

This was Simon Fenn and his partner Mitra Cvijanovic’s view from the moment they decided to create a new family home on the Norfolk coast, in the hamlet of Waxham. They were determined to make as light an impact on the surroundings as possible, designing a modern eco-friendly home that would be modest in scale and with the smallest possible carbon footprint. Their super-insulated “beach shack” is now heated by just two tiny electric radiators and even these are seldom used. “When we first moved into the house it was winter and so I went out to the shops and bought us all some thick socks and blankets, because I thought we would be cold,” says Mitra, who works in the finance industry. “We just didn’t know what to expect, but within a day we were all walking around in T-shirts. No socks, no blankets – nothing. It was wonderful.” During a regular working week Simon, Mitra and their two sons, Alex, 18, and Sam, 11, are based near Cambridge, where they built a house for themselves some years ago with the help of Mole Architects. But eventually they decided they wanted another project – a weekend and holiday house that they could use themselves, but also rent out at times to make sure it was almost fully occupied. They began looking around Cambridgeshire and East Anglia until eventually they found a small bungalow on the coast in a property auction. “It was a prefab bungalow from the 1930s made by Boulton &amp; Paul,” says Simon, an IT consultant. “They were quite popular back then, but this one was beyond repair. At first we thought we might be able to do something with it, but when we really started looking closely at the building we realised there was no chance. So we began moving towards the idea of a fresh start and a replacement dwelling. Normally you wouldn’t be able to build something new in a place like this, but we knew that we had a good chance because it was replacing the house that was already here.” Simon and Mitra had the old kit house taken apart and recycled. Having already worked with Mole Architects in Cambridgeshire, it was a natural step to ask them to design the family’s very own Shangri-La, a concept that became the name they gave their next home. The design uses Passivhaus principles, meaning that the house is super-insulated and works to a rigorous low-energy spec, so that very little heating or cooling is needed. Mole Architects – who have plenty of experience in low-energy, sustainable design – joined forces with Beattie Passive in Norwich, a construction company that produces energy-efficient, zero-carbon buildings. “Beattie are local and were a really good fit,” says Ian Bramwell of Mole Architects. “They delivered a great result in terms of airtightness and thermal efficiency, but we were still able to design the house we all wanted. Essentially, we have these two rectangular volumes, side by side, and a spine wall down the middle that does most of the structural work without anyone even realising it. But they slide past each other, so that one extends outwards, which was really important in defining the layout of the house.” The four-bedroomed house sits on the footprint of the old and takes some inspiration from the idea of the beach bungalow vernacular, with a twin pitched roofline and its broad verandah. Yet the house is also distinctly modern, with big sheets of triple-glazed sliding glass facing southwards to maximise not just the views over the fields but also the solar energy, which helps to warm the house; in summer the glass windows slide back to allow natural ventilation. The house is built of timber, mostly larch, with thick walls packed with insulation, as well as a ventilation and heat-recovery system. Inside, the yellow front door leads into a central hallway, with two bedrooms to either side, and then the house opens up dramatically at the point where one part of the house begins to slide past the other. Here, there’s a largely open-plan living area with big views and plenty of light. But the layout also allows for an intimate seating area within an alcove, defined by a lower ceiling height. Then there’s a more fluid dining area and, to one side, the kitchen, lightly separated from the rest of the space by a waist-high counter that tops some of the kitchen units. Joinery by two local carpenters lends a warm, organic feel to the spaces, while Simon and Mitra – who project-managed Shangri-La themselves – also sourced an engaging mix of contemporary and mid-century furniture and lighting. At one point, before the house was finished, the family thought about putting in a wood-burning stove to keep them warm. But the house is so efficient that Simon and Mitra are now relieved they decided against the idea. “The Passivhaus principles rely on people being in the building and cooking and doing the usual things, which helps to warm things up naturally,” says Simon, who is now working on plans for a work studio back in Cambridgeshire. “We always have this very even heat, so the energy use is incredibly minimal, and we just love how calm the house feels. It’s a complete retreat, especially out of season, where we can just get away from it all. We have this wonderful view and the other thing is that you have this fantastic beach down the path where you can walk for miles in either direction. It is a very tranquil place to be.” shangri-la.house"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"global-development/2018/jun/20/uk-foreign-office-ranks-among-worlds-worst-on-revealing-how-aid-is-spent","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-20T05:00:37Z","webTitle":"UK Foreign Office ranks among world's worst on revealing how aid is spent","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/jun/20/uk-foreign-office-ranks-among-worlds-worst-on-revealing-how-aid-is-spent","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2018/jun/20/uk-foreign-office-ranks-among-worlds-worst-on-revealing-how-aid-is-spent","fields":{"headline":"UK Foreign Office ranks among world's worst on revealing how aid is spent","bodyText":"The British Foreign Office has been ranked one of the world’s worst major aid donors on transparency, according to a new study. The Whitehall department was described as “poor” and “well below average” on transparency of aid spend, ranking 40th among 45 major donors by the Aid Transparency Index, launched by the global campaign Publish What You Fund. The annual index examines international donors that spend more than $1bn (£760m) in aid, and assess how easy it is to track the cash. The FCO ranks below South Korea’s International Co-operation Agency, which came 38th in the index. Spain’s agency for international development and the FCO were the only two European organisations included in the “poor” category. In contrast to the FCO’s low ranking, the Department for International Development (DfID) came third, with a rating of “very good”. Catherine Turner, director of advocacy at Publish What You Fund, said; “This is a wake-up call to the Foreign Office to up their game when it comes to aid transparency. Such a low ranking raises questions about how seriously the FCO is taking their commitment to improve standards.” The FCO had no information available on 39% of the transparency indicators, she said, and lacked data on evaluation and results. The 2015 UK aid strategy committed all government departments that provide aid to achieving a “good” or “very good” rating in the index by 2020. Katy Chakrabortty, Oxfam GB’s head of advocacy, said: “It’s a worrying irony that, amongst the departments other than DfID spending aid, the Foreign Office has taken the most strides towards transparency, yet remains almost rock bottom in the rankings … This is not good enough at a time when the government already spends over a quarter of UK aid outside of DfID.” The rising proportion of the £13.4bn British aid budget spent by departments outside of DfID has drawn concern from aid organisations, who see the FCO and others as less transparent. Recently, MPs from the international development committee told Penny Mordaunt, the development secretary, to “get a grip” on aid spent outside DfID, amid worries that millions of pounds were being spent in China. There have also been widespread transparency concerns over the conflict, stability and security fund, a cross-department aid pot set up under the auspices of the FCO and DfID. An FCO spokeswoman said it was committed to transparency but security issues prevented it releasing details on projects that were high-risk or in conflict zones. She said: “Foreign Office aid is tackling poverty and conflict, and boosting prosperity in some of the world’s poorest countries. We have made changes to improve our transparency, and routinely publish our aid spending on gov.uk. We are confident that we will meet HMG’s transparency commitment by 2020.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2019/aug/16/scott-morrisons-betrayal-of-the-pacific-was-immoral-and-completely-unnecessary","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2019-08-16T06:25:50Z","webTitle":"Scott Morrison's betrayal of the Pacific was immoral – and completely unnecessary | Nicky Ison","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/16/scott-morrisons-betrayal-of-the-pacific-was-immoral-and-completely-unnecessary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/16/scott-morrisons-betrayal-of-the-pacific-was-immoral-and-completely-unnecessary","fields":{"headline":"Scott Morrison's betrayal of the Pacific was immoral – and completely unnecessary","bodyText":"As the Pacific Islands Forum comes to an end, Australia has yet again been shamed on a global stage for our inaction on climate change. The forum was held in Tuvalu, one of the lowest lying islands on Earth, where the effects of sea level rise are already being seen. For Tuvalu, a global commitment to limiting climate change to 1.5C is literally a question of survival. By doing everything he could to water down the forum communique’s climate language, the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, refused to listen to the words of Tuvalu’s prime minister, Enele Sopoaga, when he urged leaders to focus on “survival, not saving the economies of countries”. However, in a country like Australia, even that is a false choice. Australia more so than almost any other country has the opportunity to prosper economically through decarbonisation. We can, as they say, have our cake and eat it too. The pathway to global decarbonisation relies heavily on the shift from coal, oil and gas to renewable resources. In a decarbonised world not only do we power our homes and businesses with renewables, but we also power our cars, buses, trains and industry with wind, solar and storage. With technologies like electric vehicles, hydrogen buses and electromagnetic industrial heating, this is all eminently possible. As a country with some of the best solar and wind resources in the world, vast areas of land, a low population and manufacturing base and strong trading relationships particularly in Asia, Australia is uniquely positioned to help decarbonise our region. Indeed, it is not only our Pacific neighbours who are asking for our help. Our biggest trading partners – Japan, South Korea and Taiwan – are looking eagerly at Australia’s renewable resources to help them act on climate. Already, there are plans in development to export solar energy to Singapore through a Sun Cable from the Northern Territory. Macquarie Capital is financing the development of the Asia Renewable Energy Hub in Western Australia. This project, which has recently grown to 15GW of solar and wind, will not only power the mining operations of the Pilbara and increased onshore minerals refining, it will also generate renewable hydrogen that can be exported to our neighbours. This week, Pacific leaders asked Australia to stop expanding our coal industry. As a country that has been exporting coal since 1799, this request came as an affront to our federal government. However, given that coal is the biggest cause of climate change and Australia’s largest contribution, we cannot be serious about stopping climate change without planning to move beyond coal. While moving away from coal will have its challenges, it is possible. It is also better to restructure our economy deliberately, supporting those who work in the coal industry, than for these communities to be left to the whims of global market forces. Already the Latrobe Valley Authority is showing how we might do this. From electric vehicle manufacturing, to investment in transport infrastructure, to more jobs in healthcare, their efforts to diversify the economy of the Latrobe Valley in Victoria are showing progress. Restructuring our economy does not happen over night, but we need to recognise that it has already started. In the past three years $9bn have been invested in building renewable energy generation. According to Macromonitor, the renewables boom is “currently the largest contributor to overall growth in construction in Australia”, helping to keep our economy moving forward. However, this boom will not continue without new policy as the renewable energy target comes to an end. With our economy stagnant and interest rates low, now is the time to invest in the future of Australia and in the process help ensure the survival of our neighbours. However, if the moral and economic arguments for acting on climate change are insufficient to move our recalcitrant federal government, perhaps the geopolitical argument will be more persuasive. China is actively working to strengthen its position in the Pacific, seeing this as a strategic location. Their efforts include backing the calls by Pacific leaders to act on climate and phase-out coal power, as well as direct support for infrastructure and renewable energy deployment in the Pacific. As a country that has globally committed to climate leadership, China has both the moral authority and the economic leverage to make Australia increasingly irrelevant. Scott Morison’s performance at the Pacific Island Forum has not helped this situation. Australia’s regional and global influence will not grow unless we are fair dinkum about acting on climate change. Without greater domestic action, we may be able to throw our weight around at the Pacific Islands Forum, but we will slowly lose our geopolitical, economic and moral authority in a world that has committed to act on the climate crisis. • Nicky Ison is a founding director of the Community Power Agency and a research associate at the Institute for Sustainable Futures at the University of Technology, Sydney"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2018/nov/01/electric-food-magic-bullet-or-magical-thinking","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-11-01T18:17:59Z","webTitle":"Electric food – magic bullet or magical thinking? | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/01/electric-food-magic-bullet-or-magical-thinking","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/nov/01/electric-food-magic-bullet-or-magical-thinking","fields":{"headline":"Electric food – magic bullet or magical thinking?","bodyText":"George Monbiot makes a strong case for how our ecosystem might survive (Electric food – the new sci-fi diet that could save our planet, 31 October). He thinks it is imperative that we eliminate meat in favour of plant-based agriculture. He also wants us to explore the possibility of using electricity instead of photosynthesis to convert sunlight into food. Since this would be 10 times more efficient, farming and fishing need take up much less space and biodiversity could flourish. But I must protest at the absurdity of his claim that the destruction of forests and wetlands along with “the slaughter of predators and the massacre of turtles … is done at our behest”. The felling of rainforest in Brazil is no more done at my behest, even if (knowingly or unknowingly) I happen to buy toiletries or food containing palm oil, than is the laundering of dirty money because I have a mortgage with a high street bank. I don’t want to make the equally absurd claim that as individuals we have no responsibility for the environmentally damaging effects of many of our unavoidable choices. My point is, rather, that the range of choices, and what any one of them involves, is overwhelmingly determined by sociopolitical constraints. As individuals in a relatively free society, we can attempt to alter these constraints by starting or joining movements – like Extinction Rebellion, which Monbiot tells us has just been launched. Good luck to it. Richard Bryden Llandudno, Clwyd • There are fundamental reasons why the Solar Foods system can’t compete with plants for sustainable food production. The supply of minerals for the bacteria has to be assembled chemically, with all the chemical industry’s environmental downsides. By contrast, plant roots pull the right minerals in the right proportions out of mixed-up traces in the environment, using solar energy to fuel selective concentration at no cost, generating no pollution. The machinery to acquire the raw materials is built by the plant using solar energy in a non-polluting process, not made in a factory. Likewise, the light energy-trapping machinery of plants is assembled on a planetary scale with none of the unwelcome byproducts of heat and chemical pollution associated with solar cell fabrication. Plants are still the only source of food with long-term sustainability. David Hanke Swaffham Bulbeck, Cambridgeshire • Given the warning from the IPCC of imminent catastrophic planetary systems’ collapse, George Monbiot’s piece is apposite. Novel synthesis based on hydrogen, the simplest element, opens up a whole new world of possibilities that might just save the world. Hydrogen, produced from water by electrolysis using renewable energy, is already set to replace fossil fuels in transport vehicles via the hydrogen fuel cell. Now it appears we can substantially ease the ecological burden the world population – especially the rich world – places on our planet by replacing our food sources with hydrogen-based nutrition. It’s not alchemy, it’s better. It actually works! John Stone Thames Ditton, Surrey • Much as I love George Monbiot, I find his suggestion this week unacceptable. Human history has been one of population growth, and “helpful” people have been offering technological solutions to feeding the growing masses. From farming and industrialisation to big pharma and changing eating habits, everything is designed to maintain the human population. Only when we accept death and learn to love our predators can we achieve sustainability. Susan Hitchcock Eastbourne, East Sussex • I see George Monbiot is again indulging in magical thinking. Leaving aside all the issues in turning something from a laboratory curiosity to a viable food source, his greatest error is overlooking the fact that – in the unlikely event of this becoming a food source – the intellectual property involved would undoubtedly end up in the hands of big business, which would ensure it was used to enhance their profits at the expense of general benefit.

Trump will tout America’s clean air and water, although his administration has advanced many efforts that experts say have undercut the country’s environmental record. As Democrats make the environment and the climate crisis key to their presidential campaigns, Republicans are feeling pressure from voters from across the political spectrum who worry about the planet and public health. Trump has little to point to in terms of environmental achievements. He could discuss a US effort to clean up marine debris, much of which is coming from Asia. The issue could fit well with Republican arguments that developing nations like China are currently contributing far more to the climate crisis than the US. Trump could also mention funds to restore the Florida Everglades. He is not expected to make any major announcements of new policy initiatives. Yet in an off-the-record conference call on Wednesday, the White House reached out to key supporting groups requesting they spread the message that the US under Trump continues to be an environmental leader. Trump’s environment officials, including Environmental Protection Agency administrator Andrew Wheeler, interior secretary David Bernhardt and council on environmental quality chief Mary Neumayr will be at the White House on Monday for the 3.30pm event titled Presidential Remarks on America’s Environmental Leadership. Broadly, Trump’s agencies have rescinded rules to cut pollution from power plants and vehicles, boosting fossil fuel development wherever possible. The president himself has denied that humans are heating the planet and endangering themselves. Yet the White House remains constrained by competing conservative interests who disagree about which climate change messaging the administration should pursue. Some groups, like the Competitive Enterprise Institute and Heartland Institute, do not believe the science that shows humans are heating the planet at a dangerous rate and want the president to focus on expanding fossil fuel use. They support an aide pushing climate denial from the White House. A small faction of Republicans want the party to acknowledge the problem but disagree with the kind of solutions Democrats propose, including a Green New Deal for massive climate mitigation spending and programs to tackle inequality. Sarah Hunt, a conservative co-founder of the cross-partisan Rainey Center, said Trump should use the opportunity to endorse America’s emissions cuts so far. “American energy innovation allows our nation to lead the world in greenhouse gas emissions reductions – we’ve cut our emissions over 10% since 2005,” Hunt said. “The president should be proud that American natural gas, wind and solar energy are creating jobs and fighting climate change. I would love to see him announce an initiative that will help our great American clean energy companies export their zero-carbon energy technology to the rest of the world.” Trump could argue that promoting cheap energy around the world will lift up the poor, even if that energy is fuelled by polluting coal, oil and gas. Myron Ebell, energy and environment director at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, said he wants the president to say that “the alternative to the Green New Deal is not carbon taxes and making people poorer. It’s the Trump energy agenda, which makes people wealthier. Wealthier is healthier, the wealthier we are, the higher our environmental quality.” Trump officials often state that the US has grown its economy while seeing a decrease over time in emissions. It’s true that US emissions have been in decline for years, but they went up in 2018, according to the Energy Information Administration. And they are not on track to achieve what scientists say is necessary to limit the worst of global warming. The president and his cabinet also argue the US has the cleanest air in the world, which is not true, although the US does outrank many other nations on air quality. US deaths related to certain types of air pollution also decreased by around a third between 1990 and 2010. Still, the American Lung Association finds that 43% of Americans live in counties with unhealthy air. The health burden is often higher for poor people and communities of color. Air pollution is increasing in some areas of the US, as Trump’s administration cuts the regulations that have achieved that cleaner air. Most recently, the EPA finalized a proposal to replace an Obama-era climate change rule to cut pollution from the electricity sector with a regulation that will do almost nothing to cut emissions and could increase air pollution in some communities. Contacted for comment, a White House spokesperson confirmed the president’s plans: “The President will deliver remarks at the White House on Monday and recognize his administration’s environmental leadership and America’s role in leading the world.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2019/oct/09/climate-emergency-what-oil-gas-giants-say","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2019-10-10T10:40:39Z","webTitle":"Climate emergency: what the oil, coal and gas giants say","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/09/climate-emergency-what-oil-gas-giants-say","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2019/oct/09/climate-emergency-what-oil-gas-giants-say","fields":{"headline":"Climate emergency: what the oil, coal and gas giants say","bodyText":"Shell “We agree that action is needed now on climate change, so we fully support the Paris agreement and the need for society to transition to a lower-carbon future.

The company has also put forward the low-carbon development objective, targeting to reduce CO2 emissions per unit of industrial value-added by 25%, compared with 2015, by 2020. By 2030, we will continue to increase the supply of natural gas and other clean energy, make sure that domestic natural gas production accounts for 55% of the company’s domestic primary energy, in order to effectively control the emission of greenhouse gases.” Total “Total is fully aware of the challenges represented by climate change, has acknowledged the link between greenhouse gases and climate change publicly for several decades and has never engaged in ‘misinformation campaigns’. We would be grateful if you would therefore refrain from alleging that Total engaged in misinformation campaigns as this is an entirely unsubstantiated allegation. On the contrary, and for many years now, Total has integrated climate change concerns into the development of its strategy. “Indeed, our challenge is to increase access to affordable energy to satisfy the needs of a growing population, while providing concrete solutions that will help limit the effects of climate change and supply an energy mix that progressively decreases in carbon intensity. “As far as the Climate Accountability Institute’s study you refer to is concerned, a distinction must be made between emissions resulting directly from our activities and those which arise from the use of the products which we make available to our customers and which we do not control. The emissions resulting from our activities account for roughly a 10th of the total figures you indicate in your email, the remainder being related to the use of our products by our customers.

We recognise that human activity, including the burning of fossil fuels, is contributing to increased concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere that can lead to adverse changes in global climate. While uncertainties remain, we continue to manage GHG emissions in our operations and to integrate climate-change-related activities and goals into our business planning. Details on our GHG metrics can be found here. “Our company has voluntarily reduced our emissions by almost 7m tonnes per year since 2009. This is significant when put in context: This reduction number does not include mandated reductions. Our total operated emissions are about 20m tonnes per year. “We have a long-term target to reduce our GHG emissions intensity from 5-15% by 2030, which is subject to periodic reviews and adjustment as we progress. We have had a longstanding climate change position and we continue to integrate climate-change-related activities and goals into our business planning.

BHP has never shied away from its responsibilities on CO2 and climate change, in fact, we have been one of the strongest – if not the strongest – advocate and proactive player in the sector in addressing our own operations as well as researching, funding and promoting technologies, practices and policies to mitigate environmental impacts from our activities.” The company highlighted an announcement this year in which its chief executive, Andrew Mackenzie, said BHP was setting up a $400m climate investment programme to develop technologies to reduce emissions from its operations as well as those generated from the use of its resources. “Over the next five years this programme will scale up low-carbon technologies critical to the decarbonisation of our operations. It will drive investment in nature-based solutions and encourage further collective action on scope three emissions … We must take a product-stewardship role for emissions across our value chain and commit to work with shippers, processors and users of our products to reduce scope three emissions.” Petrobras “Petrobras has been accompanying the climate science evolution and its developments on energetic, social and economic systems for over 15 years. The company monitors opportunities that the new regulations and technological innovations bring about in terms of new products and business models. ”In its operations, Petrobras seeks to apply technologies which have as a direct consequence the reduction of carbon intensity, with significant results already achieved: since 2008, 9.8m tonnes of CO2 have been reinjected from the pre-salt pits in the Bacia dos Santos. “Until 2025, the company projects reinjecting 40m tons of CO2. Between 2009 and 2018, the emission of over 120m tons of CO2 has been averted, which equals two years of total emissions from the Petrobras. “Currently, Petrobras has, among the major oil and natural gas producers, the second best performance in relative emissions (CO2/barrel) in exploration and production activities. “The company has vowed to achieve zero growth in operational emissions up until 2025 (base year 2015), even with an increase in production, setting emission-intensity reduction goals of 32% in exploitation and production of oil and 16% in refining. ”Additionally, by 2023, Petrobras will invest US $350m in research and development in the areas of CCUS (carbon capture utilisation and storage), advanced biofuels, offshore wind and solar energy.” Peabody Energy Peabody recognises that climate change is occurring and that human activity, including the use of fossil fuels, contributes to greenhouse gas emissions. We also recognise that coal is essential to affordable, reliable energy and will continue to play a significant role in the global energy mix for the foreseeable future.

For the first time ever, the amount of electricity demanded by homes and businesses in the afternoon on Saturday was lower than it was in the night, because solar panels on rooftops and in fields cut demand so much. National Grid, which runs the transmission network, described the moment as a “huge milestone”. The company sees the solar power generated on the distribution networks – or local roads of the system – as reduced electricity demand. The sunshine meant that solar power produced six times more electricity than the country’s coal-fired power stations on Saturday. Continued good weather saw solar power generate significant amounts of power on Sunday and Monday too, when it was providing around 15% of electricity generation. Demand on Sunday afternoon was also lower than on Sunday night. Duncan Burt, who manages daily operations at National Grid, said: “Demand being lower in the afternoon than overnight really is turning the hard and fast rules of the past upside down. It’s another fascinating sign of the huge changes we are seeing in Britain’s energy scene.” Electricity demand usually peaks around 4pm to 6pm at this time of year, as people return home from work, with demand lower still at weekends. But the early hours of the morning are usually the quietest for the Berkshire control centre that monitors the grid, so a reversal is dramatic. Chris Goodall, the author of a recent book on how solar power is transforming energy systems, said that, counterintuitively, March is a good time for solar panels in the UK, due to the angle the sun is hitting them and because they operate better in lower temperatures. “A sunny day between the equinoxes can now produce a peak of around 9.5GW. At weekends, when demand is low, this will frequently mean solar is producing well over 25% of the UK power need. This drives coal almost completely out of the mix, as it did at the weekend, and depresses gas use,” he said. Goodall said that by weekends this summer, on windy and sunny days he expected fossil fuels could be providing as little as 15% of the UK’s power. That percentage could fall to zero in coming years as new offshore windfarms are completed, he said. The solar industry hailed the landmark last weekend, and said the government had repeatedly underestimated the technology’s potential. A spokeswoman for the Solar Trade Association said: “This milestone shows the balance of power is shifting, quite literally, away from the old centralised ‘coal-by-wire’ model into the hands of householders, businesses and communities all over the UK who want their own clean solar power.” Solar power installations grew dramatically in 2014 and 2015 (pdf), but new capacity largely collapsed in 2016 after the government axed and reduced subsidies. An independent report, commissioned by the STA, found the UK’s power network could handle four times more solar capacity than there was today without increasing costs for the grid. Other studies (pdf) have also concluded that even a significant expansion of renewable energy would impose only “relatively modest” costs to integrate into the electricity system. A government spokesman said: “This government wants Britain to be one of the best places in the world to invest in clean, flexible energy. Solar power is a great success, with over 11GW of capacity installed in the last five years that’s enough to power more than 2.6 million homes with clean electricity.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/live/2021/nov/02/cop26-live-news-joe-biden-global-methane-emissions-boris-johnson-glasgow-latest","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-11-02T18:36:57Z","webTitle":"Cop26: Boris Johnson says ‘the eyes of the world are on our negotiators’ as world leaders leave climate conference – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/live/2021/nov/02/cop26-live-news-joe-biden-global-methane-emissions-boris-johnson-glasgow-latest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/live/2021/nov/02/cop26-live-news-joe-biden-global-methane-emissions-boris-johnson-glasgow-latest","fields":{"headline":"Cop26: Boris Johnson says ‘the eyes of the world are on our negotiators’ as world leaders leave climate conference – as it happened","bodyText":"The conference is over for today. So it’s goodbye from me for now. We’ll be back tomorrow morning, but here’s a roundup of what’s happened this afternoon: Boris Johnson has declared he is “cautiously optimistic” about a deal at Cop26 to keep global temperature rises below 1.5C as he urged China to commit to bringing emissions down by 2025. The US president, Joe Biden, has announced a pledge to cut global methane emissions by 30% by 2030. Reducing these emissions was touted as one of the most immediate opportunities to slow global heating ahead of the summit. A plan to coordinate the introduction of clean technologies in order to rapidly drive down their cost has been agreed at the Cop26 summit by world leaders, including the UK, US, India and China. The prime minister of Rwanda has told of how his country has witnessed the impact of climate change “first hand, including floods, draughts and landslides have cost livelihoods ... and cost many lives.” African countries are preparing to spend at least $6bn a year from their tax revenues on adapting to the impacts of the climate crisis and are calling on the rich world to provide $2.5bn a year for the next five years to enable them to meet their goals. Amazon’s founder, Jeff Bezos, has defended his trip to space telling delegates that it made him realise how “finite and fragile” the Earth is. And Police Scotland has apologised to women in Glasgow who had to walk home in darkness on Monday night after well-lit streets were blocked off due to Cop26 climate summit security concerns. Youth and Indigenous activists, and others most affected by climate change, staged an action marking the end of the World Leaders Summit just opposite the conference centre on Tuesday evening, calling on negotiators to “End Climate Betrayal” with concrete action over the next two weeks. Holding up huge illuminated letters, the action follows on from the open letter to world leaders sent by Greta Thunberg, Vanessa Nakate and Mitzi Tan to enact a 5-point plan for the climate, which has been signed by more than one million people globally. More reaction to the Biden methane pledge from earlier today. Raymond Pierrehumbert, professor of physics at the University of Oxford, says: “As things stand, methane is mostly just a distraction from the main job of ridding the world economy of fossil fuel burning and its associated carbon dioxide emissions.” Actions to control methane are only really useful if the planet is on track to achieve net zero carbon emissions in the next few decades. He said: “We are sadly not yet in that world, and until we are, methane is just a sideshow.” Professor Myles Allen, professor of Geosystem science at Oxford, said a 30% cut in global methane emissions would reduce global temperatures by around one-tenth of a degree. “Meanwhile, carbon dioxide emissions are driving temperatures up by over two-tenths of a degree per decade. Unless we get carbon dioxide on a path to net zero by mid-century, action on methane today won’t have much impact on peak warming,” he said. Johnson said companies and financial institutions have an important role in stopping deforestation and that consumer pressure is also key. Lastly, asked whether President Macron left early after falling out with the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson says: “We are working very closely with our French friends and partners on the things that matter most to the people of the world, which are climate change and reducing CO2.” Asked about India’s net zero target being for 2070, Johnson says: “I think the most important thing that they’ve said is that they want to decarbonise so much of their power system by 2030. That’s a massive commitment.” On China, he says it is engaging on the matter of climate change but that the world needs more progress from the Asian country. “I think we need China to make commitments, China has made a substantial commitment to move to net zero by the middle of the century, 2050 or before. Let’s see where we get to with China ... let’s see where that adds up to.” He adds that China has committed to stop financing overseas coal. Asked about President Xi Jinping of China’s lack of attendance at Cop26, Johnson says you have to respect his decision not to come to the summit “because of the pandemic”. He said Russian president Vladimir Putin is not attending for the same reason. More from Johnson: “If we don’t fix our climate, it will be an economic catastrophe. I also happen to think there is a great wisdom in the British people that think this is an issue that needs to be fixed.” He refers to a graph presented yesterday by Sir David Attenborough depicting the increase in CO2 emissions. “They can see that, they’re not dumb,” he says. He says the climate crisis will be tackled by creating high-wage, high-skilled jobs in green technologies. Asked by a Daily Express journalist whether there should be a public vote on net zero, he says: “As for your brilliant suggestion of a referendum, I think this country has had quite enough referendums to be getting on with.” Speaking about the impact of the climate crisis, Johnson says: “When it comes to helping countries to transition, there is a huge amount to do. We have the tools to do it. And we certainly have, in theory, the finance to do it. Mark Carney would say hundreds of trillions of dollars, others would say tens of trillions, that can be leveraged by the public sector and by our investment. But I’m not going to disagree with anyone that says the world has a lot more to do.” Boris Johnson tells the BBC’s Laura Kuenssburg that we are starting to see the plans behind the pledges made in Paris in 2015. He says: “I think what you are starting to see here is a sense of how actually you can deliver those cuts in CO2.” However, he admits there is still a lot of work to do to put plans into practice. “The world leaders may be leaving, but the eyes of the world are on our negotiators and we have your numbers,” says Johnson, who is due to fly back to London this evening. Johnson continues: “We’ve been asking for action on coal, cars, cash and trees and after just a couple of days we can certainly begin to tick three of those boxes – we are beginning to write the tick. “That’s all happened because we have been able to come together in Glasgow.” He goes on to say that the clock in the doomsday scenario is still ticking but says “we have a bomb disposal team on site and they are starting to snip some of the wires, some of the right wires I hope.” Johnson is reeling off what he perceives to be successes from the Cop26 summit so far. He says that 90% of the world’s economy is now working towards net zero, including “India keeping 1bn tonnes of carbon out of the atmosphere by switching half its power grid to renewable energy”. He added: “It’s not just that we are putting forward better or bigger targets but the world is putting forward the plans to reach those targets.” Johnson adds: “90% of the world has now signed up to net zero including India,” in reference to yesterday’s announcement from India. “We will keep working with world leaders to get to net zero sooner.” Johnson starting to speak: “We must take care to guard against false hope... still a very long way to go. I am cautiously optimistic... After two days of talks we’ve pulled back a goal or two from being 1-5 down.” As we wait for Boris Johnson’s press conference we can update you with some choice words that climate activist Greta Thunberg had for the world leaders inside the Cop26 conference in Glasgow. Joined by some of the many activists rallying around the climate change meeting, Thunberg decried inaction from politicians and big business, saying: “We are not going to let them get away with it anymore.” The Boris Johnson press conference is due to start at 5pm today. We will be covering Cop26 related updates here on this blog. For other non-Cop26 updates please follow my colleagues on the Guardian’s UK politics live blog. The prime minister of Rwanda has told of how his country has witnessed the impact of climate change “first hand”. Édouard Ngirente told the Cop26 summit: “We have fallen short of our duty to both people and the planet if we don’t urgently address climate change. In Rwanda, we have seen first hand the impact of climate change – floods, draughts and landslides have cost livelihoods ... and cost many lives.” He called on world leaders to “keep alive” the 1.5C warming target and said Rwanda “pledges its full support for inclusive and transparent negotiation and dialogue between partners around the world”. The EU has pledged €1bn to protect the world’s forests, after world leaders agreed a deal to halt and reverse global deforestation over the next decade. China, the US and Brazil are among the countries that have signed up to the Glasgow Leaders’ Declaration on Forests and Land Use, which aims to protect vast areas of land, from tropical rainforests to Siberian taiga. The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, announced the money on Tuesday and said forest protection was an integral part of the EU’s trade deals, such as with Japan. “Forests are the green lungs of the earth. We need to protect and restore them. I gladly announce that we are pledging €1 billion to protect world forests. This is a clear sign of the EU’s commitment to lead global change to protect our planet, in line with our EU Green Deal.” Of the EU’s €1bn, €250m will go to the Congo basin, home to the world’s second-largest rainforest. Von der Leyen also said the Commission would propose an EU regulation to prevent deforestation driven by EU consumption. Leaked versions of the draft law – due to be published the week after COP26 negotiations conclude – have already been criticised by scientists for incorrect use of data and by NGOs for failure to protect vulnerable grasslands and wetlands that are rich in biodiversity. In a major step forward for ocean conservation in the global south, four Pacific-facing Latin American nations have said they will create what is essentially a mega-MPA – a huge interconnected marine protection area in one of the world’s richest pockets of ocean biodiversity. Panama, Ecuador, Colombia and Costa Rica said the Eastern Tropical Pacific Marine Corridor (CMAR) would not only join but expand their protected territorial waters to create a fishing-free corridor of ocean. The area is one of the world’s most important migratory routes for sea turtles, whales, sharks and rays, but has been under threat from mostly foreign industrial fishing vessels, predominantly huge Chinese “distant fleets”, as well as illegal, underreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing by locals. Ecuador took the first step earlier today, by announcing it would expand the current area of the Galápagos marine reserve by about 60,000 sq km. Greenpeace has put out a statement responding to the earlier US and EU-led pledge to cut global methane emissions by 30% by 2030. Juan Pablo Osornio, head of the Greenpeace delegation at Cop26, has said: The IPCC says we need to cut all emissions in half by 2030 if we hope to keep global temperature rises within 1.5C. If we drastically slash fossil fuels we’d cut methane and carbon emissions at the same time, and have a much better chance of meeting that goal. And by not including meat reduction or pledges to change people’s diets in this commitment, governments are giving a free pass to big agriculture. All roads end up pointing to the need to eliminate fossil fuels from our energy system and phasing out industrial meat and dairy from our diets as soon as possible. This announcement dodges what’s needed.” If you wondered how optimistic climate scientists are about whether world leaders can tackle the climate crisis, the answer is, sadly, not very. An anonymous survey by Nature found many to be anxious or distressed, with six in ten of the respondents expecting the world to warm by at least 3C by the end of the century, compared with what conditions were like before the Industrial Revolution. The Irish premier, Micheál Martin, has said countries in the developed world have “an obligation” to support the nations most impacted by climate change. The taoiseach announced that Ireland would double its contribution to developing countries and would deliver at least €225m a year by 2025. He said: “If we act decisively now, we will offer humanity the most valuable prize of all, a liveable planet. We can achieve a cooler world. A biodiverse world. A world with healthier air for us to breathe, healthier soil for things to grow in. A world in which people can live more sustainable lives, handing a healing and enriched planet to future generations.” He added: “Those of us in the developed world, those who have, frankly, contributed most to the problems that confront us all have an obligation to support those who are most acutely challenged by their consequences. Ireland accepts that obligation.” The director and actor Fehinti Balogun has been at the conference this week talking about his show Can I live?, which uses hip-hop and spoken word to explore the ways people of colour have been excluded from environmental activism. Giving a speech last night, he said: I wanted to speak on behalf of the people this show represents: my mum, my cousins, my aunties, my uncles, my siblings, the people that look like me, that come from the places I come from. What would they want me to say? It is probably not about carbon credits or legislation. It’d be much simpler. I imagine it’d be a question: What are you gonna do? I mean ‘you’ because it’s hard to feel like ‘we’ when you often feel like them or other. It’s hard to say we when it is clear that we don’t have the same immediate power as you. The UK environment minister Zac Goldsmith has been speaking about the pledges by 114 world leaders to end deforestation and land degradation by the end of the decade, which has been coordinating behind the scenes ahead of Cop26. Although there has been great fanfare about the deal today, even backed by Xi Jinping and Jair Bolsonaro, it remains unclear about how commitments will be tracked and what ending deforestation actually means. “Clearly, monitoring is essential. There’s a lot of work going on at the moment to figure out exactly how different ecosystems in different parts of the world can be measured. But I am not convinced there is a single answer,” Lord Goldsmith said. “We’re talking about very significant sums of money. And of course, it’s public money. So the public will want to know that that money is being spent properly. That hasn’t always been the case in the past in relation to well intentioned investments to try and stop deforestation. “Countries making the Glasgow forest pledge will need to be able to demonstrate that money is being invested and it’s not being spent to subsidise failure.” Sauli Niinistö, the president of Finland, has reiterated the pledge for his country to become carbon-neutral by 2035. He said: “Ensuring adequate climate finance is crucial - Finland is doing its part by almost doubling its climate finance to developing countries.” He also told the Cop26 conference that as an Arctic country, Finland is “particularly concerned about the fast-warming Arctic region”. He said that as the most forested country in Europe, every year 150 million trees are planted in Finland, adding that “globally we need to strengthen efforts to halt forest loss... Now it is the time to deliver on our pledges and shoulder our human responsibilities,” he said. The US president, Joe Biden, has told the Cop26 summit that “our current technology alone won’t get us to where we need to be”. Speaking in Glasgow, the president insisted that setting ambitious climate targets was “only half the equation” and announced the launch of the First Movers Coalition. The coalition will bring together “more than two dozen of the world’s largest, most innovative companies” from eight sectors contributing emissions. He also said innovation should not be restricted to just the industrial sector but highlighted the “vital part to play” for the agricultural sector also. The US would lead by example and share innovations, he added. “There is virtually nothing we are unable to do, particularly if we do it together,” he said. The First Movers Coalition is part of the Breakthrough Agenda announced earlier this afternoon – a global plan to drive down the cost of clean technologies. My colleague Damian Carrington has a writeup of that story. Meanwhile, it seems Biden was given a very special welcome to Scotland this morning on his journey to Glasgow. Boris Johnson’s spokesman has sounded a more upbeat note about Cop26 today compared with the prime minister’s words at the weekend, warning about the risk of failure at Glasgow. The UK as hosts are understood to be pleased by progress on forests and the new 2030 commitment from India, but acknowledge that work on climate financing is proving very difficult. Asked whether Johnson’s weekend gloom had been expectation management, the spokesman said: “The PM felt very much at the G20 that limited progress was made but was by no means the significant boost that was needed. What we’ve seen so far is some early signs that we are starting to make some progress. Again, we are not complacent. This is not a done deal by any means. There is a huge amount of work left to do. “Currently we are at 2.7C and there is work to do to consider exactly what the commitments announced do to bring that down further, but we have absolutely not done enough to get us to 1.5 so the pressure will be kept up absolutely. It is just important to recognise when countries, when leaders do step up and make commitments that do require change, challenges and significant sums of investment.” Johnson has still not made a decision on whether to come back at the end of Cop26, and could make a statement from Downing Street on what is agreed rather than heading up to Glasgow again. Johnson is due to give a press conference at 5pm today before flying back to London. About 150 Extinction Rebellion activists have blocked Waterloo Street outside JP Morgan’s Glasgow offices. Protesters banged drums and chanted slogans highlighting the bank’s continued investment in fossil fuels as a sizeable police presence watched on. The protest, dubbed the “trillion-dollar bash”, then marched through busy streets and past Morgan Stanley’s offices before a wall of police blocked it from crossing the M8 motorway about 10 minutes from the SEC, where Cop26 is being held. A plan to coordinate the introduction of clean technologies in order to rapidly drive down their cost has been agreed at the Cop26 summit by world leaders, including the UK, US, India and China. A global transition to green energy and vehicles is vital in tackling the climate crisis and economies of scale mean that costs plummet as production ramps up, as already seen with solar panels and LED lightbulbs. Countries said they would align standards and coordinate investments to speed up production and bring forward the “tipping point” at which green technologies are more affordable and accessible than the fossil-fuelled alternatives. The first five breakthroughs being targeted are clean electricity, electric vehicles, green steel, hydrogen and sustainable farming, aiming to make these affordable and available to all nations by 2030 and potentially creating 20m new jobs. Boris Johnson said: By making clean technology the most affordable, accessible and attractive choice, the default go-to in what are currently the most polluting sectors, we can cut emissions right around the world Amazon’s founder, Jeff Bezos, has told delegates at Cop26 that his trip to space made him realise how “finite and fragile” the Earth is. Bezos said: “I was told that seeing the Earth from space changes the lens from which you view the world. But I was not prepared for just how much that would be true.” Prince William had criticised billionaires embroiled in a space tourism race, saying the world’s greatest minds needed to focus on fixing the Earth instead. Bezos also told delegates that Amazon aims to power all its operations by 100% renewable energy by 2025 and is working to convert its delivery fleet to electrical vehicles. The US president, Joe Biden, has just announced a pledge to cut global methane emissions by 30% by 2030. As my colleague Patrick Wintour reported this morning, the US is leading an alliance of 90 countries to set out new regulatory measures to limit global methane emissions by 30% from 2020 levels by the end of the decade. China, India and Russia have not joined the pact known as the Global Methane Pledge. Although methane breaks down relatively quickly in the atmosphere, it is a more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. Reducing these emissions was touted as one of the most immediate opportunities to slow global heating ahead of the summit. This is what Durwood Zaelke, a lead reviewer for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, said in August: Cutting methane is the biggest opportunity to slow warming between now and 2040. In response to today’s announcement to end deforestation by 2030, Yadvinder Malhi, a professor of ecosystem science at the University of Oxford, said it was a “Paris moment” for forests. “In Paris in 2016 the world’s leaders committed to recognise the concept of net zero, to draw a line in the sand around how much greenhouse gases can be allowed into the atmosphere,” he said. “Now in Glasgow they have committed to a similar aspiration for deforestation and land degradation, to stop and start reversing these by 2030.” More financial commitment would be needed, but it was striking to see such a significant declaration, especially one including big rainforest nations such as Brazil, Indonesia and DRC, Prof Malhi said. Police in Glasgow have apologised after it emerged that women walking home after dark on Monday were stopped from using well-lit streets near the Cop26 summit, and told to use badly-lit routes instead. Residents near the Scottish Exhibition Centre venue on the Clyde said police told them to walk long distances through Kelvingrove park and other side streets to get to their homes, because more direct routes were shut down for security reasons. One claimed she was followed by a male officer, despite asking him to leave her. Police Scotland, which recently unveiled an enhanced strategy to promote women’s safety, said those diversions were temporary and imposed at short notice due to “real-time changes to operational plans.” Assistant chief constable Gary Ritchie said the diversion would not be introduced, and the force would talk to Glasgow city council about improved lighting in Kelvingrove park. “While late changes and some level of disruption is inevitable when policing an event the size and scale of Cop26, we understand and apologise for the concern these changes caused and for the inconvenience to those diverted. “We do, in particular, recognise and acknowledge the commentary from some women who had to walk through the park on their own last night, we want to keep everyone safe and we know that the onus is on us to recognise when we could provide some more support and visibility to reassure people in our communities.” UPDATE: My colleague Nina Lakhani has said: This happened to me last night! I had to walk back through unlit Kelvingrove Park, took an extra 30 minutes and was damn dangerous with the wet leaves. I asked a cop how I was meant to get home, and he suggested I come back the following day! We’re expecting to hear more speeches from World leaders this afternoon, including major oil exporters Kuwait and Bahrain. Last week, Bahrain joined Saudi Arabia in pledging to reach net zero emissions by 2060. A leak of documents prior to the conference found the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) was lobbying the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to remove recommendations that the world needs to phase out fossil fuels. Tom Levitt here taking over the live blog throughout the rest of the afternoon. You can email me at tom.levitt.casual@theguardian.com, or send me a message on Twitter at @tom_levitt. • This post was amended on 2 November 2021 to remove an incorrect suggestion that Bahrain is a member of Opec. It’s been a busy morning, as world leaders continued to make their statements, a massive forestry deal was announced which aims to halt and reverse global deforestation over the next decade. The key events so far: African countries will spend $6bn on adapting to climate impacts, says our environment correspondent Fiona Harvey. African countries are preparing to spend at least $6bn a year from their tax revenues on adapting to the impacts of the climate crisis and are calling on the rich world to provide $2.5bn a year for the next five years to enable them to meet their goals. ‘You might as well bomb us’, Surangel Whipps Jr, the president of Palau, told world leaders, speaking of the pain of watching his country suffer “a slow and painful death”. Ecuador to massively expand protected reserve around Galápagos islands, Guillermo Lasso Mendoza, Ecuador’s president, announced. The country would add an additional 60,000 sq km of protected ocean to the 130,000 sq km that already exist around the islands. World leaders agree deal to end deforestation, as we reported this morning. Xi Jinping, Jair Bolsonaro and Joe Biden are among the leaders signing the Glasgow Leaders’ Declaration on Forest and Land Use. And the US has rejoined the High Ambition Coalition, with the goal of achieving 1.5C goal at UN climate talks. It’s been a pleasure - my colleague Tom Levitt will now take over the blog for the rest of the afternoon. The Albanian prime minister, Edi Rama, has asked rich nations how long his country, a non-polluter, has to “continue to do the right thing alone”. He said: “How long do we have to pay the price, first for the contribution to climate change of the big guys, then for their failure to remedy its consequences?” He bemoans the fact that Albania is forced to buy energy in winter when prices sky-rocket and, because of dry weather, the nation’s hydropower plants cannot meet demand. He added his country is “100% renewable” but said it cannot afford to wait around for “markets to move in the right direction” and called for international financial support through “grants, not loans”. “It is a noble stance to refuse any mixing of fossil fuels with our 100% renewable energy production. Some of the guys here may be able to afford it but for us it is literally a daily struggle,” he said. At a packed event at the Scotland Pavilion, the Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has made a statement calling for women and girls to be at the forefront of climate change discussions. The joint statement from the Scottish government and UN Women recognises that women and girls are commonly disproportionately affected by climate change. In a panel discussion with the prime minister of Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina; the president of Tanzania, Samia Suluhu Hassan and the prime minister of Estonia, Kaja Kallas, Sturgeon noted that girls were more likely to be taken out of school and women less able to find alternative forms of work as a result of climate impacts. African countries are preparing to spend at least $6bn a year from their tax revenues on adapting to the impacts of the climate crisis and are calling on the rich world to provide $2.5bn a year for the next five years to enable them to meet their goals. Félix Tshisekedi, the president of the Democratic Republic of Congo and chair of the African Union, will today call on countries and philanthropist who have pledged help to Africa in the past to step forward. He has in mind countries such as the US, Canada and the EU bloc, and the tech mogul Bill Gates, who are expected to attend a meeting with the African Union later on Tuesday. The African adaptation Acceleration Plan was set out at the Paris summit in 2015 but remains largely unfunded as donors have been slow to come up with cash. Adaptation to the impacts of the climate crisis is a key issue at these talks. Africa is already facing serious impacts from climate breakdown in the form of long and deep droughts, flooding and storm surges in coastal areas, rising temperatures and heatwaves and damaging impacts on agriculture. But funding for adaptation has lagged well behind that for cutting greenhouse gas emissions. Norway will double its climate financing contribution, Jonas Gahr Støre, the prime minister of Norway, has told Cop26, reiterating his country’s commitment to reducing its emissions and helping others to reduce theirs. He said: “We come to Glasgow with three firm commitments. First, we will follow up on the invitation by the British hosts, we are ready to double our climate financing contribution to more than $1.6bn by 2026.” He said Norway would work with development partners to help with renewable energy transition and to “phase out coal”, as well as launching a new climate investment initiative to help fund renewable energy in developing countries. “Second ... to work with business, industry and social partners to help us all succeed towards a renewable, circular and sustainable future,” he said. Støre said the Scandinavian country would “develop an export technology that can be used beyond our borders”. Finally, the prime minister insisted that the financial sector “must play its part” and announced that the Norwegian public pension fund would take the lead in responsible investment, basing its work on an overall long-term goal of net zero emissions from the companies it invests in. He concluded: “We cannot allow the inaction of some to be an argument for failing to take action together by the rest of us. Now is the time to step up.” Happy news! The UK has actually won something. Okay, it’s not really an honour: every day at every Cop, Climate Action Network hands out the ‘Fossil of the day award’ and yesterday they gave it to the UK Cop hosts. “CAN asked for a Cop postponement as we feared people from the developing world wouldn’t be able to come and advocate for climate justice in the face of the global Covid-19 pandemic,” they said in a statement. “But the UK presidency insisted that Cop26 was going ahead and was prepared to welcome the global community to ‘the most inclusive Cop ever’. This spirit of inclusivity has showcased what the Brits do best – the art of queuing – for hours in some cases. “People who have invested time and resources to travel to Glasgow have waited patiently only to find there is ‘no room at the inn’ for civil society and told to ‘join events online’ – to then find they were offline.” Tuntiak Katan, a leader of Ecuador’s Indigenous Shuar people who serves as general coordinator of the Global Alliance of Territorial Communities, has said: “We’re here to tell world leaders across the planet that indigenous people are here to make a pact for life – there is no more time, don’t make political promises or financial announcements about the climate if you are not going to keep them. “The decisions we make today will make the difference between whether we’re going to live, or we’re all going to perish.” He cautiously welcomed the $1.7bn of funding led by the governments of the UK, US, Germany, Norway and the Netherlands, but emphasised that what happens next is crucial. “The UK is now at a crossroads: they can either use our presence as a photo op, or they can choose to become a global champion for indigenous peoples and local communities,” he told the Guardian. Other campaigners said the pledge was a “first step” in making indigenous rights central to the climate crisis. No show by the Brazil delegation today at a press conference, where they were scheduled to talk on the subject of “strong environmental defence”. Make of that what you will. It follows a somewhat frosty reception for Jair Bolsonaro at last weekend’s G20 summit and a decidedly lukewarm reaction to Brazil’s latest climate plan. “I do not think anyone in Nigeria needs persuading of the need for urgent action,” Muhammadu Buhari, the president of Nigeria, has told world leaders. “For Nigeria, climate change is not about the perils of tomorrow but about what is happening today. “In our lifetime nature has gone from a vast expanse of biodiversity to a shadow of itself.” He points out, however, that they want to find a way to make a clean transition. “Nigeria is not looking to make the same mistakes that have been repeated for decades by others – we are looking for innovation in technology and finance to make a cleaner transition.” He also references his government’s commitment to electrifying 5 million households using decentralised solar energy solutions. Pension funds in the Nordic countries and UK have announced they will invest $130bn in clean energy and climate projects by 2030. As part of this commitment, the funds will also report every year on the progress of their climate investments. “Green transition requires massive investments,” said Mette Frederiksen, the prime minister of Denmark. “Governments have to do their part but we also need private investors on board.” Peter Damgaard Jensen, a co-chair of the Climate Investment Coalition, said: “These critical steps ensure pensions take advantage of the enormous opportunities of the green transition, help spur immediate solutions to lower carbon emissions, while protecting our savings against the ravages of climate change.” Joe Biden has described Build Back Better World, a G7-launched project to help create sustainable infrastructure in lower-income countries, as a means to promote not just greener economies, but also democracy. Speaking at a Cop26 event alongside Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, the US president set out a series of priorities for the scheme, known as B3W for short, including climate resilience and local partnerships. He also added: “We have to show – and I think we will show – that democracy is still the best way for delivering results.” This latter focus is notable given B3W has been seen in part as a riposte to China’s longer-running Belt and Road Initiative, a massive infrastructure plan for developing countries seen as a way for Beijing to increase its influence on such nations. In his input, Johnson gave a nod to the UK’s plans to create new green employment, calling B3W “a global mission for jobs and growth”. In another look to his domestic audience, Johnson called it “global levelling up”. Systemic shifts are needed in order to provide a positive future for humans and nature, Prince Charles has just told Cop26. “We simply must talk about the solutions and actions we can start making, and taking, today,” he said. He said the first action is to “reengineer the world economic system” and reward countries for protecting forests. He endorsed the 30x30 biodiversity target as “truly critical” to reach that objective, and said countries should receive natural capital investments for protecting ecosystems. He highlighted the importance of honouring the rights of indigenous people and communities, saying that the rest of us have lost that “vital sixth sense” which stops us damaging nature in the first place. He finished by talking about the importance of changing how we produce and consume goods, decoupling production and consumption and building a more resilient circular economy. “Frankly, we’ve all had enough talking, so we need to put our commitments into practice,” he said. He says he has done speeches like this for the past 40 years all over the world, but to no avail. He hopes this one will be different. The president of the Pacific island nation of Palau, Surangel Whipps Jr, told the Cop26 summit that parallels can be drawn between the climate crisis and the tradition Palau story of a boy who grew into a giant who “wouldn’t stop growing”. “Due to his unruly appetite, the whole island community was forced to feed him ... depleting all the natural resources.” The islanders ultimately set the boy on fire after he turned on them and tried to eat them. Whipps Jr said pointed out that the story was “eerily reminiscent” of today’s climate crisis. “Large emitters with insatiable appetites are continuing to abuse our environment, threatening our very survival. Cop26 must light the fire.” He added that “devastated” island nations such as Palau, demand that commitments of $100bn annually be increased to meet the $4tn the World Bank says is needed to tackle climate change. “We see the scorching sun is giving us intolerable heat, the warming sea is invading us and the winds are blowing us every which way, our resources are disappearing before our eyes and our future is being robbed from us,” he added. “Frankly speaking, there is no dignity to a slow and painful death - you might as well bomb our islands instead of making us suffer only to witness our slow and painful demise.” “Leaders of the G20, we are drowning and our only hope is the life-ring you are holding. You must act now, we must act together.” The Rainbow warrior is in Glasgow! Greenpeace sent their most famous ship up from Liverpool over the last couple of days: it sailed up the Clyde and docked yesterday. Onboard, alongside the Greenpeace team, are Bernard Ewekia, Jakapita Kandanga, Edwin Namakanga, Maria Reyes and Farzana Faruk Jhumu, who have travelled with the aim of speaking up for the sidelined citizens of the global south. In a comment piece on the Guardian today they say: In our home countries of Namibia, Bangladesh, Uganda, Mexico and Tuvalu in the South Pacific, we face many different challenges. But they are all exacerbated by the same injustices such as gender violence, forced migration and racial injustices, as well as the Covid-19 pandemic and the climate crisis. These are all symptoms of the same rotten system. We have friends who have dropped out of school because droughts have forced their families into poverty and famine. Others are forced to literally sell their children in order to meet their basic needs. Many people have lost land, homes and crops to floods and rising sea levels. More are being forced to flee their homes and communities. And even just accessing safe drinking water is a daily struggle for many. Thousands of people are dying right now because of the climate crisis: the world leaders at this summit have blood on their hands. Mette Frederiksen, the prime minister of Denmark, has addressed the main conference on behalf of Greenland, informing the conference that “dramatic climate change is already visible there ... Greenland has halted all new oil and gas exploration”. They believe that soon, 90% of the country’s electricity will be sustainably sourced. The Amazon founder, Jeff Bezos, has announced that $2bn from the Bezos Earth fund has been allocated to stopping the destruction of nature. This is part of the $10bn initiative he announced last year for conservation, and follows a $1bn donation he pledged to focus on the Congo Basin, the tropical Andes and the Pacific Ocean. “When people hanker for the good old days and glamourise the past, they are wrong. By almost all metrics, life is better ... There is a notable exception: the natural world is not better today than it was 500 years ago when we enjoyed unspoiled forest, clean rivers and the pristine air of the pre-industrial world,” he said. Just in case you were wondering, he mentioned his trip to space ... again. As the queue to get into the conference centre shows no sign of reducing or indeed moving, activists on the south side of the river are calling on world leaders to stop playing games with the climate. Dressed up as participants from the popular Netflix show Squid Game, these activists have assembled from across the globe under the banner Glasgow Actions to perform a series of eye-catching stunts during the early days of the summit. The Gabonese president, Ali Bongo, has just given a rousing speech at the forestry event in the Pen Y Fan room. The oil-rich nation is among the most forested countries in the world, with low rates of deforestation, and is home to the majority of the critically endangered African forest elephant. The world’s second-largest rainforest received £1.1bn in funding, including £200m from the UK, as part of the announcement on forests. “The Congo basin is the heart and lungs of the African continent. We cannot win the battle [on the climate] without the Congo rainforest. Our forests send rain to the Sahell and the Ethiopian highlands. They are critical to the African continent. Yet, the international community has consistently undervalued this critical ecosystem,” President Bongo says. “It is my hope that Glasgow will mark a turning point.” Ecuador has announced it will expand the protected marine reserve surrounding the Galápagos Islands, “the jewel of our biodiversity and a genuine living laboratory.” In a move long sought by local campaigners, Guillermo Lasso Mendoza, Ecuador’s president, said the country would add an additional 60,000 sq km of protected ocean to the 130,000 sq km that already exist around the islands. He noted that the Galápagos, famed for its crucial role in helping Charles Darwin develop the theory of natural selection, “is confronting serious threats due to global warming, plastic waste and other imbalances which are undermining our biodiversity, our food security and our economic and social development”. He added that the agreement was made via a “consensus between all of the involved sectors - fishing, tourism, conservation, and others”. The Guardian has reported extensively on how “distant fleet” fishing vessels, predominantly from China, have been decimating crucial fish stocks, including squid, on the very edge of the current Galápagos marine reserve. The new expansion “will not only strengthen the protection of the area’s biodiversity, but it will also bolster our combat against climate change”, Lasso said. The move should help fulfill Ecuador’s part of the UK-led 30 by 30 agreement, which commits to protecting at least 30% of the world’s oceans by 2030. In one note that may worry campaigners, Lasso also noted that the agreement would help achieve “growth in productivity for artisanal and industrial fishing”. The presidents of four Latin American countries, including Ecuador, are today expected to announce the merging of their marine protected areas into a “mega-MPA”. Klaus Werner Iohannis, the president of Romania, is speaking now. “There is no silver bullet against climate change. But a set of interconnected measures can help us deliver. “Romania has 40% of our electricity coming from renewable sources. We will expand this and fight climate change with nature-based solutions.” Meanwhile, at the forestry event, the US president has said that conserving the world’s forests and other critical systems is indispensable to meeting climate targets. He says forests provide clean water, host biodiversity and are home to indigenous communities. “Forests have the potential to reduce carbon globally by more than one third globally,” Biden tells the event, mentioning his decision to commit the US to protect 30% of land and sea by the end of the decade, including Tongass national forest in Alaska, the world’s largest temperate rainforest. Biden said he is launching a new plan to conserve forests in the US and around the world. He says he will make sure markets recognise the economic value of carbon sinks and create sustainable supply chains. “Let’s do this. It will have a generational impact,” he concludes. Insulate Britain protesters have blocked a major carriageway near Manchester Airport, in one of the climate group’s first protests outside of London. Footage from LBC on Twitter shows a small group of protestors in orange hi-vis jackets blocking the carriageway near the intersection of junction 6 of the M56 and the A538, as well as several police vans. The campaign group, which calls on the government to fund a national home insulation programme, said that it was the seventeenth time it had caused disruption on major roads, as it had also blocked roads in Birmingham and London. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) have asked travellers to avoid the area if possible and said they are “working at the scene to minimise disruption”. The airport said the protest had no impact on operations but warned those planning to travel to the airport that they should take the possible delays into account, in a statement reported by the Liverpool Echo. On behalf of Insulate Britain, Gabby, 27, a graphic designer from Norwich said: “We are taking our message to people outside of London because we want everyone to know that our government is killing our children. Britain should be leading the world with radical plans to decarbonise our society, instead our government is actively setting policies that will drive emissions higher. The public can close their eyes but this isn’t going away, no one is coming to save you. We are being betrayed. This government is colluding in genocide.” The mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, condemned the group’s actions in a tweet: Jeff Bezos has just arrived at the Cop26 forestry session, disappearing backstage with a small entourage including his partner, Lauren Sanchez. It’s not clear who he might be wanting to talk to at this session, but as well as Boris Johnson, Joe Biden is speaking now. The White House continues to have a mixed summit. After the confusion between Edinburgh and Glasgow yesterday, it has emerged today that plans to fly US president Joe Biden to Glasgow by helicopter have hit a snag because there are fears that the military vehicle would sink into the ground. Guillermo Lasso Mendoza, the president of Ecuador, is announcing a historic enlargement of the protected reserves around the historic Galapagos islands. Boris Johnson, Iván Duque and the Indonesian president, Joko Widodo, have taken the stage. The UK begins by paying tribute to Sir David Attenborough, “a giant redwood of environmental campaigners”. “Climate change and biodiversity are two sides of the same coin,” Johnson says. “We can’t tackle climate change without tackling biodiversity loss ... We have to stop the devastating loss of our forests.” Johnson says if we want to keep 1.5C in sight under the Paris agreement, we must protect and restore the world’s forests. He says 110 leaders have now signed the declaration on halting and reversing forest loss and land degradation by the end of the decade. China, Russia and Brazil have all signed, he emphasises. He says a partnership between governments, the private sector, indigenous communities and philanthropists is key to addressing the drivers of deforestation. He says consumers will be able to enjoy “guilt-free chocolate” that is not linked to deforestation. He says he wants to mobilise global finance to protect nature. “Let’s work together to protect the forests but ensure the forests return,” he concludes. Boris Johnson has kicked off a Cop26 session on deforestation with a typically lyrical paean to the need to preserve woodlands. Speaking on a panel alongside the Indonesian president, Joko Widodo, and the Colombian president, Iván Duque, Johnson peppered his speech with descriptions of “our three million-pillared cathedrals” and - in a section likely to have been challenging for the translators - some words on the need for “carbon guilt-free chocolate”. There was fury and frustration when it emerged that Karine Elharrar, Israel’s energy and water resources minister, who has muscular dystrophy, had been forced to wait for two hours outside after organisers refused to let her enter the compound in the vehicle in which she had arrived, she said. Her office said she was eventually offered a shuttle transport to the summit area, but the shuttle was not wheelchair-accessible, forcing her to return to her hotel in Edinburgh. Elharrar wrote on Twitter: “I came to Cop26 to meet with my counterparts around the world and promote a common struggle in the climate crisis. It is sad that the UN, which promotes accessibility for people with disabilities, in 2021, does not provide accessibility to its events.” It does appear that there is provision for wheelchair-users at the centre. The UK environment secretary, George Eustice, said: “We deeply regret that incident.” He added there appeared to have been a miscommunication and organisers had not been aware of Elharrar’s requirements in advance and so had not made the right provisions at the particular entrance she was coming to. “I know that at most of the other entrances, wheelchair access is there. It was because she came to an entrance where they didn’t have that provision,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, adding that action should have been taken to resolve the issue. Our environment correspondent, Fiona Harvey, has just revealed that the US is to rejoin the High Ambition Coalition. This is really excellent news: the HAC is a group that was formed in the run-up to Paris by the chief negotiator for the Marshall Islands, Tony de Brum. It set the goal of holding temperatures to 1.5C. As Fiona writes: The goal of holding temperature rises to 1.5C rather than 2C is much harder to achieve, as it requires emissions cuts of at least 45% by 2030, compared with 2010 levels. But science shows it is much safer – beyond 1.5C, many of the impacts of climate breakdown, such as melting ice sheets, become irreversible, and many small islands would face inundation from rising sea levels and storm surges. So far the queues have been one of the most memorable things about Cop26. There were brief hopes that that problem had been dealt with this morning after the organisers put out cordons. Unfortunately a hour or so later the situation had deteriorated and the queues were back. Maybe it’s just the way we prefer to do things here. Good morning! Welcome to day two of Cop26, where today the US president Joe Biden will unveil a plan to control methane, regarded by the administration as the single most potent way to combat the climate crisis in the short term. Our colleague Patrick Wintour has written about it below. We’ll be covering all the main events of the day, including the second day of leaders’ speeches, and some key announcements around green technology.

But in 2020 his feet will stay firmly on the ground. Walker, who runs an IT consultancy in Oxford, has pledged to make next year flight free. Instead, he will take advantage of increasingly sophisticated software to hold virtual meetings or will travel within Europe by train. “I just thought, this is something I can do. We should all be asking ‘do I really need to go there?’ From a business point of view, I honestly can’t see why I do,” he said. Next week, Alexandra Jellicoe will return to the UK from a family holiday in Annecy in the French Alps. She and her three children under seven will take the train to Paris, and from there to London before the final leg to her home near Bath. The journey will take about 10 hours, but “trains are very child-friendly, you meet other people and you get to see more,” she said. “And if you’re concerned about the environment, one of the biggest things you can do personally is not fly.” The damage caused to the environment by carbon dioxide emitted from aircraft – and the dilemma facing those who want to reduce their carbon footprint but also want to travel – was highlighted last week by a row over the Duke and Duchess of Sussex using private jets. The couple, who have spoken out about the climate crisis – even publicly saying they will only have two children because of their concerns for the planet – were accused of hypocrisy. Elton John, who invited Harry, Meghan and baby Archie to stay at his home in the south of France, defended booking a 12-seat Cessna, citing the need for security and privacy. But the journey was estimated to have emitted seven times more CO2 per person than a commercial flight. Piling on the Sussexes’ discomfort was the emergence at the end of the week of pictures of his brother, William, disembarking with his wife and children from a low-cost commercial flight from Norwich to Aberdeen. Budget airlines are more carbon efficient per person because their flights tend to be fully booked. John said he ensured the Sussexes’ flight was carbon neutral by making an “appropriate contribution” to Carbon Footprint, a consultancy that helps reduce and offset emissions. The company declined to comment on Harry and Meghan’s trip but told the Observer: “Carbon offsetting is an option for mitigating the effects of carbon impact.” Not everyone agrees. “The term is misleading – it implies you can equalise the emissions and fly carbon neutral,” said Roger Tyers, a research fellow at the University of Southampton. “Basically, you emit carbon today and even the best offset won’t repay that debt for many years, by which time a lot more damage has been done.” According to the UN, offsets “risk giving the dangerous illusion of a ‘fix’ that will allow our billowing emissions to just continue to grow”. While offsetting can be a useful temporary measure, “it is not a silver bullet and the danger is that it can lead to complacency,” said Niklas Hagelberg, a UN climate specialist. The problem is compounded by carbon calculators producing varying data on the amount of CO2 emitted by any particular journey, and by disagreement over the effectiveness of hundreds of schemes – such as reforesting, hydroelectrics and solar energy – into which money is invested. In any case, a recent survey by the BBC found that only half the world’s biggest airlines offer carbon offsetting to their customers – and only 1% of flyers choose to pay the extra. Neither British Airways, the UK’s national carrier, nor American Airlines, the world’s biggest, run schemes. Airlines must report their annual CO2 emissions, and the industry is aiming to halve its carbon footprint by 2050 by reducing emissions elsewhere. With nearly 4.4 billion passengers taking to the air last year and global aviation CO2 emissions at almost 900m tonnes, the challenge is immense. Nevertheless, consumer consciousness is rising, helped by the Extinction Rebellion campaign, the environmental activist Greta Thunberg’s zero-emission boat journey across the Atlantic, and the growing phenomenon of flygskam – the Swedish word for flight-shaming. The latter is credited with an 8% drop in the number of passengers flying from Swedish airports between January and April this year. Meanwhile, France is introducing an “eco-tax” of up to €18 on flights from its airports, and the Dutch carrier KLM has launched a “fly responsibly” campaign, even suggesting train journeys instead of short-haul flights. In the UK – where a third runway is planned for Heathrow despite the airport already being the biggest single source of CO2 emissions in the country – environmental activists are urging people to commit to a flight-free 2020. “We accept air travel is part of society and we’re not saying never fly again. We’re trying to start a conversation about how to reduce our carbon footprint,” said Anna Hughes of Flight Free UK. About 3,000 people have already signed up – including Walker and Jellicoe – and the campaign hopes to enlist 100,000 by the start of next year. “People need to be informed about the carbon impact of their journeys. The problem with carbon offsetting is that there’s no such thing as a carbon-neutral flight however many trees are planted – and it gives people a licence to continue behaving in the same way,” said Hughes. According to Tim Johnson of the Aviation Environment Federation, “public interest is unparalleled. The more people are encouraged to look at their lifestyles [in relation to the environment], the more the aviation component of our activities stands out. When you do the sums, you can eat less red meat and turn the thermostat down a degree or so, but ultimately all those efforts will be wiped out by taking a flight.” He suggested firstly looking at alternative, more sustainable modes of travel, secondly considering whether you are travelling efficiently (“most calculators suggest flying economy has half the carbon impact of business or first class”), and finally, if you really have to fly, investigate the most effective way to offset. Attitudes were changing, he said. “Look at the car industry – the accelerated demand for electric cars, which manufacturers can’t keep up with – or the plastics debate and how people have changed how they shop. But it’s certainly true that one of the worst things you can do as a carbon-conscious citizen is take a flight.” Walker, who pledged to be flight free in 2020 after seeing an item on television, said he tried not to be judgmental about flying but wanted to encourage others to follow suit. “If I can get 5% of my 500 mates on Facebook to say they’re not going to binge-fly any more, that’s enough to make a difference. Little things should be lauded.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2020/dec/08/the-curse-of-white-oil-electric-vehicles-dirty-secret-lithium","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2020-12-08T06:00:00Z","webTitle":"The curse of 'white oil': electric vehicles' dirty secret","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/dec/08/the-curse-of-white-oil-electric-vehicles-dirty-secret-lithium","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2020/dec/08/the-curse-of-white-oil-electric-vehicles-dirty-secret-lithium","fields":{"headline":"The curse of 'white oil': electric vehicles' dirty secret","bodyText":"Even before the new mine became the main topic of village conversation, João Cassote, a 44-year-old livestock farmer, was thinking about making a change. Living off the land in his mountainous part of northern Portugal was a grind. Of his close childhood friends, he was the only one who hadn’t gone overseas in search of work. So, in 2017, when he heard of a British company prospecting for lithium in the region of Trás-os-Montes, Cassote called his bank and asked for a €200,000 loan. He bought a John Deere tractor, an earthmover and a portable water-storage tank. The exploration team of the UK-based mining company Savannah Resources had spent months poring over geological maps and surveys of the hills that ripple out from Cassote’s farm. Initial calculations indicated that they could contain more than 280,000 tonnes of lithium, a silver-white alkali metal – enough for 10 years’ production. Cassote got in touch with Savannah’s local office, and the mining firm duly contracted him to supply water to their test drilling site. The return on his investment was swift. After less than 12 months on the company’s books, Cassote had made what he would usually earn in five or six years on the farm. Savannah is just one of several mining companies with an eye on the rich lithium deposits of central and northern Portugal. The sudden excitement surrounding petróleo branco (“white oil”) derives from an invention rarely seen in these parts: the electric car. Lithium is a key active material in the rechargeable batteries that run electric cars. It is found in rock and clay deposits as a solid mineral, as well as dissolved in brine. It is popular with battery manufacturers because, as the least dense metal, it stores a lot of energy for its weight. Electrifying transport has become a top priority in the move to a lower-carbon future. In Europe, car travel accounts for around 12% of all the continent’s carbon emissions. To keep in line with the Paris agreement, emissions from cars and vans will need to drop by more than a third (37.5%) by 2030. The EU has set an ambitious goal of reducing overall greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by the same date. To that end, Brussels and individual member states are pouring millions of euros into incentivising car owners to switch to electric. Some countries are going even further, proposing to ban sales of diesel and petrol vehicles in the near future (as early as 2025 in the case of Norway). If all goes to plan, European electric vehicle ownership could jump from around 2m today to 40m by 2030. Lithium is key to this energy transition. Lithium-ion batteries are used to power electric cars, as well as to store grid-scale electricity. (They are also used in smartphones and laptops.) But Europe has a problem. At present, almost every ounce of battery-grade lithium is imported. More than half (55%) of global lithium production last year originated in just one country: Australia. Other principal suppliers, such as Chile (23%), China (10%) and Argentina (8%), are equally far-flung. Lithium deposits have been discovered in Austria, Serbia and Finland, but it is in Portugal that Europe’s largest lithium hopes lie. The Portuguese government is preparing to offer licences for lithium mining to international companies in a bid to exploit its “white oil” reserves. Sourcing lithium in its own back yard not only offers Europe simpler logistics and lower prices, but fewer transport-related emissions. It also promises Europe security of supply – an issue given greater urgency by the coronavirus pandemic’s disruption of global trade. Even before the pandemic, alarm was mounting about sourcing lithium. Dr Thea Riofrancos, a political economist at Providence College in Rhode Island, pointed to growing trade protectionism and the recent US-China trade spat. (And that was before the trade row between China and Australia.) Whatever worries EU policymakers might have had before the pandemic, she said, “now they must be a million times higher”. The urgency in getting a lithium supply has unleashed a mining boom, and the race for “white oil” threatens to cause damage to the natural environment wherever it is found. But because they are helping to drive down emissions, the mining companies have EU environmental policy on their side. “There’s a fundamental question behind all this about the model of consumption and production that we now have, which is simply not sustainable,” said Riofrancos. “Everyone having an electric vehicle means an enormous amount of mining, refining and all the polluting activities that come with it.” In the tiny hamlet of Muro in Trás-os-Montes, Cassote has concerns of his own. The prospecting phase ended earlier this year, and his expensive new machinery is standing idle in his farmyard. Savannah is waiting for the final green light from the Portuguese government for its lithium mine. If approved, the company is promising to invest $109m in the project. It will also create a quarry like an open wound in the mountainside. Cassote doesn’t mind. He just wants to be back on his earthmover. * * * Not everyone shares Cassote’s enthusiasm for lithium mining. After three decades living in Amsterdam, Mario Inacio, a 50-year-old professional dancer, recently returned to his home in Portugal with plans to build a yoga retreat deep in the countryside – somewhere bucolic and isolated where guests could wake to the sound of birdsong. Inacio and his partner, Milko Prinsze, had identified the perfect spot, an abandoned farmstead set in 47 acres of grassy wilderness in central Portugal. The main house would require considerable renovation, but the rest was exactly as they had imagined. Driving down the sinuous, bumpy driveway for the first time, Inacio dreamed of the changes they could make – extending the house off to the side, converting the outhouses into private living quarters, carving out a natural pool in the rocks. He pinpointed the spot for the yoga studio: a small rise with expansive views over the grounds and out to the hills beyond. Six years after the couple first set eyes on the place, Quinta Da Lua Nova is now ready to open its doors to paying guests. The global pandemic is creating a shortage of international clients and making it difficult to fill the nine rooms, but a much greater worry hangs over the business in which Inacio has invested his life savings. Moving to one of the large ground-floor windows of his new home, he pointed to the lush expanse of open country outside. “Any of this could be exploited for lithium soon. Possible exploration orders hang over all of it.” In the past few years, small groups of anxious residents have come together across Portugal, concerned about the government’s lithium plans. With few facts in the public domain, these groups started making inquiries to local planning departments and town halls. In Inacio’s case, he said that he was told his requests would be “passed on”. He never heard any more. At the same time, early-stage exploration works, led by the likes of Savannah and the Portugal-based Lusorecursos, were reportedly sighted across the country. An objector unearthed a technical assessment of Portugal’s lithium resources commissioned by the energy ministry in 2016. Eventually, a government spokesperson confirmed that discussions were under way with various mining companies, but said no firm decisions had yet been made. Then, in January 2020, a map began circulating among the various WhatsApp and Facebook groups set up by concerned residents like Inacio. The map, put together by a local software developer specialising in cartography, appeared to confirm their worst fears. A tapestry of geometric shapes spread across the country’s interior, abutting designated nature reserves. A series of local and national protests, including a march in Lisbon last year, sought to raise awareness about the impacts of modern mining on the natural environment, including potential industrial-scale habitat destruction, chemical contamination and noise pollution, as well as high levels of water consumption. They also raised concerns about the impact on tourism – an economic mainstay for the country’s interior, with an annual turnover of €18.4bn in 2019. All these concerns appear in a “national manifesto” recently published by a coalition of civic movements. Despite vociferous local media coverage, they have made little impact so far. In part, this reflects the relative weakness of the national environmental movement. Portugal is one of the few countries in Europe not to have a Greenpeace affiliate, for instance, and according to an EU survey, of all European consumers, the Portuguese are the least likely to pay more for eco-branded products. For Maria Carmo, a 43-year-old university lecturer from the village of Barco, in the central district of Castelo Branco, such lack of engagement reveals the alienation that most urban or coastal-dwelling Portuguese feel towards the country’s rural heartlands. The trend in the past 50 years or so has been one of continued rural depopulation. Hundreds of thousands of people have left Portugal’s poor and already under-populated interior for new lives abroad or in the country’s coastal cities. Few of them return. If a mining licence is granted in their region, Inacio and a small core of diehard supporters are prepared to fight it in the courts. Carmo is less sure. Her campaign group in Castelo Branco has already split, with half its members now open to the possibility of an open-pit lithium mine above her village. It will happen anyway, they say, so why not negotiate some guarantees? Barco used to have a tin mine, the villagers argue, and it wasn’t so bad. But Carmo feels it’s a mistake to compare the two operations. Her own father and grandfather both worked in the Argemela tin mine outside the village before it closed in the early 1960s. Back then, mining was small-scale and subterranean. A new mine, in contrast, could see half the hill disappear, potentially damaging the remains of a bronze-age settlement on its peak. Villagers also fear that chemical runoff will pollute the nearby Zêzere river, which they depend on for their crops. After a three-year struggle, Carmo is exhausted and ready to give in. She feels the government is deaf, and that her fellow citizens aren’t interested. “So much destruction,” she said. “And for what? So eco-minded urbanites in Paris and Berlin can feel good about driving around in zero-emission cars.” * * * Advocates of Portugal’s hoped-for lithium boom argue that local disruption is a small price to pay for tackling the climate crisis. They point out that innovations such as windfarms, solar energy parks and hydroelectric plants, while contributing to lowering CO2 emissions in the long term, all have some impact on local populations. In a note to investors, Savannah observes that its proposed mine (which boasts projected revenues of US$1.55bn over its initial 11-year lifespan) will contribute to enough battery packs to prevent the emission of 100m tonnes of carbon dioxide. Savannah’s chief executive, David Archer, goes even further. Speaking from his London office, he pitched his firm’s multimillion-dollar investment as advancing the overall “quality of the global commons”. The equation he offers is simple: lithium equals batteries, which equals electric cars, which equals an end to transport emissions, which equals a world less vulnerable to today’s climate emergency. He adds the prospect of new jobs in the local area (up to 800 in Trás-os-Montes), higher tax revenues and a €437m boost to Portugal’s economy. From a development perspective, he said, it’s a “no-brainer”. The Portuguese government concurs. In a promotional video targeted at foreign investors, the secretary of state for the environment named his country “one of the world’s leaders in energy transition”. The short film stresses the current government’s “strong commitment” to a policy of eco-innovation. Objectors say that where there is profit to be made, local environmental impacts are almost always overlooked. The same dilemma has set back international climate talks for decades, said Harjeet Singh, global climate lead for the campaign group ActionAid. The global north wants stricter emissions targets; the global south wants economic development now, and reasonably feels that the burden of tackling the climate crisis should fall on the post-industrial societies primarily responsible for causing it. “Green technologies are essential for the transition to renewable energy,” Singh said, “but they are not without negative impacts [and] we need to ensure these don’t always fall on the poorest and most marginalised communities.” In Chile, the battle over the impact of mining has been going on for years. Born and brought up in the copper-producing region of O’Higgins in central Chile, community activist Ramón Balcázar, now 36, became aware of the potential damage of large-scale mining at an early age. Long-running disputes – over land use, water rights and chemical contamination – provided the background to his youth in the 90s. Then, six years ago, he moved to the northern outpost of San Pedro de Atacama. On the lip of the country’s famed Andean salt flats, the town looks out to a coarse, sun-baked carpet of crystalline whites and smudgy grey. There, under this huge, cloudless desert sky, Balcázar finally felt able to breathe freely. He did not know it, but he had walked into another battle zone. San Pedro lies on the westernmost point of a mining area that spreads north across the Atacama desert to Bolivia and east into Argentina. Fifty times drier than California’s Death valley, the area’s parched surface conceals an underworld rich in minerals. Historically, mining companies have exploited its lucrative deposits of copper and, to a lesser extent, iodine and nitrates. By some estimates, it also contains as much as half the world’s lithium reserves. In the early to mid-2010s, when talk of lithium-ion batteries began circulating in every mining town, a raft of new licences were requested, investments made, and extraction facilities expanded. The area became known as the “lithium triangle”. The mining companies insist their operations are sustainable. Balcázar, speaking from Mexico City, where he is studying for a graduate research degree, said they have no evidence for this claim. No one knows what effects lithium extraction on such a large scale will have on the Atacama’s fragile natural ecosystem. Unlike in Portugal, lithium here is found in brine, so the mining operations use no dynamite and no earthmovers, and threaten to leave no unsightly craters. Instead, they consist of a series of large, neatly segregated evaporation pools filled with millions of litres of brine that have been pumped from below the surface and left to evaporate in the sun. The fears of residents like Balcázar are focused on the area’s cavernous, subterranean aquifers, from where the brine is pumped. Here, they maintain, a disaster is unfolding. There is a risk that the reserves of clean water, which are found in a separate layer above the brine deposits, may become contaminated. Balcázar has been working with the Plurinational Observatory of Andean Salt Flats, a network of expert scientists and concerned citizens, to chart changes to the local ecology. The weight of their evidence – shrinking pasturelands, failing crops, disappearing flora and fauna – all point towards a process of desertification which they believe is exacerbated by lithium extraction. The impact of disturbing a “huge, complex hydrological system” is not visible from one day to the next, said Balcázar. “But the two are interlinked, without any doubt.” Plans by lithium mining firm SQM to expand its operations were recently blocked by a Chilean court on environmental grounds, but almost every other effort to get the backing of the authorities has failed. In Chile, Balcázar said, certain territories and natural environments have always been “sacrificeable” in the name of progress. * * * While mining firms scour the world’s deserts and countryside for lithium concentrate, a parallel search is on to find ways of producing battery-grade lithium without sending in the diggers. On an industrial estate surrounded by fields in rural Saxony, Christian Hanisch set out to discover a solution in recycling. “What if, instead of extracting virgin lithium from the ground, we use what we already have?” he said. Half a million tonnes of lithium has been extracted and refined in the past decade, much of which now sits in discarded mobile phones and laptops approaching obsolescence. In his modest first-floor office at Duesenfeld, the company he co-founded while working on his PhD at Braunschweig University of Technology, Hanisch, 37, admitted that the logistics are challenging. The lithium-ion batteries in everyday devices are typically small and fiddly, so to make his venture viable, Hanisch decided to start big, with used electric car batteries (which each contain about 8kg of reusable lithium). He pointed out of the window, where several recently delivered samples were piled up on the tarmac outside the factory next door, each the size of a chunky mattress. Removing the battery’s heavy plastic casing is easy enough; the challenge is how to access the lithium inside the battery cell itself. Currently, two main options exist: either heat the components to about 300C to evaporate the lithium, or apply acids and other reducing agents to leach it. Both approaches are complicated by lithium’s extreme volatility (it is prone to exploding) and its amalgamation with other metals (which are added in for better conductivity). With market analysts predicting a potential 12-fold increase in the value of the global lithium recycling industry over next decade, to more than $18bn by 2030, competition among recycling innovators is hotting up. In Germany alone, Duesenfeld faces competition from at least three other early-stage lithium recyclers. Across the border in Belgium, a former smelting firm turned urban waste recycler, Umicore, is developing its own technology, but releasing no details. Another significant European player is Snam, in France. Hanisch is confident that his procedure has an edge. Rather than smelting (which is highly energy intensive) or leaching (extremely toxic), Duesenfeld’s approach is based on mechanical separation. This method involves physically breaking the battery down into its component parts and then extracting the residual lithium via a combination of magnetisation and distillation. In the company’s factory, amid a cacophony of whirring and clanking, a submarine-like cylindrical contraption (“that’s the crusher”, shouted Hanisch through the ear protectors clamped to my head) occupies the back wall. Filling the space between is a jungle of pipes, funnels and conveyor belts punctuated by worktops. Quite where the production line begins or ends is unclear. Hanisch regarded his invention with a blissful expression. “It’s noisy,” he conceded, “But it’s the greenest way of recycling lithium there is.” Hanisch was brought up in a farming family in rural Lower Saxony, a background that inspired his environmental ambitions. Earlier this year he launched a consultancy venture, No Canary, advising on low-carbon methods for producing not just a battery, but an entire electric vehicle, from the materials stage through to final disposal. “Greta [Thunberg] was right”, he told listeners to his inaugural webinar. “We aren’t moving nearly fast enough on decarbonisation.” Shifting away from petrol and diesel is not the only concern. Manufacturing any car, electric or otherwise, causes carbon emissions, be it from the coal used to smelt the steel for its body work or the diesel oil burned when shipping its electronic components across oceans. The extra materials and energy involved in manufacturing a lithium-ion battery mean that, at present, the carbon emissions associated with producing an electric car are higher than those for a vehicle running on petrol or diesel – by as much as 38%, according to some calculations. Until the electricity in national grids is entirely renewable, recharging the battery will involve a degree of dependence on coal or gas-fired power stations. Lithium accounts for a small part of the battery’s cost, which means there is less incentive for manufacturers to find an alternative. As it is, recycling lithium costs more than digging it out of the ground. For Hanisch, one of the chief costs comes at the end of the process: converting the recovered lithium from its recycled state (lithium sulphate) into a battery-ready form (lithium carbonate). Without the resources to build his own chemical plant, Duesenfeld sends his end product – a grainy composite of precious metals known as “black mass” – to a hydrometallurgical facility for final processing. For existing recycling plants, lithium is not where the money lies, said Linda Gaines, an expert in battery recycling systems at Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois. As she said: “The main purpose is to recover the cobalt, as well as nickel and copper. The lithium doesn’t add much.” As with wind turbines and solar panels, the price of recycled lithium will very likely come down as battery manufacturers scale up. Supposing this proves true, there’s a huge supply-demand imbalance to get over. Before the pandemic, total sales of electric vehicles were projected to more than quadruple in the next five years, to more than 11m units. Demand for lithium will rise accordingly, with one industry estimate suggesting annual consumption could easily reach 700,000 tonnes by the middle of this decade. So, even if Duesenfeld and its competitors were able to recycle every last ounce of lithium produced in the last decade, come 2025, it would only be enough to power new electric vehicle batteries for nine months. * * * As it turns out, the recession caused by the pandemic may have granted campaigners a reprieve, halting the immediate need to open new lithium mines. With the world facing a prolonged crisis, new cars – even eco-friendly ones – are not at the top of most people’s priorities. As manufacture has slowed down, a glut of lithium on global markets has dampened the white oil boom, if only temporarily. But investors remain bullish about lithium’s long-term prospects. With a change of regime in the White House, there is hope for renewed support for measures to tackle the climate crisis. In the fortnight after the US election, the stock price of Chile-based lithium mine company Albermarle rose by more than 20%. In the UK, Boris Johnson’s announcement about bringing forward a ban on new diesel and petrol cars to 2030 gave the market a boost. The European commission still wants a lithium industry to call its own. In September, the Slovak diplomat and a commission vice-president Maroš Šefčovič publicly endorsed Portugal’s plans as “necessary” for the automotive sector. What’s more, the European Investment Bank would be on hand to help, he promised. His comment chimed with the launch of a new EU strategy on raw materials, which, among other goals, seeks to increase Europe’s lithium supply 18-fold by 2030, while reducing Europe’s dependence on third-party countries. This is discouraging for the opponents of lithium mines in Portugal, but Šefčovič offered them a crumb of comfort. The decision to mine has to be taken in dialogue “with local communities”, he asserted, adding that “we need to assure these communities that these projects are not only of the greatest importance, but will also benefit the region and the country”. The modern corporate responsibility movement is built on such logic. First, it does not promise to eliminate all negative industrial impacts. Instead, it pledges to “manage” them, and then to balance out any damage with compensatory “benefits”, to use Šefčovič’s phrase. In the case of Savannah’s mine in northern Portugal, the company concedes there will be local environmental impact, but argues that it will be outweighed by the upsides (inward investment, jobs, community projects). Godofredo Pereira, a Portuguese environmental architect based at the Royal College of Art in London, is sceptical. His first-hand observations of the exploitation of Chile’s salt flats suggest that offers of dialogue can be superficial. Even in Atacama, where international accords give indigenous groups the right to “free, prior, informed consent”, detractors such as Balcázar struggle to be heard. Instead, the view of pro-mining community groups is taken as universal. If necessary, the obligation to gain consent can be weakened simply by defining lithium as a mineral of “strategic” or “critical” national value – which is easy enough, given lithium’s contribution to slowing global heating and cleaner air. Nor, very often, do the promised trade-offs turn out to be quite what they initially seem, according to Pereira. The voluntary nature of corporate responsibility means mining firms can backtrack if it suits them. Even when local groups succeed in negotiating a fixed royalty (3.5% of sales, in the case of one major extractor in Atacama), communities frequently split in the subsequent fight for the spoils. Digging up Portugal’s mountains in the name of green technology may still be avoidable. An alternative, less controversial technology could break on to the scene. Green hydrogen, for instance, could help offset up to 10% of Europe’s emissions. A more immediate solution would be to rethink how we get around. As Thea Riofrancos at Providence College pointed out, if everyone were to adopt “rational forms of transport” – such as trains, trams, e-buses, cycling and car-sharing – then demand for passenger vehicles of all kinds would shrink overnight. For Portugal’s anti-mining groups, however, the clock is ticking. Godofredo argued that citizens must demand a dialogue, in order to “get a conversation going about what model of development we want”. If people were better informed, he reasoned, it’s just possible that public opinion could swing to their side, and the country’s lithium mining plans could get shelved. In this regard, recent demands by Portugal’s Green party for a national impact evaluation of mining policy is promising. Portugal’s protesters can see that blocking green growth won’t get them far. These interior regions need investment. Hence the banner hanging from the playground fence in João Cassote’s neighbouring village, which reads “Sim à Vida” (Yes to life) beside “Não à Mina” (No to the Mine). “Life” for opponents of the mine, including Mario Inacio and Maria Carmo, is eco-tourism, regenerative farming, local supply chains, and other tenets of low-carbon living. For Cassote, it means a decent wage for a decent day’s work. For a green future, it’s going to be vital to accommodate both visions. • This article was amended on 30 December 2020.

Broadly speaking, three strong themes dominated your answers: infrastructure (including housing and transport), slowing immigration and encouraging migration to and investment in regional areas. Here’s a flavour of the responses: Transport and housing “New Zealand has major infrastructure problems – the fact that there’s now 5 million of us here doesn’t change anything (other than incrementally), but the housing supply is still grossly insufficient and in most parts of the country public transport is all but non-existent. The government has to accept that it needs to invest in a proper rail links, especially between major cities, and that it will not realise any short-term returns on that investment.” Auckland resident, aged 30 “We need better transport infrastructure, particularly within the Greater Auckland area. The extensive urban sprawl due to traditionally low-density housing in Auckland makes this a complex challenge. This is compounded by the unique geographical features of the Auckland landscape, such as the densely populated North Shore only being easily accessible from the CBD via the harbour bridge. The major public transport option in Auckland is the bus, which isn’t much fun when it takes an hour into town from the “affordable suburbs” with properties $800,000 on average, and further burdens the overstretched road network. Rush hour starts at 4pm now. It is disheartening to hear that we pay over nine times our income for housing in Auckland, according to the median multiples measure, yet we are so much further behind other cities in terms of public transport infrastructure. It is one of the many things which makes you question whether your investment in this city was worth it.” Laura, 32, Auckland “Fix the housing crisis. Find a way to make suburban living more attractive and create opportunities and destination spaces outside the city centres.” Lola Davies, 28, Wellington “New Zealand needs some decent public transport around its main cities. No city currently has an underground rail system (although construction has started on a relatively small one for Auckland) and the only real public transport available in Auckland currently is an inefficient bus system. Our motorways are clogged every morning and evening with car traffic – and nearly every vehicle has just one person in it. New Zealand needs public transport that works, and New Zealanders need to change how they commute to use it. The whole country seems to think that we’re largely blameless for climate change, but when we commute like this, paired with the intensive agriculture, we have a long way to go before we can actually claim to be faultless.” Camille B, 17, North Auckland “Historically, New Zealand’s infrastructure has been created by the state: the railways and public health in the 19th century; state housing in the ‘30s; hydro-electricity schemes in the 1970s. In the 21st century the multiple challenges of climate, demographics and technology will require the state to once again take the lead with investment in a Green New Deal to provide public transport, solar energy, affordable housing and universal basic services. New Zealand has been a social laboratory in the past and must be once again if we are to build an inclusive, sustainable society.” John Kerr, 56, Christchurch “We need to change our housing and transport so we can cope with an increased population. Continuing the status quo – suburban sprawl with everyone driving a car – will put our forests and waterways under continued pressure. Central and local government could begin this transition by investing in light rail, which would both take pressure off roads and encourage denser housing. Another needed development is commuter rail. This would prevent depopulation of smaller towns by allowing workers with jobs in the larger cities to live in cheaper areas, easing pressure on housing. These developments in infrastructure would not only boost the economy, but give everyone a better quality of life and more time to enjoy New Zealand’s beautiful natural setting.” David Saunders, 28, Christchurch Managing immigration I think the government should restrict immigration further perhaps while increasing international aid which might go some way to compensate. I understand further restrictions on immigration may appear callous. However, in NZ there is a shortage of housing and services are strained. Allowing too much immigration also runs the risk of diminishing voting for left leaning government as has happened in Germany and other countries. Christchurch resident, aged 33 “Considering the pace of change, New Zealand’s transition to a multicultural society has been fairly painless; but I still believe immigration needs to be lowered to a more sustainable level, if only for the sake of everyone who is already here. We are woefully behind in terms of infrastructure and housing. In places such as Auckland, we are nowhere near capable of accommodating everyone. I watched housing go from fairly affordable, to completely unaffordable in a matter of six or so years. Banks are telling 35 year olds to ask their parents for money/equity – it’s truly sad! We need more incentives and schemes which encourage individuals and families to build houses; the process is daunting, but with help, many more would chose this option. In certain areas, building is more affordable than buying residential, and we desperately need that housing stock. We also need more effective policies designed to funnel immigrants into the smaller towns and provinces. But that in itself, will of course require more investment in infrastructure.” Rory, 35, Auckland “NZ is a nation whose infrastructure has scale to support only 3.5m people. At 5m we are at breaking point. Rail networks are worse than 100 years ago. Roading is stuck in the 1960’s. Health services are massively underfunded with endless waiting lists for essential surgery. Poverty stalks the suburbs affecting nearly 50% of families. Kids go to school daily without breakfast, shoes and other basic necessities. Teachers are underpaid and live just above the poverty line just like nurses, police, and many who traditionally would have been middle class. Farmers are massively indebted due to being victims of falling global food commodity prices. Tourism supposedly offers a lifeline of foreign earnings, but at the cost of sacrificing the remaining natural environment we have. New Zealanders find it more affordable to holiday outside of NZ rather than compete with the hoards of international tourists who befoul the natural spaces in long queues to get their essential instagram shots. Meanwhile foreign billionaires quietly buy up isolated tracts of land and build bunkers to retreat to when the fall of society happens. The problem is New Zealanders are too meek to protest and stop letting this happen.” Marc, 43, Richmond Investing in regional areas “As New Zealand’s population grows, particularly in Auckland, pressure increases on regions that are only experiencing slow growth. New Zealand has an ageing population. Healthcare and aged care is a primary concern. Regions such as the Wairarapa cannot attract enough doctors. Short staffed GP practices are not accepting new patients, new residents have no GP close by, and those already on the books wait weeks to see a GP leading to the poor health outcomes the region experiences. The regional hospitals are underfunded, there are long waiting lists for many procedures, such as hip replacement, that severely restrict quality of life. New Zealand should be reducing it’s high cancer rates and poor outcomes by offering screening programmes but what is on offer has been cut back or overpromised by central Government. Australia is a far more attractive country when it comes to and better health outcomes for a range of cancers and other diseases. How long before new immigrants realise this and make the leap across the ocean, turning New Zealand into a pit stop. The regions do not have the resources to solve healthcare and housing crisis, the central government needs to invest some of the deficit. Denise Williams, 54, Masterton “Put more emphasis on regional development. Auckland is developing at a rate which leaves the rest of the country under-catered for, and reinforces social inequality. Thus, using an immigration system which directs immigrants away from Auckland and towards the regions is a first essential. And while they are at it, providing more services which help immigrants to understand the perspectives of and to live like New Zealanders would be welcome. I know we are not a rich country, but it can’t all be left to charities and chance.” Daleaway, 70+, Kapiti region “I think we need to focus on moving people – particularly new immigrants – to other centres. Auckland is simply too full and the infrastructure cannot handle the ever growing population. Granted, the population will continue to rise but I believe providing incentives to live in the country side or Rotorua or Christchurch or Dunedin or any smaller city will help “spread the load” of an ever growing population on our small country. Don’t get me wrong, I love and embrace our multicultural society – but I don’t want my quality of life and my way of life (that I have known for 29 years) to be jeopardised through overpopulation. We need to preserve this slice of paradise – there aren’t many left in this world!” Jim Johnson, 29, Auckland"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2019/jul/26/us-natural-gas-ban-socalgas-berkeley","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2019-07-26T10:00:14Z","webTitle":"US gas utility funds 'front' consumer group to fight natural gas bans","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/26/us-natural-gas-ban-socalgas-berkeley","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2019/jul/26/us-natural-gas-ban-socalgas-berkeley","fields":{"headline":"US gas utility funds 'front' consumer group to fight natural gas bans","bodyText":"America’s largest gas utility is trying to thwart efforts to limit the use of natural gas in California beyond usual corporate lobbying efforts, going so far as to establish and fund a consumer group that pushes for “balanced energy solutions”. SoCalGas, a subsidiary of Sempra Energy that provides natural gas to nearly 22 million customers in California, says it does not direct the consumer group Californians for Balanced Energy Solutions (C4Bes). But documents show it funded the organization from its launch, paying outside consultants to develop the not-for-profit group, establish “the organization’s messages and themes” and recruit board members. In April, a SoCalGas employee emailed several local government employees across California: “I have been asked by our senior leadership team to identify some key Latino leaders that might consider supporting the current [C4Bes] effort.” SoCalGas and C4Bes promote continued investment and support of the gas system to industry and municipal governments. They pitch “renewable” gas as an alternative method of greening the grid and fighting the climate crisis. But in internal emails, C4Bes acknowledged serious potential climate and affordability limitations with the renewable gas supply. On Tuesday, the city of Berkeley in northern California became the first in the country to ban natural, fossil gas hook-ups in new buildings. More than 50 other cities and counties across California are considering similar moves away from gas to electricity. SoCalGas is the largest gas utility in the US, servicing roughly half of California. With its core business on the line, the utility is a strong opponent of building electrification, said Panama Bartholomy, the director of the Building Decarbonization Coalition. “They’re using scare tactics and misleading communities about what policies are actually being considered,” said Bartholomy, pointing to a SoCalGas suggestion in February that the state could require consumers to buy all new electric appliances. While environmental advocates push cities to turn off the gas, SoCalGas has undertaken state and local lobbying efforts of its own, encouraging cities to pass resolutions committing to “balanced energy solutions”. In contrast to the several dozen California municipalities exploring electrification rules, more than 10 cities and counties have voted to sign on to the SoCalGas resolution so far. But much of SoCalGas’s advocacy has been cloaked in C4Bes, the not-for-profit the utility paid to establish. C4Bes advocates for the continued use of natural fossil gas in California. The organization’s open letter to Governor Gavin Newsom calls building electrification “as simple as it is unrealistic”. C4Bes applied to participate in state regulatory proceedings on decarbonization. But in July, the California Public Utilities Commission’s consumer advocate office alleged that SoCalGas not only provided the funding to establish C4Bes, but used ratepayer funds to do it. According to state filings, SoCalGas began paying the bills for C4Bes in March 2018. The not-for-profit was registered with the state nearly a year later, in January 2019. Legal representatives for the environmental advocacy group Sierra Club asked state regulators to ban C4Bes from acting as a consumer advocacy coalition in the public utilities commission’s decarbonization rulemaking proceedings – otherwise, they say, SoCalGas would be unfairly overrepresented. “While SoCalGas feigns umbrage at the characterization of C4Bes as an astroturf or utility front group, these terms refer to exactly what is at issue here: entities who hide their sponsorship to appear independent,” the attorney Matt Vespa wrote in the Sierra Club’s motion to deny C4Bes party status in the proceedings. When the Guardian contacted SoCalGas with a request for comment on a story about Berkeley’s natural gas ban, the utility did not respond. Instead SoCalGas appeared to have forwarded that request to C4Bes and a spokesperson for the group got in touch with a Guardian reporter. Still, C4Bes maintains that SoCalGas does not direct the group’s position or activities. “The simple fact is that the gas company is one of 31, soon to be 32 board members. We have three officers, none of which are connected to the gas company, who steer the organization,” said Jon Switalski, the executive director of C4Bes. “We’ve received a lot of funding from a lot of other different sources. This is a very diversified coalition.” SoCalGas and C4Bes don’t deny the existence of the climate crisis. They promote the use of “clean”, “renewable” gas in the form of methane captured from dairies, wastewater treatment plants and landfills, and claim that using biogas in place of fossil gas would reduce emissions, and prove cheaper than full electrification. Earlier this year, SoCalGas announced a goal to replace 20% of its natural fossil gas supply with renewable gas as a step toward “decarbonizing the gas supply”. Experts, including those who work in renewable gas and with C4Bes, say that simply won’t work. “There’s a lot of folks who believe we can decarbonize the pipeline simply by replacing fossil natural gas with renewable gas,” said the Dairy Cares executive director, Michael Boccadoro. “I’m not one of those people.” Boccadoro is a C4Bes board member, but he does not agree with the organization’s position on the potential for biogas, which is currently used mainly as trucking fuel. In the next five years, California is on track to have 120-140 dairy farm methane digesters capturing and harnessing fugitive, climate-warming methane – with the help of significant state grant funding. “Dairy biogas is way too expensive” to use in homes or businesses, said Boccadoro – five to 10 times more expensive than fossil gas. According to emails obtained by the Climate Investigations Center, C4Bes and SoCalGas are aware of Boccadoro’s “important caveats”, but continue to promote biogas as a better alternative to electrification. “I am on record supporting this move by SoCalGas which will help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, the points made by Michael [Boccadoro] should be taken seriously and it deserves careful review,” the chair, Matt Rahn, wrote in an email to C4Bes board members in March. Rahn also called for a “fair, open, and transparent” conversation about the future of renewable gas. In an interview, however, Switalski called Boccadoro’s conclusions “just one individual’s opinion”. Switalski suggested that renewable gas could be subsidized like solar energy. “It doesn’t pencil out and it doesn’t make all that much sense from an environmental standpoint,” said Boccadoro. “It’s a pipe dream.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2019/apr/23/the-guardian-view-on-greta-thunberg-seizing-the-future","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2019-04-23T17:43:40Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on Greta Thunberg: seizing the future | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/23/the-guardian-view-on-greta-thunberg-seizing-the-future","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/23/the-guardian-view-on-greta-thunberg-seizing-the-future","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on Greta Thunberg: seizing the future","bodyText":"Nobody could have predicted that a Swedish teenager would shift the terms of the global climate debate in the way that Greta Thunberg has done. Since she began her school strike in Stockholm last August, Greta has addressed the World Economic Forum in Davos, the European parliament and the UN climate talks in Poland. Last week she met the pope in Rome. On Tuesday she met UK political leaders at the House of Commons. That Theresa May opted out of an encounter with one of the world’s foremost young activists is an embarrassing error of judgment. By any rational calculus, Greta is in the process of doing humanity a huge favour. That is because we struggle to give the global warming and wildlife crisis the attention they deserve. We have the science, with predictions of a manmade greenhouse effect dating back to the 1890s. (One of Greta’s distant relatives, Svante Arrhenius, was a pioneer in the field.) We have the international structures to collate the experts’ findings: the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) issued its first report in 1990. We have some, although not all, of the knowledge and technology we need to wean us off our addiction to fossil fuels: wind and solar energy; healthy alternatives to meat; bicycles and trains. Many nations have laws to help us transition to a low-carbon future. The world has the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the agreement struck in Paris in 2015. But for reasons that are psychological as well as political, we seem mostly unable to concentrate on the existential threat we face as global warming gathers pace (20 of the hottest-ever years were in the last 22) and climate chaos unfolds. Something else is always more important – or more manageable. Even those who recognise that we must use all the tools at our disposal, to stop emitting greenhouse gases as soon as possible, struggle to be heard. Thanks in no small part to the eye-catching tactic of the school strike, over the past nine months the movement spearheaded by Greta Thunberg has cut through. Green activists and scholars have spoken for years of the generational injustice of climate change. The school strikers belong to a 21st-century generation who have either taken this idea on, or arrived at it through a process of deduction of their own. Greta, who believes her outlook has been influenced by her autism, says she learned about climate change at school aged eight, and became depressed at 11. By 15, her angst had translated itself into a distinctive form of civil disobedience – the Friday school strikes which spread around the world. Hints that Greta has been manipulated by adults appear to be unfounded. As a teenager, she is in any case entitled to advice. And while it is natural to focus on her as a figurehead, the movement does not depend on her. As she told the audience at a Guardian Live event on Monday, she does not see herself as a leader, but as a participant. How the wave of demonstrations she helped start develops will be fascinating, as will the progress of the Extinction Rebellion protesters. Peaceful protest and activism are vital to democracy. The climate crisis makes them urgent and necessary. But decision-making requires processes and structures. This is not easy, and partly explains why so many of the successful civil disobedience campaigns of the past have been shaped by charismatic individuals. The school strikers’ message, similar to the extinction rebels, is that we should panic. Our house, in Greta’s memorable phrase, is on fire. We must embrace “cathedral thinking” – laying the foundations for the carbon-free future without knowing how we are going to paint the roof. This way of thinking does induce fear. But since doing nothing is not an option, except for nihilists and misanthropes, the rest of us have little choice but to battle through these darker emotions – and act with hope. The IPCC said last year that the next 12 years are critical, a warning echoed on the BBC by David Attenborough in a landmark documentary last week. The film should have been made a decade ago.

Travel stocks have started the week with chunky falls, on concerns that the summer holiday season will be a washout as tighter restrictions are introduced by some European countries. UK tourists will need to show they are fully vaccinated when visiting Portugal, Malta, and Spain’s Mallorca, Ibiza and neighbouring islands. Both British Airways parent company IAG (-5.9%) and budget airline easyJet (-5.8%) fell sharply, as analysts warned that the travel industry’s hopes of a good summer were fading. This pulled Europe’s stock markets lower, with the FTSE 100 ended down 0.9% or 63 points lower at 7072. Global markets were also overshadowed by rising Covid-19 infections in the Asia-Pacific region, and in South Africa, which have forced governments to introduce new restrictions. Oil has also dropped back from its highest levels since October 2018, with Brent crude now down 1.8% at $74.80 per barrel. In New York, the tech-focused Nasdaq hit a fresh record high. But the Dow fell, with Boeing losing 3% after regulators raised fresh concerns over its upcoming 777X jet, which mean it’s unlikely to be certified before 2023. Here are today’s main stories: Goodnight. GW Pharmaceuticals group AstraZeneca finished as the FTSE 100’s top riser, up almost 2%. AstraZeneca reported this morning that its Forxiga drug has been approved in the EU for the treatment of chronic kidney disease. Separately, an Oxford University study has found that a ‘mix-and-match’ approach to Covid-19 vaccines can boost the immune response. If found that receiving a shot of Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine four weeks after an AstraZeneca dose produces a strong immune response - higher than giving another dose of AstraZeneca. The reverse combination also produced high concentrations of antibodies, meaning that all possible vaccination schedules could be used. Although as the UK has a “stable supply position” there is no reason to change vaccine schedules at this moment in time, says Deputy Chief Medical Officer Professor Jonathan Van-Tam. Reuters has more details:... The data provides support for the decision of some European countries that have started offering alternatives to AstraZeneca as a second shot after the vaccine was linked to rare blood clots. Matthew Snape, the Oxford professor behind the trial, said that the findings could be used to give flexibility to vaccine rollouts, but was not large enough to recommend a broader shift away from clinically approved schedules on its own. “It’s certainly encouraging that these antibody and T-cell responses look good with the mixed schedules,” he told reporters. “But I think your default has to stay, unless there’s a very good reason otherwise, to what is proven to work,” he added referring to the same-shot vaccine schedules assessed in clinical trials. Shares in European airlines also fell today, with Air France down 4%, Lufthansa losing 3.6% and Ryanair dropping 3%. That comes alongside the falls in London where IAG fell 5.9%, EasyJet lost 5.8% and TUI shed 5.3%. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says it was “another difficult day” for the travel and leisure sector.... with some European countries introducing new restrictions on UK arrivals, and the worrying rise in cases in Asia covered early this morning. Having seen falls at the end of last week over disappointment over the limited government relaxation of travel restrictions, which saw the addition of Malta, Madeira and the Balearics to the green list. Airlines were also unhappy that the government wasn’t bolder in promising that it would look at dropping quarantine rules for fully vaccinated UK residents returning home from amber list countries. While airlines and travel companies expressed disappointment over last week’s announcement criticising the government for its cautious approach, the reality is whatever countries the government puts on its green list now matters less than the restrictions being faced by UK passengers when they leave the UK for their destination country. Airlines can huff and puff all they like, the reality is the UK government could have put a much higher number on its green list, but unless that list is reciprocated then passengers are still going to face pretty significant obstacles to travel, and sadly no amount of complaining about it will change that fact. We’ve heard this morning that German Chancellor Angela Merkel wants to ban all UK travellers from coming into the EU due to rising Delta variant cases. While this isn’t a view that is shared across Europe, Spain has announced that they want to see a proof of vaccination, or a negative covid test for those who want to go to the islands on the UK’s green list. Portugal is also insisting on certain safeguards, but it’s not just a Europe problem as the Delta variant starts to spread across Asia. In Australia, the Sydney region has implemented a full two-week lockdown, due to rising cases of Delta. With so few of the population vaccinated it is highly probable this will get extended and unlikely that the borders will reopen quickly. Hong Kong also announced that it would also ban all UK travellers from Thursday this week in a bid to keep the Delta variant out. This is ultimately where the longer-term problem lies for airlines in Europe, and it appears that markets are slowly waking up to this, with British Airways owner IAG shares falling to four-month lows, as the prospect of a return to its profitable Asia routes diminishes further. Air France-KLM shares are at their lowest levels this year while Lufthansa shares are at five-month lows. UK baker Greggs had a good day, with shares closing 2.9% higher after it reported that its sales recovery was continuing. Greggs told the City this morning that like-for-like sales at its company-managed shops were still between 1% and 3% ahead of 2019’s levels, despite tougher competition from cafes and restaurants who have been allowed to host customers indoors again since mid-May. The steak bake, sausage roll, sandwich and drinks company explains: This level of sustained sales recovery is stronger than we had anticipated and, if it were to continue, would have a materially positive impact on the expected financial result for the year. All Europe’s main stock indices finished the day lower, pulling the Stoxx 600 down by 0.6%. Germany’s DAX dipped by 0.35%, while France’s CAC lost nearly 1% and Italy’s FTSE MIB fell 1.1%. Spain’s IBEX tumbled almost 2%, as travel and leisure stocks were hit by concerns over travel restrictions and Covid-19 cases. Holiday resort operator Melia Hotels dropped 6.4%, airport operator Aena fell 4.1%, and swimming pool firm Fluidra finished 4% lower. After a subdued session, Britain’s FTSE 100 index has closed down 63 points at 7073 points, down 0.9%. Burberry were the top faller on the blue-chip index, slumping by 8.67% or 195p to £20.55, as investors expressed their disappointment about the surprise departure of boss Marco Gobbetti by the end of the year. Travel stocks also tumbled, after Spain, Portugal and Malta all tightened entry requirements for UK tourists, in a new blow to the sector. British Airways parent group IAG finished down 5.9% at 176p, its lowest level since March. Rolls-Royce, whose jet servicing business is dependent on airline flying hours, fell 5.6%, hitting their lowest level since mid-May. Commercial property firm British Land, which has suffered from the move to home-working in the pandemic, fell almost 4%, while Royal Dutch Shell shed 3.6% following the drop in the oil price today. InterContinental Hotels Group dropped by 3%, as did Premier Inns owner Whitbread. The FTSE 250 index, which is more UK-focused, dropped by 0.5%, with oil and gas producer Cairn Energy (-6%) leading the fallers. Budget airlines easyJet (-5.8%) and Wizz Air (-5.4%) were also hit by worries that the summer vacation season faced a washout, along with package holiday firm TUI (-5.3%). SSP, which owns the Upper Crust and Caffè Ritazza chains, fell almost 5%, as traders anticipated fewer customers at travel hubs. Trainline, which sells tickets for travel in the UK and across Europe, lost almost 4%. Danni Hewson, AJ Bell financial analyst, says summer holiday hopes are fading. Summer 2021 was supposed to bring salvation for the UK travel sector as lockdowns were lifted and arms were jabbed. Instead it has brought more confusion and a dawning realisation that a big money booking boost isn’t on the cards. “Shares in airlines, hotel businesses and travel companies have taken a battering today as investors rush to price in another twist in this long-running saga. Despite a number of popular tourist spots now being on offer to British holiday makers thanks to the government’s updated green list, it is precarious and it won’t mean a great deal if Germany gets its way and UK tourists are banned entry to the whole EU because of a concern over the Delta variant. “Even if that doesn’t materialise, holiday makers will have to read the small print of their booking after country after green lit country seems to be lining up change requirements. Malta, Spain and now Portugal are changing the goal posts, worried that pennies won’t be the only thing Britons will bring with them. “Though travel companies have reported a surge in bookings there have also been many stories of would-be-tourists hedging their bets and it’s likely many of those will decide to err on the side of caution and plump for their British booking. There are too many variables, too few certainties. No parent wants to get stranded at an airport with disappointed children or to spend their full holiday stuck in one hotel room. She also warns that the winding back of the UK’s furlough scheme from July will put more pressure on travel firms, if trading doesn’t pick up. “With changes to the furlough scheme just days away there will be nervousness within the sector. How far can airlines and travel companies stretch their meagre incomes, how long can they juggle costs, how much extra pressure will the new wage bill add? There are no easy answers and every day seems to bring more questions.” South African hospitality, grocery retail and gym stocks sank on Monday alongside the rand currency after the government tightened COVID-19 restrictions following the surge in Covid-19 cases. Reuters has the details: The travel and leisure index tumbled 7.53% to a one-month low and recorded its biggest daily decline in just over a year, with City Lodge, Tsogo Sun Gaming, Tsogo Sun Hotels and Sun International down between 6.70% and 9.83%. “Sentiment is very low on these businesses. People get fearful when news flow is bad as it is at the moment,” said Varshan Maharaj, Portfolio Manager at Allan Gray. Investment firm Brait SE BATJ.J, which holds just under 80% of Virgin Active gyms, fell 6.10%, while wines, spirits and cider producer Distell DGHJ.J slipped 0.69%. More here: South African hospitality stocks sink as COVID-19 restrictions tightened Back in the US, Texas factory activity expanded at a faster pace in June, according to business executives surveyed by the Dallas Federal Reserve. The Dallas Fed’s production index, which tracks manufacturing in the state, has risen by 14 points to 29.4 this month, a reading indicative of strong output growth. Other measures of manufacturing activity also pointed to accelerated growth this month. Measures of new orders, capacity utilization, shipments and business conditions all rose, as did forecasts for future manufacturing activity. However, the general business activity index dipped a little and bosses were a little more uncertain about the outlook. Labor market measures showed there was robust growth in employment and work hours, while price and wage pressures accelerated further in June. In a now familiar tale, both the raw materials prices index and the finished good price index hit record levels - as firms tried to handle the recent surge in costs. Texas firms also reported a flurry of issues with supply-chain disruptions and difficulties in hiring or recalling workers, as Sam Ro of Axios tweets: The number of new solar farms planned for the east of England has more than doubled in recent months as farmers decide to swap crops for clean energy. New solar farm applications for sites across Hertfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Essex in the last five months have climbed to 840 megawatts, or the same as 2m household solar panels. The solar boom is expected to yield more than double the solar energy capacity that came forward for the east of England in the same months last year, and would be enough to power the equivalent of 400,000 homes with clean energy. More here: The departure of Marco Gobbetti as chief executive of Burberry raises the key question of whether Riccardo Tisci, whom Gobbetti appointed creative director soon after he joined, will remain at the luxury fashion brand, my colleague Jess Cartner-Morley writes: A desire to be closer to his family in Italy was given as the reason behind Gobbetti’s decision to quit Burberry, and Tisci too is thought to have found it difficult to be away from family in Italy for prolonged periods during the pandemic. The designer was a fashion student in London in his teens and has a deep affection for British culture and subculture, but the pull of his homeland remains strong. Italy has many deep-pocketed luxury brands and a shortage of exciting design talent, so opportunities are likely to present themselves. While Gobbetti focused on raising price points and elevating Burberry’s luxury status, Tisci worked on keeping Burberry relevant – a huge challenge over the past year, as the pandemic has put the fashion industry on the back foot. The charity partnership with the footballer Marcus Rashford, who starred in a recent advertising campaign, was a symbol of how Burberry successfully positioned itself at the progressive leading edge of culture. More here: The oil price has dropped back today, after hitting its highest levels in over two and a half years. Brent crude is down 1% at $75.24 per barrel, having briefly hit $76.60 in early trading - the highest since October 2018. That’s pulled down shares in BP (-3%) and Royal Dutch Shell (-3.1%) this afternoon. The Opec+ group are due to meet this week to discuss production levels beyond July, having gradually reduced their output cuts in recent months as demand has picked up. Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, says oil producers may be cautious about increasing production significantly, given the rise of the delta variant and uncertainty over whether sanctions on Iran will be lifted soon. Crude oil trades steady near the highest since 2018 with market participants expecting OPEC+ will keep supplies tight enough to support current levels. The group meets on Thursday to decide production levels from August and beyond, and the market is currently looking for an increase of 500,000 barrels per day which is less than the increases seen during the past three months. With virus uncertainties due to the highly contagious delta strain and questions about an Iran nuclear deal hanging over the market, the group may opt for caution, hence the current price strength. Back in London, the FTSE 100 index has dropped further into the red. It’s now down 55 points, or 0.75%, at 7081 points in afternoon trading. Travel stocks are still among the fallers (along with Burberry, now down 8% after CEO Marco Gobbetti decided to leave to run Italian luxury goods group Ferragamo). Aerospace manufacturer Boeing are the top faller on the Dow Jones industrial average, down over 3% in early trading. Reuters reported yesterday that the US Federal Aviation Administration had told Boeing that its planned 777X jet is not yet ready for a significant certification step. This means the FAA will “realistically” not certify the airplane until mid-to late 2023, they say. The 777X is a widebody plane, which Boeing says will be the world’s largest and most efficient twin-engine jet. But regulators have concerns, particularly in light of the software flaws with the 737 MAX, which was grounded after two fatal crashes. The Seattle Times explains: In a sternly worded letter dated May 13, which was reviewed by The Seattle Times, the FAA warned Boeing it may have to increase the number of test flights planned and that certification realistically is now more than two years out, probably in late 2023. That could push the jet’s entry into commercial service into early 2024, four years later than originally planned. The FAA cited a long litany of concerns, including a serious flight control incident during a test flight on Dec. 8, 2020, when the plane experienced an “uncommanded pitch event” — meaning the nose of the aircraft pitched abruptly up or down without input from the pilots. More here: Citing a serious flight test incident and lack of design maturity, FAA slows Boeing 777X certification America’s tech-focused Nasdaq composite index has hit a fresh record high at the start of trading in New York. Technology stocks are leading the risers on Wall Street, where the broader S&amp;P 500 index also nudged a new peak, before dipping back. But the Dow, which contains more stocks that benefit from the reopening of economies, is lower, with banks, energy firms and industrial companies lower. Dow: down 159 points or 0.45% at 34,274 points S&amp;P 500: down two points or 0.067% at 4,278 points Nasdaq composite: up 99 points or 0.7% at 14,459 points Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor to Allianz, has told CNBC that investors are feeling comfortable about the global growth story, and confident that inflation will be transitory, and that central bankers will remain very supportive. As long as these three themes are reinforced, we still continue to see this positive momentum in the markets, El-Erian told CNBC’s Squawk Box show. But he also pointed out that there are some worrisome signs, due to the Delta variant - pointing to the Sydney lockdown, Israel re-imposing its mask mandate indoors, and the UK’s launch of pop-up vaccination centres as it battles the pandemic. El-Erian adds: “The good news is that vaccination has significantly weakened the link to hospitalizations and deaths. That’s why the economic implications of the Delta variant are not as worrisome as we’ve had in the past. However, if you’re not vaccinated, then you’re facing higher risk because of delta.” UK shopper numbers dipped by 0.2% last week, as the less-than-summery weather weighed on retailers. Research group Springboard reports that footfall in retail parks dropped by 2% in the week beginning Sunday 20th June, whilst in high streets and shopping centres it rose by +0.2% and +0.6%. That follows a 3.1% drop in footfall in the previous week (to 19th June), when rain hit the UK and kept consumers off the streets. Overall, retail footfall is still over 25% lower than in 2019, before the pandemic, with high street visits down 32% but retail parks just 5% quieter. With fewer tourists, and many commuters still at home, it’s no surprise that Central London is worst hit - with footfall down over 53% compared with two years ago, worse than market towns (-25.5%) and coastal towns (-28.2%). Diane Wehrle, Insights Director at Springboard, says “variable weather” meant there was no pick-up in overall shop visits last week (which will disappoint retailers, given the lost trading during the lockdown). On the plus side, it seems that the appeal of larger city centres over smaller high streets rebounded last week, following shifts the other way in the previous two weeks. The lack of uplift in footfall on a week on week basis means that the gap from 2019 widened for the third consecutive week, although footfall remained noticeably higher than in the same week in 2020 which was the second week of trading following the lifting of Lockdown 1.” Britain’s small businesses are calling on the government for more Covid-19 support, before a ‘flashpoint’ hits companies on Thursday. The Federation of Small Businesses is concerned that financial support packages will diminish on July 1, when business rates exemptions for retailers and hospitality firms and VAT payment deferrals end. The furlough scheme also becomes less generous, with firms having to pay 10% of wages of staff temporarily sidelined [currently the government is paying the full 80%]. With the end of lockdown extended beyond 21st June, the FSB says small firms need more help to bridge the gap until they can fully reopen. FSB national chairman Mike Cherry explains: “Last year the Government told us that it would do “whatever it takes” to help the 5.9 million sole traders and small businesses on which our recovery will depend. “The Treasury committed to evolving support measures to ensure they were adequate in the face of what firms were up against. “But now – after a crushing delay to the reopening road map – the new support measures are limited to those which do not cost the Treasury a penny. “As a small business owner, I understand the importance of being careful with what I spend. But failing to review support deadlines that were designed with a June unlock date in mind is a false economy. “Unless the Government acts now, it risks a serious economic flashpoint this Thursday – a moment at which financial support starts to wind down, further trade changes take effect and repayments on emergency loans start to fall due. “At the very least, HMRC should take a safe harbour approach when they are faced with a small business that has made a mistake or has no cash left – Time To Pay should be promoted and encouraged. The Resolution Foundation has also warned against ‘dangerous complacency’ about cutting the furlough scheme too early. It says the underlying health of the UK labour market is being overstated, as total hours worked are well below pre-crisis levels and underlying pay growth isn’t as strong as the headline number suggest. Britain’s accounting watchdog has opened investigations into PwC and a smaller rival over audits conducted for Greensill Capital UK and the bank owned by one of its largest borrowers, the metals magnate Sanjeev Gupta. The Financial Reporting Council’s (FRC) investigations – launched on 15 June but only made public on Monday – add to a growing list of investigations linked to Greensill and its customers, after it fell into administration in March this year. The regulator revealed on Monday it was looking into work conducted by Saffery Champness, which audited Greensill Capital UK’s accounts between 2014 and 2019, over its audit of Greensill for the year ending 31 December 2019. The FRC is also scrutinising PwC over its audit of the 2019 accounts issued by Wyelands Bank, the lender majority-owned by Gupta, the billionaire boss of beleaguered manufacturer Liberty Steel UK. Here’s the full story: Shares in travel and hospitality firms have fallen in London, on fears of a summer “washout” as Spain, Portugal and Malta all tighten their entry requirements on UK tourists. Airline group IAG, which owns British Airways, have fallen by 4.7% this morning. Budget airline easyJet are down 4%, with Wizz Air off 3.7%, and package holiday firm TUI dropping 3.9%. Rolls-Royce, which makes and services jet engines, are down 3.1%. Hotel groups are also lower, with Premier Inns owner Whitbread (-2.3%) and InterContinental Hotels (-2.3%) falling. Earlier today, Portugal announced that British travellers who are not fully vaccinated against coronavirus must quarantine for 14 days on arrival from today. Sky News explain: Anyone travelling to mainland Portugal by air, land or sea will have to prove they have had two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine at least two weeks ago, or have to isolate. The new rules, introduced by the Portuguese government, come into effect on Monday and will last until at least 11 July. Spain will demand a negative COVID-19 test or proof of vaccination from British tourists who want to enter Mallorca, Ibiza and other Balearic Islands, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Monday. My colleague Sam Jones explains: The rules – which come into effect in 72 hours, – were announced two days before the Balearics are due to move on to the UK’s green list for quarantine-free travel, and amid growing concerns over what Sánchez called “the negative evolution” of the virus in the UK. Spain had planned initially to let British visitors enter the country without the need for a negative PCR test, but pressure has been mounting on the central government following rising case numbers in the UK and clusters of cases in Spain that were traced back to an end-of-year school trip to Mallorca. And on Friday, Malta said that British holidaymakers who are not fully vaccinated against coronavirus will have to quarantine when they arrive on the island from Wednesday - including children aged 12-16. Today’s falls also follow a report in The Times that Germany will attempt to ban British travellers from the European Union regardless of whether or not they have had a COVID-19 vaccine. The story says: Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, wants to designate Britain as a “country of concern” because the Delta variant is so widespread. The plans will be discussed by senior European and national officials on the EU’s integrated political crisis response committee and will be resisted by Greece, Spain, Cyprus, Malta and Portugal. President Macron of France has backed mandatory quarantine for unvaccinated travellers. A British government source said that Merkel looked “increasingly isolated”, adding: “A lot of countries will think it’s their own decision and not one to be decided in Berlin.” Last week, Merkel called for all travellers from the UK to be quarantined wherever they arrive in the EU, due to the rise in cases of the Delta variant. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says hopes of a late summer rebound in business for the travel sector are fading. “Optimism on the horizon for the travel industry has once again been obscured by dark clouds, as, one by one, European countries bring back in tough quarantine rules. EU leaders are preparing to meet this week and Germany’s Angela Merkel is hoping to gain approval for a consensus on quarantine to stop the spread of the delta variant. So, it’s looking increasingly likely this summer will be a wash out for the industry after all. Tour operator TUI in the FTSE 250 sank by 4% in early trading after Portugal re-imposed strict isolation requirements for unvaccinated arrivals. Although some routes are still open for holiday makers who have been double jabbed, that could soon change. With the rules for children and teenagers also unclear, many families, once hopeful for a holiday, are now putting away their suitcases, settling for a summer of staycations and day trips. Streeter adds that the ‘ever-changing’ rules regarding foreign travel are making it very hard to plan an overseas holiday: Already disappointment had been swirling around the industry after the UK government only extended the green list of travel countries with a handful of new destinations. Although a rush of bookings came with the inclusion of Malta, Madeira, Spain’s Balearic Islands and a number of Caribbean islands, Malta’s move to re-impose quarantine on unvaccinated arrivals was a blow. The ever-changing rules and restrictions mean that trying to plan an overseas holiday has become like a game of snakes and ladders. A relaxation of the rules by one country, is swiftly followed by a tightening in another, leaving travellers at risk of being left isolated in a hotel overseas with only a TV remote control for company. Over in Germany, import prices have jumped sharply - partly due to the recovery in oil prices and the jump in commodity prices. Destatis reports that import prices rose by 1.7% on a monthly basis in May, up from 1.4% in April. On an annual basis, import prices were 11.8% higher than in May 2020 - when the first wave of the pandemic gripped the global economy. That’s the sharpest year-on-year rise in import prices since October 1981, when prices climbed 13.6 percent, the report says. Energy imports were almost twice as expensive last month as in May 2020, with oil up 135%. Metal prices were also much higher, reflecting the pick-up in global demand, Destatis adds: Compared to May 2020, iron ores (+83.6%), copper (+65.1%), non-ferrous metal ores (+46.6%), plastics in primary forms (+42.9%) and pig iron increased in price, Steel and ferro-alloys (+32.4%) significantly. The main reason for the sharp rise in iron ore prices is likely to be the continued strong global demand. Trading on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange was delayed today, after heavy rain forced the morning session to be washed out amid widespread disruption. Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing halted morning trading after the weather department issued its first “black rainstorm” warning alert of the year. Heavy rain led to landslides and severe flooding in some parts of the city, forcing flight delays, and the temporary suspension of public services such as schools and Covid-19 vaccinations. Trading began in the afternoon after the warning was downgraded, with the Hang Seng index dipping slightly - energy and materials companies dropped, but consumer and healthcare firms were higher. The South China Morning Post has more details on the storm: The Observatory issued the black rainstorm warning at 8.20am, later reporting that more than 200mm of rain had fallen on Lantau Island, Lamma Island and the western part of Hong Kong Island as of 12.30pm, with other areas sustaining at least 70mm of rainfall. A landslide at about 8am on Lantau Island blocked two lanes of traffic, police said, while four other landslides and flooding were reported on Cheung Chau. Video shared on social media showed a torrent of muddy water spilling from a hillside onto South Lantau Road near Upper Cheung Sha Beach. Flooding also caused the closure of the Tuen Mun Chek Lap Kok Tunnel Road towards Tuen Mun earlier, though it had been fully reopened by 11.41am. In the New Territories, police attributed a fatal traffic accident to the heavy rains as a bus driver lost control of his vehicle on a wet road in Sheung Shui at about 6.18am. In London, shares in luxury fashion company Burberry have fallen by 6% after it announced that CEO Marco Gobbetti is leaving unexpectedly. The British fashion brand said Gobbetti – who was charged with turning around the business when he took the reins in 2017 – was leaving to take a job in Italy that would allow him to be closer to his family. The luxury Italian group Salvatore Ferragamo, famous for making shoes worn by Hollywood stars such as Audrey Hepburn, announced on Monday it had appointed Gobbetti as its new chief executive. The Burberry chairman, Gerry Murphy, credited the outgoing chief executive with leading the transformation of the brand and business. Murphy said: “The board and I are naturally disappointed by Marco’s decision but we understand and fully respect his desire to return to Italy after nearly 20 years abroad. With the execution of our strategy on track and our outlook unchanged, we are determined to build on Burberry’s strong foundations to accelerate growth and deliver further value for our shareholders.” Gobbetti, a luxury goods veteran who led brands including Céline, Givenchy and Moschino before joining Burberry, is expected to stay in the role until the end of 2021, giving the company time to find a successor. The move means the chief executive will lose all of his unvested share awards, which will lapse in full when he leaves Burberry at the end of the year. Here’s the full story: Burberry are the top faller on the FTSE 100, which is down 34 points or 0.5% this morning at 7101 points. European stock markets have also dipped this morning, with the Stoxx 600 down 0.3%. A gauge of Southeast Asian stocks fell to its lowest level since May 21 today and is almost 7% from a January high, Bloomberg says: Nations from Malaysia to Thailand are struggling to contain the pandemic, clouding recoveries in their economies. Indonesia reported fresh records in daily cases while Thailand suspended dine-in services for a month at restaurants in Bangkok and nearby provinces. “The tightening in restrictions in some parts of Southeast Asia to curb rising Covid-19 cases will hurt domestic demand and hold back economic recovery,” said Khoon Goh, head of Asian research in Singapore at Australia &amp; New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. “Given the need for more policy support, especially on the fiscal side, this is weighing on domestic asset prices in those countries.” More here: Virus Lockdowns Send Malaysia Stocks Tumbling to Seven-Month Low Thailand’s stock index dropped to a one-month low today, after new restrictions in Bangkok, and five provinces, were announced. The measures include a ban on restaurant dine-ins in the capital, 9pm closures of shopping malls, and a ban on gatherings over 20 people. Construction sites in the six areas will be shut down, and workers’ camps will be sealed off to contain clusters, after Covid-19 cases were detected at the camps (where tens of thousands of building workers live). Bangkok’s SET Index is down 0.5%, and on track for its eighth consecutive session of losses, as concerns over the economic recovery rise. Reuters adds: Further souring sentiment, the Bank of Thailand’s deputy governor said the economy was expected to return to pre-pandemic levels only in the first quarter of 2023, as the tourism sector has been slow to recover. In Jakarta, the benchmark stock index has fallen 1.4% to its lowest closing level in a month, after Indonesia reported a new daily record for Covid-19 cases yesterday. AFP has the details: Indonesia set a new record for daily coronavirus cases on Sunday with more than 21,000, as hospitals are flooded with patients in Jakarta and other Covid-19 hotspots across Southeast Asia’s hardest-hit nation. The figure brings the country’s tally for the pandemic to more than 2.1 million coronavirus cases with 57,138 deaths. But the real number is believed to be much higher due to low testing rates for the deadly respiratory illness. Yesterday, Gemma Holliani Cahya wrote about the terrible situation in Indonesia, where deaths have risen in recent weeks - and the pressure for tighter lockdowns to slow the virus. President Joko Widodo insists the existing restrictions on public mobility are still the best option so as not to harm the economy, as well as social and political activities. Health experts have criticised the decision, urging the government to take radical action to save the nation and halt the spread of the virus. Hermawan Saputra, from the Indonesian Public Health Experts Organisation (IAKMI), has said the crisis has been exacerbated by travel during the Idul Fitri national holiday and the spread of the more contagious Delta variant. “We are in a very worrying situation. With this condition we recommend regional lockdown,” Hermawan said, to stop the virus spreading to other islands in the archipelago. Malaysia’s stock market has fallen to a seven month low, after Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin extended the country’s lockdown due to elevated Covid-19 infections. The FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI Index has dropped by 1.2% today, to its lowest level since 10th November (when Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine successful trial results sparked a global rally): The Straits Times has more details of Malaysia’s move: Malaysia will extend its full lockdown until daily new Covid-19 cases drop below 4,000, and its targets on vaccination and intensive care unit (ICU) bed usage are met, Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin said on Sunday (June 27). The lockdown was originally due to end on Monday, but Malaysia is still averaging above 5,000 cases a day nearly four weeks into the lockdown. It recorded 5,586 new cases and 60 deaths on Sunday. The country also spent much of May under a more relaxed nationwide lockdown after a drastic spike in cases beginning April this year. South Africa’s rand has weakened today, following the two-week tightening of restrictions to try to combat the rise in Covid-19 cases. The rand has dropped by around 0.7% to 14.24 to the US dollar following president Cyril Ramaphosa’s warning that South Africa faces a “massive resurgence of infections”. These curbs on gatherings, alcohol sales, dining in restaurants and travel will be assessed in two weeks, to see if they have helped to slow the wave of Covid-19 cases. Ramaphosa said during his televised address to the nation that the aim is to limit social contacts while preserving the economy. Analysts at Nedbank wrote in a note that the restrictions are likely to hamper growth, though: This scenario, although necessary, is likely to hamper an already faltering economy, and the rand is likely to remain under pressure, with any strength in the local unit likely to be met with fresh demand for US dollars.” More here: REUTERS: South Africa’s rand weakens as government tightens COVID-19 restrictions Early in June, the rand touched a 28-month high against the dollar, but has fallen back since (partly on worries that America’s central bank would raise interest rates earlier than thought, which pushed up the dollar). Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Global markets are subdued today amid a worrying rise in Covid-19 cases in the Asia-Pacific region and Africa. In Australia, outbreaks of the Delta variant have been detected at several locations including Sydney, while South Africa is tightening restrictions after seeing a sharp rise in Covid-19 cases which is threatening to overwhelm its health system. Other countries are also battling a fresh wave, with Indonesia reporting its biggest daily increase in coronavirus cases on Saturday, putting hospitals in the country under huge pressure. Malaysia is extending its lockdown, and Thailand announced new restrictions in and around Bangkok - including curbs on large gatherings and indoor restaurant dining. South Africa’s president Cyril Ramaphosa yesterday said all gatherings, indoors and outdoors, would be banned for 14 days, along with the sale of alcohol, dining in restaurants and travel to or from the worst-hit areas of the country. An extended curfew is also being imposed, and schools shut early for holidays. Ramaphosa warned: “We have overcome two decisive waves but now we have a new hill to climb, a great challenge, a massive resurgence of infections … a devastating wave.” The surge is part of a wider devastating resurgence of COVID-19 infections across Africa, which health experts fear will surpass earlier waves, as countries have struggled to vaccinate even a small percentage of the populations. The rise in Covid-19 cases and restrictions threaten hopes for a strong economic recovery from the shock of the pandemic, as Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst for Asia Pacific at OANDA, explains: Malaysia has extended is MCO national lockdown once again. Thailand has tightened restrictions in Bangkok. Jakarta, where I am based, is in a dark place, with cases surging, with that pattern being repeated across Java. In Australia, the Greater Sydney area lockdown was widened, and Darwin also entered a snap lockdown with the trans-Tasman air bubble suspended until the end of tomorrow. Milder restrictions in the Wellington area of New Zealand were all extended Although much has been made about the vaccine progress in the US, the UK, and Europe, Covid-19 and its new delta variant remain a severe problem for much of the world. Nowhere more so than Asia, with Japan and Taiwan also dealing with persistent virus cases and Singapore subject to still-severe, domestic restrictions. I have stated before that resurgent Covid-19 posed the largest threat to the post-pandemic economic bounce across Asia. We are not there yet, but if we are at this point this time next month, many economic forecasts will need to be revisited for surgery. Global markets had hit record highs last week, lifted by the agreement of a $1tn US bipartisan infrastructure package, and hopes that rising inflationary pressures will be temporary. Traders also have an eye on Friday’s US non-farm payroll, which is expected to show a pick-up in hiring in America this month (up to around 675,000, from 559,000 in May).

In his acceptance speech on becoming Labour leader in September 2015, the MP for Islington North spoke of enabling members to better influence party policy, of his desire to hear passionate debate, and to “make our party more inclusive, more democratic and the membership better listened to in the future”. Let the tail wag the dog. On that basis, we shouldn’t be surprised by today’s announcement that Momentum, the youthful, 40,000-strong membership organisation established as an outrider for Corbyn’s leadership, will be campaigning for a “radical and transformational” new policy agenda. It is nonetheless a desperately needed and inspirational injection of energy. Over the summer, the group will seek to organise Labour’s mass membership to get motions passed in local constituency party meetings backing a green new deal (including achieving zero carbon emissions by 2030), the introduction of a four-day week, and the abolition of all migrant detention centres. The aim, they say, is to get these CLP motions taken forward to conference in September and made into party policy. That’s something pro-remain campaigners in the party did very effectively ahead of last year’s Labour conference, shaping party’s current policy on Brexit. The idea is to create an election manifesto that builds on the widely praised 2017 equivalent – but takes it much further, and in doing so sees off Tom Watson’s more conservative Future Britain group, whom they see as “intent upon watering down and blocking Labour’s most transformational policies”. Interestingly, three other small grassroots organisations are in the mix here, prompting Momentum’s turn to policy campaigning: Labour for a Green New Deal, Labour Against Racism and Fascism, and Labour 4 Day Week – each of them less than a year old. After a year of (largely enforced) malaise in Westminster, these groups provide a welcome reminder of what the point of a leftwing Labour party ought to be. What is notable is how these three groups, and now Momentum, relate to a wider network of activist movements, thinktanks and campaigners. They are showing that they can be a conduit for existing political energy outside of the Labour party. This, again, is exactly what a leftwing party should look like: pluralistic, democratic and porous, rather than proprietorial. The school climate strike led by Greta Thunberg and the phenomenal campaign by Extinction Rebellion inspired millions to take the climate emergency seriously; the thinktanks Autonomy and New Economics Foundation who campaign for shorter working weeks have been gaining influence; while everyone from the hunger strikers inside Yarl’s Wood to the groups Sisters Uncut campaigning on the outside, have helped make the plight of migrants in detention centres a mainstream issue. Party politics shouldn’t exist in a vacuum, cut off from the political life, ideas and activity around it. And that doesn’t mean Labour should simply co-opt and dilute the demands of those extra-parliamentary activists, instead it should respond to them, work with them and be energised by them. There is a bizarre fallacy popular in the rightwing press and Westminster among critics of the Labour party under Jeremy Corbyn: that it has become a “Stalinist”, “Leninist” and also – confoundingly – simultaneously “Trotskyist” organisation: that it is ferociously authoritarian in spirit and practice, and run with iron discipline from the centre. This line of attack displays not only a depressingly slight grasp of the basics taught in key stage 3 Russian history modules, but also a goldfish-like memory of even recent British politics. How easy it is to forget the macho culture at the heart of the New Labour project, the endless stories of bullying, abuse and “explosive clashes” in the heart of government, a party run by “the Burnley bruiser” Alastair Campbell, while former Blair adviser John McTernan wrote cheerfully about how great it was that Labour whips used to physically assault backbenchers, and the vital need to “crush” opponents. By contrast, the Labour party under Corbyn might be many things – tangled, messy, riven with factions and kvetching MPs – but an incarnation of Soviet democratic centralism it is not. For months now it has felt as though the Labour party has been stranded in the purgatory of Brexit, distractedly rubbernecking at the clown-car pile-up that is Change UK, while radical grassroots energy flared up outside the party hierarchy, as it always had done prior to 2015. The PLP has been right to respond to Extinction Rebellion and the school climate strike so swiftly – declaring the world’s first climate emergency, and announcing a plan for a massive investment in solar energy just yesterday. But more needs to be done. British society needs radical transformation to address the ever-worsening climate crisis, the way we work – for too little money, for too long, until it destroys our mental and physical health – and the way we treat migrants and refugees. It is right that Momentum is showing itself to be responsive to this. Above all, it is a reminder that Labour needs to be led from the bottom up. • Dan Hancox is a freelance journalist and author"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"science/2018/nov/01/paul-obrien-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-11-01T18:04:07Z","webTitle":"Paul O’Brien obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/nov/01/paul-obrien-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/nov/01/paul-obrien-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Paul O’Brien obituary","bodyText":"In 1995 the leading British materials chemist Paul O’Brien, who has died aged 64 after suffering from brain cancer, began to use chemical synthesis to make quantum dots, which are tiny semiconductor particles, only nanometres across, that can be made to emit light of varying colours according to their size. Up to that point quantum dots had been difficult to produce, requiring the use of hazardous metal alkyl precursors at high temperatures. O’Brien’s new method not only allowed them to be mass-produced; it also required much less energy and generated fewer harmful byproducts. As a consequence, quantum dots are now ubiquitous in modern electronics and are used in any number of applications, from lighting and visual display units to solar energy capture and bio-markers, which help doctors to detect disease in the human body. O’Brien’s work on this branch of nanoscience, dealing with materials that are typically thousands of times smaller than the width of a human hair, was revealed to the world in a 1996 paper in the journal Advanced Materials, and was a key discovery in its field. Thereafter he concentrated on the real-world impact of his work, producing a number of patents based on the process and, in 2001, establishing a company, Nanoco Technologies, which supplies quantum dots to global businesses such as Dow, Wah Hong Co and Merck. A native of Manchester, Paul was born in Ancoats and brought up in Collyhurst and Failsworth. He was the son of Thomas, an engineer at the electrical engineering firm Ferranti, and Maureen (nee Graham), a clerk at a raincoat factory. From Cardinal Langley grammar school in Middleton he went to the University of Liverpool, where he gained a degree in chemistry, and to University College Cardiff for his PhD studies on the binding of metals to amino acids. In 1978 he became a lecturer at Chelsea College of Science and Technology in London, and six years later moved to Queen Mary College, London (now Queen Mary University of London), where he spent 11 years, latterly as a professor, developing the materials chemistry activity for which he is celebrated. His insights at the time, he always stressed, were highly influenced by discussions with a colleague at Queen Mary, Donald Bradley, who was using a similar approach to making other inorganic materials. In 1995 he became professor of materials science at Imperial College London, and in 1999 moved to the University of Manchester to a joint professorship between Victoria University of Manchester school of chemistry and the Materials Science Centre jointly run by Victoria University of Manchester and Umist. During this time he also acted as associate dean for research and, from 2002, head of the department of chemistry, playing a key role in bringing together departments during the merger of Victoria University of Manchester with Umist. He was head of the school of chemistry that resulted from the merger, and then head of the school of materials (2011-15). His common sense and immense patience proved invaluable in breaking down barriers between groups that had, until the merger, been in competing institutions. O’Brien retired in July 2018 after his diagnosis, and approached his illness with his usual scientific curiosity and optimism, drafting and editing papers from his hospital bed, which he turned into an impromptu office. He published more than 700 scientific papers across his career and helped more than 100 young researchers obtain PhDs under his watchful eye, many of them scientists from developing countries. He was passionate about science in Africa, and his advocacy and leadership in that sphere led to the procurement of significant amounts of funding from the Royal Society and the UK government for new materials for solar energy capture in three African countries. Elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 2013 and a fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering in 2016, he was appointed CBE in 2016. A wonderful raconteur who was generous with his time and energy – and who amused everyone with his unique emailing style, which varied from minimalist to poetic – he somehow found time outside his scientific work for many other interests, including reading, hill-walking and camping, theatre and football. He is survived by his wife, Kym (nee Evans), whom he met while studying in Cardiff and married in 1979. • Paul O’Brien, scientist, born 22 January 1954; died 16 October 2018 • This article was corrected on 18 December 2018.

Billions of people rely on rivers for water, food and irrigation, but from the Danube to the Yangtze most large rivers are fragmented and degraded. Untouched rivers are largely confined to remote places such as the Arctic and Amazonia. The assessment, the first to tackle the subject on a worldwide level, examined 12m kilometres of rivers and found that just 90 of the 246 rivers more than 1,000km (621 miles) long flowed without interruption. The scientists, whose research, published in the journal Nature, was led by Günther Grill, at McGill University in Canada, were particularly concerned to discover that only a quarter of long rivers that once flowed freely to the sea, rather than to an inland lake or other river, still had such a course. Separate research in Britain, which included the effects of smaller infrastructure such as weirs, fords and culverts, suggests that 97% of the nation’s river network has been interrupted by human-built structures. Thriving wildlife in rivers is crucial to keeping water clean but freshwater habitats were found to be the hardest hit of all the ecosystems, with wildlife populations having plunged by an average of 83% since 1970 due to dams, overuse of water and pollution. “Free-flowing rivers are important for humans and the environment alike, yet economic development around the world is making them increasingly rare,” said Grill. “Two billion people take water from rivers for drinking, so it is important they remain a clean source.” Annually, 12m tonnes of fish are caught from rivers, providing a vital source of food for hundreds of millions of people, but 500 million people are living on deltas that are sinking as dams starve them of sediments. Grill said rivers needed more protection, but that their length made such habitats harder to protect than areas of land. “Rivers are the lifeblood of our planet,” said Michele Thieme, lead freshwater scientist at WWF and one of the 34 researchers behind the analysis. “While hydropower inevitably has a role to play in the renewable energy landscape, well-planned wind and solar energy can be more viable options for rivers and the communities and biodiversity that rely on them.” LeRoy Poff, at Colorado State University, in the US, who was not part of the team, said: “The research provides a crucial new perspective on the global status of rivers [and] suggests that their global sustainability is more precarious than currently recognised.” Poff said population growth made it difficult to balance the conflicting demand for water, food and energy, with the need to keep rivers healthy and free flowing. “Attaining this balance will increasingly rely on rigorous, state-of-the art analyses, as exemplified this study.” The data used in the study took 10 years to assemble and examined dams and their impacts on seasonal flow and sediment movement, as well as levees, other artificial banks, and general water use. Great rivers that flow freely are now rare in populated areas. Heavily fragmented rivers include the Danube, Nile, and Euphrates, the Paraná and Missouri in the Americas, the Yangtze and Brahmaputra in Asia, and the Darling in Australia. The Congo and Amazon were found to be among the least affected. The biggest impact comes from physical barriers created by dams, but reservoirs also seriously affect the natural seasonal flow of rivers. “It can be really freaky sometimes, when the electricity is produced one hour on, one hour off, and the river goes up and down by a metre, which is very stressful to the ecosystems downstream,” said Grill. The study estimates that there are about 60,000 large dams worldwide and 3,700 in planning or construction, in addition to millions of smaller dams. Many rivers are also hemmed in by banks built by people to prevent flooding in urban areas, although flood waters can end up displaced downstream. These banks also stop natural replenishment of nutrients in soil on flood plains. Carlos Garcia de Leaniz, a professor at Swansea University, who led the UK study, praised the global analysis but he said the closer examination carried out by his team in the UK revealed a still worse picture. “The [global] study grossly underestimates the extent of river fragmentation as [it] only considers very large dams. We believe free-flowing rivers simply don’t exist any more, at least in Europe.” The negative environmental impacts of many large dams is well known, but the international drive to fight climate change by reducing the burning of fossil fuels means low-carbon hydropower is in demand. “We are in a boom phase,” said Grill, noting that this was particularly so in the Balkans, Amazonia, China and the Himalayas. Grill added that the broader environmental costs of hydropower were often not taken into account. He said he hoped his team’s database would enable planners to make better decisions about the necessity, location and design of dams."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2019/jun/14/power-to-the-people-how-spanish-cities-took-control-of-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2019-06-14T12:05:36Z","webTitle":"Power to the people: how Spanish cities took control of energy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/14/power-to-the-people-how-spanish-cities-took-control-of-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2019/jun/14/power-to-the-people-how-spanish-cities-took-control-of-energy","fields":{"headline":"Power to the people: how Spanish cities took control of energy","bodyText":"After a close fight, Barcelona’s radical mayor, Ada Colau, is expected to take office for a second term on Saturday, vindicating her often-criticised policies, which have included making sure all the city’s municipal buildings and services run on renewable energy. On the other side of the country in Andalucía, José María González was re-elected as mayor of Cádiz last month having swept to power in 2015 on the same tide that brought Colau to office, with energy as a central issue in his campaign. Cádiz and Barcelona have set themselves up as distributors, cutting out the middle man, and have begun installing solar panels on public buildings with the aim of becoming self-sufficient. “Energy policy should be in the hands of the people,” González said. “In Cádiz we set up two permanent citizens’ energy forums and the people have been the driving force behind the improvements we have carried out. The people of Cádiz are the motor of energy transition.” The city is an anomaly in that it has its own power company, Eléctrica de Cádiz, founded in 1929, in which the council holds a 55% stake. Since 2017 it has supplied all municipal needs and about 80% of households with energy from renewable sources. About 40% of Andalucía’s power is produced by renewables, from windfarms and vast solar arrays such as those at San Roque, whose 67,000 panels rotate to follow the sun, and the innovative PS10 plant near Seville. Cádiz is an ancient city but its elegant squares obscure the fact that it is the poorest province in Andalucía, Spain’s poorest region, and one of the most impoverished in the European Union. A quarter of the city’s population are unemployed. Under González, €500,000 (£445,000) of the profits generated by Eléctrica de Cádiz is used to prevent “energy poverty” among the city’s most disadvantaged, whereas other companies simply cut off the supply to those who cannot afford to pay. “The profits are invested in Cádiz, they don’t go to Qatar or a tax haven,” he said. González believes the city’s sustainable policies were a factor in attracting the electric vehicle producer Torrot to establish its factory in Cádiz, with the creation of 200 jobs. In a city where shipbuilding dates back to Phoenician times, the shipyards have also diversified into building offshore wind platforms. Cádiz embarked on an energy education programme to make people “energy literate”, to understand how energy is produced, to be responsible consumers and avoid being tricked into signing abusive contracts. More than 90% of citizens surveyed backed the move to renewables. In wealthy Catalonia, Barcelona has also taken energy matters into its hands. When the power company that supplied the city failed to bid to renew its €33m contract last year, the council decided to set up Barcelona Energia (BE), to buy certified renewable energy direct from source. “Our aims as a public company are to promote renewables and an ecological transition,” said Eloi Badia, responsible for the city’s energy policy. “We’re not looking to make a profit, and as a public service we can’t subsidise electricity because that would be unfair competition, but we can offer people a range of tariffs and, in the case of the most vulnerable, we can help directly and bypass welfare benefits and the like.” “We don’t aim to be a producer but to represent all the small producers, to help with individual consumption,” Badia said. “We subsidise installation by up to 50% and offer discounts on VAT so that people can recoup the cost within three or four years. Since the law changed there’s been a tenfold increase in the number of projects. We don’t see other suppliers of renewable energy as competitors; on the contrary, we welcome them.” However, as most people in the city live in apartment blocks, the issue is more complicated than installing solar panels on the roof of a house. Most blocks house a mix of owner-occupiers and tenants and Badia said there was as yet no legal framework for people living in apartments to share energy generated from communal solar panels. But, as of January of this year, BE has started supplying electricity to private homes. Competition laws mean it can only supply 20% of the private market – about 20,000 households – but Badia said that as demand increases they could create subsidiary companies to meet it. “We’re doing it in phases, learning as we go along,” he said. “We’re not in a hurry, we’ve only been going since last July and only supplying homes since January.” Spain was on the way to becoming a world leader in renewables until the big power companies, alarmed that self-generation would cost them clients, persuaded the conservative government to introduce the so-called “sunshine tax” in 2013. Homeowners, far from being encouraged to install solar panels through the possibility of selling surplus energy to the grid, were instead treated as suppliers and taxed accordingly. As a result, Spain’s solar business went into a steep decline. In contrast, Germany offers financial incentives to install solar panels, with the result that – with around half the sunshine hours – it generates 10 times more solar energy than Spain. The sunshine tax was scrapped after the socialists came to power in June 2018. Though Spanish cities are making up for lost time, others are not doing so well and many EU member states will struggle to meet the 2020 renewable targets. A 2017 report commissioned by Friends of the Earth reveals that, while Reykjavik in Iceland and Fafe in Portugal use 100% renewables, major cities such as Amsterdam, Warsaw, Athens, London and Zurich are almost entirely dependent on fossil fuels. Wrocław in Poland and Gibraltar are the dirtiest in this respect, while three-quarters of the Paris power supply is nuclear."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2021/oct/25/australia-news-live-update-covid-vaccine-victoria-new-south-wales-cabinet-meets-to-finalise-2050-net-zero-deal-all-nsw-students-return-to-school-daniel-andrews-90-booster-shots-cop26","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2021-10-25T08:06:43Z","webTitle":"Nationals MP Keith Pitt rejoins cabinet after climate deal – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2021/oct/25/australia-news-live-update-covid-vaccine-victoria-new-south-wales-cabinet-meets-to-finalise-2050-net-zero-deal-all-nsw-students-return-to-school-daniel-andrews-90-booster-shots-cop26","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2021/oct/25/australia-news-live-update-covid-vaccine-victoria-new-south-wales-cabinet-meets-to-finalise-2050-net-zero-deal-all-nsw-students-return-to-school-daniel-andrews-90-booster-shots-cop26","fields":{"headline":"Nationals MP Keith Pitt rejoins cabinet after climate deal – as it happened","bodyText":"With that, we will wrap up the blog for this evening. Here’s a recap of today’s major stories: Boosters should be available six months on from last vaccine doses, Lt Gen John Frewen flagged today. Advice from Atagi is expected to come imminently. Victoria has reported 1,461 new Covid cases and, sadly, seven further deaths. Among them was a woman in her 20s. Over in NSW, the state has recorded 294 cases and four deaths as hundreds of students returned to school. Deputy prime minister and leader of the National party Barnaby Joyce has been on radio describing the net zero by 2050 target as a “goal”, not a commitment. Labor’s Chris Bowen today said the Coalition had been dragged “kicking and screaming” to the position a week before the Glasgow climate summit. Minister for resources and water Keith Pitt will be added to the cabinet, Scott Morrison announced, a day after the Nationals confirmed an in-principle support of net zero by 2050. Origin Energy have been slugged a record $5m in penalties after allegedly charging prohibited exit fees to more than 20,000 customers. And nearly one-third of refugees at Melbourne detention hotel have tested positive for Covid and one has been hospitalised. Former NSW education minister Adrian Piccoli is up on The Drum alongside Guardian Australia editor Lenore Taylor, discussing John Barilaro’s appearance at Icac hearings today. You can catch up on that here: Piccoli: In terms of the way government decisions get made about allocating resources, it’s pork-barrelling but it’s in somebody else’s electorate, when it’s in your electorate it’s about being a good local member. Tony Windsor and plenty of others were given lots of things in their electorates in order to carry their support with our independence, particularly in a minority government. Is that corrupt in itself? No. It’s not. It’s the political process. Taylor: I don’t think we can sit here and excuse pork-barrelling as being just the way that politics is done. Pork-barrelling means when there isn’t clear criteria and when it isn’t a transparent and clear process. And yes of course you might need a different set of criteria for say regional projects and the profitability of them in urban projects but you need criteria and a process, if you get to the point where pork-barrelling is normalised we are in a sorry state and it’ll erode trust in politics. That would be a terrible thing. Labor’s Marielle Smith has been quizzing PMC officials about Josh Frydenberg’s stay at the Lodge before the August sitting period. The treasurer told Sunrise in August that Morrison was “actually on the dishes, would you believe, because it’s just the two of us there”. PMC officials told Senate estimates that “there would have been household staff continuing to operate” because even in times the Lodge has been used to quarantine, staff have accessed the back of house through a zoning arrangement to keep them away from those quarantining. Smith also asked whether taxpayers were paying for food and drink, because Frydenberg had said “there’s enough bottles of ginger ale for us both to get one”. Officials said that as Frydenberg was there for two weeks there was no “cost recovery”, he didn’t pay his own way, and the tab was picked up by the department. For longer stays of non-dependent adults, the department seeks to recover costs. Officials couldn’t say whether MP Ben Morton had stayed there as they have “no visibility” of who stays at the Lodge. Australia is edging ever closer to 90% first vaccination doses among over 16-year-olds. Over in Tasmania, sonar imaging of the sea floor off the north-west coast has found no trace of a man or boat that went missing a week ago, AAP reports. Thomas Courto set off from the town of Wynyard around midday on 18 October with friends Isaiah Dixon and Bree-Anna Thomas in a yellow and white 17-foot motorboat. The bodies of Dixon and Thomas were found washed ashore at nearby Table Cape on Wednesday afternoon. Multi-beam sonar technology was used on Monday to comb an underwater area of roughly 340 hectares about three to four kilometres offshore. Inspector Steve Jones said there had been “no sighting” of Courto or the missing vessel, and said it wasn’t likely he’d be alive at this stage. Jones said air and sea search efforts would not occur on Tuesday, when a review into the week-long operation would be undertaken to determine if any spots had been missed. Searching may then resume on Wednesday. Courto’s family and friends continue to search coastline in the area and are still holding hope of finding him alive, Jones said. The Victorian premier Daniel Andrews is on ABC Melbourne now. He says Victoria will get “well over” 90% double-dose coverage in the coming weeks. Asked why Victoria is the only state with vaccination mandates to extend well into 2022, Andrews says: The protection you get from these vaccines is so clear cut, the fact this isn’t going away... the way to stay open, the way to stay as safe as possible is for people to get vaccinated... the evidence and steady climb in the numbers would make the case for me that having it mandated in certain settings has absolutely made people get vaccinated. Sometimes you need to be prompted, sometimes a bit of urgency comes when you have a date to work to. Meanwhile, Bridget McKenzie is speaking with ABC Melbourne on the National party’s support (in principle) of net zero emissions by 2050. She says the government has “made it clear” the targets won’t be legislated. On that note, I am going to hand you over to the lovely Caitlin Cassidy who will take you through the last part of the blog. Estimates continues and we will keep an eye on it, but the house is starting to wrap up. We will be back with Politics Live early tomorrow morning, but make sure you check back to see what the team have been working up for you today. A very big thank you to Mike Bowers, Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin, Paul Karp and Daniel Hurst for their never ending diligence and support. And to everyone else in the Guardian Australia brains trust who work overtime keeping this thing afloat (and all of us out of trouble. Well most of us. I’m always going to manage to find it) But the biggest thank you, as always, has to go to you for following along with us. It’s been a very strange year and it must feel a little weird as we all move on like the last two years weren’t completely life changing – I can assure you we feel it too and we are very aware of the load people are carrying. We’re all trying to find a balance at the moment, and there is no script for that. Find your own in your own way. Just try to be kind to those around you as we all stumble along. Have fun with Caitlin and take care of you. A good Monday evening to all and thanks to Amy Remeikis. I’ll be with you for the rest of the night. A thank you to the secret squirrels who are watching estimates so we don’t have to for passing on this gem – apparently the department of prime minister and cabinet spent $9,500 on consultants, who were hired to train up the people in PM&amp;C who train others on how to handle... estimates. So 10 grand on training the trainers, if you will, who then train senior executives on how to answer questions about their department. How does one train for estimates? Well, there is no scale of Penny Wong’s eyebrow raise for one. Also, no one plays specific senators during the mock hearings, there is apparently no list of senators to watch out for (one would think that is obvious anyway) and the training doesn’t teach people how to avoid answering questions. Apparently. So it remains unclear what they are taught. Because it is not as if we get a lot of answers during estimates anyway. We imagine it is probably pretty obvious not to wink at a minister during a hearing as well, so that probably doesn’t form part of the training either. Labor’s Kate Thwaites has seconded Josh Burn’s motion on the asylum seekers being held in the Parks Hotel: It is just not good enough that asylum seekers are still being held in unsafe and cruel conditions. In Melbourne asylum seekers are being held at the Park Hotel, where we now have a covid outbreak. At least one person has been taken to hospital. It’s not clear if the appropriate arrangements around infection control are in place to keep other people being detained safe. It is unacceptable the Morrison government is leaving people in an unsafe position during a global pandemic.” Remember that earlier post (it was many hours ago, so I don’t blame you if you don’t) about how Labor is starting the “stop pensioners from being added to the cashless debit card” campaign – now with Julian Hill’s private member’s bill (there is also a website, and petitions as this starts to whir up). Labor is also pushing for the card to be wound up, which is another part of Hill’s bill (and Luke Henriques-Gomes has been writing about the dubious evidence to support the card) but it is the pensioners part which is getting the most attention. Well, the minister Anne Ruston is not impressed: Labor are running a shameful scare campaign aimed at age pensioners based on blatant lies. Let me make it crystal clear - the Morrison government will not force age pensioners onto the cashless debit card. We were never going to, and never will. This government understands pensioners have worked hard to help build the Australia we live in today. That’s why I, as the social services minister, want to personally reassure all age pensioners of this. In fact, the government voted with the crossbench last year to support an amendment to legislation which explicitly ruled out ever forcing age pensioners on to the cashless debit card. But Labor opposed the amendment. Therefore, the bill the opposition has introduced today is simply an attempt at rewriting history. But Labor’s bill goes further and introduces a reckless plan to end a program that is helping unemployed Australians of working age stabilise their lives and their communities. Bizarrely, this plan was not put forward by Labor’s social services spokesperson Linda Burney who understands the complex challenges facing the communities where the program operates. It was put forward by backbenchers from Melbourne and Byron Bay who have not bothered to consult with the communities it will affect. Labor has clearly demonstrated they don’t care about supporting communities. They just care about playing politics, so much so they’ll simply lie to people and scare them into voting for them. Not sure if Burney will be pleased to see her name invoked here by the minister though, either. The federation chamber is about to debate a motion about refugees who are caught up in the Park Hotel covid outbreak. Ben Doherty has been covering that issue – you can catch up here Labor MPs Ged Kearney and Josh Burns are trying to make sure the plight of the refugees being held in the hotel – who are now fighting covid – gets more attention. Burns: In recent days we have learnt of a very serious Covid-19 outbreak at the Park Hotel in Melbourne – where 46 refugees are being held and where 20 have already tested positive. These are the remnants of the people who were transferred to Australia under the medevac arrangements. Ironically, they were brought here because they needed extra medical care. But due to the cruel choices by the government, their lives have been put at risk. And we must ask why. Why were they not released into the community when over 100 other medevac transfers were given a ticket into the community? The Minister for Defence said at the time, that it was cheaper to have people in the community, instead of detention. Yet, this Government chose to hold these 46 asylum seekers in the Park Hotel. And now almost half of them face a battle with the Delta variant. And the reports from this are not good – refugees have told advocates that when they first complained of symptoms, no isolation protocols were implemented, testing was delayed seemingly for weeks, and they were simply offered paracetamol. Because of this foreseeable failure we now have an active outbreak which was completely avoidable.” And Kearney (speaking on the ABC) This is a great travesty. We knew this was going to happen. I remember when I discovered that there were asylum seekers in a hotel in my electorate. One could see this was going to be a problem. I wrote to the then minister, I think it was Alan Tudge, and Andrew Giles wrote to the minister saying this is potentially a really big problem and we need to get them out of detention and into the community where it would have been safer for them. They have been moved to the Park Hotel. We’ve had the Delta strain and in three weeks, we have seen half the men affected or taken down by Covid. It is a tragedy that should never have happened. We don’t know what the conditions are in there. We know that guards are coming and going. We know that the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre told us that the men have said in there, that it is very difficult to get medical attention. They are testing their own oxygen levels in there. The nurse in me just absolutely starts to worry about that situation. I think the best thing that could happen is they were moved into the community and the government needs to take responsibility for this. Scott Morrison can’t palm this off to the state government. These men are his responsibility and he needs to make sure that they are treated carefully and that we protect the other men from what is happening in there. Senator Rex Patrick has been asking PMC officials about why they haven’t been releasing national cabinet documents after they lost an Administrative Appeals Tribunal case on the point of whether they are confidential. Stephanie Foster, the deputy secretary, and John Reid, the first assistant secretary, answered that AAT decisions are decided on their own facts and are not equivalent to a court decision that has to be applied across the whole government as a matter of course. Labor’s Katy Gallagher is suspicious that government departments, including the health department, are still saying the documents are cabinet in confidence. Asked if PMC directed them how to respond to requests from the Covid committee, Foster replied that the government’s position that national cabinet is still a committee of the commonwealth cabinet isclear, including from legislation seeking to effectively overturn the decision and PMC evidence to an inquiry into that bill. Patrick complained that the government hadn’t even appealed the AAT loss. Foster replied a future case might be decided differently, and noted that since the case all state and territory leaders had reiterated that they expect confidentiality and solidarity, key features of a cabinet. It’s almost as if the government doesn’t want to appeal the case because a court decision stating conclusively that national cabinet isn’t a cabinet they would have to abide by, but a pesky AAT decision they can safely ignore. That interview between David Littleproud and Patricia Karvelas wraps up with this: Q: What’s the difference between an in principle agreement and a binding target? Which one is it? Littleproud: I think after tonight this will be a target that we are signing up to try and achieve by 2030. It is a goal that we’re on our way to do... PK: 2050. [I think you] misspoke. 2030, [is what] many people hope. Littleproud: Shoot me. It has been a long day, PK. Chris Moraitis of the Office of the Special Investigator (OSI) was also asked during Senate estimates about the impact of the closure of the Australian embassy in Afghanistan on its investigations into alleged war crimes. He said an embassy was not a prerequisite for mutual legal assistance, but noted: “We just can’t turn up in a country without the host state being aware of that.” But on the thorny issue of cooperation with Afghanistan, he observed: “At this stage I’m not sure we can do that.” (The Australian government has not formally recognised the Taliban-led government.) Moraitis said the OSI was following foreign affairs department’s work on that issue. He said securing evidence that could be admissible in a criminal case was “massively challenging at the best of times”. Moraitis was also asked to make clear that administrative actions considered by Defence (whether someone is terminated from the ADF, for example) are separate from the OSI investigations into criminal allegations. “Yes, Senator, I can absolutely confirm that. It’s separate … It’s not relevant to our work.” For more on that issue, see our recent story: Q: Just last Thursday Minister Pitt told question time “solar panels don’t work in the dark”. He repeated those comments today. Are you comfortable that a minister with this position is the best fit as Australia works to reach net zero emissions by 2050? David Littleproud: That’s childish politics. I mean, really? There are batteries that can come off them, but it doesn’t collect the solar energy when the sun is down. Pitt literally said those words. Here’s the Hansard from 21 October: I thank the honourable member for that question and say to them: find me a solar panel that works in the dark! This is just a statement of fact. It absolutely is. It is that simple. I say to those opposite: are you seriously suggesting that, when there is no sun, solar works? This is just a fundamental fact. He mentioned nothing about batteries, or storage. Just “find me a solar panel that works in the dark”. So Patricia Karvelas asks Littleproud: Who is the childish one? Littleproud: Really? Are we going to have a go at the - the question was asked about solar panels and the minister said, “Well, they don’t collect solar energy at night.” They’re stored in a battery. (He didn’t say that until today, after days of being ridiculed) That’s why people get sick of watching Question Time and the little antics like that. I think we should be better than that. That’s just silly semantics. “Silly semantics”. David ‘we are the first government to think of the future’ Littleproud is top and tailing the ABC today, appearing on Afternoon Briefing. He is asked about Keith Pitt’s return to the cabinet (which was part of the deal for the National party’s support for net zero emissions by 2050) Well, it was part of what we asked the prime minister to make sure that the resource sector is represented because the resource sector is part of the technology road map, representing 260,000 employees. We wanted to make sure that we were part of that and the prime minister saw that importance as you see the road map outlined in the coming day or days. The ONLY reason Pitt was removed from the cabinet in the first place, was because Barnaby Joyce all but booted him out in his return to the leadership, to make room for his own cabinet picks (including Bridget McKenzie) The Nats, under the secret Coalition agreement have a certain number of cabinet spots. Joyce didn’t have enough to reward his supporters, so he took Pitt out of the cabinet in order to make good on his promises when he became leader. So the only reason Pitt was removed, was Joyce wanted it that way. Mike Bowers also caught very happy Scott Morrison (as opposed to cranky answering questions Scott Morrison) Once again, Keith Pitt has only had his cabinet spot returned. He never lost his portfolio or spot in the ministry. He hasn’t cured world hunger. He didn’t even win his position in the party room battle over the bare minimum target of net zero emissions by 2050. He just gets to sit back in the cabinet room. Still, that didn’t stop the victory lap Oh, Joel Fitzgibbon is still bringing in books to be photographed with as a troll – today’s was the Latham diaries. During the Senate estimates hearing, Kristina Keneally asks Chris Moraitis of the Office of the Special Investigator (OSI) whether it is been able to exonerate any of the 19 current or former ADF personnel who were initially referred for investigation after the Brereton inquiry. Moraitis says it is “way too early” for that: “Senator, we have not exonerated anybody, we are starting our investigations to examine the evidence.” Keneally: When do you expect the investigations to conclude? Are we looking at a year, two years, five years? Moraitis: “Yes.” (He clarifies that “it could be anywhere in that range you’ve suggested”.) Chris Moraitis of the Office of the Special Investigator (OSI) has told an estimates hearing that more than 50 investigators and intelligence analysts are now on board. This is the body working with the AFP on investigations into allegations against Australian special forces soldiers who served in Afghanistan. He says they have a “clear focus on progressing as expeditiously as possible”. He said OSI has monitored recent events in Afghanistan (that’s the fall of the government and return of the Taliban) with concern. “To date our work has not been markedly impeded by the situation in Afghanistan.” He says the investigation teams are primarily focused on information from a variety of other sources at this stage. Sussan Ley, the environment minister who mostly makes the news for approving mines, finishes up this torturous question time with a dixer and we are then all allowed to stop watching parliament. In the meantime, this question from Linda Burney was important: Why did the prime minister fail to make every effort to properly consult Australian of the year, Grace Tame, on his national strategy to prevent child sexual abuse? Scott Morrison sends the question to Ben Morton, the special minister for state: Morton: The national strategy of development has been made possible by the incredible work and insights of those who have contributed to it, consultations have been made with the victim survivors and advocates, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, people with disabilities in the Australian women’s commissions, in relation to the Australian of the year, in March the head of the national office for child safety had an informal meeting with Grace Tame in Canberra to discuss the national strategy ... the head of the National office of child safety emailed Grace Tame about how she might work [with] the office of child safety in relation to the strategy. On 13 May I spoke to Grace Tame to talk to her about measures in the budget to form part of the national strategy. And ... further the national office of child safety emailed Grace Tame to advise you of the national strategy commitment, it was to anticipate further activity of Grace Tame including her advocacy on these issues. And [emailed] the healing foundation on behalf of the national office of child safety emailed Grace Tame to invite to attend a consultation workspace on the 10 June on these issues for victim survivors, a follow-up email was sent. On 14 June, I personally travelled to Tasmania, with the head of the national office of child safety, to meet Grace Tame. The position and the role I take is Minister responsible for national office of child safety work I have done in relation to the national strategy was one that has been informed by Grace Tame’s meeting with her and engagement with our officials. I thank her for the insight onto those issues but the fact I had concerns and reservations about some of the elements of the strategy and Grace and I spoke about those and she actually assisted me in understanding the importance of them, that will be announced this week. On 20 October, the National office of child safety emailed Grace Tame to make sure she participates and invite her to the launch later this week. As a result of media discussions on this issue there has been further interaction with Grace Tame to make sure she can participate with other victim survivors in relation to the national strategy launch. Subsequently in relation to tweets from the leader of the opposition on Friday afternoon I reached up to his chief of staff to inform them of some of those engagements with Grace Tame. In relation to the national strategy is an important issue and victim survivors deserve to be above politics. The government wins the divisions, so we move on. Barnaby Joyce tries and fails to answer another question, and then we move through some very painful dixers (honestly, just use a press release) before Anthony Albanese moves to suspend standing orders to debate this motion: that the House of Representatives supports a legislated target of net zero emissions by 2050 (The transcription service called that SARAH emissions. It also mislabelled a minister’s title as ‘minister for testicles’ so it is having a small moment today. Question time may have finally broken Tveeder) The government opposes the suspension of standing orders. Vince Connolly, the member for the soon-to-be-no-more electorate of Stirling, is taking every opportunity he can to audition for his role if he doesn’t win a WA seat at the next election (he could be the candidate for Cowan) – a human who absolutely knows how to talk to people. We believe in the member for Stirling. Sure, he still delivers dixers like he is a bunch of raccoons sewn into a suit, but one day, he’s going to ask a question like a normal person and then we’ll know – he’s ready. Scott Morrison was cranky again on a question on climate. Moving on. Just for the record, the deputy Nationals leader also dropped this brain fart into question time today: We are the first government to think about the future. Sure Jan. An interesting exchange during Senate estimates. James Paterson – who is chair of the parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security (PJCIS) – asked Asio chief Mike Burgess about Anthony Byrne, the Labor MP who recently resigned as deputy chair. Paterson told the hearing Byrne had resigned as a result of “internal party matters that I don’t seek to comment on and I know you won’t seek to comment on either”. Paterson told the Senate estimates hearing: “But during that public discussion it was suggested that a reason that he may need to resign from the committee was because intelligence and security agencies could no longer trust him, given his disclosures before Ibac.” Paterson then asked Burgess whether he held any of those concerns. Burgess told the hearing he generally did not comment about individuals, but added that he had engaged with Byrne extensively over the past few years, both as Australian Signals Directorate head and now as the head of Asio. “And in that capacity, I found him to be someone who is deeply thoughtful and probing in his understanding of intelligence and security matters, the threats we face and actually what’s needed to protect our country from these threats whilst upholding the law of this land. So, I’ve no doubt I would assess that Mr Byrne is someone who cares deeply about national security, and what’s in Australia’s national interests.” Burgess then proceeded to make a general comment that “if I had concerns about a member of parliament” he “would talk to the leader of the party”. Keith Pitt, now looking like a terrier who might be offered a piece of nana’s steak if they can just manage not to bark and ruin Sunday lunch, has put out his own statement about his return to the cabinet. (Barnaby Joyce, who booted him from the cabinet, made sure the cameras were watching as he walked over and shook his hand, because apparently, the floor of the parliament was the only chance he had). Pitt’s statement (a reminder that Pitt never lost his job, or his portfolio – just his spot around the cabinet table): “Today the Prime Minister appointed me to Cabinet as the Minister for Resources and Water. “I thank him for that privilege. “My focus will continue to be on the hundreds of thousands of men and women across Australia who make such a significant contribution to the resources and water sectors. “The resources industry directly employs more than 260,000 Australians, mainly in regional areas, and is forecast to hit a record $349 billion in exports this financial year. “It supports the jobs of another 1.2 million Australians. “Our resources remain in high demand throughout the world and will support Australian jobs and economic growth for decades to come. “I am also committed to building stronger regional communities across the Murray-Darling Basin. “Good rain combined with good management and best practice by our farmers and irrigators are delivering record crops across many parts of the Basin this year. “In Cabinet, I will continue to support them with policies that support all Basin communities.” Alan Tudge sprouts some more rubbish about the changes to the curriculum. The things he says are not only factually wrong, they are also just sad, transparent attempts to start a culture war in a bid for some actual relevance. Libby Coker to Barnaby Joyce: “I refer to his comments in this House last week concerning net zero. Did the deputy prime minister yesterday oppose a policy of net zero emissions by 2050?” Joyce: I thank the honourable member for her question, and right from the start say I want 100% support our process of going to Glasgow, for the target of net zero emissions. I do that because I have laid out the process of how the National Party were deliberate about this, I clearly laid out the process that was never given to other people in the regional member for the Labor Party, and that process was that opposition would not be determined by the executive, it would not be determined by one person, it would be determined by the views of party members and yesterday they did precisely that. We are going forward as a Coalition government to make sure we do the best. It is really important that we got to that position and I tell you why. Because there is a difference in policy, we believe in technology, they believe in legislation. They believe in laws, we believe in technology. (Barnaby Joyce, as a member of the executive government, writes the laws. That is his job). They believe in legislation, because legislation outsourced things, and they are going to be the greatest outlaws since Ned Kelly, they will outlaw central Queensland and the Hunter Valley, the coal industry, they will outlaw the miners because they have said they are coming forward with legislation, that is your policy. (He then starts an argument with Anthony Albanese from the despatch box). You are saying you’re not going to legislate? Tony Smith: “I will caution the deputy prime minister. We have done this a few times, ministers are not going to, no you haven’t got your microphone on, you need to wait. The deputy prime minister will not ask questions, he will bring himself to the question that was asked, that he is already straying from. Joyce: For the sake of the House, for the sake of the honourable member opposite, the issue is resolved. Albanese then seeks leave to answer the question, but Peter Dutton does not grant it. The head of Asio says the intelligence agency “would not let it rest if we saw a nation state engaged in acts of misinformation or disinformation” – including during an election campaign. Mike Burgess said he would have a conversation with the electoral commissioner and the prime minister and the opposition leader if such activity was detected during a campaign, but it would depend on the nature of the problem. Labor’s Kristina Keneally asked Burgess about the issue of disinformation being used as a tool of state-backed foreign interference, which she noted had been reported as affecting a number of democratic elections in other jurisdictions. Burgess said: Have we seen nation states lining up issues in an attempt to provide disinformation on certain topics? Yes, we have seen that. Do we expect that before an election? Maybe. We’ll continue to watch that, with other agencies and put out the appropriate advice at the time. I think there’s something wonderful though about our democracy. [It] allows information and disinformation to be debated and challenged openly so I think there is a good defence there. I think our democracy is fairly robust in that regard, but of course we wouldn’t let it rest, the community would not let it rest if we saw a nation state engaged in acts of misinformation or disinformation. That would be drawn to the government’s attention and during caretaker be drawn to both parties’ attention. Mike Burgess, the Asio chief, is giving evidence to Senate estimates now. He says each day, “multiple countries are making multiple attempts” to conduct espionage and foreign interference against Australia. Such activity is enabled and accelerated by technology, he says, adding those attempts are targeting all levels of government and industry and academia. On terrorism, Burgess says religiously motivated violent extremists continue to continue to urge attacks. He notes investigations into ideologically motivated violent extremism have increased. While he says there has been considerable and understandable attention given to nationalist and racist violent extremism, Australia is also seeing growth in single-issue motivated groups and individuals that have the potential to embrace violence. Burgess points to recent anti-lockdown protests “where some adopted violence as a tactic”. Meanwhile. Madeleine King to Scott Morrison: “Given his previous statements that electric vehicles and renewable energy targets are nuts and the world’s biggest battery store of renewable energy was as useful as a big banana and a big prawn, how can Australians trust the prime minister to deliver action on climate change?” Scott Morrison (continuing to rewrite history, which is what happens when you use marketing slogans and glib one-liners off the cuff as policy, and then actually have to come up with policy): I opposed Labor policies, I opposed their approach to the issues you are referring to, I didn’t agree with the way they wanted to do that, and the Australian people agreed with me. The approach that the Labor party was seeking to take at the last election on those matters was not an approach I agreed with. We had policies that were supporting electric vehicles and renewable technologies, all of those things, at the last election and the Australian people supported those policies. We want to keep doing that because under our policies, we want to see more and more investment going into these areas and that’s what we are trying to change and ...mandate so they can invest in these important technologies. There are $192m support for low emissions technologies, including $72m to support electric vehicles and hydrogen vehicle charging infrastructure, $52m for regional Australia, $20m to make heavy trucks more fuel efficient and more to help heavy industry reduce their energy consumption. That is what we are trying to do. The Labor Party are voting against all of those things for supporting the disallowance motion which would prevent us from on those renewable technologies, in particular, on electric vehicles and hydrogen vehicle charging infrastructure. So, I’m not going to [support] the policies of the Labor party, whose policies were rejected at the election because they were carried away with the fantasies, and the Australian people caught them out ... That’s what they are not going to pay for and the Labor party is still in the same place, they still haven’t thought the policies through haven’t prepared a plan for how to achieve the targets, they don’t have a 2030 target, and they are going to the Australian people and saying just trust us? Who would trust the Labor party with the economy, to take Australia through one of the biggest changes in the global economy which has been for at least a generation if not 50 years. The Labor party cannot be trusted to manage the economy through this major change ... Our policies will set out very clear plans, there will be technology, there won’t be taxes, respect for people’s choices, we won’t be mandating what they should buy and where they should buy it. We will let Australians make their own mind up because we trust Australians to make good choices in their interests, they will have lower taxes to pay for them, courtesy of the treasurer. You cannot trust Labor on their climate policies. Angus Taylor sprouts something about technology not taxes. Next. Chris Bowen to Scott Morrison: “My question is to the prime minister and refers to his previous answer in which he said he would release his plan soon enough. The minister for regionalisation has said in regard to what the government does to make good a deal on net zero ‘the first rule of fight club is not to talk about fight club’. “Don’t Australians deserve more respect than this? Apart from a pay rise for the minister ... what is Australia’s climate policy, and why don’t the Australian people have a right to know?” (Most question times these days seem to have some inclusion of something ridiculous Bridget McKenzie has said). Morrison: They have every right to know and we set out very clearly at the last election ... and as a result, emissions reductions, Mr Speaker, emissions reductions have fallen by 20% on 2005 levels. I said we would meet and beat our 2030 target Mr Speaker, and we will, and I’m looking forward to setting that out, Mr Speaker, at the Glasgow Cop26, where we will set out clearly our commitments in terms of 2050 as well as ... our commitments in relation to 2030, which we took to the last election. At the last election, there was one issue. There was a question of 45% emissions reduction, put forward by the Labor party, and 26-28% was put forward by the Liberal National party, Mr Speaker. That is what we took to the last election. The people rejected a Labor policy because Labor could not expand the policies. No plan to achieve their policies. They couldn’t say what they cost. And, Mr Speaker, nothing has changed since that time. They still don’t have a plan, as to how they will meet their targets. They don’t even have a target for 2030, Mr Speaker. I recall when the government first came to be elected, we made very clear in 2013 that we would commit to the 2020 targets. That was, Mr Speaker, that was seven years from that date, we are eight years from 2030 and the opposition can’t even make a commitment about a 2030 target. Not only do we make that commitment before we were elected, we met that commitment and we beat that commitment. ... I said very clearly, Mr Speaker, that the government I lead was not going to support a net zero by 2050 target unless we could detail a plan to achieve it. Mr Speaker, those opposite scoff at this. What they don’t understand, Mr Speaker, is that people in rural ... Australia across the country deserve that. They deserve to know what the plan is, how it impacts them, and how we’re going to achieve it. Mr Speaker, that is what we will be setting out very, very clearly. ... And we will be very faithful to the commitments we made at the last election ... Those opposite could not expand their policies. We could. That is why Australians can trust the Liberals and the Nationals with an economic plan that enables us to meet our emissions reductions targets. They know that a party, both parties and our coalition, which, Mr Speaker, have rightly wrestled with this issue ... considered carefully the implications of the costs and the issues that will need to be dealt with. Greg Hunt says some things but people seem to pay even less attention than usual, which really says it all. The only person who seems to hold people’s attention less these days is Angus Taylor. Thank goodness for merit, huh? Anthony Albanese decides to ask the prime minister a question: Now that the prime minister supports Labor’s policy of net zero emissions by 2050, will he also support Labor’s policy to legislate net zero emissions by 2050? Scott Morrison is so cranky he begins to lose his voice answering this one. (He also gets a bit more personal, as he seems to work out some internal frustrations – which may actually just be a projection of who he is really cranky at, but can’t publicly yell at, because Coalition unity). Morrison: The Coalition does not support Labor’s policy. The Labor party have a target with no plan, Mr Speaker. They have a target with no plan. That is not the Coalition policy. The policy of the Coalition is to have a plan with a target. So people actually know what we plan to do to achieve the target that they want to achieve. Mr Speaker, we have been working through carefully, considering all of the implications. I also have a plan of how I am going to transition to removing chocolate from my diet by the year 2050, which involves changing nothing, but talking about how I am absolutely going to do it. Albanese interjects with how Morrison should release the plan. Morrison says “soon enough” in the same sort of voice my parents used to use when I would ask when my curfew would be lifted. Morrison continues: The Australian people will know our plan, Mr Speaker, but they won’t know the Labor party’s plan. They won’t know the Labor party’s plan because despite having said that they want to achieve net zero by 2050, Mr Speaker, for some years now, there is still no plan as to how they will achieve it, no estimate of what it will cost. Mr Speaker, Labor does not even have a 2030 target let alone having a plan for how they will achieve their 2050 target. But what the Australian people know is the same genius on the Labor’s side who came up, Mr Speaker, with the retirees’ tax, the housing tax, and the superannuation tax, the same genius that came up with all of those economy destroying policies is the same genius that the leader of the Labor party was relying on for the Labor party to achieve a 2050 net zero outcome. The only net zero outcome that will come from the Labor party, Mr Speaker, is what will happen to the Australian people and their prosperity, Mr Speaker, because you cannot trust Labor with an economic plan to deliver on a net zero 2050 target. Mr Speaker, our plan is clear, Mr Speaker. Technology, not taxes. (No one is suggesting taxes). We won’t be mandating or shutting down industries, Mr Speaker. We will let people make their own choices. We’ll make sure there is a portfolio of technologies that we can bring to scale, Mr Speaker, and bring to affordability, backed up by backing to make any balance right between affordable, reliable power, Mr Speaker, and ensuring that we are achieving the lower emissions outcomes that we are seeking. And we will be absolutely transparent about that because that is one of the things that the Australian government has delivered year in year out on being fully transparent about our emissions reductions. ... Labor have no plan for their target. They have signed up Australia and they want to put it in law and they can’t even tell Australians how they will do it or how much it will cost. It is just a rerun of Bill 2.0. (When Morrison gets personal, and tries out these lines, you know he is getting frustrated). Josh Frydenberg has once again forgotten how to use microphones. Moving on Adam Bandt manages to make Scott Morrison, who is once again being sidelined by Labor to prove a point (that he has no impact on his policy), very cranky with this question: The Glasgow summit is demanding the whole world commits to climate targets before it is too late to stop runaway global warming. It is easy to beat the terrible target set by Tony Abbott. The UK and US have lifted their targets with a 68% cut. Prime minister, why won’t you beat and better the UK and US targets, with 75% target determined by the independent emissions panel. And condemn Australia to severe floods, droughts and rising temperatures. Morrison is very cranky as he answers this: I don’t know why the member for Melbourne wants to talk down about regional and rural areas. They have seen emissions drop by 20.5%, more than New Zealand, more than the United States, more than many countries around the world ... Australian farmers and those in rural and regional Australia do the heavy lifting, I think they should expect this place to respect them. They should respect their efforts and they should respect their contributions, but I think Australians are growing ... tired of the Greens, and joined also by those opposite from time to time, talking down rural and regional Australia and their contributions to ensuring their environments and their communities are stronger, and their way of life is protected. The targets that I took to the last election, the targets that I took the last election, were endorsed by the Australian people! They rejected the targets put forward by the Labor party and the Greens, they rejected them, they endorsed our targets and I said we would meet and beat those targets and indeed we will! We will keep faith with the Australian people on the things we pledged at the last election and we will exceed their expectations on what those targets were set out at the last election. The Australian people are doing the heavy lifting. Australia has the highest rate of solar on roofs of any country in the world, last year. We had more renewable investment in this country in one year [than Labor’s government]. Our rate of growth in renewable investment is outstripping countries around the world, our low emissions technology roadmap is making sure hydrogen and other important fuels and opportunities are being realised all around the country. The leader of the Greens needs to understand it is performance that counts, not the empty aspirations. And what Australia can point to as a track record of delivering, a 20% reduction in emissions at the same time as Australia has achieved 40% increase in the size of our economy. I’d like to see another country match that. ... We are carrying our weight and making a contribution and we won’t be told by people outside this country how we should be meeting our targets. Chris Bowen to Keith Pitt (who now looks like if his chest puffed out any further, he would float into space): “Does he agree with the New South Wales treasurer who said yesterday we have some of the best renewable resources anywhere on the planet, those renewable energy resources can be used to create and support heavy industry create green aluminium and steel and provide the world’s energy needs in a low carbon future?” Pitt: Mr Speaker, I will be very frank. I am not interested in what the New South Wales treasurer has to say – my job is to deliver for the resources sector, to look after the water interests of all Australians as we saw with the Murray-Darling basin continuing to have the right balance, to make exports ... while there are markets for our products we will fill them. Those opposite want to close sections down and close industry down, close the resources sector down. On this side of the chamber we will continue to support the sector. The current deputy prime minister took a dixer which seems to be an opportunity to spend time talking about [most likely] incoming Country Liberal Party senator Jacinda Price (who won the top NT CLP senate spot from Sam McMahon) That is most likely because he backed McMahon in the senate battle – and there is nothing stopping Price from sitting in the Liberal party room (like the LNP, the CLP can choose which party room they sit in) which would mean he faces losing another vote. He has already lost George Christensen – and Colin Boyce the candidate replacing him, is no guarantee to be a Joyce backer. So that is a potential loss of two numbers in the Nats party room already – and it’s never a particularly loyal group anyway. Labor’s Warren Snowden gets booted out for interjecting with “donkey’s brain” Anthony Albanese to Keith Pitt (who is still shaking like a terrier faced with a Schmacko): “Last week the minister told question time ‘find me a solar panel that works in the dark’. Is the minister aware that batteries can store renewable energy? Does the minister get a shock when he turns on the tap and water comes out even though it is not raining outside?” Pitt: I thought they brought the out the big guns, but they brought the pop gun. The leader of opposition has said the thing I backed up, solar panels don’t work in the dark, that is just a fact. If you want to store energy you can do it and in any number of ways. It is the resources sector delivering the technology and resources to make those things a reality. Scott Morrison continues to take credit for the vaccination program and Covid recovery like that guy who never turned up for your group assignment, but arrived in time for the presentation, presenting it like it was all their own work. We are straight into it, with Pat Conroy taking on Keith Pitt (Pitt arrived early for QT, spread out his papers and tried his best not too look too excited – which he failed at. Pitt has been pretty sad since he was booted from cabinet – this is all his dreams come true). Conroy asks if Pitt can confirm he gave away his opposition to net zero for a chance to get back into cabinet: “Why is it about about your job and not regional jobs?” Pitt: They [Labor] are all about digging up dirt but not the way the resources sector does. (It’s not exactly digging up dirt – it was announced). It is all about politics with those opposite. The hardworking men and women, Mr Speaker, out there turning over dirt (machines do this now), shipping coal, shipping iron ore, driving jobs and driving our economy. Mr Speaker, those opposite will continue this line of questioning, but I can say that every day I get up and am on a role in the government, I am looking to deliver for regional Australia, our country, for individuals that we represent who are out there working hard, paying their taxes, taxes which are much lower under this the government than they would be under the opposition, I will say, Mr Speaker. We will continue to deliver for them because it is about them. Now Anthony Albanese is up – he is saying the coming election is about two very different outcomes for Australia. (Which is the outcome of every election). It is time for 90 second statements in the House (where MPs can speak about anything they like before question time). So it is time to play who is that MP – retiring LNP MP Ken O’Dowd. The Nationals wanted to add another title to Keith Pitt’s portfolio covering “managing the transition in regional communities”, which was denied by the PM. Scott Morrison has made this announcement: “Today I announce the Minister for Resources and Water the Hon Keith Pitt MP will be added to the Cabinet. “Minister Pitt is a powerful voice for the resources sector and ensuring that we build upon Australia’s strength in traditional exports, while harnessing opportunities in the new energy economy and critical minerals. “Minister Pitt has been a strong advocate for regional and rural communities, both in his portfolio responsibilities and as a local MP, and will work closely with the Minister for Industry, Energy and Emissions Reduction the Hon Angus Taylor MP to ensure we reach our emissions reduction targets through technology that will empower our industries and regional communities. “Only the Coalition can be trusted to grow our economy, maintain affordable and reliable energy prices, protect our resource industries and manufacturing base that supports rural and regional communities, and take practical and responsible action to achieve our emissions reduction targets.” Labor’s Chris Bowen has stood up to respond to the government’s deal on net zero, saying the Coalition had been dragged “kicking and screaming” to the position a week before the Glasgow climate summit. He accused the government of being a “rolling rumble of chaos and secrecy”, highlighting Joyce’s opposition to the net zero goal, and the lack of transparency around the deal that has been struck between the two parties which will include a new cabinet position. Bowen said the net zero target needed to be legislated, and the government should update its medium term emissions reduction target. “Australia under Scott Morrison is desperately playing catch up.” He said the Labor party would outline its medium term emission reduction targets in the coming weeks after the Glasgow summit had concluded. “The Australian people will have a choice: a party which doesn’t really believe in net zero by 2050, there’s no plan to get there and it’s all about the politics, or an alternative government, which believes passionately that the world’s climate emergency is Australia’s jobs opportunity,” Bowen said. “The most important thing is to ensure that Australia has a government which believes in the path forward and has the policies in place to ensure that job creation goes hand in hand with emissions reduction, emissions down, jobs up, energy prices down.” Bowen said he was prepared for an “inevitable” scare campaign on Labor’s targets, once they were updated. “I believe Labor can win the next election with a good and ambitious climate policy, one which is anchored in good economics in jobs across the regions of Australia,” he said. “And I believe we can repel the inevitable scare campaign.” Labor’s Penny Wong has asked Simon Birmingham about when Scott Morrison first found out about the entity that partly paid for Christian Porter’s legal fees. Birmingham said: “To my knowledge, when the disclosure was made.” Birmingham said he believes Porter updated his personal information declaration to Morrison on the same day as the MPs’ pecuniary interest register. Wong said it was extraordinary that the prime minister did not have any advanced warning. Birmingham said he would confirm the answer and report back if there was “any variance” with the evidence he’d given. John Reid, first assistant secretary, said the department first found out in a phone call to him from a senior adviser in the PMO on 14 September, the day the news broke of Porter’s disclosure of the Legal Services Trust. Stephanie Foster, the deputy secretary, said the department was asked “whether or how an arrangement such as that could be compliant with the ministerial standards”. But no conclusion was reached before Porter resigned from the ministry. Earlier, Foster answered a question about the PMC department discussing the Porter issue with the PMO between 15 and 19 September. Wong then drew Foster’s attention to vision of her appearing to wink at Birmingham when she gave this evidence: Foster said at no time did she intentionally wink at Birmingham. You be the judge! Over at energy estimates, we’ve just broken for lunch. We haven’t learnt a great deal more from this morning’s sessions but it’s worth mentioning that the hearing had to break for about 15 minutes a little while ago to deal with the issue that departmental officials were not answering questions. This has been the case more or less all morning, with officials refusing on multiple occasions to take questions relating to the Glasgow talks and climate policy due to cabinet confidentiality, or, where questions related to Australia’s climate modelling, because of a claim made by the energy and emissions reduction minister Angus Taylor for public interest immunity. The specific issue at hand that led to the suspension was a question asked by Labor senator Nita Green about the Nationals’ proposed $250bn loan facility for the resources sector. Officials said they could not answer because this was not the relevant hearing in which to ask it – the relevant time would be the resources portfolio on Thursday. Some heated debate ensued with Labor, the Greens and the independent senator Rex Patrick all arguing officials had an obligation to answer questions. The hearing was suspended to deal with it. It was ultimately agreed officials should take a question about whether energy officials had provided any advice to the resources minister, Keith Pitt, about a $250bn coal loan facility. The department said the answer to that question was no. It is almost time for question time. Expect a repeat of what we are not hearing in estimates. Labor’s Penny Wong is asking the government Senate leader, Simon Birmingham, about a UK Telegraph report that Australian government sources described the UK high commissioner, Vicki Treadell, as a “sanctimonious bore” who was “haranguing” Australia about climate. Birmingham said he is “not accepting the proposition” that anyone in the government said that, because it is an unattributed quote. But he said “of course if someone were to have said that, the prime minister would condemn it” because Scott Morrison values the close relationship with the UK and its high commissioner. Earlier, James Larsen, the climate coordinator in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, confirmed that Morrison had indicated he would go to Glasgow Cop26 climate conference on 15 October, the last day for registration. Wong was annoyed at Larsen for not being able to reveal who is travelling to the conference, besides Morrison and the energy minister Angus Taylor. Larsen said he couldn’t recall which MPs were going, but confirmed Warren Entsch was among them when prompted by Wong. Wong asked him to get the draft list he had seen. And in environment estimates there is one piece of information we have learned. We don’t know what the Nationals have received, what the climate deal is, or what it will cost, but we do know that there is an advertising plan coming! Under questioning from Labor’s Nita Green, the environment boffins have conceded there will be a $13m marketing plan on the climate policy, including market research – which you should start seeing from this week. Back in the house (the Senate is all estimates-focused this week) and Adam Bandt has reintroduced the Greens’ coal prohibition bill. Here was part of his speech: We need to do what we have done in other industries that we know don’t have a sustainable future. It is not the fault of the workers or communities in coalmining towns or towns associated with coal-fired power stations. They have worked to help us keep the lights on and to power this country for decades. These communities should be in charge of their own future. They should be provided with the support, expertise and financial resources they need to transform and diversify their local economies in the way that they choose, so that their children can have stable, good-quality jobs in the new global economy. If we don’t stop mining and burning coal, we will be extinguished. If we don’t start now, before the change is thrust upon us, we will see deep, localised recessions and dismantled communities. This is a bill whose time has come. We need to join the rest of the world in making a plan to get out of coal and gas. We don’t have a minute to lose. The Senate’s legal and constitutional affairs committee has heard details of the Australian federal police’s investigation into the Leppington Triangle land purchase. Last month the AFP said it had finalised its investigation into the commonwealth’s purchase of land for the development of the Western Sydney airport, “with no evidence of criminal conduct identified”. During the AFP’s appearance before a Senate estimates hearing this morning, the committee heard that 11 investigators had been involved in the Leppington investigation. The Queensland LNP senator Gerard Rennick asked what evidence had been provided by the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) as part of the investigation. The AFP deputy commissioner, Ian McCartney, told the Senate committee: The original referral matter indicated that fraud may have occurred and subsequent to that the auditor general provided a significant amount of digital material to the AFP as part of the investigation ... It was a range of documents in terms of financial transactions, valuation agreements, a range of documents related to the transaction. Rennick: “And no evidence was found of any wrongdoing?” McCartney: “We have put out a statement saying we identified no criminal wrongdoing in relation to the matter, senator.” Rennick: “So do you know why, if there was no evidence of any wrongdoing … why the auditor general would think there was evidence of wrongdoing?” McCartney: Well I think you’d have to ask the auditor general, but in the letter he provided to Australian federal police he indicated the suspicion of fraud in relation to the transaction. We received that matter, we decided to undertake an investigation, and as a result of that investigation we haven’t found criminal offending in relation to the matter, senator. Rennick: “Did you have to conduct raids on the the staff’s houses to get all possible records?” McCartney: I think we’ve said before at Senate estimates [that] we don’t conduct raids, we conduct search warrants. We conducted two search warrants, but I’m not prepared to say in terms of the open hearing what they related to, senator. Rennick made a general statement that included the question: “Where’s the accountability with the auditor general?” (The ANAO is due to face Senate estimates tonight.) The hearing continues. Labor’s Tony Burke sought to suspend standing orders to move a motion relitigating the issue of the House failing to refer Christian Porter’s legal fees being part-paid by a trust with funds from unknown sources to the privileges committee. The government moved that Burke no longer be heard, and won the vote, so he didn’t get further than the attempted suspension. A copy of the motion, seen by Guardian Australia, indicates that Burke was seeking to move that the House note: Last week, the Morrison-Joyce government voted down a privileges motion given precedence by the speaker for the first time since federation; media reports that ‘Liberal backbenchers were completely horrified’ by that vote, which protected the member for Pearce from having to disclose the sources of donations; this renders the register of members’ interests completely meaningless; and those same backbenchers now have the chance to put things right and restore basic standards of transparency and integrity to this parliament. It also sought leave for Burke to move once against to refer Porter to privileges. But Burke didn’t get that far. So, another vote on government members’ record refusing to refer the Legal Services Trust issue to the privileges committee. Over in energy estimates, senators have been putting pressure on the department about Australia’s 2030 targets. Remember that for all the government’s focus on 2050, it is 2030 targets and urgent cuts to emissions in the next decade that are the focus of the Glasgow climate talks. My colleagues flagged in this piece last week that there was no appetite in the government to take a stronger 2030 target to next week’s summit. There have been some confusing exchanges about Australia’s 2030 plans during this morning’s hearing, with department officials seemingly unwilling to confirm if updating the target had been ruled out. But that now appears to have been confirmed in this exchange between the Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young and Jo Evans, a deputy secretary in the department of industry, science, energy and resources department. Hanson-Young: The NDC (nationally determined contribution) does require commitment, doesn’t it? Not just aspiration. Evans: Well we have already taken that and there is a commitment in our existing NDC and that is the target that has already been communicated. Hanson-Young: The Tony Abbott target? Evans: The target of the Australian government that was set under Paris in 2015. Hanson-Young: So that won’t change? Evans: That target, which was set at 2015 and which is for 2030, is not changing. Nationals MP Anne Webster has lodged a private member’s bill to regulate social media companies. The bill gives the communications minister power to “make determinations about the basic expectations of a social media service”. These can then be followed up by the eSafety commissioner, which can demand social media companies report on how they’re meeting the expectations or publish their own conclusions about contraventions. The bill also creates a process for members of the public to complain to the eSafety commissioner about defamatory material on social media platforms. According to the explanatory memorandum: The commissioner [has] the power to issue defamation notices to a service provider in circumstances where a complaint regarding defamatory material has been made to the commissioner, and the commissioner is satisfied that it is reasonably likely that the material defamed or defames the complainant ... Service providers can be liable for defamation if that service provider is issued with a defamation notice by the commissioner and the defamatory material is not removed within 48 hours. Webster as been at the forefront of efforts to hold social media giants liable as publishers after successful defamation proceedings against a conspiracy theorist who used Facebook to call her “a member of a secretive paedophile network”. Labor MP Julian Hill has also introduced this bill (as a private member’s bill) which aims to “Protect Pensioners from the Cashless Debit Card Bill”. This has been a campaign Labor has been ticking away at in key electorates for the last couple of months. The thing is, there is no plan to put pensioners on the cashless debit card. The government has been ruling that out for months – but don’t be surprised if this starts to play out as part of an election campaign (much like the fake death-tax campaign run against Labor at the last campaign had an impact, and Mediscare had an impact before that). Over in the house, Tony Burke has attempted to suspend standing orders but that has been gagged very quickly by the government and the procedures move on. Earlier today, New South Wales premier Dominic Perrottet welcomed the return to school for hundreds of thousands of students, and said the government was “always revisiting” its reopening plans. His comments came after he was asked about his counterpart in Victoria, Daniel Andrews, announcing eased restrictions from Friday, and again from 24 November. Perrottet said the Covid and Economic Recover Committee revisited the state’s restrictions each week, with changes due on 1 November and 1 December. He said: There’s a sense of positivity and confidence we haven’t seen for sometime. What we need to do is have that strong health response, which we’ve made some substantial investments in, but then ultimately open up as safely as possible so we get [people] back into work and provide for their families. We’ve always had a balanced and measured approach here in NSW. We’ll continue to have that approach as we move forward. Perrottet was asked if the state had “dodged a bullet” considering it had avoided forecasts of cases and hospitalisations spiking in October. He said: This pandemic is not over. We are opening up and as we open up, case numbers will increase and hospitalisations will increase. I think it’s a long journey. The success here has been our vaccination rate, and we’ll obviously continue to look at the data as it comes through. All school students returned to face-to-face learning today, after years 1, 12 and kindergarten returned last week. State education minister Sarah Mitchell announced school sport would resume from 1 November. Sixteen schools across NSW are closed today for cleaning and contact tracing, after members of their school communities tested positive. The head of the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission says the recently released Pandora Papers only confirms the group’s past findings about the risks posed by offshore service providers. The Greens senator Nick McKim pointed to a 2017 ACIC report that said serious and organised crime groups “engage the services of professional facilitators to launder the proceeds of crime, conceal illicit wealth and enhance their criminal activities”. The report said: As seen with the release of the so called Panama Papers in April 2016, criminal groups may employ offshore service providers to conceal their illicit funds. Michael Phelan, the ACIC chief executive, told Senate estimates today: I think with the release of the Pandora Papers and what we know about them … all it does is confirm the original assessments that were made in 2017 that offshore enablers does cause us a problem, both from a revenue protection position in terms of our tax revenue but also potential money laundering and obfuscating of funds that may well have been derived illicitly from activities in Australia. Phelan said the assessment in 2017 “has been confirmed”. He said he “wouldn’t necessarily say we are a favoured destination for money laundering”, adding: “Generally the money goes the other way.” I would not say that Australia is a popular destination for laundered funds - popular in a sense of relativity, senator … So if I was going to hide my money it would be in an offshore tax haven, it certainly wouldn’t be here. McKim pursued the issue of including professional facilitators – such as accountants, lawyers and real estate agents – within the scope of money laundering laws. Phelan said the gap was “a vulnerability and I’m not going to step back from that” but added it was “a matter of government policy” as to what they choose to regulate. Labor’s Penny Wong is grilling the finance minister, Simon Birmingham, about a report from Michelle Grattan suggesting that Scott Morrison could have gone to Glasgow promising net zero even without the Nationals’ support. Birmingham said the prime minister had “respectfully engaged” in a process with the Nationals and it was “hypothetical” whether he could’ve gone to Glasgow promising net zero without their support. Asked if there was any discussion of him doing so, Birmingham replied: No – the prime minister was always intent on running a proper cabinet process. Wong said the Nationals could’ve been out-voted at cabinet, and noted Barnaby Joyce’s public comments about it being within Morrison’s remit to promise net zero. Wong argued that all this meant whatever Morrison had agreed to amounted to “taxpayer funds to purchase political peace with the National party” for a decision he could’ve imposed if he wanted. Birmingham rejected that. He said Australia was “best served” by keeping Australians together and negotiations within the government were a “function of representatives democracy” to ensure that diverse interests were represented. Birmingham said he hadn’t seen the Nationals’ letter but “we work through the different issues that are raised”, confirming he had been briefed on them. James Chisholm, a first assistant secretary at the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, said he hadn’t prepared advice on the demands, nor seen the list. Stephanie Foster, the deputy secretary, said this likely meant the department hadn’t seen it. Wong questioned how the government could claim the document was cabinet in confidence if the department that administered cabinet hadn’t even seen it. The call has now moved to Coalition senators. In Victoria, a woman in her 20s is among the seven Covid deaths announced today, as health minister Martin Foley said more than 800 people were in hospital with the virus. The deaths also included a man in his 40s, a man in his 60s, two women and a man in their 80s and a man in his 90s. It came as Foley and the Covid-19 commander, Jeroen Weimar, both urged people to continue to get vaccinated and to remain cautious of restrictions and of symptoms. Weimar also announced a series of pop-up vaccination clinics aimed at communities with “lower levels” of vaccine take-up, and he pointed out that many of the new cases were unvaccinated people. He said: What we’ve seen now with a new case in the last week, two-thirds of the new cases every single day are not vaccinated. Not the first dose, not fully vaccinated, they’re just not vaccinated... Some of the local government areas of concern, in Wyndham, 96% of those new cases under the age of 40 were vaccinated. In Hume, 97% of new cases under the age of 40 were not fully vaccinated. Please, for your protection and the possession of those you love around you, get the vaccination job done over the coming days. Weimar welcomed the drop in case numbers today but said it was imperative people remained vigilant about symptoms and getting tested across the metropolitan Melbourne. Testing numbers across metropolitan Melbourne were slightly down at 94,000 over the weekend, he said. Cabinet isn’t scheduled to meet until tonight, so don’t expect any updates from the coalition on climate. There will be a lot of back and forth on rhetoric in question time, but no answers. Party room doesn’t meet until tomorrow – after cabinet has signed off on the deal. The Australian federal police’s deputy commissioner of operations, Ian McCartney, says some groups in Australia have viewed the 6 January attack on the US Capitol “as an inspiration point”. During Senate estimates, McCarney was asked whether he’d seen any evidence that Australians had been inspired by the attack. He was also asked of any links to individuals in Australia. McCartney replied that a colleague in the NSW police had referred to the “petri dish of hate” on the internet. McCarney told the committee: I think there has been some groups in Australia that have looked at that as an inspiration point, but it’s not binary. There are a lot of factors at play and a lot of different views at play. McCartney also referred to the Australian terrorist responsible for the Christchurch attack, saying: Unfortunately his manifesto has been an inspiration point for other attacks, so this type of ideology is fuelling concern. Origin Energy has responded to Nino’s post about the fine. From retail executive manager Jon Briskin: When we discovered this issue, we self-reported to the regulator, apologised, credited the accounts of current Victorian small business customers who were charged the $22 fee in error, and offered refunds to former customers.” We value our customers and take all of our compliance obligations seriously, so we are disappointed we did not implement these regulatory changes correctly and we are sorry.” New Zealand reported 109 new cases of Covid-19 today, as the country’s outbreak grows to 2,681 cases. Last week, prime minister Jacinda Ardern outlined New Zealand’s pathway forward through the pandemic, introducing a new “traffic light” system that would end lockdowns once the country reached 90% vaccination. Today the ministry of health announced 87% of eligible New Zealanders (aged 12 and over) had received at least one vaccine dose, and 71% were vaccinated with both doses. There are ongoing concerns that Māori, who are behind in vaccinations, will be disproportionately affected by illness and death. As of today, 69% of Māori had had one dose and 48% were fully vaccinated. Auckland, the centre of the outbreak, has now hit 90% first doses, and 77% fully vaccinated. All of the day’s cases were restricted to the North Island: 103 in Auckland, four in Waikato and two in Northland. A single case detected in the South Island over the weekend has not yet resulted in further infections. Thirty-five people are in hospital with Covid-19 – a drop of 15 from yesterday – and five are in intensive care. Still in energy estimates, Labor has been asking what has happened to the government’s national electric vehicles strategy that was due in the middle of last year. Just a note here, transport accounts for about 17% of Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions. Jo Evans from the department confirms that the strategy was due more than a year ago but the pandemic, and other things, forced a change of course. Labor’s Jenny McAllister then asks about the future fuels strategy, or the FFS – which probably fairly conveys how we all feel about how this hearing is progressing today. Evans says what was the electric vehicles strategy became the future fuels strategy and again, no word on when we might see it. Government senator Zed Seselja says: The answer is those policies will be released. In terms of the timing that’s going to be a matter for the minister [Angus Taylor], I’m not going to pre-empt it. Please save us from these references: The Australian federal police commissioner, Reece Kershaw, has requested an “urgent review” of measures to protect the safety of parliamentarians. Prosecutors in the UK last week charged a man with the murder of Conservative MP Sir David Amess and the preparation of terrorist acts. During Senate estimates, when asked about the safety of MPs, senators and electoral candidates in Australia, Kershaw said the AFP had “taken this issue very seriously”: Last year I did bring out the UK anti-terrorism command from the UK Met to have a look at our overall protection for MPs and high office holders and part of that included looking at the threat assessments and a whole range of initiatives. So we are looking at a new model for us around what services we could be able to provide protection, whether that’s physical protection, liaison, other solutions that perhaps in the past we haven’t had a look at those kind of different layers. Our model tends to be almost an all-in or nothing kind of model, so we’re looking at how could we service all of the parliamentarians in a better way, and provide that level of reassurance, what do you do when you’ve got these threats coming in and not to take them lightly, because I know a lot of the electorates receive lots of threats and concerning letters and other things. We do have to work with the state police as well, often that’s their jurisdiction. Brett Pointing, the AFP’s deputy commissioner of operations, added: The commissioner has tasked me to conduct an urgent review to see what additional strategies could be employed to enhance the safety of members of parliament. I think what happened in the UK was a stark reminder of the unpredictability of this environment and members of parliament are often at public events, there are often people there who have different views, sometimes extreme views, and it’s extremely important for us to work with members of parliament and the broader intelligence community to make sure we have up-to-date intelligence, and that that intelligence is converted into a security overlay that provides a best possible security for our members of parliament. So we look forward to doing that piece of work as a matter of urgency. Labor’s Kristina Keneally asked about the timeframes, given that Australia “could be in an election campaign in a matter of weeks or a matter of months”. Pointing: We’re working through that now and I’ve got to report back to the commissioner by 11 November. Origin Energy have been slugged a record $5m in penalties after allegedly charging prohibited exit fees to more than 20,000 customers. The Victorian Essential Services Commission issued 250 penalty notices to Origin after finding that more than 77,000 gas and electricity small business contracts wrongly included exit fees. Exit fees adding up to $489,774 had been wrongly charged to 22,371 customers, the watchdog found. Commissioner Sitesh Bhojani says it is the largest penalty issued by the commission to an energy company. He said: Origin Energy knew at all times about the changes in the law banning exit fees and they even reviewed 19 different contract templates, but didn’t remove the exit fees. Given the size and standing of Origin Energy, the commission is concerned about the company’s compliance culture over that four-and-a-half-year period from 2016 to 2020. Some of the affected businesses were charities and not-for-profits who can’t afford extra fees. Some were charged multiple times, paying thousands of dollars in prohibited fees. A local council, places of worship and charities were all incorrectly charged fees by the company, the commission found. Despite receiving customer complaints as early as 2018, Origin did not stop charging the fees until late last year, Bhojani said. At least one customer thought Origin was being generous after they complained and were told the fee would be waived. The case came to light in September 2020 after Origin Energy reported the alleged breaches of Victoria’s electricity and gas industry acts to the commission. In Victoria, exit fees can only be included on fixed-term retail contracts with fixed tariffs, charges and fees, which was not the case with these small business contracts. Origin advised the commission it was trying to contact former customers, with fewer than half having been reimbursed. The commission issues energy industry penalty notices where it has reason to believe a business has committed a contravention, but payment of a penalty is not an admission of a contravention. It’s all going great: The ATO would like to remind you that this is the last week to get your tax return in (without late penalties): The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) is reminding Australians that this is the last week to either lodge their tax return or register with a registered tax agent. So far this tax time, over $20 billion has been refunded to more than 7.2 million taxpayers. Assistant Commissioner Tim Loh understands that tax might have been the last thing on people’s minds these last few months. If you’re planning to DIY your tax but haven’t got around to it yet, don’t worry. For people with simple tax affairs, lodging through our myTax service can be done and dusted in under 30 minutes. Most of your income and personal details will already be there; simply confirm it’s correct, add any additional income and claim your eligible deductions.” If you’re lodging with a registered tax agent the same information will be available to them. You may also have a bit longer to get your return in; all you need to do is be registered with your agent before the end of this week. Over in the House, Indi independent MP Helen Haines has introduced her federal integrity commission bill. Rex Patrick introduced Haines’ bill in the Senate late last week. Most of the crossbenchers are pushing to make this as much of an issue as they can, and are hoping to drag moderate Liberals into supporting a commission that could actually do something, rather than the model the government has suggested For what it is worth, Bob Katter has thoughts on net zero which include his discovery that majorities don’t mean everyone agrees. (Just wait until he finds out how the country’s vote was split at the last election.) Here is the press release his office sent out: Bob Katter says the National Party has backed net-zero by 2050 despite putting up a huge fight, ‘which means a large proportion of their party room thought it was wrong and now they’re just going to do the wrong thing.’ “They’re going to the bend the knee and go with it, destroying what little credibility they had left,” Mr Katter said. “They went to the last election opposing this strongly and now, three years later they’re going along with it.” Mr Katter said before cheering for net-zero, every Australian must understand the concept that to buy something from overseas you must sell something. “The only things that we produce of significance are coal, iron-ore, copper, zinc and aluminium,” he said. “Everything else is very small by comparison. Now, you’re going to wipe out coal – unless you’re lying of course. And by doing so, you will also ban these other metals because they must be smelted with coal. It would be ridiculously costly to smelt it any other way. “My own thoughts are that the LNP and ALP are lying through their feet about net-zero and won’t be game enough to bankrupt the country.” AFP commissioner Reece Kershaw said while religiously motivated violent extremism remained Australia’s biggest terrorism threat, the growth in ideologically motivated violent extremist was providing challenges. He cited the following factors as posing those challenges: its rural and regional presence its influence over young people the high levels of security consciousness access to firearms among adherents The IMVE cohort is extremely interconnected, especially online. Their views are diverse and include supports for nationalist, white supremacy and neo-Nazism. The AFP has detected a number of threats, and concentrated investigative efforts on individuals or small networks (three to four individuals) who are not aligned to members of a specific nationalist or racist group. More broadly, Kershaw said law enforcement was mindful of “global instability, including the resurgence of the Taliban in Afghanistan”. The Australian Islamist cohort is influenced by both the Isil and AQ ideology, however there is a greater number aligned to the Isil ideology. We expect that Isil will transform and re-establish transnational links to increase their ability to direct or influence terrorism in other parts of the globe. Kershaw told the estimates committee that other significant threats were “the terrorist offenders released from Australian jails”, adding that the UK and NZ were “experiencing similar challenges”: Eighteen terrorist offenders are scheduled for release from prison before 2026, and 54 are due for release by 2060. He said the community safety risk posed by the reintegration of convicted terrorist offenders into the community would be an ongoing challenge, and the AFP had established a dedicated capability to manage this risk. Without naming names, he said an offender “who was recently released almost immediately went online to access information about executions, beheadings and torture”. The Australian federal police commissioner, Reece Kershaw, has warned of “individuals who are now pre-loaded with extremist ideology” while declaring that the end of restrictions on movement “will make it harder for law enforcement”. Kershaw used an opening statement to a Senate estimates hearing to say Australians “need to remain vigilant” about the threat of terrorism as lockdowns end and borders reopen. He said the threat of terrorism remains at “probable”, but noted: There have been some significant shifts, in the diversity and complexity of the environment, since the pandemic started almost a year and a half ago. The threat of terrorism has not dissipated. In fact, the pandemic, extended lockdowns and more time spent online, has in some cases, made it easier for extremists to recruit. Increased anti-government sentiment, proliferation of conspiracy theories, physical isolation and more time spent online have increased the threat, facilitating local and transnational links between individuals and groups, and sharing of ideas among extremist communities. Across the world, including in Australia, we have individuals who are now pre-loaded with extremist ideology, and the end of restrictions on movement will make it harder for law enforcement. Kershaw said religiously motivated violent extremism remained the biggest threat – comprising 85% of AFP investigations – while 15% related to ideologically motivated violent extremism (a new umbrella term that includes rightwing extremism). (For comparison, the intelligence agency Asio has said its own investigations into ideologically motivated violent extremists, such as racist and nationalist violent extremists, have grown, with such investigations having “approached 50% of our onshore priority counter-terrorism caseload” last financial year.) Kershaw continued: The AFP and our partners are protecting Australians from terrorism on a number of fronts, including the concerning trend of young children occupying the attention of law enforcement agencies. Children as young as 13 years old – not even old enough to get their learners’ driver’s licence – are planning and negotiating with others online to carry out catastrophic terror attacks. Some of these youth feel isolated or do not feel like they belong, and so they retreat to the online world, looking to connect with someone, including RMVE and IMVE individuals. Labor’s Jenny McAllister has been asking officials in the energy estimates hearing whether stakeholders – such as the Australian Industry Group and the Clean Energy Council – had been consulted about the government’s long-term emissions reduction strategy. Jo Evans, a deputy secretary in the industry, science, energy and resources department, says stakeholders were consulted as part of the technology roadmap that was released in September 2020and the roadmap is at the core of the strategy. McAllister takes that as meaning no industry group has been consulted about the emissions strategy that will be taken to the Glasgow climate summit next week: This is everything we have feared about a government that is entirely addicted to secrecy. You are going to Cop with a plan that no one has seen. The chances of this passing before the election are pretty slim. As AAP reports: Children aged under 16 would need their parents’ consent to use social media platforms under a proposed online crackdown. Attorney-General Michaelia Cash on Monday released an exposure draft of new legislation to create a binding privacy code for social media services, data brokers and other large online operators. All platforms would be forced to receive parental consent for users under the age of 16. Social media companies would be required to take all reasonable steps to verify users’ age and put children’s best interests first when handling personal information. There would be tougher penalties and more enforcement powers handed to the privacy regulator. Online platforms subject to the code would need to comply with strict new privacy requirements, including new rules about children and other vulnerable groups. The code will be developed with the Australian Information Commissioner and industry. Organisations would face tougher requirements to be transparent about how personal information is handled. Senator Cash said the bill would ensure Australians’ privacy would be treated more carefully and transparently by online platforms. “We know that Australians are wary about what personal information they give over to large tech companies,” she said. “Our draft legislation means that these companies will be punished heavily if they don’t meet that standard.” Labor is yet to outline its climate policy but that hasn’t stopped Anthony Albanese from trying to keep all the focus on what the Coalition is or is not doing: The climate wars haven’t even ended within the National party. Matt Canavan has been out there opposing this target. Barnaby Joyce, apparently, was the last speaker in the room and said he was opposed to it. Now, when Scott Morrison jets off to Europe, Barnaby Joyce will be the acting prime minister of this country, someone who doesn’t support this target as Australia’s position. So, it’s very clear that the Coalition government remain divided. They remain in a state of conflict. Their negotiations aren’t about good policy. It’s all about politics, as everything that this government does. Senate estimates have begun for the energy portfolio and, if you were hoping it might shed some light on the deal for net zero, I am here to disappoint you. Senators have been quizzing the government this morning about the agreement between the Nationals and the Liberal party for a “process” to work towards a net zero by 2050 target. The department has told the hearing it’s not in a position to answer questions because the information is cabinet in confidence. Officials told Labor senator Jenny McAllister they can’t answer questions about whether they’ve been asked to provide advice about the National party’s list of demands in exchange for an agreement on a net zero target, whether the department had been asked to provide advice on a government-funded coal-fired power station, or any advice on costs. Senator Zed Seselja also told the hearing the energy and emissions reduction minister Angus Taylor had made a public interest immunity claim and would not be tabling the government’s net zero emissions modelling in the parliament. Both McAllister and the Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young asked Seselja if he knew what was in the deal the Coalition had struck. Seselja said he couldn’t comment on cabinet processes. Hanson-Young: Are you aware of what the deal consists of? I’m not asking you for the detail, I’m asking you if you even know what’s in it, mate. You don’t know what’s in it, do you? Here is some of the current deputy prime minister being as clear as coal dust about what it is the National party has actually agreed to. Net zero emissions by 2050, according to Barnaby Joyce, is apparently “a goal”. Not a target. Or even a nationally determined contribution, which is what Scott Morrison told the Liberal party room it would be. (A NDC is a commitment that says “here is what the nation will do” offered up to the international community. It doesn’t need legislation but it carries more weight than just a statement. It’s basically a handshake deal.) Here was Joyce (speaking very closely to the microphone) on ABC radio RN this morning: I said to you quite clearly, un ambiguously, I am 100% onboard with the goal to achieve net zero by 2050 because that was a decision of the National party room. I’ve also clearly stated that it was always the case as told to you, told to everyone that the process would be that no individual would make the decision and the party room would make the decision. The party room has moved decision. I abide by the party room, I am 100% onboard with the goal of net zero reaching by 2050. I can’t make it clearer than that. Except it’s not meant to be a “goal”. It’s meant to be a commitment. Meanwhile on the other side of the Coalition: No one is allowed to see the modelling the Morrison government is using in its net zero target: NSW and Victoria have reported their Covid numbers for this morning: The first round of estimates hearings is about to get under way. Today’s schedule includes finance and public administration, legal and constitutional affairs, environment and comms and rural and regional affairs. And then we get to the myth. Matt Canavan: I don’t think this is the right approach for this country. It’s a fantasy to think we can remove all carbon emissions* and normally when you pursue a fantasy it doesn’t end well because you forget about other things that are really important and I think right now what is important is securing the defence of this country and making sure we continue to have jobs post-Covid. *Net zero does not mean no emissions. At all. It means emissions are meant to be offset, not that there are no emissions. And your regular reminder Matt Canavan is an economist by trade and his only time in mines has been as a politician/for photoshoots (anyone working in a coalmine who gets that much coal dust on them needs to immediately contact OH&amp;S and report it, given the health risks we know come from breathing in the dust). Canavan: This guy is not for turning. I think this remains a bad deal for this country. Somebody in this place has got to stand up for the workers of Australia* and I’ll keep doing that because I think net zero is going to end in tears. It is going to end in higher power prices, fewer jobs for Australians and make us weaker at a time where China is being pretty aggressive in our region. I’ll keep up the fight. I had a loss yesterday. I couldn’t have fought any harder. *Yet to hear Canavan speak on the estimated 40,000 job losses in the university sector over the last couple of years, or the jobs which have been lost in the arts because of the lack of government support during the pandemic. Queensland LNP senator and former minister Matt Canavan continued his opposition to net zero emissions this morning on the Nine Network: I don’t agree with the decision. I let the room know yesterday that I will – as I say, I’ll continue to fight for special the blue-collar workers of this country. I don’t think they have much of a voice down here. The Labor party long since deserted them. I think it’s unfortunate our party is jumping onboard with this green fantasy. I know the people that support the Liberal and National parties aren’t big supporters of big government and don’t forget net zero is another word for big government telling you what to eat, what to drive, what electricity you can use. I believe people should make their own decisions and not bureaucrats from Canberra. This is the level of “debate” from people who have “big” futures in the National party. The latest Newspoll is out and AAP has taken a look at it: The latest Newspoll, published in the Australian on Monday, found Labor is leading the coalition 54 per cent to 46 per cent on a two-party preferred basis. This compares to the last poll three weeks ago when Labor was leading 53 per cent to 47 per cent. Asked about the federal government’s priorities, 47 per cent of voters polled nominated meeting targets to cut emissions while 40 per cent pointed to keeping energy prices down. When the same question on priorities was asked in February this year, the outcome was 43 per cent to 42 per cent, respectively. The poll, conducted between October 20-23, also found 35 per cent of voters believed a Labor government would be better at leading the response to climate change compared to 28 per cent for a coalition government. On the primary voting measure, support for the Coalition was at 35 per cent compared to 38 per cent for Labor. This was the worst result for the government since December 9, 2018, according to the poll conducted by YouGov. But it also found Prime Minister Scott Morrison was considered the better leader at 48 per cent, compared to 34 per cent for Labor’s Anthony Albanese. Lt General John Frewen also had an update on the third dose of the vaccine timetable this morning (he was speaking to the ABC): Booster doses for the immunocompromised have started and that’s just to bring the people up to the same level of protection that rest of us achieve through just two doses. But we’re waiting on Atagis’s advice now around boosters. We expect that the advice is imminent and we think what’s going to happen is that a booster shot will be made available from six months, from your second dose. So we’ll work the priority groups in the very first instance, aged care, disability, frontline health workers and those sorts of areas. But we think what will happen is that as people become eligible from six months, they’ll just be able to go and grab a booster shot. For an insight into the Nationals party room meeting yesterday, you can read Murph (a reminder, this small group of people are not only selling the message, they are also influential in setting policy as all three now sit in the cabinet): By the end of of a two-hour party room conversation, a majority of colleagues were in favour of the net zero transition, provided Morrison followed through on the various high-level policy undertakings. There wasn’t a formal vote in the room, but a tally was kept. Joyce acknowledged the majority position in favour when he spoke at the end of the debate. According to multiple sources, at that point the deputy prime minister also revealed his own position. Joyce told his colleagues he was not in favour of net zero. This is, of course, pretty extraordinary. What this means is the Nationals leader – Australia’s deputy prime minister – is now fronting a Nationals party room decision that he personally doesn’t agree with. It’s not just Joyce. Two other Nationals ministers – Bridget McKenzie and Keith Pitt – were also serious net zero sceptics, if not outright opponents. (Some say McKenzie was recorded as a no vote on Sunday, although recounts of her remarks to colleagues are hard to follow.) And, given that the agriculture industry is already making its own changes, I don’t know what this means: Oh good. Just a reminder that he will be acting prime minister for the week Scott Morrison is in Glasgow. Meanwhile, what’s going on with the Australian Open? Well, unvaccinated players may be able to attend, as long as they go through two weeks of hotel quarantine. Which seems to contradict this from the government last week: Asked on ABC radio on Wednesday morning whether he had a message for Djokovic, Alex Hawke reiterated that anyone entering the country must be double vaccinated. “The government in establishing its borders has said that you will need to be double vaccinated to visit Australia, that’s a universal application, not just for tennis players,” Hawke said. Asked if he could see any workaround for the Australian Open, Hawke said “not at this time”. “Our health advice is that when we open the borders everyone that comes to Australia will need to be double vaccinated.” So there is still quite a bit to play out there. But David Littleproud wants you to know that the Nationals will be honest with you at the next election: We’ll be honest with the Australian people and look them square in the eyes and tell the truth. That’s what they want out of government, not just someone who signs up to it blindly but has no plan to get there. And if that’s what the public want from the Labor party who are able to do this without any scrutiny, you’ll see a detailed plan in the next 24-48 hours from us. Whereas the other mob are pinning their hope on a few electric cars. Q: Do you support electric cars? Littleproud: Definitely. Q: So what’s wrong with supporting electric cars given that petrol-powered cars are being phase out in the next 15 years? Littleproud: I have no issue. So long as people have vehicles. The reality is that the market will decide that. You’re seeing cars move towards hybrids and many other changes in technology. So I’m agnostic to that. The reality is that I need them to work, but in my parts of the world where I have an electorate three times the size of Victoria, I just need to be able to plug them in somewhere. But the reality is that in some areas, it will be acceptable for those areas to have. So I’m not against that. But if that’s all the Labor party has, the detail of their plan will surely cost you a lot more than a few electric vehicles is the point I’m making. So what about the actual issue Cop26 will be looking at – the 2030 targets? Any shift on that? David Littleproud: That is important and we also met Kyoto. But we don’t shift the goalposts during a game of football. You keep them where they are. And the fact that we’re going to overshoot that says a lot about Australia and says a lot about what we’ve done in the last decade to achieve that. We should be proud of that. Our chins should be up and our chests out as a nation, instead of the self-loathing. We’ve done a lot of heavy lifting and what the reality is that we will overshoot it and what we’re now going to say is that as the cabinet agrees, we’ll get to a position of setting a goal to reach 2050 net zero, so the world can look at us and say that we’re fair dinkum because we’re going to squarely look them in the eyes and say this is how we get there and who pays. Except we really haven’t, as Adam Morton has been reporting for years: So do Barnaby Joyce and Keith Pitt support the deal? You can’t know. I they speak out against it, they will have to resign from the cabinet. But you’re not allowed to know their actual position. David Littleproud: I won’t tell you because what happens in our party room stays in the sanctity of that party room. That’s what we respect as National party members and I don’t intend to commentate on anyone’s position, nor my own. We all made that in the sanctity of the room and got to the position that we as a party room should support. But what sort of future can Matt Canavan have in the party, given his very, very loud objections to any sort of emissions reduction target? David Littleproud: In the National party, a big one. The culture of the National party is celebrating people who are prepared to stand for their convictions and the courage of that. Matt obviously has a differing view to the rest of the party room. And we respect that. That’s not something that we denigrate in the National party. You want that in Canberra. You want the diversity of ideas and to be prosecuted. As a National party party room, we got to a different position than Matt Canavan and he made that clear yesterday. But why can’t people know now what is in the deal which has ensured the Nationals “in-principle” support for climate policy? David Littleproud: That’s part of the cabinet process and you’re just going to have to wait another 24 hours because obviously it has to be ratified by cabinet as a cabinet document. And I could go to jail if I start talking about it and I’m sure that you done want to see that! But we worked through this as quickly as we can and when we see the roadmap and what the National party has asked for. We’ve done this in a very mature sense. We worked through this calmly and rationally as a party. And as a Coalition, and the prime minister and the treasurer have been working closely with the deputy prime minister and myself and our party room, along with Angus Taylor, to make sure that we’ve got the comfort of securing those jobs in regional Australia now and creating new jobs. And if you’re a coalminer today in the Hunter or in central Queensland, you will have a job well beyond 2030, well beyond 20 and well beyond 2050 particularly if carbon capture storage takes off*. (*Spoiler: it won’t) Nationals deputy leader David Littleproud has been the main spokesperson of the new “mature” and “reasonable” Nats. So what is in the deal? You can’t know yet. He told the ABC: Well, obviously the prime minister has been very respectful to the National party from the start saying that regional Australia wouldn’t be impacted and there would be mitigants put in place and, so long as they appear in that, the National party is onboard. And we have no reason to believe that it will be anything other than that, because it’s been a respectful process, one that we started last Sunday in seeing the detail of the technology roadmap, and now we work through that in a mature and sensible way to get to the resolution, and tonight that will be ratified and obviously, the prime minister will make those announcements, I would suspect, tomorrow morning. Well. That was quite the weekend. The Nationals are now trying to rebrand as “calm and rational” over their climate views, with the junior Coalition partner agreeing to in-principle support for a net zero emissions target by 2050. Well, most of the Nationals. Matt Canavan wants everyone to know its a bad deal. But what is the deal? No one knows. Keith Pitt is back in the cabinet, after he was booted as part of Barnaby Joyce’s return, so the Nats got another cabinet spot (and vote). Other than that – it is all secret. But it’s calm and rational. Apparently. Sarah Martin and Katharine Murphy gave up their Sunday to try to make sense of the position: The Nationals MP George Christensen, who has repeatedly threatened to shift to the crossbench, told colleagues he would now reconsider his position in the government in protest at the party’s position. Christensen attended the meeting remotely, wearing a “support coal” T-shirt. Others who spoke out strongly against the target included Matt Canavan and Wide Bay MP Llew O’Brien. The party’s Senate leader, Bridget McKenzie, also spoke against supporting the deal, and suggested Joyce could yet secure more for the party through the cabinet process. The fact remains though that Australia’s government has been turning itself inside out just to get to this point but most of the rest of the world has moved to 2030 and action this decade – something Australia is not budging on. So don’t expect this issue to go away. In fact, expect the election campaign to be bitterly fought on this point – with more scare tactics about “cost” and “plans”. Just remember that “meet and beat” is not the whole truth. On that, the environment team have spent months putting this new podcast series together – it gives you all the history and knowledge you could need to understand what has happened – and what’s ahead. We’ll bring you all of the day’s events as they unfold. Cabinet is meeting today and we have question time – as well as the first day of estimates hearings. Mike Bowers is already hard at work and we’ll get to as many committees as we can. Just follow Penny Wong’s eyebrows. Meanwhile, congratulations to NSW students, parents and carers and school staff, with remote learning now a thing of the past. I don’t think any of us who have not been directly impacted can understand what school has been like for much of the past two years and I hope today is filled with as many happy reunions as possible. And Victoria is looking at being reunited on Friday, with the 80% vaccination target about to be met, which means Melbourne and the regions will no longer be kept apart. Given how many loved ones have been separated that is just wonderful news. I understand there are still concerns – everyone can take it as slow as they like, and if you are not ready to rush out, you don’t have to. Just take it at your own pace. Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin, Daniel Hurst and Paul Karp will keep you updated on all of the politics today, with the rest of the Guardian stepping in to let you know important things happening outside of Canberra. It being a sitting week, you have Amy Remeikis on the blog until the end of the day. It is going to be a busy week – Scott Morrison is due to leave for Glasgow on Thursday, so there is a bit to get through before then.

This is less obvious than the coal smoke induced gloom that Victorians suffered. In the 1880s central London had just 17% of the winter sunshine that was measured in the countryside. This had only improved to 45% by 1916–20. However, even modern haze is still reducing sunlight in cities. Scientists find that in Delhi air pollution over the city is reducing the efficiency of solar panels by between 12% and 17%, depending on the type of photovoltaic technology. Losses are between 9% and 13% in Beijing, and around 2% in London and Los Angeles. In the worst cities air pollution could affect the viability of solar energy. It also means money – Los Angeles’ expanding solar electricity sector could be losing about $6m to $9ma year by 2020. During the 1920s medics thought that smog-induced lack of sunlight caused vitamin D deficiency and the rickets which plagued the UK’s urban poor.

However, the strategy is not as straightforward as presented. Put simply, we emit the carbon in fossil fuels into the atmosphere as excess CO2. This absorbs heat otherwise leaving the planet. A policy of planting vegetation, especially trees, that absorbs CO2 lessens this excess. So far, so, good; but we must ask what eventually happens to this vegetation? Burning it indiscriminately only puts the carbon back into the atmosphere, albeit with a time delay. So the basic criteria must include: fossil fuels remaining underground; timber becoming permanently locked up (eg, in buildings and furniture); and vegetation, including leaves and branches, being composted into soil. By the first criterion, a major aspect becomes using the vegetation to substitute for fossil fuels. The many processes are well known, including modern biomass and biofuel technology. These must expand to global scale while improving efficiency and harmlessness in use. Moreover, success in mitigating climate change demands that we in the developed world curb our excessive lifestyles. The third criterion touches on a subject that is poorly assessed. Much more vegetation should be composted into soil – for example, garden and field hedge cuttings. No field fire can be a bonfire, they are all malfires, provoking climate change. Above all, mitigating climate change by growing trees should also become a personal challenge. Our breath takes in oxygen and expels carbon dioxide; a tree does the opposite. Each of us needs one mature tree for our metabolic equilibrium. Moreover our average UK lifestyle with oxygen-consuming fuels requires 100 trees. Do you have 101 trees? If not, why not? There are many ways to invest in trees – go to it. Dr John Twidell Horninghold, Leicestershire • Damian Carrington hails new research revealing that “a worldwide planting programme could remove two-thirds of all the emissions that have been pumped into the atmosphere by human activities”. The analysis found there are 1.7bn hectares of treeless land on which 1.2tn native tree saplings would naturally grow. That area is about 11% of all land and equivalent to the size of the US and China combined. Unfortunately that area also rivals the extent of the bright polar sea ice, whose loss to global warming threatens to amplify climate change by decreasing the Earth’s “albedo” – its average capacity to reflect solar energy back into space. Just as the deep blue sea is darker than polar ice, green forests tend to absorb roughly twice as much solar heat as the generally paler ground they overshadow. Geoengineering is where you find it, and humanity’s impact on albedo – we have already physically altered half of the land surface of the Earth – deserves as much thought as managing our carbon footprint. Russell Seitz Senior research fellow, The Climate Institute • As a local climate action group that has planted over a quarter of a million trees over the past 21 years, we welcome the acknowledgement that tree-planting can play a significant role in tackling the climate crisis. However, it is (literally) important to keep our feet on the ground. First, the total projected cost of $300bn is based on a price per tree of 24p – we can’t even buy trees for that, let alone do the necessary fencing and protection to keep animals away from them as they grow, and cover other planting costs. Second, Prof Simon Lewis’s point about soils is a vital one. The map of the UK showing potential planting areas appears to envisage trees being planted on blanket bogs. These peat bogs are Britain’s most significant habitat type due to their global rarity and carbon storage (far in excess of our woodlands). Tree-planting on these areas would be totally counterproductive. Third, planetary-scale landscape plans may look good on paper, but they are unlikely to come to fruition without involving local people, and huge cultural change. Realistic (and non-bureaucratic) incentives to cover the true costs of increasing tree-cover will be necessary, but they will not be a quick fix. So, yes to trees, but not at the expense of urgent measures to cut carbon dioxide emissions. The government currently spends £2.5bn on export subsidies for UK companies’ fossil fuel projects abroad. Reallocating this funding to clean energy and reforestation would be the place to start. Penny Eastwood Treesponsibility, Climate Action in Calderdale • Your editorial (6 July) makes a crucial point in connection with reforestation and the preservation of existing forests, that “the green movement is not just about economics. It must also speak to our spiritual sides if it is to mobilise a global coalition”. We face the threat of possible climate breakdown and ecosystem collapse, and the reality is that neither the corporate world nor the governmental world are going to initiate decisive action against their own short-term interests, defined in terms of growth and electability. One way to achieve the critical mass needed to drive significant change in human behaviour is to mobilise the world’s largest voluntary organisations – the religions. Grounded in moral and ethical principles, they claim an “anthropocosmic” perspective; they have vast human and material resources, and billions of positively motivated and socially committed followers around the globe with whom they are in ongoing communication. What the religions really need, however, especially those in the western world with declining active memberships, is a compelling cause to help regain the interest and involvement of a younger generation. A compelling cause? That’s exactly what the ecology and environmental movements offer – the opportunity to care for what the religions think of as “God’s creation”. On the other hand, what ecologists really need is the sheer weight of numbers that religions can provide – the millions of supportive activists required to put pressure on the corporate and governmental worlds, to force them to listen, face facts, and act with urgency. The ecologists and the religions really do need each other.

That is the question the Scottish barrister Polly Higgins found herself asking 15 years ago; a question that led her to abandon her courtroom career and embark on a quest to establish an international crime of ecocide. Such a crime would render persons of superior responsibility (such as company chief executives and government ministers) liable to prosecution for causing or contributing to large-scale ecosystem destruction. Polly, who has died aged 50 of cancer, had begun to see the climate activist movement take up her call in the weeks before her death, with Extinction Rebellion actions demanding that ecocide law be established around the world. Polly’s early research revealed that the Rome statute, the governing document of the international criminal court (ICC), had originally included an atrocity crime of ecocide, but that it had been dropped at the final drafting stage. Determined to see this “missing” crime reinstated alongside genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and crimes of aggression, she submitted a proposal to the UN Law Commission in 2010 that defined ecocide as “extensive loss, damage to or destruction of ecosystems of a given territory, such that peaceful enjoyment by the inhabitants has been or will be severely diminished”. This led to a mock ecocide trial at the UK supreme court in 2011 (Michael Mansfield prosecuting), which demonstrated the legal viability of such a crime and brought Polly to international attention. Polly’s first book, Eradicating Ecocide: Laws and Governance to Prevent the Destruction of Our Planet (2010), won the 2010-11 People’s Book prize and set out her full proposal, while her second book, Earth Is Our Business (2012), included a draft Ecocide Act and indictments that had been used in the mock trial. She became a sought-after speaker and delivered the 50th anniversary Rachel Carson Memorial Lecture in 2012, in London and in the Netherlands. She was named one of the world’s top 10 visionary thinkers by the Ecologist magazine, and a 2015 documentary featuring her work, Advocate for the Earth, was produced by the Dutch broadcaster VPRO. Polly discovered over time that big NGOs and grant-giving bodies were reluctant to support her proposal, perceiving it as too high-risk or too controversial; and that governments in wealthy developed nations were too enmeshed with polluting industry to consider taking it forward. She therefore shifted her attention to small climate-vulnerable states with the biggest incentive to propose an ecocide amendment to the Rome statute, and in 2017 founded a trust fund to enable her legal team to assist those states in doing so. Polly attended the annual meetings of the ICC’s management oversight and legislative body (the Assembly of State Parties to the Rome Statute) for four consecutive years – with increasing visibility and amid growing interest from Pacific island states. Among these were Vanuatu, whose foreign affairs minister, Ralph Regenvanu, publicly acknowledged Polly’s work in December 2018 after global climate change talks failed to result in the support his islands were looking for in the face of climate breakdown. During the 2018 assembly, Polly’s team launched an “independent preliminary examination into climate ecocide” to look at whether the CEO of Royal Dutch Shell, Ben van Beurden, and the CEO of Shell Nederlands, Marjan van Loon, could be prosecuted for ecocide, if such a crime is ever put in place. Since then the team has been preparing a test case file for submission to the ICC, to discover whether prosecutions for climate ecocide can in any case be investigated under existing legal provisions. Born in Glasgow to Nicholas Higgins, a dentist, and his wife, Monica (nee McGarvey), an artist, Polly was the eldest of three children. Showing a strong awareness of injustice from an early age, she was excluded from her art class at St Aloysius, a private Jesuit school in Glasgow, at 16 for punching the teacher. She went on to achieve a degree in cultural history from Aberdeen University, a diploma in semiology from Utrecht University in the Netherlands, and a postgraduate degree in fine and decorative arts from Glasgow University before moving to London, where she worked for an art gallery and later set up a catering business to fund her way through bar school. She was called to the English bar in 1998 and gained a pupillage at the chambers of Baroness (Patricia) Scotland. She was subsequently offered a tenancy at Bridewell Chambers in London, where she met Ian Lawrie, now a judge, whom she married in 2002. After quitting court advocacy she became co-founder of a solar energy company, Desertec, before devoting herself full-time to ecocide law in 2010. She is survived by Ian, by her mother, her brother, Nicholas, and her sister, Monica. • Pauline Helène (Polly) Higgins, barrister and climate change activist, born 4 July 1968; died 21 April 2019"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/aug/31/low-cost-printable-solar-panels-offer-ray-of-hope-amid-energy-gridlock","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-08-31T03:01:45Z","webTitle":"Low-cost, printable solar panels offer ray of hope amid energy gridlock","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/aug/31/low-cost-printable-solar-panels-offer-ray-of-hope-amid-energy-gridlock","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/aug/31/low-cost-printable-solar-panels-offer-ray-of-hope-amid-energy-gridlock","fields":{"headline":"Low-cost, printable solar panels offer ray of hope amid energy gridlock","bodyText":"An Australian physicist is leading a push to pioneer a new type of low-cost solar energy he believes could make signing up for energy accounts as straightforward as taking up a mobile phone plan. In May last year, the University of Newcastle professor Paul Dastoor used organic printed solar cells to power screens and displays at an exhibition in Melbourne. Less than one millimetre thick and held down with double-sided sticky tape, the panels are similar in texture to a potato chip packet and can be produced for less than $10 per square metre. Dastoor has been working on the technology for more than a decade, but has now begun a 200 square-metre installation – the first commercial application of its kind in Australia and possibly the world. “The low cost and speed at which this technology can be deployed is exciting as we need to find solutions, and quickly, to reduce demand on base-load power – a renewed concern as we approach another summer here in Australia,” he said. And as Canberra is again gripped by energy policy inertia, he said the commercial pilot was an example of industry and academia “just getting on with things”. “If we reflect on where we’ve come from in the last decade and what we’ve seen in the last couple of weeks in Canberra, one of the things this project highlights is that universities and industry are coming together to just to get on with things and that’s exciting.” The printed solar technology is not as efficient as the silicon-based one, and degrades much faster. But Dastoor believes its low production and installation costs would make it competitive. “The point of this technology is that if you look at it in terms of raw efficiency numbers, it’s much lower than typical silicon cells [and] it doesn’t last as long but actually those aren’t the important numbers,” he said. “The question is how much does the energy cost? These materials are so cheap to make, manufacture and install that when you calculate the total cost of energy when manufacturing at scale, it’s going to give you a competitive product.” Dastoor said it would be easy for companies to sell energy “plans” for consumers to sign up in the same way they do with mobile phones. The commercial installation was completed in a day by five employees, and a lab-size printer can produce hundreds of metres of the product in one day. “The caveat to that is I’m obviously not sure exactly how the commercial reality will manifest, but if I was going to guess I would say that this technology is one that does not last an extremely long time [but] is also likely to improve rapidly,” he said. “Both of those factors are similar with what we faced with mobile phones [so] I think it points to a model where you will simply have all of that done for you – it will be some sort of plan with constant upgrade and replacement. “The cost to produce it is so low and to roll out another set of solar cells is going to be extremely easy. I think over time our current picture of how we view solar energy and cells is going to fundamentally change.” The pilot installation is due to last six months, and is the final stop before the technology becomes more widely available in the next few years."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2016/dec/27/solar-energy-and-rethinking-geothermal-arenas-hits-and-misses","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-12-27T05:17:32Z","webTitle":"Solar energy and rethinking geothermal: Arena's hits and misses","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/dec/27/solar-energy-and-rethinking-geothermal-arenas-hits-and-misses","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2016/dec/27/solar-energy-and-rethinking-geothermal-arenas-hits-and-misses","fields":{"headline":"Solar energy and rethinking geothermal: Arena's hits and misses","bodyText":"As any punter will know, backing winners isn’t easy. There’s a little bit of science, a little bit of art and a whole lot of luck. Australia’s independent renewable energy agency came into being in 2012 though an act of parliament, with a $2.5bn, 10-year mission to improve the affordability of renewable energy and increase its supply in Australia. It hasn’t been smooth sailing; this year Arena was facing a $1.3bn budget cut but this was commuted to a smaller but still significant $500m. Six years on it has spent nearly $100m wholly or partly funding more than 60 projects across the renewable energy portfolio, from solar to geothermal to wind to hybrid. Its chief executive, Ivor Frischknecht, says it’s not so much about picking winners as working to generate market interest in the area. But with a rapidly expanding range of technologies and innovations arising to meet the demand for a truly sustainable energy supply, the agency and its expert advisory boards have had to make a lot of tough decisions. Some have paid off handsomely. Others have not. Improving the efficiency of solar photovoltaic cells How do you make solar photovoltaic cells cheaper without compromising their quality and efficiency? It’s the holy grail question of solar photovoltaic development, prompting researchers at the University of New South Wales and industry partners Suntech R&amp;D Australia to investigate how to mass produce high quality solar cells that maintain their performance for as long as possible. “The silicon wafer is by far the biggest cost of making a solar cell so it’s important that the cost of the silicon wafer gets reduced,” says Prof Stuart Wenham, chief investigator on the project and director of the UNSW’s Centre of Excellence for Advanced Photovoltaics and Photonics. “But the problem for reducing the cost of the silicon wafer is the fact that it reduces the quality.” With $4.4m from Arena, the researchers not only achieved a new world record for efficiency of the most commonly used commercial silicon wafer, but have subsequently developed a method to further improve efficiency. Hydrogenation is new technology that uses hydrogen atoms to chemically neutralise impurities within the silicon, thus improving its purity and performance. The technology can be incorporated into existing solar cell manufacturing processes and is now commercially available, with interest coming from around the world. Co-locating solar and wind Wind turbines and solar farms both require large amounts of space. A country the size of Australia has an abundance of land, wind and sun but there is the potential to combine all three of these. Arena commissioned a report, which was published in October, to identify areas for brownfield development – retrofitting solar farms at existing windfarms – or greenfield projects, where a site for both wind and solar could be developed. The report’s authors, Aecom, found that co-location was not only viable across a range of sites but could achieve significant cost savings in connection equipment, installation, operation, maintenance and development. Since then, Arena has invested nearly $10m in Australia’s first large co-located wind and solar farm in the southern highlands of NSW. The plan is to install 10MW of solar photovoltaic power generation alongside the existing 165.5MW Gullen Range windfarm. Integrating solar energy into mining operations Mining operations in Australia tend to be remote and therefore far from the electricity grid. As a result, many are powered by diesel, which is not only costly but produces significant greenhouse gas emissions. Rio Tinto’s bauxite mining operation in Weipa in remote Queensland has now built the first stage of a 6.7MW photovoltaic solar farm, with $11.3m of assistance from Arena. The 18,000 photovoltaic panels are already generating up to 1.7MW of power, meeting 20% of the local township’s electricity demand and saving as much as 600,000 litres of diesel each year. A spokesman for Arena says the project has created a precedent for the mining industry by demonstrating solar photovoltaic is a viable option for powering off-grid locations such as mines. The next stage – worth an additional $7.8m from Arena – will see the solar farm’s potential output increase to 6.7MW, and the provision of batteries for storage. Rethinking geothermal energy Australia is one of the least volcanically active continents on Earth so, when it comes to generating electricity from geothermal energy, it was always going to be a more challenging prospect than for countries such as Iceland or New Zealand. When Arena was formed, it inherited a $32m commitment to what was hoped to be Australia’s first demonstration of geothermal energy generation. Unfortunately the hot rocks of the Cooper Basin in South Australia proved harder to economically tap into and, after six years, the company formerly known as Geodynamics has sealed the wells and got out of geothermal altogether, rebranding as ReNu Energy and turning its focus to biogas, solar, battery solutions and hybrid. It’s not the end of geothermal in Australia, at least from Arena’s point of view. It has since commissioned an international report into the viability of geothermal energy generation in Australia and granted $450,000 to the University of Adelaide’s South Australian centre for geothermal energy research to develop a map that will help identify areas where drilling is more likely to hit geothermal paydirt. Converting old coal-fired power plants into solar As coal-fired power plants are decommissioned, many are looking at ways to reuse some or all of the infrastructures left behind. In 2013 Arena provided $2.15m to a conglomerate interested in exploring a life after coal for the 180MW Collinsville power station in Queensland. The idea was to rebirth the plant as a 30MW hybrid solar thermal and gas-powered plant. But the feasibility study found while there were no significant technical challenges to the conversion, the construction and operating costs were high enough that it could not be made economically viable. Ratch-Australia, which owns the plant, has now revised its plans and is moving towards building a 42MW solar farm around the station, making as much use of the building infrastructure as possible."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"world/2019/oct/21/monday-briefing-labours-11th-hour-bid-to-scupper-brexit-deal","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2019-10-21T05:22:23Z","webTitle":"Monday briefing: Labour's 11th-hour bid to scupper Brexit deal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/21/monday-briefing-labours-11th-hour-bid-to-scupper-brexit-deal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2019/oct/21/monday-briefing-labours-11th-hour-bid-to-scupper-brexit-deal","fields":{"headline":"Monday briefing: Labour's 11th-hour bid to scupper Brexit deal","bodyText":"Top story: Critical day in Commons as PM tries to push through deal Good morning and welcome to this Monday briefing with Alison Rourke. After a weekend that promised more Brexit action than it delivered, many in Westminster and beyond will be hoping that the coming days provide more clarity. Today the PM is expected to try to win parliamentary backing for his deal in a straight yes or no vote in the Commons, in the hope that MPs will sign off on the withdrawal agreement before there is the chance to scrutinise the full legislation and attach amendments. But Labour has another plan: overnight it declared that it would seek the backing of rebel Tories and the DUP for amendments that would force Johnson to drop the deal – or accept a softer Brexit. Some of what happens today will hinge on whether the Speaker, John Bercow, will allow another “meaningful vote”, because Johnson tried and failed to get it done on Saturday. No 10 will resist any amendments to the Brexit legislation, arguing that the current offer from the EU is the only one on the table and that “wrecking amendments” could torpedo the fragile coalition that it is trying to assemble for a deal. Our guide to what next for Brexit sets out the potential paths ahead. The PM claims he has the numbers to get his way, including all of his 287 voting MPs (including his brother Jo), about 20 former Tories who left the party or had the whip suspended, and about eight Labour MPs. You can read the papers’ opposing stances on Brexit here, but it’s a brave person who would predict with any certainty exactly what may happen over the next few days. * * * Air pollution – Scores of people are being rushed to hospital for emergency treatment on days of high pollution in cities across England, including for heart attacks and strokes. Data from the King’s College London study, to be published in full next month, shows the extra strain on the NHS on those days, including 120 more cardiac arrests, 230 more strokes and 200 more people needing asthma treatment. “It’s clear that the climate emergency is in fact also a health emergency,” said the NHS chief executive, Simon Stevens. Previous studies have found spikes in hospital admissions and GP visits on days of high pollution, but the new data gives precise numbers for nine English cities and shows a clear relationship between heart attacks, strokes and respiratory illnesses and dirty air. * * * Christmas recycling – John Lewis and Waitrose are to stop selling crackers containing plastic toys and puzzles as part of a drive to reduce single-use plastics – but not until 2020. Today they will announce a switch to recyclable materials such as metal and paper. John Lewis has also joined the wider crackdown on glitter (some of which contain microplastics) by reducing the amount used to decorate its own-brand range of Christmas wrapping paper, gift bags and tags, advent calendars and crackers by two-thirds. * * * Northern Ireland abortion rights protest –Members of mothballed Stormont assembly are due to return to the chamber today for the first time in almost three years to protest against the extension of abortion rights to Northern Ireland. The DUP and other anti-abortion members will stage what is expected to be a largely symbolic recall of the assembly. The region’s near-blanket ban on abortion is due to end at midnight tonight after a historic vote in the House of Commons last July to bring Northern Ireland into line with the rest of the UK. * * * Renewable expansion – Global supplies of renewable electricity are growing faster than expected and could expand by 50% in the next five years, powered by a resurgence in solar energy. The International Energy Agency has found solar, wind and hydropower projects are rolling out at their fastest rate in four years. Its latest report predicts that by 2024 the world’s solar capacity could have grown by 600GW, almost double the installed total electricity capacity of Japan. The cost of solar power is also expected to decline by a further 15% by 2024. * * * ‘Don’t be a dick’ – Hillary Clinton has been trolling Donald Trump, tweeting a mocked-up letter from John F Kennedy to Nikita Khrushchev, which was intended to ridicule a real letter from Trump to the Turkish leader, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, revealed publicly last week. “Found in the archives,” Clinton wrote, over an image of what purported to be a letter from the US president to the Soviet leader on 16 October 1962, during the Cuban missile crisis. “Dear Premier Khrushchev,” the “letter” began, “Don’t be a dick, OK? Get your missiles out of Cuba … if you don’t everyone will be like ‘what an asshole’ and call your garbage country ‘The Soviet Bunion’”. Trump’s letter to Erdoğan, in which he urged the authoritarian Turkish president who has invaded northern Syria “Don’t be a tough guy. Don’t be a fool!”, met with widespread disbelief, not least for its strikingly unpresidential tone. Today in Focus podcast: How did a town in West Virginia become the opioid capital of the US?

Lunchtime read: Lenny Henry: ‘I wish somebody had taught me how to defend myself’ Lenny Henry’s childhood was defined by racist abuse and his mother’s violence. But his new autobiography, Who am I, Again? is also about bearing witness to the time of his early years in Dudley. “I grew up in a period where, just down the road in Smethwick, a Tory politician got in with the slogan ‘If you want a nigger for a neighbour vote Labour’,” he tells Lanre Bakare, referring to Peter Griffiths’s notorious 1964 election win for the Conservatives. The book ranges from his infancy to until he was a few years into his nascent career. It ends before his marriage to fellow comedian Dawn French in 1984. To write it, Henry opened up a “pandora’s box” of memories and then started, as he puts it, “to vomit out the chapters”. He turned violence at home into a live performance that would eventually help him to buy his mother (who died in 1998) a home. He used his comedy to ward off bellicose bullies and honed his short impressions sets in sometimes hostile working men’s clubs. At 61, and arguably Britain’s best known comic, Henry continues to push back against racism: “When, in 100 years’ time, we look back at the way things change, we’ll go: ‘Wow, that was a snap of a finger.’ But when you’re in the middle of it, change is long. And I think that’s the problem. Things aren’t happening fast enough.” Sport Wales refused to buckle under intense pressure in their Rugby World Cup win over France, which bodes well for their next outing against South Africa, who ended Japan’s campaign after grinding down the host nation in the other quarter-final.

Business The former governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn King, has warned the world economy is sleeping walking into a new financial crisis that will have devastating consequences for the democratic market system. Lord King, who was in charge at Threadneedle Street during the near-death of the global banking system and deep economic slump a decade ago, said the resistance to new thinking meant a repeat of the chaos of the 2008-09 period was looming. Giving a lecture in Washington at the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund, King said there had been no fundamental questioning of the ideas that led to the crisis of a decade ago. “Another economic and financial crisis would be devastating to the legitimacy of a democratic market system,” he said. “By sticking to the new orthodoxy of monetary policy and pretending that we have made the banking system safe, we are sleepwalking towards that crisis.” Continuing uncertainty over Brexit has pushed the pound down from a five-month high against the dollar and the euro. It’s buying $1.291 and €1.157. The papers The papers almost all focus on the prospect of a new vote on the prime minister’s Brexit deal today. The FT reports that things are looking fairly sunny for the prime minister: “Johnson sticks to Brexit deal as faith rises in Westminster victory”. The Guardian reports: “Labour seeks new alliance to kill off PM’s Brexit deal”, the i has: “Labour to back deal ... if second referendum included”. Other papers are livid at Labour’s talk of amendments, like the Daily Mail, which reports on “Fury at Labour plot to wreck Brexit”. The Express channels some of this fury: “How dare they! New plot to hijack Brexit”. The Times reports: “Downing St says Labour is trying to stop Brexit”, and the Telegraph says “PM faces ‘guerrilla war’ over new vote on deal”. The Sun’s lead story is “Bad blood brothers”, about comments made by Prince Harry that he and his brother are “on different paths” and the Mirror leads on an investigation into working conditions at Amazon’s biggest UK warehouse: “Treated like slaves”.

Labor said on Tuesday its national hydrogen plan would “supercharge” Australia’s renewable energy industry and create thousands of regional blue-collar jobs, particularly in Queensland. Under the proposal, a Labor government would allocate $1bn in funding from the Clean Energy Finance Corporation for clean hydrogen development and invest up to $90m from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency for research, demonstration and pre-commercial deployment of hydrogen technologies. It would also establish a $10m Arena funding round for hydrogen refuelling infrastructure and set up a hydrogen “innovation hub” in Gladstone with an initial investment of $3m. Labor said that the direct investment from the policy was focused on the production of hydrogen gas using renewable energy, but the platform did include regulatory reforms and infrastructure investment that could assist hydrogen production from non-renewable sources. Arena is restricted from supporting non-renewables technology and the legislation for the CEFC prevents it from investing in carbon capture and storage. “Developing a hydrogen industry will deliver new opportunities for manufacturing, transport and electricity generation,” Shorten said in a joint statement with other Labor ministers. “As the global demand for hydrogen surges to an expected $215bn market by 2022, Australia is uniquely placed to benefit from the development of this new, job-generating industry.” Hydrogen gas can be made from water, coal or natural gas. While the definitions vary, generally “green” or clean hydrogen is made from water through electrolysis using electricity from renewable energy. “Blue” hydrogen is made from natural gas and “brown” hydrogen is made from coal. Both blue and brown hydrogen production usually uses electricity from fossil fuels and, for this to be zero-carbon, the process must use carbon capture and storage to offset the resulting greenhouse gases. Some of the proposed regulatory reforms from Labor would support the use of existing gas pipelines for hydrogen, support the shipping of hydrogen, and the storage of CO2 from blue and brown hydrogen production. Richie Merzian, the climate and energy program director at the Australia Institute, said the CEFC was well placed to support clean hydrogen development and that hydrogen made using water and renewable energy was “a rare and opportune industry for Australia to transition its energy exports”. But he said it would “be disappointing if any proposed support for the new industry would go to hydrogen made using gas or coal, on the basis of businesses making dubious promises to capture and bury resulting greenhouse gases”. “Australia Institute research has shown the federal government has committed over $1.3bn to carbon capture and storage and has nothing to show for it, with most projects failing,” he said. “Solar, wind and hydro energy should be powering the hydrogen industry and we see no role for coal with carbon capture and storage.” The Australian Conservation Foundation said a $1.1bn commitment to the industry was “a win for the environment, regional communities and job creation so long as it backed by renewable power”. “Australia has an enormous opportunity to export our virtually limitless wind and solar energy to power-hungry neighbours, particularly across the Asia-Pacific region, through green hydrogen,” said Suzanne Harter, the ACF’s climate change campaigner. She said Australia had some of the best clean energy sources in the world and the cost of producing hydrogen with renewables had fallen dramatically in recent years. “But in a world where we must urgently stop climate pollution to limit the damage from global warming, only hydrogen produced from clean energy sources, not polluting coal and gas, is acceptable,” Harter said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/aug/15/hugh-synge-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-08-15T16:38:51Z","webTitle":"Hugh Synge obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/aug/15/hugh-synge-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/aug/15/hugh-synge-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Hugh Synge obituary","bodyText":"The botanist Hugh Synge, who has died of cancer aged 67, was a roving ambassador for wild plants. In 2007, he was voted one of the 20 most influential British conservationists by BBC Wildlife magazine. While on the staff of the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew in the 1970s, he helped to compile the first Red Data Book of plants. Published in 1979, co-edited with Gren Lucas, this was a landmark publication that assembled for the first time detailed case histories of plant species to explain why so many of them were vanishing. In 1982 Hugh was invited to design and develop a joint plant conservation programme for the Swiss-based International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and the then World Wildlife Fund (WWF). He drew up plans that included the creation of the umbrella body now known as the Botanic Gardens Conservation International, a global network linking the world’s botanic gardens, as well as a partnership with the World Health Organisation on the conservation of medicinal plants. With the Danish botanist Ole Hamann, he led the implementation of the programme until 1989. At the same time, he was hired by the European commission to help draft the botanical sections of the EU Habitats Directive, which aims to conserve a wide range of species and their natural habitats. Although his approach was multinational, Hugh felt that for Britain to be an influence overseas, it needed to set an example at home. He was one of the founders of Britain’s premier wild plant charity, Plantlife, which works to raise the profile of plants, to celebrate their beauty and to protect their future, and oversaw the steps that led to its launch in 1990. In that year, Hugh became a freelance consultant. With John Akeroyd, he co-founded the magazine Plant Talk which sought to publicise plants and their conservation throughout the world. As its editor, Hugh needed to reinvent himself, mastering the arts of electronic typesetting and page layout, while also coaxing the world’s best botanists to give of their best for minimal pay. Plant Talk ran successfully for 11 years and 44 quarterly issues. Early in his freelance career, Hugh had taken a master’s degree in business administration, and in 2006 decided to put his ideals into practice by setting up Soltrac, a solar energy power company. He also set up and chaired Nadder Community Energy, a project close to his heart, in which solar energy income was used to assist his home village of Tisbury, Wiltshire, and surrounding villages. Hugh was born in Woking, Surrey, the elder son of Margaret (nee Chenevix-Trench) and Patrick Synge. Botany was always likely to be his chosen career: his father was a well-known botanical writer and plant-hunter, and the long-term editor of the Journal of the Royal Horticultural Society. Literary ability ran in the family, too; his father’s cousin was JM Synge, the Anglo-Irish poet and playwright. Hugh was educated at Rugby school (not an experience he enjoyed) and graduated with a BSc in horticulture at Wye College, a London University instituion that was based in Kent, from where he joined the herbarium at Kew as a volunteer. His knowledge of plants was extensive, and he was a keen gardener and horticulturist. Like his father, he specialised in rare lilies, which he managed to cultivate on the unyielding clay soil of his Wiltshire home. Hugh was hard-working, imbued with a quiet charm, reserved, fastidious, and with a careful, concise delivery. He set and expected high standards. He had persistence, allied to a stubborn streak, and an equally necessary sense of optimism. He was at the centre of a web of contacts from around the world, and had many associates and friends, though perhaps few close ones. Akeroyd, with whom he collaborated on botanical projects over nearly 40 years, felt he was a difficult person to know well. Hugh is survived by his younger brother, Robert. • Arthur Hugh Millington Synge, botanist and conservationist, born 4 August 1951; died 4 August 2018"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2019/apr/10/research-impact-award-winner-and-runners-up","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2019-04-10T21:00:07Z","webTitle":"Research impact: award winner and runners-up","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/apr/10/research-impact-award-winner-and-runners-up","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2019/apr/10/research-impact-award-winner-and-runners-up","fields":{"headline":"Research impact: award winner and runners-up","bodyText":"Winner: University of Manchester Project: Our Migration Story Our Migration Story is a website presenting the untold stories of the migrants who have shaped Britain. Launched in 2016, it was set up to meet demand from pupils for more diverse histories, and to support new GCSEs on migration to Britain developed by the OCR and AQA exam boards. The website is divided into four time periods, from AD43 and the Roman invasion of Britain, to Polish migration after 2004. In each section, images, quotations, videos, Parliamentary reports, poems and extracts from novels and newspapers, as well as academic commentary, tell the stories of individuals and groups who have come to Britain as migrants and explain their influence on the country. Take the story of Dadabhai Naoroji, who, in 1892, became the first Indian to be elected to Parliament in Britain. His story is illustrated on the site with a Punch cartoon in which he features as Othello, and links to other resources including an article about his portrait on the Art in Parliament site, and a BBC programme from 2009 on Britain’s first non-white MPs. Most case studies include questions and classroom activities for teachers to use, as well as booklists and links to other websites and organisations. A separate part of the site is dedicated to teaching resources, with advice on how to teach migration, suggested lesson plans and further links. Funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council, the website was developed by academics from the universities of Manchester and Cambridge, together with race equality thinktank the Runnymede Trust, and draws on work from more than 60 historians. Teachers and teacher training organisations, including Teach First and the Institute of Education, have helped refine the site and raise its profile, responding to demands from young people seeking to “decolonise” the curriculum. Since its launch, it has had more than 112,000 users – 53% (60,000) from the UK and 47% (52,000) from across the world, including the United States, India, Australia, Canada, Germany, France, Italy, the Philippines and Ireland. In January 2018 it was awarded the Royal Historical Society’s online resources public history prize. Runner-up: Heriot-Watt University Project: Scorres Heriot-Watt University led a consortium of businesses and researchers in developing an irrigation system for small farmers that reduces water and energy use while improving crop yield and saving money. Smart Control of Rural Renewable Energy and Storage (Scorres), which has been trialled in the Tamil Nadu region of southern India, relies on localised weather forecasts and farming knowledge combined with solar energy storage and machine learning to create a precisely targeted irrigation system that farmers can control by mobile phone. Researchers from Heriot-Watt teamed up with Findhorn College in north-east Scotland, Scottish social enterprise company Scene, AI business Auraventi, and Auroville Consulting, an ecology consultancy and unit of the non-profit Auroville Foundation, to develop the system, funded by Innovate UK. First, they held workshops with farmers in Tamil Nadu to find out what their needs were. Then they began to design a system that incorporated local knowledge about the weather, plants and soil quality to predict how much water different crops needed to maximise growth. Using this knowledge, they drew up an irrigation schedule that ensured crops would receive exactly the right amount of water at the time it was needed, and that farmers could control remotely. Within 14 months, one of the trial farms in Tamil Nadu reported that its water use had been reduced by 76%. Energy demand was down up to 70% because using less water meant using less energy to pump it, and crop yield was up by 70%. The nutritional value of the crops also appeared to have improved because fewer nutrients had been leached from the soil by overwatering. Scorres is now being installed in 12 more farms in India, and farms in China are also interested. The team is taking steps to commercialise the system, which should be made available for around £1,000. This would allow small farms to be able to afford a smart irrigation system for the first time, potentially transforming – or even securing – the future of agriculture in some areas. Runner-up: University of Exeter Project: Revolutionising diabetes testing Around 3.8 million people have been diagnosed with diabetes in the UK, and this number is expected to grow to more than five million by 2025, according to the charity Diabetes UK. Around 90% have type 2 diabetes and around 8% have type 1 diabetes (the other 2% have rarer forms of the disease). But it is difficult for doctors to distinguish between the two. This matters, because treatments for each form of the disease are very different. While patients with type 1 need lifelong insulin injections, most people with type 2 can be treated with tablets. Researchers at the University of Exeter have developed a simple test to check whether a patient has been diagnosed correctly. The test relies on measuring levels of C-peptide, produced at the same time and in the same quantities as insulin, which regulates blood sugar. By measuring C-peptide levels, doctors can tell how much insulin the person is producing, even if they are taking insulin injections. Previously, urine tests for C-peptide were not available in the UK or Europe and blood testing for C-peptide was expensive, complicated and rarely used for diabetes patients. The Exeter team devised new, simpler and cheaper ways of conducting the tests, which made it possible to conduct them routinely in outpatient clinics for as little as £10. The team also showed how testing for C-peptide can help identify exactly what subtype of diabetes an individual patient has, and which treatments will be most effective. This includes identifying genetic forms of diabetes, which has implications not only for the way the patients themselves are treated, but also for their families. As a result of the research, all patients in Edinburgh and Glasgow with insulin-treated diabetes are now tested for C-peptide to ensure they have been diagnosed correctly. Doctors in Edinburgh found that of 720 patients they tested nearly 14% had been incorrectly diagnosed, which led to many having their treatment changed and some stopping insulin therapy altogether."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2022/apr/21/australia-politics-live-disability-federal-election-scott-morrison-anthony-albanese-coalition-labor-nsw-qld-victoria-covid","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-21T10:17:37Z","webTitle":"Sharma labels Deves’s comments on trans people ‘reprehensible’ – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2022/apr/21/australia-politics-live-disability-federal-election-scott-morrison-anthony-albanese-coalition-labor-nsw-qld-victoria-covid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2022/apr/21/australia-politics-live-disability-federal-election-scott-morrison-anthony-albanese-coalition-labor-nsw-qld-victoria-covid","fields":{"headline":"Sharma labels Deves’s comments on trans people ‘reprehensible’ – as it happened","bodyText":"Just as the day was winding down came the news that Labor leader Anthony Albanese has tested positive for Covid. He’ll isolate at home in Sydney for seven days, and we’ll have to wait and see what impact that has on the campaign. In other news: Prime minister Scott Morrison apologised if anyone took offence at him saying he was “blessed” to have children without disabilities. Those comments aside, families are being left without the help they need from the NDIS. The ongoing saga of Liberal candidate for Wentworth, Katherine Deves, continued, with news attorney general Michaelia Cash rejected changes aimed at excluding transgender people from single-sex sport. A Nationals candidate is under fire for telling her congregation she wants to “bring God’s kingdom” to politics. The fallout continued over the security deal between Solomon Islands and China, with questions over what Australia could have done. Catch up on the day in politics and what the leaders got up to with the Campaign catchup and the daily election briefing. And more extreme weather is on the way for Queensland. See you back here tomorrow, where Amy Remeikis and the politics team will keep you in the loop on all the campaign twists and turns. Katharine Murphy on Labor leader Anthony Albanese’s Covid positive plot twist: The former senator and veteran Labor man Doug Cameron making his thoughts clear: Fingers crossed the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, didn’t pass it on (by all accounts, his team was being as Covid-safe as possible): James Massola, the national affairs editor at the Age and Sydney Morning Herald, had a preview of Labor’s just-in-case-of-Covid plan: Swift response from the Greens leader, Adam Bandt: The foreign minister, Marise Payne, has been on Sky News, where host Tom Connell asks her about the possibility of China building a military base on Solomon Islands, after the countries signed a security agreement. She says prime minister Manasseh Sogavare has assured her it would not be permitted. “He’s been unequivocal about that,” she said. That said, (she said): Of course we are dealing with this deeply concerning decision very seriously. Asked if the Australian government had any responsibility for that decision, she said: Ultimately it’s a sovereign decision. That is their right and decision to make but we’ve been explicitly clear and in a respectful way ... we think it is not a constructive approach to regional security. The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, has issued this statement: Following a routine PCR test this afternoon ahead of interstate travel to Western Australia, I have returned a positive result for Covid this evening. I have been testing regularly as part of my election campaign duties. I will be isolating at home in Sydney for the next 7 days and will continue to follow health guidelines and advice. While at home I will continue my responsibilities as alternative prime minister and will be fighting for a better future for all Australians. I am grateful to know that I will have access to the world’s best health care if I need it, because of Medicare. I am feeling fine so far – and thank everyone for their well wishes. Thousands of applications for grants to support communities devastated by floods in the New South Wales northern rivers and western Sydney have not been processed, while thousands of others have been rejected. Read the story here: That ratio of tests to positive cases is pretty intense*: * It’s not as straightforward as saying most tests are now coming back positive, because negative Rats aren’t recorded. Neither are false negative Rats. Still interesting numbers... Read Ben Smee’s story below about the Nationals candidate Kimberly Hone. The deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, has come out to say he stands by Hone. The ABC reports that when asked about her comments, Joyce said: You can say what you like in this country, because people have fought and died for it. If you don’t agree with someone’s views that’s also your right. “Well done, Australia,” says the electoral commissioner, Tom Rogers, confirming 96.8% of eligible Australians have enrolled to vote: With many nations around the world campaigning to get even three-quarters of their population enrolled to vote, this result is a continuing source of Australian democratic pride. The roll has increased in pure number terms by 804,652 since the previous federal election in 2019, a rise of 4.9%. Labor leader Anthony Albanese’s day, including some more genius from his advance team – does that stand for “better off overall test”? AAP were there: Action man Scott Morrison had his eyes on the prizes today on the campaign trail. AAP captured some great shots: Blessed be. Prime minister Scott Morrison has apologised for saying he was “blessed” not to have children with disabilities. But the story doesn’t end there. Jane Lee and Katharine Murphy discuss the future of the NDIS in today’s Campaign catchup: Like any good valet, Josh Butler is here to make your life easier. He’s pulled together today’s highlights – from doggos and a Judo flip to the NDIS and pork barrelling – in today’s campaign briefing: For Darumbal woman Aunty Sally Vea Vea, the handover is a “settling” after past atrocities: They treated killing us like a sport. The prime minister’s office has been ordered to process a two-year-old freedom of information request from Labor for documents relating to the Angus Taylor/City of Sydney scandal. In October 2019, Labor’s Mark Butler sought documents from the PMO related to the scandal over altered documents the energy and emission reductions minister’s office used to suggested City of Sydney had spent over $15m on travel – claiming the council’s travel outstripped the carbon impact of travel of federal ministers – when in reality the figure was just over $200,000. Butler sought from the PMO communications and documents relating to the scandal, including talking points, emails, text messages, and encrypted communications between the PM, PMO, Taylor and Taylor’s office. PMO refused the request on the grounds it would take too much time and divert attention from the work of the PMO. However after a two-year appeal to the office of the information commissioner, the PMO has now been ordered to process the request. It is the third ruling of its kind from the OAIC in the past few weeks, with Guardian Australia winning a similar ruling for texts between Scott Morrison and his friend and prominent QAnon conspiracy theorist Tim Stewart. The PMO has also been ordered to process a request for text messages related to Barnaby Joyce’s time as drought envoy. In refusing the requests, there was a consistent theme from the PMO that the processing of the requests would take too much time for the office and the prime minister considering how busy the office and the PM are, but in each instance that claim was rejected. The acting freedom of information commissioner Elizabeth Hampton said in this ruling that she was not convinced the gravity of the work of the prime minister’s office was enough to exempt the whole office from FOI: While the prime minister has significant responsibilities as the head of government, official documents held by the prime minister can be requested under the FOI Act, which carries an obligation to devote part of the resources of the office to this task. The PMO’s submissions regarding ‘most’ FOI requests requiring the FOI coordinator’s specialist attention are not persuasive. All three orders will require decisions released before the election. The PMO has not responded to questions on whether it will comply with the OAIC ruling. Back to the Wentworth debate – Sharma and Spender are getting some curly questions from the good burghers of Wentworth, including on why Sharma hasn’t pushed back more on the rightwing sentiment of the Liberals and why Spender is “splitting the moderate vote” by not running for a different seat. Sharma defends his record, taking credit for being “one of the people” that pushed for more renewable energy support, crossing the floor against his own party on the religious discrimination bill, and pushing for more ambitious climate targets (even though, as Spender pointed out, the Liberals still have “Tony Abbott’s targets” of a 26-28% emissions reduction by 2030). “Those are the sort of things I can do, but I’m also part of a team,” Sharma said: I’ve argued in the past and I’ll continue to do that, but more ambitious interim targets ... I’ll continue to argue that. Sharma and Spender were both asked if they had solar panels on their house or electric cars. They both said they didn’t have solar panels (Sharma said he lived in a terrace house, which made it impossible) and Spender said she had a hybrid car. Paterson is having a crack at Labor’s foreign affairs spokeswoman, Penny Wong, and Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, for criticising the government’s failure to somehow prevent the deal going ahead. He says he doesn’t know if they’ve had security briefings on the matter, and that they were “irresponsibly canvassing very sensitive matters”. Liberal senator James Paterson is talking about that deal between Solomon Islands and China (he’s also chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security). He’s on the ABC, and host Greg Jennett asks him when he knew about the deal. He says he was only aware when it became public, but that he had been aware before that of China’s intentions in the region. He says: We have known for some time it’s the ambition of China to expand its presence in the region ... it did not come as a surprise and we did learn about the agreement as it became public. There’s no doubt it’s a very serious challenge to our regional security. We got experts to watch and analyse United Australia Party’s campaign ad so you don’t have to (unless you want to, like 15 million other people): The press release for this didn’t mention the NRL in the all-caps header (DOLPHINS RECEIVE $15 MILLION FOR NEW COMMUNITY FACILITY) and I pictured the cheeky mammals frolicking in a nice playground under the sea: Back at the Wentworth debate, Sharma has called the comments of Liberal Warringah candidate Katherine Deves on trans people “reprehensible”: [They] should be condemned and they should be withdrawn, and I’m glad she has withdrawn those. The Wentworth MP also said he didn’t back the “save women’s sport” bill from Liberal senator Claire Chandler, and wouldn’t support it if it came to a vote. Earlier, the PM, Scott Morrison, said he had contacted Deves to “encourage her” today, saying her advocacy to prevent trans women playing in female sports “finds a lot of resonance with Australians who just want common sense to apply”. Sky News is broadcasting a debate between the Liberal’s Wentworth MP Dave Sharma and independent Allegra Spender. The very first question is on which party Spender would support in the event of a hung parliament (which, after recent opinion polls, is looking a little more likely). Spender said she was “open to work with either side of government”, saying she would “be legislating and voting on the basis of what’s important to this community”. Sky host Kieran Gilbert pointed out there had never been a Labor member for Wentworth, and that Labor’s policies were closer than the Coalition to Spender’s own policies – Spender said she would work “issue by issue” in the event of a hung parliament. But Sharma hit back, demanding Spender declare before the election who she may support: I think you’re being dishonest with them ... you owe it to the public. We have [policies], you can sit down and decide which one you’d like to support. The Anzac Day dawn service in Sydney is expected to attract 10,000 people, AAP reports. It’s the first in two years with no Covid restrictions. NSW veterans’ affairs minister David Elliott said it was also the first since the 80th anniversary of the bombing of Darwin, 80 years since the Kokoda campaign, 50 years since the withdrawal from Vietnam, and the first since Australian troops withdrew from Afghanistan. Elliott said: A lot of the contemporary veterans are feeling a bit vulnerable as a result of the situation of Afghanistan. I would expect that you may see an increased number of younger veterans and their families. Climate change discussion has been conspicuously hushed so far this campaign. Adam Morton is here to turn up the heat, with the latest Temperature Check: About that crash we mentioned earlier: Australia needs a clear policy on climate change if it wants to rebuild its relationship with Solomon Islands, retired admiral Chris Barrie said on Thursday. Speaking to reporters following a conference on fuel security, Barrie said Australia was “kidding ourselves” about its relationship with its Pacific neighbour. Barrie said: We have to stump up and be a good friend of countries in the Pacific like the Solomon Islands. That means a change to climate policy, to be honest. Because they look at what we do in climate change and say, ‘where are you? When we’re facing the loss of our country, the loss of our identity, the loss of our culture, you call this part of the family? I’m sorry, it doesn’t work.’ Solomon Islands’ government signed a new security pact with China on Wednesday in what has been called the “worst Australian foreign policy failure” since the second world war. Barrie described the moment as a “failure of Australian government policy” and pointed to the appointment of former politicians to diplomatic postings, rather than trained diplomats, as a contributing factor. Also speaking at the conference was the independent MP Zali Steggall and Allegra Spender, a Sydney-based businesswoman running as an independent in the seat of Wentworth. Steggall said the issue of fuel security was “incredibly important” in the wake of geopolitical conflicts in Ukraine and “even here in our backyard in the Pacific” but accused the government of “fake net zero commitments”. She said: We know the government is absolutely doubling down and locking in reliance on oil and gas. We have only a handful of days’ supply and we are incredibly exposed – over 90% of our fuel is imported. The one way we can achieve [fuel security] is by electrifying our fuel and our transport. We can do that because we are the most abundant continent in the world when it comes to solar and wind. Steggall said she would work to legislate a plan to reduce emissions by 60% by 2030 in the new parliament: We’re talking a lot about cost of living in this election, but let’s be frank. Cost of living is immediately impacted by global warming events. Food, fuel, insurance costs, disruption to business, all of these are impacted by events like what we’ve seen with the floods on the east coast. Action on climate change is not a ‘nice to have’. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, has also been in Bennelong today with the Liberal candidate for the electorate, Simon Kennedy. Ah, Bennelong. The Liberal MP and tennis legend John Alexander is putting away his balls (that’s a tennis reference) after more than a decade representing the seat. It’s been considered fairly safe Liberal territory since Alexander won it from Labor’s Maxine McKew in 2010. McKew famously lifted the seat from former prime minister John Howard in 2007. How do I know all this? I started with our excellent seat explorer: I wonder if the advance team deliberately had Labor leader Anthony Albanese walk past signs saying Rats, vaccines, and boosters available: Luke Henriques-Gomes has gone beyond the headlines about prime minister Scott Morrison’s “blessed” reaction to Catherine, whose son Ethan is autistic, to look at systemic failings in the NDIS: I love a good graph, until they scare me: Thanks, Amy Remeikis, and thanks all in advance for gentle treatment. I had the 2am wake-in-frights that I’d inadvertently swapped “Albanese” and “Morrison” somewhere along the way. Did not feel blessed. Tory Shepherd is going to lead you through the late afternoon and evening. Be gentle – she is still recovering from last night’s debate coverage. Make sure you check back for updates and stories from the Guardian crew. I’ll be back early tomorrow morning – please, take care of you. Just back on the NZ prime minister – she is in Japan at the moment, where New Zealand is being honoured with a live musical performance featuring dancing kiwi fruit. Anne Ruston told Sky News the government has accepted the aged care royal commission recommendation to have “nursing care” in all aged care homes, 24 hours a day, seven days a week but just needed to work out a “realistic” timeline to make it happen so the health system could handle it. But that is not the government’s policy. It hasn’t accepted the “24/7” recommendation for registered nurses. What’s the difference? RNs can do things not all nursing staff can, including administering pain medications. Ruston also said there was a 2024 timeline in the royal commission: But there’s not. Then there is this point: Jacinda Ardern has spoken on the China-Solomon Islands security pact, as Eva Corlett and Daniel Hurst report: Jacinda Ardern, the New Zealand prime minister, has spoken of Beijing’s “growing assertiveness” in the Pacific region as she challenged the motive for a security pact between Solomon Islands and Beijing. Australia, New Zealand and the US are concerned the Solomons pact could allow China to establish a military base within 2,000km of Australia’s east coast. The text permits China to “make ship visits to, carry out logistical replenishment in, and have stopover and transition in Solomon Islands”. Speaking to the BBC, Ardern said: “One of the reasons we’ve expressed this disappointment [is] … Australia and New Zealand both have heeded the call of the Solomons for support during recent disruption. “And we’ve again highlighted that should any extended need exist, we are there to help and support. What gap remains that requires such an agreement with China?” Queensland police say the car that crashed into Terri Butler’s office lost control, and that it was not a “targeted incident”. Police have been able to review CCTV footage nearby and believe the car was speeding and overcorrected on Old Cleveland Road at Greenslopes. The male driver lost control and crashed into Butler’s electorate office. He then drove off. Police are still looking for the vehicle. That contradicts what Scott Morrison said yesterday: Well, first of all, I’d say this. The prime minister of Solomon Islands has made it very clear that they are not accepting of any base in the Solomon Islands. They are not. So that is a false claim that there’s no basis to make that assertion. It’s not there. That would be the first point that I would make. Today, Morrison was a little more Dutton-leaning in his assessment. Here are some of the ‘blunt’ comments Peter Dutton, the defence minister made on China on Sydney radio 2GB the prime minister mentioned in his earlier press conference: I don’t think there’s any sugarcoating the reality of China’s actions, not just in the Indo-Pacific, but around the world. I mean, they’ve got this Belt and Road Initiative. It’s all about militarising ports across the world so that they can have a military presence. And I’m not going to pretend to your listeners that we are not coming into what I think are dangerous times. And the intelligence indicates that China’s own words and actions prove that. And we should be very conscious of it. We’ve seen this deal between Russia and China now. And China operates in a very different world. Leaving the Solomon Islands aside for one moment, you know, they go in with bags of cash. I mean, they don’t operate by the same rules that we do. They go into countries, they buy people off, and Australia doesn’t do that. And we can’t compete in that circumstance. In the case of the Solomon Islands, guarantees have been given. I don’t think they’re worth much, but they’ve been given that they won’t set up a military port. But that’s exactly what happened in the South China Sea. Where you know, assurances were given by president Xi to ... to president Obama at the time that there wouldn’t be a military presence. Well, there are now 20 islands with runways and military buildings on within the South China Sea. And that is what we are dealing with. So when we say that we’re coming into a dangerous time, [we’re] not making that up, that’s exactly what is happening. Queensland police are searching for the driver of a vehicle that crashed into the Brisbane office of the Labor MP Terri Butler then drove off this afternoon. There is no indication yet as to whether the incident was an accident. No one was hurt. Butler’s office is on a main road in the suburb of Greenslopes. Terri Butler says police are on the scene and the condition and whereabouts of the driver remains unknown: On the subject of debates: Ben Smee will have more detail on this very soon It’s been the morning after the night before. Scott Morrison for much of this morning has been battling criticism about his observation in last night’s leader’s debate that he and wife Jenny had been “blessed” to have two children without special needs. During a morning radio interview with Ray Hadley, Morrison dug in, arguing his observation was meant empathetically and in good faith. But later at his press conference on the hustings, the prime minister apologised for his choice of words, telling journalists he understood how the comment may have been hurtful. Morrison referenced a conversation this morning with Dylan Alcott, the Australian of the Year and high-profile disability advocate. Alcott had been critical of Morrison’s formulation this morning, noting people with disabilities just wanted equality, choice and control. Alcott noted he felt “blessed” to be disabled. With a campaign fire now running, Morrison flopped down full-body to douse the flames. Morrison is also fighting controversy on another front. Rather than be blamed for Solomon Islands signing a new security deal with China, the prime minister wants to train attention on what he contends is Labor’s record on being soft on China. We’re in the process of examining that particular contention in more depth, but suffice to say, the prime minister was rebuked by Canberra’s national security establishment (including the Asio chief, Mike Burgess) only a couple of weeks back for claiming differences that weren’t actually there. When that point was put to Morrison this morning, the PM said something along the lines of we run the government, not public servants. Before I go, there was one more point of interest from this morning’s press conference. Morrison was in the Queensland seat of Longman this morning. That’s one of Labor’s targeted seats in the 2022 campaign. The impression I’ve picked up over the past few days from strategists is Labor currently isn’t that hopeful of switching that particular seat to their column on election day. But Morrison was pretty direct this morning – he indicated Labor’s scare campaign contending that pensioners will be put on the cashless debit card had some legs in the seat. Longman has a lot of retirees. The prime minister suggested he was in Longman to combat the lies. This bit of sandbagging is interesting. If you want to read more on Labor’s scare campaign, here’s a fact check from Paul Karp earlier this week. As Paul says, the Coalition at one point left this idea open. But the government has since ruled out this change for pensioners, repeatedly and comprehensively. No wiggle room. Here are the latest coronavirus numbers from around Australia today, as the country records at least 50 deaths from Covid-19: ACT Deaths: 1 Cases: 1,265 In hospital: 61 (with 3 people in ICU) NSW Deaths: 16 Cases: 17,447 In hospital: 1,641 (with 69 people in ICU) Northern Territory Deaths: 1 Cases: 655 In hospital: 49 (with 1 person in ICU) Queensland Deaths: 15 Cases: 9,281 In hospital: 578 (with 17 people in ICU) South Australia Deaths: 3 Cases: 4,079 In hospital: 241 (with 11 people in ICU) Tasmania Deaths: 1 Cases: 1,468 In hospital: 58 (with 1 person in ICU) Victoria Deaths: 11 Cases: 10,674 In hospital: 444 (with 35 people in ICU) Western Australia Deaths: 2 Cases: 9,314 In hospital: 248 (with 9 people in ICU) Reconciliation Australia has released a list of election demands of all major parties, which it says will need the next parliament to be “brave and ambitious” about making change. In a “‘roadmap for reconciliation” released today, it calls for the next government to: Introduce legislation setting out support, a timeframe, and process, for a referendum to achieve a constitutionally enshrined Voice to Parliament. Work with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations, to appropriately fund and meet the targets of the national agreement on closing the gap. Support truth-telling including investment in research to uncover the untold, and under-told, parts of our shared history. Recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander histories with memorialisation, renaming electorates and other public places. Strengthen the national curriculum to better include Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander histories and cultures. Fund an “anti-racism framework” to guide actions by government, NGOs, business, police and the community. Appoint a national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children’s commissioner to help reduce the numbers of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in out of home care. Strengthen cultural heritage protection through funding and engaging in a co-design process with the First Nations Heritage Protection Alliance and other First Nations stakeholders, and acting on the outcomes of that process to make necessary policy. Karen Mundine, the CEO of Reconciliation Australia says: We know that almost 90% of the Australian community support formal truth-telling processes, and the majority of Australians want more to be done by government to close the gaps in health, justice and employment. The public is on board and our work shows it wants governments to step up too. Australians are looking for leadership and greater ambition on reconciliation. Whichever party forms government, it needs to be brave and ambitious when it comes to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs. We ask the incoming government and all parties represented in the next parliament to be brave. Make change. The View from Murph will be with you very soon Q: Last night more voters in the room picked Anthony Albanese over you, a quarter remained undecided after [the hour long debate]. What does that say about your chances after last week’s campaign gaffes from Anthony Albanese, and ... if you don’t win, will you stand down as Liberal leader? Scott Morrison: What it says is ... there are 4.5 weeks left in the election and Australians are looking carefully. Many of them haven’t made up their mind. And they will be making up their mind over the next four and a half weeks. What they know is what they don’t know about Anthony Albanese. What they don’t know about his plan. What they don’t know about his experience on national security. And on economics. What they do know is what they do know about our government. The Liberals and the Nationals ... keeping Australians safe, keeping our economy strong because a strong economy means a strong future. Thanks very much, everyone. He doesn’t address whether he would stay on as leader. It was a fairly abrupt end to the press conference. Q: On Dom Perrottet [and texts]? Scott Morrison: Happy to touch on that. When I spoke to some close colleagues on the weekend, they asked me whether Dom had been contact and I simply said he had. I didn’t share any text messages. I said he had been in contact. That wasn’t released to anybody. Q: How did- You’re the journalist, you talk to people who talk to people who talk to people. He did not and neither did I. They [the messages] haven’t been [leaked]. All that people know is the premier was in touch with me and indicated his support for the decision that we had made and that’s the truth. It was on the front page of the Daily Telegraph by his own words. I am in regular text contact with leaders all around the world ... and I continue to be, and I will always be, because it’s an important part of my job to ensure I remain in regular contact and as a result, when it comes to my relationship with Dom Perrottet we work closely together. We’re creating jobs in NSW and here we are doing the same in Queensland and that’s what today’s announcement has been about to ensure we can do that. Q: A hundred million dollars has gone in community funds to marginal electorates since the budget. How can that be described as anything other than pork-barrelling? Also, Dominic Perrottet has been the latest person whose private text messages to you have made the front pages. Why should foreign leaders trust you that you won’t release their private text messages? Scott Morrison: I’ll give you a good example [on grants]. Today you’re with me in Caboolture. We announced the program for the regional telecommunications dealing with periurban areas. More than half of the seats that benefited from the program were Labor seats, not Coalition seats. The majority were actually Labor seats. So I just don’t buy it. What elections are, we go to the public, and like in Caboolture today, there we were with seniors who can only get one bar on their mobile phone or only 3G, and they need some additional mobile towers. So they raised that with Terry [Young], their local member, Terry raised it with us, and they expect us to do something about it. That’s what elections are. People expect the government to deal with issues on the ground in their communities. Whether it happens to be facilities or services, health services or education services, support for important manufacturing jobs, we’re talk about them right here, additional jobs right here in the electorate of Bonnar. These are important things that need to be done. We respond to those, we are telling people very plainly – the Labor party are making their commitments in their places that they wish to make commitments, I make no criticism of that. But people know what they can vote for. And what they could work for with me and my team, sitting here with Angus and Ross here in Bonner, is they can vote for a strong economy. They can work for a team that has produced a strong economy in one of the toughest challenges we have ever faced, or they can vote for an opposition. And he spoke a lot last night, Mr Albanese, he spoke about how Labor were the party of big reforms – I make the point it’s always the Liberals are Nationals that have to work how how to pay for them – he spoke about the big reforms and talked about Bob Hawke. As you know, during the Hawke Keating-government, no, [Albanese] wasn’t an economic advisor to the Hawke Keating advisor. He was an electorate officer for Tom Uren. What he wasn’t doing that he was at Labor conferences denouncing the Hawke-Keating government, conference after conference, I supported the Hawke government more than Anthony Albanese did, John Howard supported the Hawke government more than Anthony Albanese did. So he’s no Bob Hawke. He is not even a Kevin Rudd. And I can assure you not John Howard. Over the last three years, he has sought to make a virtue not of being a big ideas man, but a no ideas man, because he wanted to be a small target. So here we are just before the election ... he’s madly scrambling around, he has no plan, it’s a choice between a government you do know and ... an opposition you don’t. Australians are making the choice because it’s a choice. Q: On Katherine Deves, you said you don’t want her to be cancelled or silenced. My understanding is that she wants to speak out and would like to correct the record but it’s actually your campaign stopping her from speaking out. Will you let her speak in front of the media and if not, why not? Scott Morrison: Katherine is campaigning and I’ve been in contact with her today to encourage her. Katherine is passionate about the issue of women and girls in sport and I think the position she has set out on the issue is one that I think finds a lot of resonance with Australians who just want common sense to apply in the situation and for it not to be turned into a broader debate about other issues which I think distract from the main point, which is women and girls in sport, and ensuring that that debate can be had sensitively and properly. Q: On Solomon Islands you said ... you know a bit about national security. Earlier this year when you and other ministers made similar comments about China, the head of Asio said politicising national security is, quote, “not helpful”. Why did you repeat that comment when our national security agencies are saying it’s not helpful, it’s doing Australia disservice? Scott Morrison: When you’re prime minister you run a government. Public servants don’t run the government. Prime ministers and the ministers run governments. And I chair the National Security Committee for a very long period of time as prime minister and have served on it in a number of capacities. What’s important, particularly when we deal with issues that have been risen in an election campaign right now and challenges were being made about the government’s handling of a particular issue, then I think it’s perfectly reasonable for me to set out that when the Labor party has had to choose between taking a position in support of the government on matters of national interest, be it with our coercion that we faced from China because we’ve had foreign interference rules or we have said no on foreign investment sessions, or we’ve called out on major public health issues, then I would have expected in bipartisanship on national security that there would be a common view. But there wasn’t. There was criticism. Bipartisanship, I don’t think should be set at a low bar. We set a very high bar when it comes to national security. If the Labor party wants to aspire to that, then I think they have to lift their game. Q: Do you support Emma McKeon’s comments today that she won’t compete with trans women and you consider yourself a supporter of women’s sport? Scott Morrison: Yes and yes. Q: Following on from that, would you be comfortable about your daughters competing against transgender people? Would you feel comfortable about your daughter competing against transgender people in sport? Morrison: Sports will make their decisions but my preference is for girls to play girls, for women to play women, boys to play boys, men to play men. I don’t think this is a terribly remarkable statement. I think it’s common sense. For those who are trans, I want them to participate in sport as well. I want them to have opportunities for inclusion in sport and every Australian to be treated with dignity. But we also have to have common sense here so whether it’s Emma, or anyone else who has made comments about this in support, and as Katherine who has been a champion of these, Katherine Deves [says], it’s a common sense position which I think Australians understand. They want it to be dealt with sensitively and respectfully and so do I. But it’s a pretty straightforward common sense position which I think Australians agree with. That answer continues: To the other point, I meant no offence by what I said last night but I accept that it has caused offence to people and I have been in contact today and I apologised directly to Dylan Alcott about that. I think people would also appreciate that I would have had no such intention of suggesting that anything other than every child is a blessing is true. Every single child is precious. And a blessing to every parent. I don’t think that’s in dispute and I don’t think anyone would seriously think that I had intent of anything different to that. What I was seeking to do when talking to Catherine about her son, Ethan, last night and I had the opportunity to talk to Catherine after the debate last night, took her details, [the department will be in touch] about her particular case, Catherine certainly didn’t convey to me that she had taken it in that way. But I can appreciate particularly in some of the ways it was communicated, and the way it was sought to be represented by our political opponents in the mill of an election, that it could have been taken in a different context and I’m deeply sorry about that. The points that Dylan Alcott [made] are right. It’s about equality and it’s about access and it’s about being able to live life on the same terms as everyone else. That’s what the National Disability Insurance Scheme is all about. I it’s a very important scheme. I know Labor things it’s a very important scheme. It’s a very difficult scheme to run. There are challenges in running a scheme of that scale which is now bigger than Medicare. And every single individual’s case is different. Every single case is different. I was simply trying to make the point last night – and I’ve often referred to my own children’s as a blessing, we were 14 years in the waiting to have our children – but my point is I wasn’t trying to imply that I could first-hand understand the challenges people face in those situations. I was seeking to respect the challenges they face. Not the opposite. I would hope that people would accept that at face value and I deeply apologise for any offence it caused. Q: You didn’t answer the question on when you found out about the potential deal between China and Solomon Islands because at the moment Zed Sesejla is saying the Government found out when the draft was leaked. Second that, will you apologise for comments made last night: Labor is says you should apologise for the comments regarding the NDIS story? Scott Morrison: I am pleased to address that issue and I’ve had a chat with Dylan Alcott about those issues today. Going back to the other issue, what I was saying is [I won’t go into] specific details of an agreement ... I won’t go to those specifics as it goes into issues of national security so I won’t do that. No, what I’m telling you, no, I’m sorry, I knew about national security. I’ve been on the national security committee for eight years. Anthony Albanese, I think he was on it for less than three months. So I know a bit about these issues and what you can and can’t say about national security issues. What I have said very plainly is we have always been aware of the risk of an agreement like this. We’ve been aware of the Chinese seeking to obtain an agreement like this, as they have in Papua New Guinea and other countries in the Pacific, as they have done in African countries. And we know what they’ve done in those countries, as we have seen them do things in Sri Lanka and places like that. We have said how the Chinese operate in developing countries and how they seek to gain favour in those countries. They don’t play by the same rules as transparent liberal democracies like Australia and the United States and Japan and India, the United Kingdom and France and other countries like that. They play by different rules so that makes our job difficult. These are sovereign nations making their own decisions. Q: A number of retirees we spoke to at that retirement village said they are worried about the pension cut. It is clear your message it is just a Labor lie is not cutting through. What can you do now? Will you go into it, launch a counterattack and maybe letterbox some pamphlets of your own, will you complain to big tech? What do you do now? Scott Morrison: That’s why I was in Caboolture and I welcome opportunities to present right here, and my members are doing the same thing around the country: Labour are telling a despicable lie to pensioners seeking to frighten them to vote for the Labor party. We are not extending the cash list debit card to pensioners, we are not forcing that on pensioners. That is an absolute lie. What I found interesting in talking to those pensioners this morning is they remember back in 2016 when Bill Shorten said we were going to privatise Medicare. He put it on a big bus! And it was a blatant and awful life. Medicare has only got stronger under our government. Not weaker. I’ll tell you why, because a stronger economy means a stronger Medicare and this election is about having a stronger economy under the Liberals and Nationals, or a weaker economy under Labor who can’t manage money and can’t run a strong economy. That is the message that I think is well understood particularly by older Australians who know that you have to work hard, you have to save, that you have to look after your finances if you want to achieve the things in life you want to achieve and they understand for governments, it’s no different, and they understand Labor can’t manage money. Q: If they [Labor] are critical of you, they say they are on China’s side. If they are critical of anything your government does in the space, you say, well, you must be on China’s side. Is that your argument? Scott Morrison: Let me put it to you: do you think the relationship with China and the fact that they have imposed trade coercion on Australia because we put in place foreign interference laws, that we put in place tougher foreign investment laws, that we call them out on issues like the pandemic, do you think that was Australia’s fault or was it China’s fault? ... You put the question. I am simply saying ... that when we have taken decisions in the national interest, and when we have stood up for Australia and on the right thing for Australia, the Labor party has joined the chorus of other countries attacking Australia. And that is just a fact. That answer continues: Now we had a good discussion about this issue last night as you would have seen. I made a couple of points and Mr Albanese took some offence to what I said to him last night, but let’s just look at the record. When our relationship with China started to descend, and when China was putting in place trade blocs on Australian products, wine and barley and various things like that, they said that was Australia’s fault, not China’s fault. When I called out China for where the pandemic started and said there had to be an independent investigation into the origins of Covid, apparently this was the wrong thing for us to do. Labor said that Australia was at fault in calling for that, and our government was at fault for doing that. When I cancelled a submarine contract for $90bn because it wasn’t the right submarine for Australia, and I can assure you there is no easy way to cancel a $90bn submarine contract with a friend such as France, but when France attacked Australia over that decision, they didn’t side with Australia, they sided with the French government. And more recently now we have China seeking to influence through their means, which Peter was a bit more expressive about today. Did they blame China for doing that, or do they use it as an opportunity to attack the government? So when I look at that record, on each occasion have they backed the Australian government in standing up for Australia? Why have they run the talking points, have they run the lines of those who are seeking to criticise Australia for the important decisions that we have taken in our national interest? That is why I made the claim I did last night because it is backed up by a Labor party who has played politics with national security, despite their claims to the contrary. Question time at the Scott Morrison presser: Q: You said the Solomon Islands and China deal was not a surprise. Zed Sesejla said he found out when the draft leaked. So when exactly did the government find out that this was a sealed deal? Scott Morrison: We have known for some time the risk of a deal such as this coming about. This is why the first place I went to after the last election was the Solomon Islands. And I spoke to the prime minister there on that occasion about the threats that China presented to the region, and we discussed those issues back on that occasion, and there has been an ongoing dialogue over that entire time. And so we have been addressing those issues over a long period of time, that is why we further doubled down – I mentioned last night in the debate – the $39m financing investment we put in place for the transmission project. It is why we did the undersea cable, it is why we are the single largest provider of overseas development assistance to the Solomon Islands. It is why we continue to lift our investment right across the Pacific, because what has emerged as a result of this issue in the Solomon Islands as it has been able to further elevate the awareness of other Pacific Islanders who are also very concerned about this, just as Australia and New Zealand is, and as prime minister Arden said today – we have discussed this many times – this is a matter we are looking forward to discussing as part of the Pacific Islands forum. The threat of this has been around for a long time and I can’t go into all the details as to how Australia is able to know the specific information, as they are security matters, but what I do know is we have always been very conscious of that threat of China being able to influence a nation in our region, and you know, Peter Dutton I thought put it pretty well today. China, they don’t play by the same rules as liberal, transparent democracy. This is a secret deal, and the arrangements that are there are not public. And, you know, Peter may have put it a bit more bluntly this morning, but he makes the right point, that we are dealing with an autocratic nation that is not playing by the normal rules on how they seek to influence other nations in our region, and other nations in our region I can assure you are very aware of that. While we wait for Angus Taylor to stop speaking, here is an update on ACT’s covid restrictions, via AAP: On the eve of Covid-19 isolation rules being ditched for household contacts of people with the virus in NSW and Victoria, the ACT is expected to follow suit. The seven-day home quarantine for household contacts will be scrapped in NSW at 6pm on Friday and 11.59pm in Victoria. Close contacts will have to undertake daily rapid antigen tests, wear masks indoors and work from home where possible. They will also have to notify their employers and avoid high-risk environments like hospitals and aged care settings. The ACT health minister, Rachel Stephen-Smith, has indicated the nation’s capital will make a similar announcement on Thursday. “The ACT government is keen to ensure that ACT public health directions are consistent with settings in NSW and Victoria to the greatest extent possible, taking account of our local circumstances,” she told the ABC. The prime minister is in Brisbane, with Angus Taylor, talking manufacturing and how he doesn’t think the opposition understands “that we make things in Australia”. But not cars. AAP has an update on business confidence: The strong rebound in confidence among small businesses seen in late 2021 proved short-lived as the impact of the Omicron Covid-19 variant and rising costs took their toll. National Australia Bank’s small and medium enterprise business survey for the March quarter showed its confidence index dropped six points to nine index points, softening across firms of all sizes. The SME business conditions index also eased, down five points at six points. “Unfortunately, conditions remained very weak for SMEs in the hospitality sector, which has continued to face disruptions from the pandemic,” said NAB’s chief economist, Alan Oster. “SMEs in the property and construction sectors also saw conditions slip in the quarter, which could reflect a range of factors impacting the property market, including Omicron as well as slowing house price growth.” Costs also remained elevated with labour and materials availability continuing to be a constraint for a large share of firms. Scott Morrison will hold his press conference very soon. Given Scott Morrison people may not have heard what he actually said last night, here is the video: Given the Coalition has had the steerage of the NDIS for the past nine years or so, and the complaints about funding being cut, and plans being re-done without consultation with those the plans are for/families/carers and the government is funding lawyers to argue against AAT rulings, this doesn’t seem to be the defence some government MPs think it is. It hasn’t come up in the campaign as much as it should, but the cost of living is really biting. Australia’s major food relief groups have come together to ask for more attention from the Coalition and the Labor parties, given the stress on their services: Australia’s national food relief sector has come together to ensure those experiencing hardship are not forgotten in the lead-up to the Federal election and beyond. Foodbank, OzHarvest and SecondBite are calling on all sides of politics to deliver improved food relief funding and tax incentives to help reduce food waste and feed more people. The three charitable organisations work towards the common goals of eradicating hunger and halving food waste by 2030. They act as a vital frontline safeguard in times of individual and community adversity, whether prompted by disasters such as the recent floods, global pandemic and Black Summer bushfires, or everyday poverty and inequality. Together, the organisations are providing food relief to more than a million people per month across Australia, distributing more than 85 million kilograms of food and groceries in the 2021 financial year. Yet despite these record volumes, the current community need is not being met, and Federal Government funding for the food relief sector is not confirmed beyond next financial year. Ahead of the Federal election, Foodbank, OzHarvest and SecondBite are seeking three key commitments from all the parties and independents to ensure vulnerable people have consistent and reliable access to food: 1. Sustained and adequate funding for food relief 2. The establishment of dedicated disaster preparedness and emergency food relief programs 3. The introduction of a national food waste tax incentive, making it easier for the food sector to redirect its surplus for food relief We stan Joesphine’s concern for the climate. It’s the Reserve Bank (an independent statutory body) which sets the cash rate, which interest rates are based on. But this graph shows how governments are considered to have that power. Scott Morrison should be holding his press conference very soon. He is in Queensland, in the electorate of Longman (which is held by the LNP). Labor is targeting it, but is unlikely to see a win there. The leaders’ debate on Sky News Australia on Wednesday night had 175,000 viewers nationally, according to ratings figures from OzTAM. The Sky News People’s Forum was the most watched program on subscription TV last night where it beat Gogglebox (111,000) and Paul Murray Live (85,000). The Morrison v Albanese contest had a bigger audience than the Friday night contest in 2019 between Morrison and then Labor leader Bill Shorten (95,000), according to analysis by TV Tonight. However, the last free-to-air debates on Seven and the ABC in 2019 drew 550,000+ and 600,000 respectively. The OzTAM figures do not include those who watched it via a free livestream on skynews.com.au and news.com.au, or those who watched through the Flash news subscription service. SBS on Demand also produced a Mandarin and Arabic version and the program was broadcast on free-to-air TV via Sky News Regional. The highest-rating program on free-to-air on Wednesday night was Seven’s The Voice (629,000 metro viewers). The Mad as Hell season finale on the ABC won its slot with 401,000. Our New Zealand friends are seeing inflation take off, with March quarter headline CPI coming in at 6.9%. The reading will be watched by a few on this side of the Tasman not least because we are also a smallish open economy, largely at the whim of global markets. The consensus CPI expectation, according to the ANZ bank, was 7.1%. (Might be a bit mean but we do wonder how many people form the “consensus” given the NZ economy is a lot tinier than, say, Victoria or NSW’s economy.) Of interest to Australians will be what’s been rising in price, not least because we get the first-quarter CPI result on 27 April. The RBA minutes this week said they expect a figure of “above 3%”, which wasn’t very insightful as inflation was already running at 3.5% for 2021. As the ANZ noted, food prices added the most (one-third) to the quarter-on-quarter increase of 1.8%. Thank Russia’s invasion of Ukraine for that. Fuel prices were up 32.5% on a year earlier, and 8.8% higher for the quarter. NZ, as in Australia, cut its fuel excise late last month but only for three months (versus six months here). The 25 NZ cent cut (from about $NZ0.70 to $NZ0.45) will ease some of the price pressure in the current quarter and - along with the NZ Reserve Bankalready lifting the interest rate – has economists hoping the CPI spike may be near its peak. Anyway, whatever the Australian CPI number is, it’s unlikely to nudge the RBA to lift the cash rate target at its May meeting. June, though, looks a strong bet. What the 27 April number may do, though, is put “cost of living pressures” back on the election campaign agenda. The issue was largely absent from last night’s “leaders debate”, which was a surprise but perhaps points to the success the government had with its budget neutralising the issue through the $3bn fuel excise halving. We’ll see whether it stays neutralised. Apple will soon roll out a new iPhone feature in Australia that will, when enabled, scan messages sent to and from children detecting whether nudity is in the photos. The feature, called communication safety in Messages, can be switched on by parents, and when a message detected to be a nude photo is detected trying to be sent or received, it will be blurred, and will warn the child it may contain sensitive content. It’ll direct the child to child safety resources online, and the child will be given an option to tell an adult about it. The scanning is all on-device, meaning Apple never sees the messages, the photos, or harvests any data from the analysis. Apple said: Messages analyses image attachments and determines if a photo contains nudity, while maintaining the end-to-end encryption of the messages. The feature is designed so that no indication of the detection of nudity ever leaves the device. Apple does not get access to the messages, and no notifications are sent to the parent or anyone else. The company first launched the product in the US, but will now expand it to other markets including Australia. My colleague Alex Hern wrote about the product in depth for the UK announcement overnight. How would a Labor government handle China? Anthony Albanese: The issue with Beijing will be problematic. Regardless of who is in government because the stance of Beijing has changed. I have said that repeatedly. But my philosophy, and I will finish with this. My philosophy is consistent with the Biden administration ... where he speaks about competition without catastrophe. We have to recognise what is happening in the region, we have to recognise that China is more forward-winning. They are seeking to increase influence in the region and we need to respond to that. We have to call out the behaviour of China inputting sanctions against Australian businesses, because that sanctions against Australian jobs. And it is entirely inappropriate. The press conference ends. Labor instigated Medicare, the NDIS and the aged pension, so what “big thing” does Labor offer this campaign? Anthony Albanese: My big thing is taking clean energy and using that to bring back manufacturing to this country, and to have Australia become a renewable energy superpower. That clean energy to drive jobs and advanced manufacturing. Jobs that exist for domestic purposes, but also export. We see in the Sun Cable project, to get an example. An opportunity that’s there. Sun Cable project gave Australia renewable energy, solar energy, powering Singapore. Powering Singapore. An extraordinary project. We have an incredible opportunity to make more things here and in coming days, hopefully you will be with us, we will be visiting places where we want to make more things here. Q: Just on religious freedom, you have said if you win in May, you will legislate the National Integrity Commission this year. Will you also do the Religious Discrimination Act this year and as part of that, will you abolish those exemptions in the Act that allows schools to discriminate against transgender and gay people, will that happen this year? Anthony Albanese says he won’t put a time table on all Labor’s legislation and then says: Since the government, let’s be clear about what happened here, since the government introduced legislation, it was amended consistent with what the prime minister wrote to me and said should happen with the legislation. They then withdrew it. The government promised, like prior to the 2019 election, that they would get this done. Scott Morrison always goes missing. And he always blame someone else. And in this case, in this case he has blamed as of his own party. Members of his own party. I mean, we sat until about five o’clock in the morning in order to get this legislation through. Because the government had not prioritised it. They were too busy doing sports rorts, too busy with their scheme on commuter car parks. There were too busy on the other priorities. We will get, all of our policies will be a priority. All of our priorities will be a priority. And yes this time, one of the things that I’m doing, to be very clear, about one of the big differences between me and Scott Morrison, I am running in this campaign to be Australia’s prime minister to implement the policies that I am taking to the selection, whether it be the NBN, whether it be cheaper childcare, the establishment of the national reconstruction bond. A Religious Discrimination Act, a national anti-corruption commission, this term. This term. I will be held to account. I will be held to account for that. One of the things I would do is what characterises as prime minister, which as he always goes missing and he always blame someone else. Q: Can I just ask you on NDIS. Senator Linda Reynolds has said that your plan for expert reviews will add time and bureaucracy. Can you guarantee that won’t happen? And also what did you make of Mr Morrison’s comment last night regarding being blessed not to have had to dealt with those NDIS issues? Anthony Albanese: Well, on the latter, I was asked about this before, but ... But I’m not a commentator. But I was asked about that before. I think that – all children are a blessing for parents. And the first bit – NDIS – NDIS, look, we have outlined the policies about removing the distant bureaucracy that’s occurring. We heard from the mother of young Ethan last night the problems that are occurring in practice. People are having their plans cut because a bureaucrat somewhere who isn’t in touch with what their issues are are making decisions. Ellie, who I spoke about last night as well, I know that she – I saw one of the things that she tweeted last night as well. You know, her circumstance, quite frankly, we had some of you were at the press conference with Ellie and Dougie. Dougie, I think, was from Canberra, just telling their stories about the impact. The NDIS is about our humanity. It’s a proud Labor reform and what’s happening is that people are having programs cut, the idea that someone can be told that colostomy bags are no longer part of their plan and when they asked, “Well, what am I supposed to do?”, they get told, “Can’t you just reuse them?” even though they’re very susceptible to infections. And the consequences of that, the consequences of that are far more dire in terms of a potential hospitalisation, acute care. We need to make sure that we get this right. I’m very confident that Bill Shorten’s plan that he’s put forward and that we have endorsed and we’re going to this election on is about putting people back at the centre of the NDIS. That’s what it’s about. ... If there are unfair cuts have been made, absolutely. People should get the care that they need and some of these cuts – inevitably there are changes made to people’s plans that they work through, but they need to be ones that actually improve the capacity to have a quality of life. Where there are cuts that have been made that make it worse for people’s quality of life, that make them less employable, that make them less able to participate in society, that should not happen. Q: Just a quick question on local matters. Gilmore has a huge homeless issue and lack of housing issue. What is Labor going to do about that? Anthony Albanese: We’ll have a Housing Australia Future Fund. Our fund will have 20,000 additional social housing units, but will also build affordable housing units for essential workers. Now, of that 20,000, I know that domestic violence is an issue right around the country as well. We’ll make sure that 4,000 of those units, those dwellings, are available for women and children escaping domestic violence. In addition to that, we have additional funding for emergency housing, we have a specific fund as well for Indigenous housing, for fixing up Indigenous housing in areas as well. So we have ... ... Homelessness is a huge issue, particularly in our regions. And what we know is the biggest group where homelessness is growing is older women. It’s older women who just can’t find anywhere to rent. The prime minister told them they should just go buy a house, that was their solution. Q: Peter Dutton has said that China won’t waste any time expanding its presence in the Pacific in the wake of that deal with the Solomons. If you’re elected next month, what will your government do to address that? Anthony Albanese: We’ll actually not go missing. We’d turn up. Where has Peter Dutton turned up? I tell you what – the people of the Pacific know. They have all seen the video of talking about how funny it is that countries are going to go under water. They have all seen it. And these are the people in that video – Scott Morrison and Peter Dutton – who are negotiating with the Pacific. How do you think they feel? How do you feel the people of Tuvalu, the leadership of Kiribati, the leadership of our Pacific Island neighbours feel about this? This government have gone missing. They had enough notice to engage and do something about this. China is more aggressive. China is more forward-leaning. We all accept that. The difference is how do you respond to it? Do you respond to it by trying to play domestic politics? Or do you respond to it in a strategic way - in a strategic way – that makes a difference? And we have been warning about this for some time. We opposed the extradition treaties being signed between China and Australia because they have a different view about the rule of law and about human rights and yet the government condemned us and said we were undermining business opportunities by doing that. I make this point as well: The government of which I was a part and leader of the government in the House of Representatives, the Gillard government, did a deal and put US marines in Darwin. This government sat back and went missing while the port of Darwin was sold to a company with direct links to the Chinese Communist party. Clearly not in Australia’s interest for that to happen. So in terms of national security and taking these issues seriously, we will. We will engage with our partners, we’ll engage with the region, we’ll take these issues seriously because we have to. Q: Mr Albanese, how will your federal Icac be in the landscape of state and territory bodies of a similar nature, for example, Peter Malinauskas in South Australia as opposition leader supported a model that is much weaker than Scott Morrison’s, for example, one that you say is not good enough? Anthony Albanese: Well, we’ll support our own model and Mark Dreyfus has outlined the principles in our model – one that’s allowed to have public hearings, one that has independent powers investigation, one that can subpoena and take action in order to ensure that it produces outcomes. Look, we need to – we need to restore faith in our politics and be very clear – Scott Morrison in 2018 announced before the last election when he was prime minister, he stood up and did a press conference, he didn’t have to do it, he stood up and said, “We’re going to have a National Integrity Commission”, as he called it. We could call it a National Anticorruption Commission. He then did nothing until the 2019 election was called. The 2019 election was called and he said, “We will legislate a National Integrity Commission.” We have gone three years and he hasn’t even introduced the legislation into parliament and during this election campaign, he has made it very clear that there will be no National Anticorruption Commission if he is re-elected. That is very clear. So it’s a stark contrast – if you want a National Anticorruption Commission, you have to vote for a Labor government because it’s only a Labor government that will get it done. Q: Can I ask: how many of your other colleagues shared that position that you had back then? Anthony Albanese: Everyone supports our position. The Labor party’s position is very clear – we support boat turnbacks. And what’s extraordinary here is that this is an example of the prime minister looking for divisions where there aren’t any. The truth is boat turnbacks have worked. The truth is that the Labor party have been very clear about supporting boat turnbacks. I support it. Everyone in my team supports it. We’ll implement it. Q: Can I ask a question of your candidate. You’re a signatory to a document in 2015 which says you fiercely opposed turning back the boats. What is your current position? Does it remain the same? Fiona Phillips: I absolutely 100% support Labor’s policy. Absolutely. Q: Why have you changed uyour mind when you were a fierce advocate for not turning back the boats recently. Phillips: There’s been two conferences since then and as MP, I absolutely support Labor’s policy. (Anthony Albanese tries to move back to the microphone) Q: Sorry I’m asking the question of the candidate. Can you articulate the reason why you changed your mind? We now understand Mr Albanese has. Q: And when did you change your mind? Albanese: She has answered that. Reporter: She hasn’t. Phillips: I like many members have gone to national conferences and just like we should we discuss items and I support that position. Absolutely. That’s what I did in the 2016 election and the 2019 election. So nothing has changed. I support Labor policy. I support regional offshore processing and if required and safe to do so boat turnbacks. Q: Do you think the prime minister is downplaying the prospect of the Chinese military base being built in the Solomons given we heard Barnaby Joyce say that it could become a little Cuba. Anthony Albanese: Well, Barnaby Joyce’s comments were quite extraordinary. He, again, you think he had nothing to do with this. He is the deputy prime minister of the country and the deputy prime minister of the country who was allowed to make a public comment on one of the few occasions in this campaign has said that this is like Cuba, likening it to the Cuban missile crisis that occurred on the doorstep of the United States. We know that the Solomons is a strategic destination. We know during World War II some of the fiercest and most important battles for control of the Pacific occurred there. And we know that the United States very much relies upon Australia and sees Australia as playing that key role of partners in the Indo-Pacific and that Australia and Scott Morrison has just gone missing. The United States is sending Kurt Campbell, its senior representative in this region. I have known Kurt a long period of time. He is a world-respected figure. We sent a junior person across there for what is a really serious matter and is beyond my comprehension that in spite of all of the speculation that has occurred, there’s been no action. Marise Payne on the Insiders program said that basically this was all under control. It’s quite clear that it wasn’t. Q: When did you change your mind [on boats], Mr Albanese? Anthony Albanese: I have answered that. I make a public statement at the time. Q: Do you think it was insensitive last night the prime minister saying how blessed he and his wife were who had children who didn’t suffer autism? Anthony Albanese: I think every child is a blessing for parents. Q: Mr Albanese, if I can about some comments last night. In 2015 you said that you couldn’t ask someone to do something you couldn’t see yourself doing yourself regarding boat turnbacks. You said if people were on a boat and putting families and children, you yourself couldn’t turn that around. When did you change your mind? What was it specifically that made you change your mind given it sounds like quite a strong view you head in 2015? Anthony Albanese: When I announced it. When I announced it at the time. Labor supports turning back the boats. Scott Morrison is asked about the criticism of his comments in the debate last night, where he said he was “blessed” not to have a child with a disability and says: It took us 14 years to have Abbie and we refer to her as our miracle child and then we’re blessed with Lily. What I was saying in good faith and Catherine who I was speaking to whose son, Ethan had an autism, eh, um, disabiliy, she didn’t take it that way. I was just simply saying that it’s tough and I’m grateful that these hardships that I and Jenny haven’t had to deal with. They’re other things. But it’s tough and it’s hard. Of course there is no greater love than a parent has for a child, and particularly a child who has special needs, and and it is a blessing. But I was just simply trying to say in good faith, look, I haven’t walked in your shoes, Catherine, I’m not gonna pretend to say that I understand it as well as you do. And that’s all and the fact that Bill Shorten and others seek to leap on that and twist the words and turn it into something I just thought showed really bad faith and tried to take something that was meant in a good spirit and just use it for political purposes in the middle of the campaign. So that says more about him. And I know others have jumped on that. And then they probably haven’t heard exactly what I said. And so I can understand if I they were just listening to Bill Shorten that they’d say that but I thought that was just pretty poor from Bill. Ray Hadley says it is something he has said many, many times himself and he has friends who have children and grandchildren with disabilities. Morrison: It’s a hard road and it’s the very definition of limitless love. I think. It really is. And I just think they’re amazing Australians and their kids are and we love them all. And we really respect what they do and supporting families with special needs and disabilities shouldn’t be a partisan thing. We support the NDIS we’ve had to fund it. It’s hard to fund and and it’s a big commitment and we believe in it. It shouldn’t be something that is being torn apart and used and partisanised in this way. I just thought it would just bad form. Given Ray Hadley and Scott Morrison are still talking about boats, it is worth pointing out that Morrison has not identified any intelligence that there is any issue. Labor has said it will keep turning back boats when safe to do so. It’s straight into another spiel on the economy, before mentioning that the mobile reception in Caboolture is “not great” and announces another reception blackspot program. Caboolture is just outside of the Queensland capital, it is not exactly the sticks. The Coalition has been in power for almost a decade. Make of that what you will. Then it moves on to the Labor scare campaign over putting pensioners on the cashless debit card. Then, without irony, it moves on to the Coalition scare campaign on Operation Sovereign Borders (which is treated very seriously). Scott Morrison is in Longman, and tells Ray Hadley that “you’re very popular up here, mate”. Morrison is at a retirement home. Ray Hadley’s “analysis” continues, asking his listeners “who do you trust” to protect the borders, and drops in this pearler: Anthony Albanese who doesn’t know his beeeeeeeeep [they actually used the sound effect] from his Albo? Scott Morrison is late for Ray Hadley, so he is filling in time. He says that Kristina Keneally is in “witness protection” and then adds “with all due respect” because “she has had the virus”. “But she can still talk,” he says. The Labor campaign has moved away from Queensland and is now in the electorate of Gilmore. Labor holds the seat with a 2.6% margin and the Liberals want it back, putting in former NSW state minister Andrew Constance against Fiona Phillips. Labor think they can hold on to the electorate, but both sides are throwing a lot at it. Scott Morrison will speak with Sydney radio 2GB’s Ray Hadley in the next 15 minutes or so. Labor senator Katy Gallagher, who has a daughter with autism, was asked about Scott Morrison’s “blessed” comment on the Seven Network this morning. She said it was “deeply offending and deeply upsetting”: Gallagher: As the parent of a wonderful daughter with autism, I was really upset by that comment. I found it really offending and quite shocking. And it’s something that people who have a disability, children with autism, it’s the kind of response they get all the time, that people are blessed not to have what they have when in actual fact every child is a blessing. Certainly my daughter Nat enriches my life and my partner’s life every day. She’s wonderful. And I think that again just shows a lack of connection with everyday people’s lives. I mean, there’s millions of us who live with children with a range of different needs. And to have a prime minister say he was blessed not to have one of those is deeply offending and deeply upsetting to those of us who have that wonderful addition in our family. And you can add the Australian of the Year Dylan Alcott to that list Luke just reported (former Australian of the Year, Grace Tame’s tweet is below). Amy brought you Liberal senator Hollie Hughes’s defence of Scott Morrison’s “blessed” comments earlier. As Amy mentioned, Hughes’s son Fred is autistic, and Hughes is a big supporter of the NDIS, even criticising the government over its handling of the issue at times. Respected disability advocate Craig Wallace, meanwhile, had this to say: But it would be fair to say that for many, many others, the prime minister’s comments have been deeply hurtful. Nicole Rogerson, the founder of Autism Awareness Australia, a group that Hughes has widely praised, posted this pointed response to Morrison. The organisation itself was even more scathing: Here is some other reaction to the comments from autistic people and those with autistic children. And if you watched the debate, you would have heard Anthony Albanese talk about a woman who had been told by the NDIS that she would now have to re-use her colostomy bags. That woman was Elly Desmarchelier, a disability advocate who had this to say about Morrison’s comments. This morning, on Sky News, Zed Seselja, in listing what he said was Labor’s “misrepresentations” on the Pacific situation, didn’t list the August warning as one of them: Well, Penny Wong has fundamentally misrepresented the situation and, in fact, completely misdiagnosed the response. So, Penny Wong and Anthony Albanese and the Labor party have made false claims about cuts that aren’t there. We are spending a record amount when it comes to aid in the region, when it comes to security arrangements in the region, when it comes to our Covid response. We have stepped up in every way. And the Labor party haven’t said what they would do differently, but we know what they did do differently – they did a lot less in the region when they were there. They cut defence spending, and now what they are saying, and what Penny Wong said again today and what Anthony Albanese has said is that it’s, in fact, about climate change and the climate change response, which is just an absurd argument, which goes, I think, to their fitness for office. Yesterday afternoon, the Pacific minister Zed Seselja disputed Labor’s claim that the Morrison government had been warned China was looking to establish a military presence in Solomon Islands in August last year: So she’s [Penny Wong] claimed, and I think she’s shown herself to particularly be unfit to be foreign minister. She’s claimed that this is a resolve to cut aid. That’s not true. We have actually substantially increased the aid budget to the region since we came to office. So when the Labor party were in office, they were spending a lot less when it came to aid, and indeed a lot less on other co-operation, like defence co-operation in the region. So that’s the first lie. The second lie was that we knew about it in August. That is simply not true. Q: And what was the earliest knowledge that you had? Seselja: We found out about it when we saw that leaked draft. So Penny Wong is simply making that up. That’s not true and our officials have confirmed that. In March, Matthew Wale, the leader of the Democratic party, the Solomon Islands opposition, told the ABC he had tried to warn Australia in August. He said: I have intimated as much to the Australian High Commissioner and officials that this was in the offing, even as far back as last year — all the indications were there and the Australian government did nothing about it — so I’m extremely disappointed in the Australian government. Josh Frydenberg is on the campaign trail today, campaigning in Sydney’s west with the Liberal candidate for Bennelong, Simon Kennedy. Sitting MP John Alexander announced he would retire at the election. The Liberals are expected to hold on to the seat. New South Wales has recorded 16 Covid deaths and 17,447 new cases in the past day. More people have died of Covid so far this year in Australia than in 2020 and 2021 combined. Victoria has released its Covid numbers for the past 24 hours, with 10,674 new cases and sadly 11 deaths. Simon Birmingham was doing the media rounds this morning. We’ll bring you more of that interview a little later. Finally, asked if Australia believed, as at least 25 human rights organisations do, that Julian Assange should not be extradited to the United States, Simon Birmingham said: No, we have confidence in the independence and the integrity of the British justice system. This is a process that will be able to continue to work through that system. There remain appeal rights for Mr Assange, depending on decisions that have [been] made and we’ll continue to provide, where it is taken up, appropriate consular assistance. Asked about Scott Morrison describing him and his wife as “blessed” not to have children with disabilities, Simon Birmingham said: I think he was expressing the type of sentiment many Australians would understand, in terms of the circumstances where we all want to see. It’s why Australians support the NDIS, and the record investment we’re making, which has grown its funding to now be greater in totality than that of Medicare. ... It’s a vast and complicated system supporting 500,000 different Australians in different circumstances. It won’t get every single case right in terms of how it engages, but that’s why the PM took the time out afterwards to sit down with that mum and that make sure that he was able to get the details and to go back to the agency, as I’m sure he will today, to ensure they will get in touch with her. Q: I’m talking about the language, it’s the language we’re discussing, the idea he and Jenny have been blessed by not having a child with a disability. People from within your own party have said it’s not right that people with a disability are continually portrayed as being a burden on those around them. Birmingham: Well, it’s certainly not that. It is simply the case that, as a country, all Australians, I think, understand the need for us to provide additional support and we can understand as well the circumstances for family members and for others helping people living with disabilities are not always easy circumstances. And that for many of us, we are fortunate not to deal with some of the challenges faced in those cases. Q: But senator, I do want to take you up on that. This was the debate we were having in the dying days of the parliament, and all the national security experts and veterans in the field say it was unhelpful and that the ALP was anything other than supporting Australia’s policy, so why are you continuing this line of attack? Simon Birmingham: The Labor party have created the points of difference in the way they expressed themselves and the language they used. When last in office, let our investment in our defence forces whittle away to the lowest share of the economy. We brought it back to 2% of the GDP, and having that credible investment is what has enabled us to strike new defence pacts and partnerships with countries like the United States and the United Kingdom, making us a credible partner for defence and strategic investment in areas of artificial intelligence, in missile equipment and investment, and the nuclear-powered submarines. In the lead up to the election, the government has tried very hard to present Labor as being “weak” when it came to China, breaking the bipartisan pact that national security is not a political wedge. This culminated when in the last sitting week of parliament Scott Morrison accused Labor’s Richard Marles of being a “Manchurian candidate”. Former ASIO head Dennis Richardson and current ASIO boss Mike Burgess chastised the use of national security as a political tool. But last night in the debate, during an exchange about the Solomon Islands-China security pact, Morrison brought back echoes of that moment, when he asked: “When it comes to standing up to China, they’ve criticised me for being too strong, I was called a racist for closing the borders, I was protecting Australia. “What I don’t understand is, when something of this significance takes place, why would you take China’s side?” Anthony Albanese called it “an outrageous slur”. This morning, though, Liberal SA senator Simon Birmingham wasn’t backing down from it: I think we have seen a Labor party, who when China were making decisions to apply trade sanctions and tariffs against Australia, Labor seemed to want us to reach a compromise with China rather than to stand up for Australia. Anthony Albanese spoke at the National Press Club not that long ago – he suggested we should negotiate or settle some of the points with the Labor party – sorry, with China. Well, ultimately, we have to stand up for Australian interests. We’re not going to trade away beef producers in Queensland or winemakers in South Australia or fresh seafood exporters from Tasmania. We’re going to stand up for all of those industries and for Australia’s interests in term of having a peaceful and prosperous and secure region. Q: Before you go, I want to ask about more now-deleted tweets uncovered from Liberal candidate Katherine Deves. This one suggesting a link between cross-dressing men and trans women being sexual predators, even serial killers. Are you concerned by the language that Katherine Deves has used over the years? Hollie Hughes: Look, Ms Deves has deleted those social media profiles. She has apologised for the language she used. I do believe some of the language was inappropriate. But we’ve also got to have some brave discussions when it comes to these issues. And sometimes, you know, we’re talking about now, the use of a word, sometimes people say things in the moment that they don’t actually mean, or they are overstating. Q: She seems to have said a lot. There’s an awful lot of tweets. Hughes: There are tweets from a candidate in the Hunter who used photographs of naked women with big guns saying that size didn’t matter when you had 130kg behind it. There’s substantial tweets from a Labor candidate in the Hunter and everyone has gone silent on those. If everyone wants to cry about one set of tweets, they should be crying about them on both sides of politics. Q: Does Katherine Deves have your full support? Hughes: I have never met Ms Deves. But yes, she’s the candidate for Warringah, and what I would like to see is the seat of Warringah return to the Liberal National party, not a candidate who wants to fundamentally shut down our economy, who makes ridiculous claims about how climate change needs to be addressed, who also has referred to every single parent who has problems with perhaps a 15-year-old trans teenage woman or girl* using their daughter’s change room. That apparently makes us transphobic as parents having concerns about that. Saying goodbye to Zali Steggall in Warringah would be a very good thing. For that, Ms Deves has my full support. *Trans women and girls are women and girls Q: Sounds like a bit of damage control here, Senator Hughes. Hollie Hughes: We have just recently funded $1.2m to autism awareness Australia for a further project on autism, ‘What Next?’ It’s telling them the choices available to them in their life and how they can get assistance. We have put some money up for this. Q: I want to talk just briefly about the actual NDIS and the import of that question last night. Because the mother said the funding was cut by 30% at a first review with no explanation given. Labor says the NDIS needs a sweeping review and that’s what it will do if it wins government. Simon Birmingham says it’s a great scheme and we’re happy with how we’re running it. It can’t be both, can it? Hughes: It is a great scheme and it’s made a significant difference. That mother ... and her son ... I hazard a guess they went to an early intervention preschool. There’s problems around intensive early intervention. A lot of this is driven by the autistic adult community, who suggest using best practice behavioural interventions is somehow torturing those children. So there’s ideological problems within the autistic community. And some of the problems that we’re seeing in the early childhood stream in particular are because those within the agency are pushing back about good quality intensive early intervention. These are the fundamentals those children should be accessing. One thing I would say, the early childhood stream does need some review. Because I believe there are some ideological objections to children with autism getting intensive early intervention because there’s a band and a barrage of autistic adults who claim the kids don’t need it. Q: Senator Hughes, I know you have spoken about your son Fred over the years. You spoke about him in your maiden speech in 2019. And you’ve been an advocate for people with disability. You’re now refuting the thoughts of people with disabilities who last night, certainly on social media, were saying, when is the population, when is the community, when are leaders going to stop looking at us as a burden? Hollie Hughes: Look, it’s not looking at us as families or our children as a burden. It’s a recognition that we do have additional challenges. My son is a blessing but I can tell you, as I said, there were days I did not feel particularly blessed. There were very challenging days. For some of these people coming out, people in the autistic community who have been diagnosed in their later life, they didn’t experience the challenges we did as parents in the early days. Anyone who has children with a disability or without a disability will say there’s days that are challenging. If you want to talk about the word blessed as the biggest problem we’ve got facing us as parents and carers of those with a disability, this is why the disability community struggles to make constructive gains, because there’s lying underneath it a significant, almost permanent rage machine. And when the NDIS came in and a lot of people got funding for the first time, they had to find somewhere else to direct their rage. There’s significant issues with the NDIS. I have my own challenges with the agency. ... Find something of substance and stop focusing on a ridiculous notion that somehow or other the prime minister was in any way denigrating people with a disability, or their families and the experiences they go through. In fact, Scott understands better than most if for another other reason, I’m constantly in his ear about it. Liberal senator Hollie Hughes, who has an autistic son, has appeared on ABC News Breakfast to defend Scott Morrison for saying he was “blessed” to have children without disabilities: To be honest, I did not think of anything of them at all. I know Scott and Jenny had tried for 14 years to have their children and they are blessed with two beautiful daughters. I certainly didn’t take anything negative away from it. And I really do think that people are missing the point of the substantive issue here. If they want to focus on one word. As you and I have discussed previously, I’m a mother of an autistic son. I have three children. I know there were days, very early on, when my son was younger, that were really, really hard. I didn’t feel particularly blessed. I now have a teenager daughter. There’s days I don’t feel particularly blessed either. To focus on one word is missing the point. I recently chaired the Senate autism – select committee into autism, on the whole of life experience of autistics and their families. For anyone who wants to get upset about the use of one word, I suggest they read that report. We have a much higher suicide rate within the autism population. We have a higher unemployment later than the general disability population. There’s issues we can be angry about. The use of the word blessed is symptomatic of those who don’t like Scott and want to find something to cling to. The prime minister’s choice of language, saying he had been “blessed” to have children without disabilities, is going to be remembered for some time. Scott Morrison was very keen yesterday to make sure it was known that there was no military base as part of the security pact between the Solomon Islands and China: The prime minister of Solomon Islands has made it very clear that they are not accepting of any base in the Solomon Islands. They are not. So that is a false claim that there’s no basis to make that assertion. It’s not there. That would be the first point that I would make. Yesterday, Barnaby Joyce contradicted him: We don’t want our own little Cuba off our coast and that is not what is good for this nation, not what is good for this region. And it looks like the defence minister Peter Dutton has done the same thing: Dutton chastised China for “not playing by the same rules”, AAP reports. “You can expect the Chinese to do all they can now that they’ve got this agreement signed,” Dutton told Sky News when questioned on whether troops would move in. “[China said] the South China Sea would not be militarised [and] today, they’re militarised. They’ve got airstrips. They’ve got fuel depots. And that’s the reality of China under President Xi.” In case you didn’t see it last night, here was Murph’s take on the debate The first thing to say is the questions from the audience were sharper and more substantive than most of the questions put to the two leaders over the past week and a half of the campaign. Voters wanted to know about housing affordability, the nursing workforce, the absent national integrity commission, funding packages under the national disability insurance scheme, the future of renewables and battery technology, the treatment of sole traders left out of jobkeeper during the pandemic, regional security, youth participation and the health of Australia’s democracy. Not one pop quiz about the unemployment rate (which dominated the first 72 hours of the campaign) or question about the life and times of the unfortunate Katherine Deves (which is continuing to dominate it). Welcome to another day in the campaign where things are really starting to get messy. Anthony Albanese was judged as the winner of last night’s debate by a slim margin (although even the Sky After Dark commentators begrudgingly awarded him the night). But it’s one of Scott Morrison’s comments that is still being spoken about. When asked by a woman with an autistic son about the future of the NDIS under his government, Morrison said he and his wife Jenny had been “blessed” to have two children without disabilities. That set off a firestorm of hurt and disbelief online, as people with disabilities and parents of children with disabilities sought to remind the PM that all children were blessings. The counterfactual to Morrison’s statement is what has upset people. He said: Jenny and I have been blessed, we have two children who haven’t had to go through that. And so for parents, with children who are disabled, I can only try and understand your aspirations for those children. The finance minister Simon Birmingham was asked about it on the ABC this morning, and tried to keep focus on how the NDIS now had a bigger expenditure than Medicare, pointing out that the PM took time to sit with the woman after the debate last night, to hear more of her story. Given the sheer amount of stories about NDIS funding being cut, not everyone can sit down with the prime minister to discuss their story and needs and receive personal guarantees someone from the department will be in touch. Birmingham also tried to turn attention to Labor supposedly being weak against China after both Albanese and Morrison fired up over national security in last night’s debate. It is going to be that sort of day. You have Katharine Murphy, Daniel Hurst, Sarah Martin, Paul Karp and Josh Butler to make sense of it, with Amy Remeikis on the blog for most of the day.

But new worlds now beckon","bodyText":"My favourite childhood reading in the 1950s included the Eagle comic, especially the adventures of Dan Dare, Pilot of the Future – where the brilliant artwork depicted orbiting cities, jet packs and alien invaders. When spaceflight became real, the suits worn by the Soviet cosmonauts (and their US astronaut counterparts) were already familiar, as were the routines of launching and docking. My generation avidly followed the succession of heroic pioneering exploits such as Yuri Gagarin’s first orbital flight and Alexei Leonov’s first spacewalk. But of course the day most etched in our memories is 20 July 1969, when Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin planted the first human footprints on the moon’s dusty surface. The exploit seems even more heroic in retrospect, given how primitive and untested the technology was. Nasa’s entire suite of computers was less powerful than a single smartphone today. The Soviet “firsts” in space had caused alarm in American political circles – and so galvanised a massive countereffort. John F Kennedy declared in 1961 that the US “should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the Earth”. No single space project, he said, would “be more impressive to mankind, or more important in the long-range exploration of space”. The US committed up to 4% of the US federal budget to Nasa’s Apollo project, the strategic prioritybeing to surpass the Soviets – and despite the rhetoric it was not primarily an idealistic goal, still less a scientific one. In December 1968, to worldwide acclaim for Nasa, Apollo 8 successfully circled the moon 10 times before returning to Earth. During this mission William Anders snapped his famous “Earthrise” photo – iconic among environmentalists ever since – showing our fragile blue Earth contrasted with the sterile “moonscape” in the foreground. The later Apollo missions succeeded, with the exception of Apollo 13 in April 1970, when astronaut Jack Swigert famously radioed mission control with the words, “Houston, we’ve had a problem here.” The shuttle’s power supply had failed, but thanks to repairs and heroic improvisation by Jim Lovell (portrayed in a memorable 1995 film by Tom Hanks) and his fellow astronauts, the mission concluded safely. Armstrong’s “small step for man” came just 12 years after the first successful Soviet space mission, Sputnik 1. Had the pace of advances been sustained, there could have been footprints on Mars by now – indeed that’s what many of us expected in the 1970s. But the Apollo programme ended in 1972 with Apollo 17’s safe return to Earth. It remains, a half-century later, the heroic peak of manned spaceflight. In the subsequent decades, hundreds have ventured into space – but they have circled the Earth in low orbit, mainly in the International Space Station (ISS). Their voyages simply do not offer the same inspiration that the pioneering Soviet and American space exploits once did. But the Apollo programme was motivated by the US strategic imperative to “beat the Russians”. Once that had been achieved, there was no longer any justification to continue the massive expenditure that it had consumed. In fact, it would have been naive to think that manned spaceflight would continue to surge forward as it did in the 1960s. All technologies advance in “spasms”, and sometimes stagnate if there’s no commercial or social demand. Of the 12 men who walked on the moon, only four are still living. Will there soon come a time when no human has firsthand memory of standing on another world? Many, myself included, would be saddened to see human exploration of space simply fade into history. The question, of course, is whether the manifestly exciting potentialities of space will include a practical and affordable role for humans. Machine learning is advancing fast, as are sensor technologies. And there is still a huge cost difference between manned and unmanned missions. The hiatus on manned spaceflight stems not only from the lack of a Kennedy-style political imperative, but also because the practical case weakens with each advance in robotics and miniaturisation. There are nonetheless plans, from the US, Russia and China, to return to the moon and build a “base” there – but will there be sufficient motive and political will to send people, given what robots can do? The main obstacles are political and cultural: the American public demands that such missions come with almost no risk. Nasa’s space shuttle was launched more than 130 times, with only two of its missions ending in disaster. But those episodes were national traumas, because the shuttle had unwisely been promoted as a safe vehicle for civilians, such as the schoolteacher Christa McAuliffe, who died in the 1986 Challenger explosion. Professional test pilots and adventurers would readily accept an implicit failure rate of 2% – or indeed, much more. If I were an American, I would not support Nasa’s manned programme – I would argue that private companies should “front” all manned missions as cut-price, high-risk ventures. SpaceX, led by Elon Musk, and the rival effort Blue Origin, bankrolled by Jeff Bezos, will soon be offering orbital flights to paying customers. Indeed, SpaceX hopes to launch a Japanese billionaire, with a few friends, on a five-day trip around the far side of the moon. The phrase “space tourism” should be avoided by promoters of these private-sector schemes, because it creates a false complacency that such ventures are routine and safe, more like extreme sports or intrepid exploration. The risks are daunting, but despite them there would still be many volunteers for a trip to Mars – some perhaps even accepting “one-way tickets” – driven by the same motives as early explorers and mountaineers. Indeed, it is time to eschew the mindset that space ventures should be national (or indeed international) projects – along with pretentious rhetoric where the word “we” is used to denote the whole of humanity. There are some endeavours – tackling the climate crisis, for instance – that can’t be done without concerted international action. The human exploitation of space need not be of this nature; it may need some public regulation, but private or corporate risk-takers can best provide the impetus. And of course, space technology has burgeoned, despite the hiatus in manned flight. Modern society now depends heavily on orbiting satellites for satnav, communication, navigation, environmental monitoring, surveillance and weather forecasting. Moreover, space probes have journeyed to all the planets of the solar system. Nasa’s New Horizons beamed back amazing pictures from Pluto, 20,000 times farther away than the moon. The European Space Agency’s Rosetta landed a robot on a comet. These spacecraft took five years to design and build and then nearly 10 years journeying to their remote targets. The Cassini probe spent 13 years studying Saturn and its moons and was even more venerable; almost 20 years elapsed between its launch and its final plunge into Saturn in late 2017. It is not hard to envisage how much more sophisticated today’s follow-ups to these missions could be. In the coming decades, giant robotic fabricators will be able to construct solar-energy collectors, telescopes and other giant structures in space. Some aspiring space pioneers, like Bezos, envisage a longer range future in which much industrial production actually takes place off Earth. And the entire solar system – planets, moons and asteroids – will be explored by fleets of tiny automated probes, interacting with each other like a flock of birds. But no feasible probes can reach beyond our solar system. Our knowledge of deep space – stars and galaxies – comes from telescopes. But space offers a huge boost to astronomers. Telescopes orbiting far above the blurring and absorptive effects of Earth’s atmosphere have beamed back sharp images from the remotest parts of the cosmos. They have surveyed the sky in infrared, UV, x-ray and gamma ray bands that don’t penetrate the atmosphere and therefore can’t be observed from the ground. They have probed with high precision the “afterglow of creation” – the microwaves pervading all space whose properties hold clues to the very beginning, when the entire observable cosmos was squeezed to microscopic size. Perhaps most fascinating of all, we’ve learned that most stars are orbited by retinues of planets, just as our sun is orbited by the familiar planets: there are millions of Earth-like planets orbiting other stars in the Milky Way. But do any of these harbour life – even intelligent life? To me, that’s the most fascinating question of all. These “exoplanets” are too faint to be studied by existing telescopes. Giant robotic fabricators will be able to construct, in space, enormous lightweight telescopes to map the cosmos far beyond our own solar system. It’s realistic to hope that by 2068 – the centenary of the iconic Earthrise picture – such telescopes will have an image of another “Earth”, orbiting a distant star, that harbours life – yielding a still wider perspective on the role of life and intelligence in the cosmos. • Martin Rees is the astronomer royal and a former president of the Royal Society"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2019/mar/13/one-state-solution-gains-ground-as-palestinians-battle-for-equal-rights","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2019-03-13T13:32:18Z","webTitle":"One-state solution gains ground as Palestinians battle for equal rights","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/13/one-state-solution-gains-ground-as-palestinians-battle-for-equal-rights","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2019/mar/13/one-state-solution-gains-ground-as-palestinians-battle-for-equal-rights","fields":{"headline":"One-state solution gains ground as Palestinians battle for equal rights","bodyText":"Maybe it wasn’t the wisest choice for a Palestinian activist living under the close watch of Israeli security. But Fadi Quran was obsessed and determined: he would study nuclear physics at Stanford University. “I got stopped at the border a lot,” he joked years later of the times he passed through Israeli passport control after graduating. “To be honest, when I first started I just wanted to win a Nobel prize in physics. I was 18 years old. I loved the stuff.” He wanted to use his physics degree to provide wind and solar energy to Palestinians. But the plan stalled. Israel delayed the import of the technology needed, he said, and Palestinian officials became interested and demanded a share of his company. “I was squashed.” Now 30, he sits at a plush cafe in downtown Ramallah in the West Bank, with fast internet and mochas filled with chunks of chocolate. Smartly dressed 20-somethings sit smoking and typing away on laptops. A restaurant next door sells sushi. Further up the street, there is an electric car charging station next to a tourist information centre. It’s a pleasant scene, but it’s a lie, Quran says. “If you go two miles in any direction outside the centre of Ramallah, you’ll find [an Israeli] settlement, or a wall, or a checkpoint or so forth.” Israeli military control is not immediately visible here, he acknowledges, but that’s the ingenuity of it. Palestinians in the West Bank live under a system that was supposed to last just five years – an agreement made 25 years ago as the first step towards a self-governing country alongside Israel. Under the Oslo accords, an interim government called the Palestinian Authority (PA) was given limited control over small pockets of land, almost exclusively towns and cities, while Israel maintained control of the remainder. But after the peace process collapsed, Israel dug in by building an extensive network of roads, military bases, settlements and quarries. Meanwhile, the PA clung to power, surviving by coordinating closely with Israeli security forces. The PA has become a “subcontractor for the occupation”, says Quran. “The other way you could frame it is postmodern Uncle Toms – people whose personal interests have become so enmeshed with the interests of the ‘slave masters’ that they will serve them and betray their own people’s interests.” Peace has never seemed so distant. Almost two-thirds of Palestinians want the PA’s 84-year-old ailing leader, Mahmoud Abbas, to resign, according to polls, and half believe the Authority “has become a burden”. Palestinians live in constant bemusement as they hear world leaders and diplomats talk as if the past quarter-century never happened. Last month, the European Union’s top diplomat Federica Mogherini wrote a 3,000-word article which read like a desperate plea for Palestinians and Israelis to keep working for a two-state solution. Foreign governments have held tight to the two-state ideal despite drastic changes on the ground. Even as they privately acknowledge it as a fading prospect, diplomats still talk of “working towards” two states. When polled, a majority of Palestinians do not see that as a possibility. Roughly 600,000 Israeli settlers now live on occupied land with no intention of leaving. Meanwhile, Israeli politicians in cabinet talk about annexing vast swathes of the West Bank. “Almost nobody believes in the two-state solution anymore,” Quran says. Bassem Tamimi, from the village of Nabi Saleh, has a lifetime of resistance behind him. The 52-year-old points to a scar on his head from what he said was surgery after he was shaken into a coma by interrogators. His sister died after he says she was pushed down the stairs in an Israeli courthouse. His cousin was killed by a direct hit with a gas grenade. Now, his teenage daughter, Ahed, has risen to global prominence after she slapped a soldier and spent eight months in jail. Tamimi sees the Palestinian struggle as one of fighting for ever-tinier chunks of land. When Israel was established in 1948, Palestinians were left with 22% of the land they had lived on. Under Oslo, they agreed to work towards sovereignty over that area. Now they have limited autonomy over an even smaller fraction of that. “I fought for the two-state solution,” he sighs. “I lost my friends, I lost my sister, I lost a lot of cousins, I lost my time in jail.” He has since given up on the idea of a Palestinian state alongside Israel. “Our society feels like it has lost. And this is the first time that has happened,” he says. The village halted demonstrations in 2015 as too many people were being shot. “Why should Ahed fight for the life I had?” he asks. Tamimi now advocates for one secular state in all the land shared by Israelis and Palestinians. The idea gaining momentum, even among Palestinian officials who helped negotiate Oslo. When Donald Trump recognised the contested city of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, the senior Palestinian politician Saeb Erekat said the message was clear: “The two-state solution is over. Now is the time to transform the struggle for one state with equal rights for everyone living in historic Palestine.” Palestinians already live inside Israel with citizenship. They are families who remained in their towns and villages while others fled or were expelled in wars surrounding Israel’s creation. But their life is not what other Palestinians aspire towards. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said on Sunday: “Israel is the nation state of the Jewish people – and only it.” Neither does he back two independent states, leaving Palestinians in limbo. Quran, the activist, is wary of calling himself a “one-stater”. He knows that for many Israelis, it’s a scary phrase, as it would lead to the end of Zionism in its current form. Under one state, Palestinians might make up approximately half or more of the population. That would mean Israel could cease to be a majority-Jewish country. But his hopes appear to echo that of Tamimi. “I want everyone in this area to live under the same constitution and same social contract that provides them with freedom, justice and dignity for all.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2019/apr/28/james-mccord-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2019-04-28T16:16:13Z","webTitle":"James McCord obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/28/james-mccord-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2019/apr/28/james-mccord-obituary","fields":{"headline":"James McCord obituary","bodyText":"It is somehow fitting that the death of James McCord – the CIA agent and Watergate burglar whose arrest then sensational trial in 1973 set in motion the scandal that eventually forced the resignation of the US president Richard Nixon – should have evaded public notice for almost two years. McCord’s death in 2017, aged 93, was first reported in Shane O’Sullivan’s 2018 book Dirty Tricks, about the Nixon scandals, but it was not until it was mentioned on the website Kennedys and King last month that it was picked up by major media. In death, as in life, McCord remained in the shadows. His role in the president’s downfall ostensibly began in 1971, when he left the CIA to work for the Nixon administration on the committee for the re-election of the president (popularly known as Creep), first with Jack Caulfield on Operation Sandwedge, gathering dirt on Nixon’s “enemies”, then with “the plumbers unit”, so-called due to its brief to plug information leaks. On the night of 17 June 1972, McCord led his plumbers’ team of Frank Sturgis and three Cuban exiles into the Democratic National Committee offices in the Watergate building, to check on malfunctioning bugs they had planted there previously. But a security guard, Frank Wills, noticed a taped-over door latch and called the police, who arrested the five burglars. The head of the plumbers unit, G Gordon Liddy, and another ex-CIA man, E Howard Hunt, who were overseeing the break-in from a room at the adjacent Watergate hotel, fled, but were later arrested. Asked about his employment during arraignment, McCord whispered “CIA” to the judge, and the ears of the Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward perked up. A search of the hotel room abandoned by Hunt and Liddy revealed notebooks with White House contact numbers. The ensuing investigations into crime and cover-up moved to Congress, and, faced with impeachment, Nixon eventually quit, in August 1974. During the trial, the White House had tried to fend off reports suggesting ties between the president’s men and what they called a “third-rate burglary” but in January 1973 McCord, who declined to say anything about his own career before Watergate, pleaded guilty along with the other four, and was sentenced to a prison term of one to five years. A month earlier, McCord had written to Caulfield warning the White House not to fire the CIA director Richard Helms, or “every tree in the forest will fall. It will be a scorched desert.” However, having refused to aid Nixon’s cover-up, Helms was fired in February 1973. Soon after, Caulfield conveyed what McCord characterised as a mixture of bribery, threats, and promises of clemency to McCord, but it did no good. In March, McCord wrote to the judge, John Sirica, detailing those offers and multiple perjuries by those giving the orders. He also stated flatly: “The Watergate operation was not a CIA operation. The Cubans may have been misled by others into believing that it was a CIA operation. I know for a fact that it was not.” As Sirica described it, the “trickle of information soon became a flood”, and the almost inevitable end of the Nixon presidency followed. For co-operating, McCord had his sentence was cut to four months. Entering federal prison in Allenwood, Pennsylvania, in 1975, he said: “In the long run it has been extremely beneficial to the country to become aware of what occurred.” But the question of exactly what occurred has been contentious ever since. Many researchers point to the awkward taping over of the latches, as many as six of them, the dawdling of the team in the DNC offices and the leaving of evidence in the Watergate hotel, as being uncharacteristic of McCord’s experience with tradecraft. This suggests a set-up, to get the White House operatives caught, and debate still persists about what material the DNC bugs were intended to discover. Others point out that without McCord’s testimony, the whole investigation might well have been stone-walled and, rather than being frightened by White House threats, McCord may have spoken out of loyalty to the CIA to keep the investigation focused narrowly on Nixon. As Jim Hougan noted in his study of Watergate, Hidden Agenda, instead of the usual photo of Nixon on the wall, McCord’s Creep office featured one of Helms, inscribed, “To Jim, with deep appreciation”, with the “deep” underscored, as if with a nod and a wink. Answers to some Watergate conundrums may lie in McCord’s CIA career. Born in Waurika, Oklahoma, he was the son of Marjorie (nee Welch) and James McCord Sr, a teacher. After high school he worked briefly at the FBI, then enlisted in 1943 in the Army Air Corps as a lieutenant. After the war he settled in Texas, where his parents lived, receiving his bachelor’s degree from the University of Texas. After a brief return to the FBI, he joined the still-young Central Intelligence Agency in 1951. It is believed that as an operative McCord played a role in the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba in 1961, and developed ties then with Sturgis. McCord later testified that he and Hunt had never met before Watergate, but that was easily disproved; their association went back even before the Bay of Pigs, in which Hunt was a major player. This becomes particularly crucial in light of White House tapes revealing Nixon briefing his aide HR Haldeman on what to tell Helms in an effort to cut off Watergate investigations. Nixon warns they will “make the CIA look bad … make Hunt look bad, and it’s likely to blow the whole Bay of Pigs thing”. While McCord’s Watergate team were veterans of the Bay of Pigs, Nixon’s reference appears to suggest other Cuba-related affairs, from CIA assassination plots against Fidel Castro, to the alleged involvement of some CIA people with Cuban exiles and the mafia in the killing of John F Kennedy in 1963. Although McCord’s official title at the CIA was director of security, he was part of the “security research staff”, a unit specialising in covert and illegal operations, reporting directly to Helms. There he worked with David Atlee Phillips, often tagged as a JFK plotter, on the infiltration of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee; Lee Harvey Oswald, the alleged lone assassin of JFK, created his own one-man branch of FPCC in New Orleans, drawing attention to himself as a Castro supporter, which some say was a CIA-style “legend” identity. And O’Sullivan, in Dirty Tricks, quotes a source saying that Alfred Baldwin, a former FBI man brought into Creep by McCord, told him McCord was actually in Dallas the day Kennedy was killed, an allegation also levelled against both Hunt and Phillips. After his release from prison, McCord founded his own security firm, McCord Associates, later called Security International. He taught security at a junior college outside Washington, and later founded a solar energy company in Colorado. In 1974, he published a memoir, A Piece of Tape, with the ambiguous subtitle The Watergate Story: Fact and Fiction.

While many have already made their home more energy efficient, 62% said they wanted to fit solar and a surprisingly high 60% would buy an energy storage device such as those sold by Tesla. An even greater number – 71% – would join a local energy scheme such as a community windfarm or solar panel collective, according to the YouGov survey. The results run counter to the government’s approach to climate change and energy, which favours large-scale power generation such as nuclear plants and offshore windfarms. Community energy projects have flatlined in the face of government subsidy cuts and tax changes, while incentives for household solar will expire next year without a replacement. There is no support for people considering a home battery. James Thornton, CEO of environmental law group ClientEarth, which commissioned the research, said: “Government policy is plainly at odds with public sentiment – and its own ambition to tackle climate change – as far as our energy sources are concerned. “People want to know more and take ownership of how they get their energy – that’s clearly demonstrated by the broad support in the poll for household solar and community energy schemes.” Solar installers have told the Guardian that, increasingly, people are also opting for home batteries when they buy solar. Energy storage is also making inroads at utility scale. On Monday, water company Anglian Water will announce it has bought a 300 kilowatt hour (kWh) storage system from UK-based firm redT, for use at a water treatment site alongside solar panels. Solar was ranked the most popular of all energy sources in the ClientEarth survey, while gas was second worst behind coal. More than two thirds (68%) thought the big six energy suppliers’ market dominance should be broken up to allow smaller clean energy firms to grow. Exactly half said they would move their pensions to avoid fossil fuel investments, a figure that rose to 59% for 18-34 year olds."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"environment/ng-interactive/2020/feb/12/bp-statement-on-reaching-net-zero-carbon-emissions-by-2050-what-it-says-and-what-it-means","type":"interactive","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2020-02-12T15:39:39Z","webTitle":"BP's statement on reaching net zero by 2050 – what it says and what it means","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2020/feb/12/bp-statement-on-reaching-net-zero-carbon-emissions-by-2050-what-it-says-and-what-it-means","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/ng-interactive/2020/feb/12/bp-statement-on-reaching-net-zero-carbon-emissions-by-2050-what-it-says-and-what-it-means","fields":{"headline":"BP's statement on reaching net zero by 2050 – what it says and what it means","bodyText":"BP’s new chief executive, Bernard Looney, has announced plans to make it a net zero company by 2050, and outlined its strategy in a document. The Guardian’s global environment editor, Jonathan Watts, examines what it says – and what it means: BP today set a new ambition to become a net zero company by 2050 or sooner, and to help the world get to net zero. The ambition is supported by 10 aims. Five aims to get BP to net zero: 1. Net zero across BP’s operations on an absolute basis by 2050 or sooner. 2. Net zero on carbon in BP’s oil and gas production on an absolute basis by 2050 or sooner. 3. 50% cut in the carbon intensity of products BP sells by 2050 or sooner. 4. Install methane measurement at all BP’s major oil and gas processing sites by 2023 and reduce methane intensity of operations by 50%. 5. Increase the proportion of investment into non-oil and gas businesses over time. This is a step forward from the company’s current position, but it is too little, too late to tackle the climate crisis. Looney, as CEO of Britain’s biggest oil company, is trying to placate protesters and activist shareholders by promising to reduce the company’s direct carbon emissions (those related to production, transport and other areas of operations) to zero over the next 30 years. Over the same period, BP will also reduce indirect emissions from burning its oil and gas to zero and halve the carbon intensity of the products it sells. But there is nothing in this statement to suggest BP will move away from previous plans to increase oil and gas production by 20% over the next 10 years. That would be a disaster. To keep global heating to a relatively safe level of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, the world needs to slash emissions – mostly from fossil fuels – by half by 2030. Five aims to help the world get to net zero: 6. More active advocacy for policies that support net zero, including carbon pricing. 7. Further incentivise BP’s workforce to deliver aims and mobilise them to advocate for net zero. 8. Set new expectations for relationships with trade associations. 9. Aim to be recognised as a leader for transparency of reporting, including supporting the recommendations of the TCFD. 10. Launch a new team to help countries, cities and large companies decarbonise. BP is responding to criticism that it lobbies against climate action and withholds information about its carbon footprint. In the future, the company says it will encourage staff and trade associations to promote net zero policies. This could be an important shift, but the devil is in the detail (see below). To deliver the ambition, BP will fundamentally reorganise to become a more focused, more integrated company, comprising: · Four business groups to deliver performance and value growth: Production and operations; customers and products; gas and low-carbon energy, and innovation and engineering. · Three integrators to identify and maximise opportunities: Sustainability and strategy; regions, cities and solutions, and trading and shipping. · Four core enablers to support business delivery: Finance; legal; people and culture, and communications and advocacy. BP will reorganise. What this means for the climate will depend on how much authority is given to the divisions related to low-carbon energy and sustainability. If they are left on the fringe, little will change. BP is committed to performing while transforming. No change to BP’s fundamental commitments: · To safe and reliable operations. · To delivering BP’s investor proposition, including commitments on: - growing sustainable free cash flow and shareholder distributions over long term; - maintaining strong financial frame and cost and capital discipline, and deleveraging the balance sheet; - delivering 2021 free cash flow targets. Despite the talk of change, BP is reassuring shareholders that its core priorities are the same, including more dividends. This aims to reassure skittish investors who have got used to the oil company providing the third biggest payouts on the London stock exchange. The big unanswered question is whether this will be achieved as in the past – by increasing production of fossil fuels – or through a new shift to renewables. New purpose and ambition BP’s new CEO, Bernard Looney, today announces a new purpose and a new ambition for the company. BP’s new purpose is reimagining energy for people and our planet. The purpose is underpinned by an industry-leading ambition – for BP to become a net zero company by 2050 or sooner, and to help the world get to net zero – and this ambition is supported by 10 aims. To deliver all this, BP will fundamentally transform its whole organisation, and maintain its commitment to performing while transforming. If the oft-repeated phrase “performing while transforming” is to be anything other than corporate speak, the company will need to do more than reorganise management. It will have to embark on an energy transition. But there are no concrete details here about scaling down production of fossil fuels or scaling up renewables. This will raise concerns that the company thinks it can just plant trees or use other offsets to make up for ever greater petrochemical production. This would not be enough to stabilise the climate. Bernard Looney said: “The world’s carbon budget is finite and running out fast; we need a rapid transition to net zero. We all want energy that is reliable and affordable, but that is no longer enough. It must also be cleaner. To deliver that, trillions of dollars will need to be invested in replumbing and rewiring the world’s energy system. It will require nothing short of reimagining energy as we know it. “This will certainly be a challenge, but also a tremendous opportunity. It is clear to me, and to our stakeholders, that for BP to play our part and serve our purpose, we have to change. And we want to change - this is the right thing for the world and for BP.” This is a clear recognition of the scale of the challenge ahead and it is encouraging that the Irish CEO states oil companies can no longer simply justify themselves as providers of reliable, affordable energy. This has been their fallback position for many years. Helge Lund, BP’s chairman, commented: “Energy markets are changing, driven by climate change, technology and societal expectations, and the board supports Bernard and his new leadership team’s ambition for BP. Aiming for net zero is not only the right thing for BP, it is the right thing for our shareholders and for society more broadly. As we embark on this ambitious agenda, we will maintain a strong focus on safe, reliable and efficient operations and on delivering the promises we have made to our investors.” This highlights the importance of climate protests and the divestment campaign. Social pressure is forcing more investors to recognise the danger of fossil fuels. The BP chairman is acknowledging the company is being pushed into action. In the past year, demonstrators have blocked access to the BP headquarters, called for halts to sponsorship of museums and the arts, and disrupted shareholders’ meetings. The markets are responding. Major investors are starting to pull out of petrochemical firms. One Wall Street analyst recently declared he was “done with fossil fuels”. BP’s new ambition to be a net zero company by 2050 or sooner covers the greenhouse gas emissions from its operations worldwide, currently around 55m tonnes of CO2 equivalent (MteCO2e) a year, and the carbon in the oil and gas that it produces, equivalent currently to around 360 MteCO2e emissions a year - both on an absolute basis. Taken together, delivery of these aims would equate to a reduction in emissions to net zero from what is currently around 415 MteCO2e a year. “This is what we mean by making BP net zero. It directly addresses all the carbon we get out of the ground as well as all the greenhouse gases we emit from our operations. These will be absolute reductions, which is what the world needs. If this were to happen to every barrel of oil and gas produced, the emissions problem for our sector would be solved. But of course, the world is not that simple; the whole energy system has to be transformed and everyone has a contribution to make - producers and sellers of energy, policy makers and everyone who uses energy” - Bernard Looney. Therefore, BP also aims to help its customers reduce their emissions by halving the carbon intensity of the products it sells, again by 2050 or sooner – offering customers more and better choices of low- and no-carbon products. The promise to halve the carbon intensity of products is potentially the most far-reaching part of BP’s new strategy. It recognises that petroleum companies have a responsibility for how their products are used. Until now, they have tried to foist these so-called scope 3 emissions on to consumers. BP also aims to install methane measurement at all of its existing major oil and gas processing sites by 2023 and then reduce the methane intensity of its operations by 50%. And over time BP also aims to increase the proportion of investment it makes into non-oil and gas businesses: “We expect to invest more in low-carbon businesses – and less in oil and gas – over time. The goal is to invest wisely, into businesses where we can add value, develop at scale, and deliver competitive returns” – Bernard Looney. This language on transition to a low-carbon business is disappointingly vague. If “over time” means “after 2030”, then the shift will be too late. This caution may be the result of BP’s previous botched promises to move to solar energy under the leadership of former CEO John Browne. More detail may be forthcoming later this year when the company will unveil its next five-year strategy. The action on methane is welcome but long overdue. Petroleum companies have been under-reporting this extremely potent greenhouse gas and failing to remedy a major cause of climate disruption. The ambition also includes a series of aims targeted at supporting the world’s progress towards net zero: · More actively advocating for policies that support net zero, including carbon pricing; stopping corporate reputation advertising and redirecting resources to promote net zero policies, ideas, actions, collaborations and its own net zero ambition. · Incentivising BP’s global workforce to deliver on the aims and mobilise them to become advocates for net zero; increasing the percentage of remuneration linked to emissions reductions. · Setting new expectations for BP’s relationships with trade associations, making the case for BP’s views on climate change, being transparent where views differ, and being prepared to leave those where alignment cannot be reached. · Being recognised as an industry leader for the transparency of reporting, working constructively with the TCFD and other groups to develop good practices and standards for transparency of reporting. BP today announced its support for the recommendations of the TCFD. · Launching a new team to create integrated clean energy and mobility solutions and to help countries, cities and corporations around the world decarbonise. This would be a very positive step, but BPs past record on greenwashing and lobbying gives little cause for confidence. This oil company reportedly spends more than any of its rivals on influencing politicians and public opinion. BP donated $500,000 to the inauguration of Donald Trump and then pushed the White House to cut environmental regulations. It is also a member of the American Petroleum Institute, a trade organisation that has actively campaigned against climate action and undermined climate science. If BP keeps its promise to use that influence for zero-carbon goals, the political world could change dramatically. The structure of BP’s organisation – and of much of the industry – has been broadly the same for more than a century, split into separate organisations – upstream, downstream, and other businesses. To deliver its new ambition and aims, BP will now undergo a fundamental reorganisation. “We need to reinvent BP. Our historic structure has served us well but, in order to keep up with rapidly evolving customer demands and society’s expectations, we need to become more integrated and more focused. So we are undertaking a major reorganisation, introducing a new structure, a new leadership team and new ways of working for all of us” – Bernard Looney. Under the plans, BP’s existing, largely autonomous business segments - upstream and downstream - will be dismantled and the group reorganised globally into a more focused and more integrated entity, comprising 11 teams. The heads of these teams will make up BP’s new leadership team. Management restructuring that could mean a little or a lot for the climate depending on who is appointed and what power they have. For the moment, this is probably of more interest to staff and shareholders. Performance and value growth will be delivered by four business groups: · Production and operations, led by Gordon Birrell, will be BP’s new operational centre, bringing its operations together, focused on driving safety, efficiency and value growth. · Customers and products, headed by Emma Delaney, will focus on customers as the driving force for the energy products and services of the future, and on customer experience and expansion in rapidly changing markets. · Gas and low-carbon energy, led by Dev Sanyal, will unite energy teams currently dispersed around BP to create focused low-carbon solutions. It will also pursue opportunities in decarbonisation and new value chains such as hydrogen and CCUS. · Innovation and engineering, headed by David Eyton, will bring added momentum to BP’s venturing and Launchpad investments and act as a catalyst for creating value from disruptive opportunities. It will also house BP’s engineering discipline and safety and operational risk team. Three integrators will be established to find and maximise opportunities for BP: · Strategy and sustainability, headed by Giulia Chierchia, who is joining BP from McKinsey, will ensure that sustainability is embedded at the top of BP and provide a single groupwide approach to strategy and capital allocation. · Regions, cities and solutions, led by William Lin, will build relationships with regions, cities and large corporations, aiming to develop integrated energy and carbon solutions that can bring emissions down at scale. · Trading and shipping, led by Carol Howle, will build on BP’s existing deep expertise in its existing business to more effectively help BP capture new commercial opportunities and add value. Four teams will serve as enablers of business delivery: · Finance, led by Murray Auchincloss. · Legal, headed by Eric Nitcher. · People and culture, headed by Kerry Dryburgh. · Communications and advocacy, led by Geoff Morrell. Over the next few months, the new BP leadership team will focus on building their teams and on developing BP’s strategy to deliver the ambition. “Together we will aim to build a more agile, innovative and efficient BP. A purpose-driven, digitally enabled, fully integrated organisation. I’m confident that this new leadership team, together with all our people, have the skill and will to turn BP into a thriving sustainable energy business that is a force for good in a net zero world” – Bernard Looney. These personnel changes are climate positive without being revolutionary. It is good news that the head of alternative energy in BP, Dev Sanyal, appears to have been given more authority. The promise to embed sustainability at the top of BP under Giulia Chierchia sounds nice, but it also contradicts the previous assertion that shareholders (rather than the environment or society) are fundamental. Performing while transforming Despite the planned groupwide programme of change, BP’s fundamental commitments remain unchanged – to safety and to investors. “BP needs to continue to perform as we transform. As committed as I am to making transformation happen, I am equally committed to some fundamental principles that have served us well. Safe and reliable operations will always underpin all we do, and we remain committed to meeting the promises we have made to our shareholders. We can only reimagine energy if we are financially strong, able to pay the dividend our owners depend on and to generate the cash to invest in new low and no-carbon businesses” - Bernard Looney. BP’s commitment to safe and reliable operations is unchanged with safety as a core value. The new structure is expected to underpin and strengthen safety performance. BP also remains committed to its investor proposition of growing sustainable free cash flow and distributions to shareholders over the long term. It continues to be committed to a strong financial frame including deleveraging the balance sheet and maintaining capital discipline, to delivering its free cash flow targets for 2021, and to staying focused on costs and pursuing efficiencies. BP intends to host a capital markets day in September at which the leadership team will set out more information on BP’s strategy and near-term plans. Generating cash to invest in low-carbon business is another key phrase, but what it means for climate will depend how it is done. If the company were to quickly start selling off fossil fuel assets and use the money to pay dividends and invest in renewables, this would be huge step in the right direction. But if it plans to generate more revenue by expanding its fossil fuel business over the next 10 years or more, BP would remain part of the problem rather than part of the solution. Currently, the latter seems more likely. The meeting in September should reveal whether the change is genuine or just more PR fluff. As with the UK government, if BP are serious about climate action, they need to set a 2030 target. Anything else is just kicking the can down the road."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2019/dec/30/airports-gardens-waterfalls-environmental-costs-architects","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2019-12-30T12:00:06Z","webTitle":"Gardens, waterfalls, parks… what is happening to our airports?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/dec/30/airports-gardens-waterfalls-environmental-costs-architects","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2019/dec/30/airports-gardens-waterfalls-environmental-costs-architects","fields":{"headline":"Gardens, waterfalls, parks… what is happening to our airports?","bodyText":"‘We have the confidence and ambition,” announced China’s president, Xi Jinping, to a rapt audience last September, “to forge ahead. The strong pass of the enemy is like a wall of iron, yet with firm strides we are conquering its summit. China can do it!” Patriotic, martial words, fitting for a march-past of tanks and missile launchers. They were, though, spoken at the opening of the vast, all-new civilian airport, Beijing Daxing, the most spectacular yet of a building type that keeps getting bigger and grander. Flying, of course, is an energy-intensive, highly polluting form of travel. One person’s return flight from London to Edinburgh generates more carbon emissions than an average Somalian or Ugandan produces in a whole year. In Sweden, far away from Beijing, the term flygskam, or “flight-shame”, has been coined. It comes with a campaign to encourage people not to fly. In the world’s large and fast-growing economies, however, there is no sign that political leaders are paying any attention. National pride, as well as the convenience and prosperity of their citizens, is at stake. In April, the first phase of the new Istanbul airport, which is planned when complete to be the busiest in the world, became fully operational. “This is not just an airport,” said the posters that announced it, “it’s a monument to victory.” Changi in Singapore, which has long striven to enthral and entertain its users, outdid itself with its new “Jewel” extension to its existing terminals, essentially a shopping mall and nature-based theme park. From a great oculus in its glass roof descends the “rain vortex”, a funnel of falling water described as the “world’s tallest indoor waterfall”. It has a “butterfly garden”. It has the Shiseido Forest Valley, a 900-tree, 60,000-shrub indoor landscape named after the Japanese-based personal care company Shiseido. The forest concept is, in marketing terms, a good fit with its corporate mission: “Beauty innovations for a better world.” There have been large and dramatic airports before, many of them in the hi-tech tradition of Norman Foster and like-minded architects: Renzo Piano at Kansai in Osaka, Richard Rogers and his partners at Heathrow terminal 5 and in Madrid, Foster in Hong Kong and at Beijing Capital airport. (The latter, huge and barely a decade old, was rapidly deemed insufficient to meet demand, which is why Daxing was built.) Most adopt an approach pioneered at Foster’s Stansted in the 1980s, that of the uncluttered, elegant roof soaring over the huddled masses grinding their way through the machinery of check-in, security and duty-free. But, however spectacular they might be, they remain rooted in the idea of modernist architecture that the beauty of a building should come from its structure – those roofs are conceived as poems to engineering. The difference now is that sensation and artifice have overtaken the appearance of functionality. These are buildings that want to put on a show. In Daxing, the late Zaha Hadid was selected, despite little previous experience of designing airports, to work the magic she had previously shown in Galaxy Soho, a curvaceous retail and office development in Beijing. In what turned out to be one of her last projects, she and her office created a great white world of abstracted biomorphs, whose columns and vaults might be the fronds and pads of subaquatic plants or the tendrils of sea creatures. Istanbul’s new airport, designed by the London-based architects Grimshaw, claims to draw on “the architectural character of Istanbul, a city rich with colour, pattern and history since its Byzantine origins”. Jewel Changi airport is designed by the Israeli-Canadian architect Moshe Safdie and his office, who created Singapore’s Marina Bay Sands casino hotel, famous for a 150-metre infinity pool within a 340-metre-long “sky park” perched 57 storeys in the air. Similar tendencies can be found at a smaller scale, with an airport that Foster + Partners are designing to serve the Red Sea Project in Saudi Arabia, the self-described “world’s most ambitious luxury tourism development”. Here, say the architects, the airport will be “an integral part of the visitor experience” with an “oasis landscape” running through it. The design is “inspired by the colours and textures of the desert”, its roofs shaped like dunes. “We have moved away from the traditional air-conditioned air bridges that connect the planes,” Fosters tell me, “and opted for an arrival experience through lush landscaped gardens.” Such airports seek to be more than large pieces of transport equipment. They aim to make air travel an immersive experience as much as a function, a mall or theme park as much as infrastructure. If airports and aeroplanes are usually denatured, with their canned air, their artificial light and their layers of synthetic materials between you and the outside, these models offer you a kind of hyper-nature, confections of foliage and water that you would never quite find in the wild. They offer a new version of the sublime: the scale of Daxing, says Cristiano Ceccato, who led the team at Zaha Hadid Architects who designed it, is like that of the Grand Canyon. It cannot at first be comprehended. It slowly dawns on you. The Jewel is conceived as a destination in its own right, a place to visit even if you are not catching a flight. “We have people coming here to study,” a senior Changi executive told CNN. “We have people coming here on dates. In fact, we always get requests from residents who want to take wedding photos.” It is sometimes pointed out that a modern airport occupies the ground area of a traditional city and has a comparable daytime population. With its shops and parks, and its settings for romance and afternoons out, Changi is taking on more of the functions of a city, too. The wave of airport building is partly a function of demand, especially in the fastest-growing economies of the world. The annual number of air passengers in China has increased from 230 million in 2009 to 611 million in 2018 and is projected to reach 3.5 billion in 2040. Global passenger traffic is expected to double, to 17bn a year, by 2035. These are figures to take your breath and water your eyes. However vast and dominating might seem the current aviation industry and its infrastructure, they will get vaster yet. Airports compete with each other. Hubs such as Singapore and Hong Kong vie for long-haul stopover passengers who might as well be in one place or another – the one with the nicer waterfall or the shortest walking distances might be the determining factor. They want to lead the annual lists of top airports run by, for example, the consultancy Skytrax (awards that Changi has a habit of winning). They are businesses that want to maximise their assets. If retail makes them rich, and if they have the transport facilities to bring millions to their doors, why not add malls to their terminals? But the most lavish airports are not pure creations of the market. They are prestige projects, symbols of national pride particularly beloved of the strongman leaders now in power in many major countries, such as Xi, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in Turkey and Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman in Saudi Arabia. Hence Xi’s speech at the opening of Daxing and an earlier visit when the airport was under construction. The new Istanbul airport is the most conspicuous item of the huge portfolio of development and infrastructure (which also includes the third bridge over the Bosphorus and a 30-mile marine canal) with which Erdoğan has tried to boost both his image and the Turkish economy. The planned Red Sea resort is a pet project of the Saudi crown prince. Daxing and Istanbul were timed to open on politically significant dates, the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China and the 95th anniversary of the proclamation of the Turkish republic, which in the Turkish case led to the airport being opened before it was really finished. “Look how far we’ve come from being a bunch of peasants,” is, according to Cristiano Ceccato, the message, “from the Long March, from people dying in the snow.” It is therefore neither coincidental nor insignificant that the airport lies on what Ceccato calls “the national axis of China”, a line heading south from the throne room of the Forbidden City, through Tiananmen gate and down the middle of the roughly symmetrical street plan of Beijing until it reaches the also symmetrical star-shaped airport. “It is incredibly symbolic to them,” he says, “this is now the first gate of Beijing.” It has been customary for decades for international airports to make more-or-less hokey references to local traditions, the architectural equivalent of the rock star saying: “I love you Stockholm!” The Hajj terminal in Jeddah, completed in 1981 to the designs of the American practice SOM, takes the form of multiple desert tents. The control tower in Istanbul is in the shape of a tulip, Turkey’s national flower. The Western Sydney airport, also designed by Zaha Hadid Architects, will include “aboriginal cultural elements.” Daxing, among other things, is said to take the form of a phoenix, engaged in a conceptual but cosmologically significant dance with Fosters’ dragon-shaped terminal at Beijing Capital airport, which is to the north of the city. But there’s not much doubting the Chineseness of Daxing – the speed of its construction, for example, (less than five years from official approval to its opening) or its scale. The main building at Heathrow’s terminal 5 could fit twice into the central core of Daxing. You could say that the sinuous Hadid style, although not placeable to any one region of the world, has a non-western quality that suits the new world economic order of which Daxing is an expression. The airport is also Chinese in its combination of mass labour and new technology. It took huge gangs of builders, sometimes using hazardous, old-school welding techniques, to put up a complex superstructure that was aligned by lasers and verified by computers. The airport serves what Ceccato calls “a growing entrepreneurial class in China, a very autonomous layer of society very adept at doing business”. They fly a lot. They embrace the digital. And so, in addition to the conventional departure and arrivals levels is a third, located between them, for “self-processing”. Here, once users have registered and had their faces scanned, all further security and ticketing checks are performed seamlessly with facial recognition. If you’re untroubled by this level of control – and what else might you expect in an airport but surveillance? – the system is quick and easy. For Ceccato, the modern airport is an essential component, a “portal” of a new world of mega-cities. “It is not so much that you live in this country or that country,” he says, “but you live in giant urban continuum that is stitched together by air travel.” An airport is creating a time-warp – “if you know how to fly, how to sleep on a plane, you can suddenly be teleported between two points. You’re folding space-time.” He is in awe of the Chinese ability to realise projects like this – “people will call it a dictatorship or a command society but they do get things done” – which he compares with the slowness and expense of building a third runway at Heathrow: “I find that befuddling and quite tragic in a way.” Infrastructure planning by strongman leaders doesn’t, in fact, always go smoothly. Whereas Daxing is integrated with a large rail and road facilities, the new Istanbul airport is awaiting its metro connections. The design of Daxing, with multiple levels in its centre and a radiating plan, keeps walking distances to gates under 10 minutes; there have been numerous complaints at Istanbul of walks of 20 minutes and more. It comes with severe human and environmental costs. There were at least 27 deaths in the construction of Istanbul airport, with the pressure of time cited as a contributory factor. Hundreds of thousands, possibly millions, of trees have been cut down and ecologically rich wetlands destroyed. All for an enterprise whose economic rationale – its projections for passenger numbers, its burden on the national debt, at a time when Turkey is struggling to emerge from recession – has been questioned. “The maths just doesn’t add up,” the economist Bahadır Özgür told the Guardian. “This airport is a perfect symbol of modern Turkey.” Ah yes, the environment. Air travel accounts for about 2.5% of global carbon emissions, which, if it may not sound hugely significant, will become more so if passenger numbers double. Frequent flying, in affluent countries, is often the greatest single contributor to an individual’s output of greenhouse gases. Debate has broken out in the architectural profession following the publication last summer of Architects Declare, a call for action on “the twin crises of climate breakdown and biodiversity loss”. It was rapidly pointed out that the signatories included Zaha Hadid Architects, Foster + Partners and Grimshaw, all of them designers of major airports. Jeremy Till, head of Central St Martins school of art and design called their position “a farce.” “You can’t have a carbon-neutral airport,” he said. Elrond Burrell, a founding signatory of Architects Declare in New Zealand, told the Architects’ Journal that the profession needs to “show moral leadership in the climate emergency: imagine the headline ‘Foster turns down a major airport commission.’” Almost all major airports now come with claims of sustainable design, of harvesting rainwater, for example, or collecting solar energy. Western Sydney airport, say the architects, will incorporate “sustainable design principles across the building’s architecture as well as its construction principles… The project integrates the extensive use of daylight, natural ventilation and water recycling to create a modular, energy-efficient design.” For Fosters, air travel is desirable: it “enables people to forge cultural connections, grow their businesses and see the world”. They add that “most sustainable climate scenarios accepted by the UN acknowledge that the aviation industry must grow over the coming years”. New technologies, they say, will eventually reduce the emissions and consumption of aeroplanes. Meanwhile, the best thing an architect can do is to “take the lead to design the sustainable airports of the future”. It is beyond architects’ power to redesign international travel, goes the argument, so they should apply their skills where they can to the structures that serve it. It is unlikely that the concerns of western architects will have an impact on the growth of Chinese air travel, driven by a newly prosperous generation who, in many cases, are flying for the first time. The concept of flygskam will, hopefully, get established flyers to ask if their flights are really necessary and to find alternative means – a video conference, a train journey – where they can. One might hope that, leading by example, they might offer a version of the good life to be followed around the world, based on the realisation that air travel, with or without fountains and biomorphic architecture, is not actually that pleasant. The much greater likelihood is that the current expansion will carry on regardless. So there will be more Daxings and Changis, possibly bigger, probably more lavish. Their users will be grateful for their convenience and for the freedoms they give them. They might marvel at the oases and the curvy architecture. They won’t much mind feeding their faces into the airport computers, if it smooths their passage. If the building also serves as authoritarian propaganda, they may not notice. Air travel creates a strange version of reality. It is anaesthetising and anxious at once, exciting and boring. It rearranges your expectations of daylight, meal times, mobility and personal space. It elides some differences – between countries, for example – and heightens others, such as the divide between those who do and don’t fly. The new breed of airports take that altered reality and alter it some more, to create their own version of the world. If you want to be dystopian, airports are prototypes for sinister societies of the future, products of the military-entertainment complex where dictatorial government colludes with big business to create controlling environments. Where individuals are pacified by distractions and ruled by technology. If cities and airports really do become identical, that would indeed be scary. Or you could choose to trust that important distinctions will be maintained, contemplate the splendour of the modern airport and enjoy the waterfalls."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2019/apr/11/we-can-talk-about-this-millennial-republicans-take-a-methodical-approach-to-climate-change","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2019-04-12T05:00:40Z","webTitle":"The young Republicans breaking with their party over climate change","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/11/we-can-talk-about-this-millennial-republicans-take-a-methodical-approach-to-climate-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2019/apr/11/we-can-talk-about-this-millennial-republicans-take-a-methodical-approach-to-climate-change","fields":{"headline":"The young Republicans breaking with their party over climate change","bodyText":"Donald Trump’s indifference, punctuated by bursts of mocking disdain, towards climate change has been indulged and even cheered by his supporters. The president has called climate science “bullshit”, donned a coalminer’s helmet at rallies and defenestrated federal rules designed to cut planet-warming emissions. It is becoming harder, however, for Trump to swat away the unfolding crises caused by global warming. American lives are increasingly ravaged by flooding and wildfires and Democrats have seized the initiative with the Green New Deal resolution, which proposes full-scale societal and economic change to eliminate carbon emissions while investing in education, health, transport and a federal jobs guarantee. Now, younger Republicans are breaking with Trump in an attempt to haul their party towards scientific reality. “There’s disagreement there with Donald Trump,” said Tex Fischer, a 22-year-old conservative Ohioan with a head of unruly hair. “I don’t personally know anyone involved in young, right-of-center politics that doesn’t believe climate change is an issue. “I think conservatives for a long time have been too willing to just let this be a leftwing issue. We can talk about this. Conservatives that care about the environment do exist.” Fischer heads campus operations for the American Conservation Coalition (ACC), a Republican youth group founded 18 months ago but already with a presence in 125 colleges across the US, holding events and organizing campaigns. In January, 41 state college Republican chairs signed an ACC letter to GOP leaders urging “action on clean energy and environmental issues” to ensure “conservative values are not lost on the next generation”. On a recent Monday night, the ACC held a campus event at Temple University to extol the virtues of renewable energy. Temple is a predominantly liberal institution based in a city – Philadelphia – that’s of a similar mien. The panel discussion mustered around a dozen attendees, with one wearing a red “Keep America Great” hat. Young Temple conservatives are “subject to severe ridicule and a lot of vitriol from their peers”, said Christopher Smith, president of Temple’s student Republican group. Smith, who is 20, comes from Allentown, Pennsylvania, and sports a sober combination of navy suit, combed hair and sensible spectacles. “People call you white supremacists, Nazis. We’ve all been called that at some point. It’s not nice.” Very few of these taunts are based upon the sharp differences between senior Democrats and Republicans over climate change, however, pointing to a divide that is partially generational. “Trump’s views are definitely more typical of older Republicans than us,” Smith conceded. Almost 60% of millennial Republicans, a cohort that has never experienced a reality other than of record hot years and collapsing glaciers, agree that climate change is already having some effect on the US, according to Pew Research Center polling. Nearly half believe the government isn’t doing enough to ameliorate the damage. Older Republicans, the core of Trump’s support, are substantially less likely to back these stances and are much more enthusiastic about coalmining and offshore oil and gas drilling, with the latter proposition supported by 75% of boomer GOP voters compared with 44% of millennial Republicans. There is no guarantee, of course, that these positions will remain steadfast rather than shift rightward as the newest generation of GOP voters age. With record numbers of Americans expressing alarm over global warming, however, it may be that flat denial of climate science is becoming unmoored from political expediency. The major divisions occur, crucially, when it comes to how to respond to climate change. While the Green New Deal, spearheaded by the charismatic Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, calls for a “10-year national mobilization” on a scale not seen since the second world war to decarbonize the economy, the college Republicans are far more reticent. ACC literature at Temple University calls for a “broad range of limited government and market-based policies”. A booklet called How to Be a Conservative Environmentalist promotes cutting regulations, as well as subsidies, for solar and wind power and allowing the market to continue to grow the clean energy sector. “With Ocasio-Cortez there is this sort of alarmism, like ‘We’re all gonna die in 12 years,’” said Fischer. “We have a more methodical, slower approach … The conversation has been so politicized and so leftwing-dominated that it has put people off. That gives us an opportunity to offer a sensible alternative.” Much like superstitious actors talking backstage at a production of Macbeth, the protagonists in the Temple climate change event dare not mention the subject of their gathering. “Climate change” is not uttered in an hour of discussion, rejected in favour of uncontroversial bromides such as job-creating “energy diversification”, the conservation accomplishments of Teddy Roosevelt and the national security benefits of American-sourced energy. “We love it when market forces produce a better product, right?” said Chad Forcey, head of a conservative clean energy organization, to vigorous nods as he flicked through slides showing the plummeting cost of solar energy. The Green New Deal, Forcey said, is “ridiculous. They’ve blended it with socialism and identity politics. What we’re trying to do is something a lot more practical.” Trump has naturally gone further, falsely claiming the Green New Deal would mean “no more airplanes, no more cows, one car per family”. Republican alternative plans have sprouted from Senator Mike Lee, who suggested having larger families will somehow solve climate change, and his House colleague Matt Gaetz, whose “Green Real Deal” would slash regulations and set no emissions targets. Ocasio-Cortez dismissed Gaetz’s plan as “just so weak” and “so lame”. A major UN report last year found the world must cut greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030 to avoid calamitous warming, a task that will require an enormous upheaval in the way societies create energy, raise food and transport people. The US has been rattled by record hurricanes and wildfires in the past two years, with government scientists predicting increasingly punishing storms, crop failures and coastal inundation. Thousands of people are set to perish in heatwaves. The US Government Accountability Office calculates climate impacts cost the federal government $350bn in the past decade, with economic losses on course to hit $500bn every year by the close of the century. A modest tax on carbon emissions, backed by some conservatives, is unlikely to be enough to dodge this future. “If there was a free market solution to the climate crisis we would’ve seen it in the last 40 years,” said Varshini Prakash, the 25-year-old founder of Sunrise Movement, the youth-led group allied to Ocasio-Cortez that helped spawn the Green New Deal. “We don’t have decades to wait, we need to do it in the next decade. “People are dying from the climate crisis right now. The truly irrational thing to do would be continue on the current trajectory and allow 150 million climate refugees and the complete obliteration of coral reefs.” Prakash was a campus climate activist herself while at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. “There wasn’t really a robust conversation” with college Republicans on the issue, she recalls. There’s a realization on both sides, however, that the Green New Deal and growing public concern has cracked open the debate, to the odd degree that Trump reportedly will attempt to campaign on climate change in the 2020 presidential election. “Young people see the denialism and corruption of Republicans and the insufficiency of action by Democrats. They are fed up with it and want to call it out,” Prakash said. “This is a generational thing. People saying ‘wait your turn, we’ve got this’ frankly don’t see the urgency because they won’t be around for it. It’s quite obvious that they haven’t got it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2019/jun/08/john-browne-engineering-fracking-greta-thunberg-huawei","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2019-06-08T14:00:05Z","webTitle":"Ex-BP boss John Browne: ‘It’s going to take a long time to take oil and coal out of the energy system’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/08/john-browne-engineering-fracking-greta-thunberg-huawei","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2019/jun/08/john-browne-engineering-fracking-greta-thunberg-huawei","fields":{"headline":"Ex-BP boss John Browne: ‘It’s going to take a long time to take oil and coal out of the energy system’","bodyText":"Before standing down in 2007, John Browne was CEO of BP for 12 years. In 2015, he returned to the global oil business as executive chairman of L1 Energy. Since leaving BP, he has written five books; in the latest, he argues that engineers will save humanity from the threats such as disease, artificial intelligence and global warming. You say that civilisation is founded on engineering innovation and technology. Do you equate human progress with machines? Absolutely not. It is the combination of the machines, the engineering and humans that makes progress. Without engineering, there will not be progress, but machines without humans will go nowhere. Do you understand the widespread public fear of unfettered technologies? Yes. Some engineering advances are not good for humans until they are confined in the right way.Some have really bad, unintended consequences. There are plenty I fear. The uncontrolled use of fissile material to make bombs is terrifying, so too [the release of] pathogens. There are problems with poisonous gases used by dictators, materials getting into the hands of rogue states. Modern technology has given immense wealth and power to the very few and has allowed global surveillance and the erosion of privacy. Is that acceptable? These are worrying. But they lead back to the control of the technology and the question of the expression of values. So, surveillance and face recognition are something heavily controlled in the west. In China, they are not. Stanford University has developed a technology that can recognise, to a probability of 80%, gay people from straight. This is not a good thing to have. I say that as a gay man. I find it objectionable, too, that in China facial recognition technology is used to identify certain ethnic peoples and keep them under control. That is wrong. There will be aberrations, but [facial recognition] has been very beneficial across the world, whether it is for law enforcement, the convenience of people to pay, or to get in and out of buildings. But there are other things which have gone wrong unintenionally, or are in hands of wrong people. Will engineering get us out of the problems we face? I am optimistic. Engineering is the application of discovery into life. It has done extraordinary things for the world. It has made it more peaceful, less violent, safer, cleaner. People live longer, they are better educated, there’s less poverty. All these things have been brought about by engineering. Engineers have saved more lives than physicians; they have created clean water. In my lifetime, the world population has tripled and people are healthier and better off than they used to be when the world was one third its size. But has technology not also made the world less secure? You are chair of the UK board of Chinese company Huawei, the world leader in 5G technology. Will 5G technology undermine British or American security? It depends on your level of risk. The UK government has, apparently, said you can divide the system into high- and low-risk areas. If you keep certain technologies low risk they are happy with that, whereas others will say take no risk. The problem started with the break-up of the Bell Labs, which did the early research on telecoms. The pieces were sold off and we have ended up with the US not having a commercial approach to 5G. It’s in the hands of only Nokia, Ericsson and Huawei. It’s not an easy position for the world to be in and [it remains] to be seen if there’s a way out of it. President Trump wound Huawei into a trade war, so is it part of a trade war or a security war? It’s very difficult to resolve. The big thing with technologies is to overcome the legacy of the past. Many people have vested interests in keeping the past going because they make money with it. Is not oil a legacy of the past? Not as old as coal, which is still a big part of the energy mix. But you have spent a lifetime working with fossil fuels that have led to the climate crisis. … and trying to change. Have you succeeded? I’ve been a little bit successful. I wish I had been much more successful. Because 22 years ago I made a very clear statement, to say the oil and gas industry was part of the problem, so it had better start working out how to solve it. What would you say to Greta Thunberg? I would say that I have been at this for longer than you’ve been on the planet and that [decarbonisation] will take time. And so my proposal is this: remember that energy is a very big system and there is not one solution. We can’t have one magic bullet that will make the solution work for us. We need to take all the things people are doing [to reduce emissions] because it will be very difficult to persuade them to change. China is opening up brand new coal mines to feed India. What happens in the UK is actually not very important. It’s what happens in places like China, Indonesia and India that will really count. Because we will need coal, oil and gas, we need to do everything we can to decarbonise the emissions. This is critical for the future. You know the problems of climate change but you are now chair of the oil and gas investment company L1 Energy and still in the oil business. Gas and oil. I created a company that is 70% natural gas and 30% oil. Gas has less carbon, it is much more environmentally friendly and has lots of different uses. That is much more modern than the other way round. How are you working to reduce emissions? When I was with BP, I laid out a plan. But BP is producing more oil now than it was… And I have been away a little while. Then I set up the world’s largest renewable energy fund, $10bn of investment to prove to people you could make money from doing this. It’s going to take us a long time to take oil and coal out of the energy system and even longer for natural gas. We have the tools to take a lot of the carbon out of hydrocarbons; what we don’t have is the right cost. The more you do of something, normally, the cheaper it gets, with the exception of nuclear power [where] the more you make, the more expensive it becomes. That can be overcome with standardisation. Governments have to take the first risk [to reduce emissions] which is very high and industry will take the second risk, which is getting lower and lower. That’s what happened with solar energy, which is an important but small part of the energy system. But you are arguing in the book for fracking. You were chair of fracking company Cuadrilla. Does that make sense? No, fracking in the UK doesn’t make much sense. I think it was a test to see if it worked. We probably don’t need to do it. Can we reduce emissions fast enough to avoid the frightening scenarios that are forecast? If we get on with it now, we stand a chance. If we don’t start now, the chances get lower and lower. I said 22 years ago that we should start then. We have done something but not enough. Is the quest of humanity that we move to another planet? Who knows? James Lovelock changed my views. He reminds me that we’re not trying to save this planet, but simply the humans on this planet. The planet will look after itself. It will have its course of life. What we are doing is adjusting its path. We will go. It will come back. Does that justify wrecking it? Absolutely not. It just puts it in perspective that we have to do something to keep it ready for human beings. Because if we don’t do things, we are simply consigning a portion, if not all, of humanity, to its death. That is wrong. Are you saying that the planet is for humanity? Surely we have a responsibility for the rest of life? That is what I am saying. We are stewards because humanity must live on this planet. Humans are designed to live in an atmosphere with a certain amount of oxygen. If we go elsewhere, we are not well tuned to that. We’ve got to figure out how to create a built-in environment to protect us. That will be difficult. • Make, Think, Imagine: Engineering the Future of Civilisation by John Browne is published by Bloomsbury (£25). To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com.

Frail of body but still sharp of mind, the 87-year-old architect was something of a countercultural guru by this stage, thanks to his “spaceship Earth” philosophy and his forward-looking designs, not least the dome. Lightweight, efficient, simple to construct and futuristic, domes became a hippy cliche in the 70s, but the New Alchemists’ dome was a little different. Designed by Fuller’s disciple Jay Baldwin, it was the first “pillow dome”: made of triangular panels of transparent plastic inflated with argon gas, which improved its insulation properties (the same technology is behind Cornwall’s Eden Project). Inside the pillow dome was a miniature forest of plants, tropical fish ponds and a ripening fig tree. Fuller nodded with approval. “He said, ‘She’s beautiful,’” recalls Nancy Jack Todd, co-founder of the New Alchemy Institute (NAI), along with her husband John. “He turned around and said to John with this happy smile: ‘This is what I’ve always wanted to see: my architecture with your biology.’ He called the work we were doing ‘the hope of the world’.” Founded in 1969, the NAI set out to design a sustainable way of living from top to bottom: food, energy and shelter. This was the era of Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring, James Lovelock’s Gaia hypothesis, and the Whole Earth Catalog (of which Baldwin was an editor). It was the era of anti-nuclear and anti-Vietnam war movements; a time when huge numbers of people felt that modern society was on the wrong path, and better alternatives were possible. “I wouldn’t say we were on the same page as Bucky,” John Todd says, “but we came to the same conclusions. His basic message, about how to do more with less, really resonated with us.” The New Alchemists’ alternative was a harmonious system of organic farming, renewable energy, sustainable architecture, waste treatment and ecosystem restoration. No pesticides or chemicals, no fossil fuels, no waste, no pollution, low impact, energy efficient. In other words, they were doing 50 years ago what we’re now realising we should have been doing all along. Despite their long hair and countercultural leanings, the New Alchemists were not hippies; they were scientists. John Todd, the driving force behind the NAI, is a marine biologist by training; his wife Nancy is a writer and activist, and the third founding member, Bill McLarney, is a fish biologist. True, their large-format journals of the time have a quaint, radical vibe to them, with their intricate hand-drawn covers depicting unicorns and dragons. But alongside quotations from Tolkien and poems about mushrooms are reports on their experiments on the insect-resistance of certain cabbage varieties, diagrams of their low-tech wind turbines or progress reports on aquaculture techniques. Nor was the NAI a “commune”. It was a research project, the Todds explain; people came there to work, not to play. At its peak, the NAI had around 30 members, aided by hundreds more temporary volunteers. Few actually lived on the site. There were no experiments in common ownership or free love. The Todds and their three young children lived in a small cottage a few miles away, where they still live today. “Socially, we agreed, the three of us founders, that we wanted to lead private lives,” Nancy says. “We felt that there were too many revolutions underneath it already without trying to do a social one as well.” Besides, John adds, “Being somewhat reserved Canadians, there is not a lot of gossip or juicy stories.” The catalyst for the NAI was frustration with academia, John says. In the late 60s, he and McLarney both began teaching at San Diego State University, where John was to head up a new department of environmental studies. He soon hit a wall of institutional inflexibility: “The idea of doing activities from various disciplines – energy, architecture, agriculture, waste water, you name it – was simply not possible within the university setting at that time. A number of people, who became very close friends, were coming to the same conclusion: that we had to find new institutional structures to go after a larger vision.” The Todds and McLarney quit academia, found new jobs at an oceanographic institute in Cape Cod and started to put their New Alchemist ideas into practice on a 12-acre plot of land. The first objective was agriculture. They set about improving the soil quality and planting food crops. They began breeding rabbits and digging fish ponds. McLarney introduced the then-unheard-of tilapia, an easily farmable fish. Other friends and colleagues came to join them. A 1973 film made by the National Film Board of Canada portrays the NAI as an Arcadian utopia: a lush, green world of healthy, happy people tending healthy, happy crops. They build wind turbines out of car parts and oil drums, swim in the pond, gather for communal outdoor meals, scavenge at the local dump and play guitars together in the sunset. It almost looks like a parody. The NAI’s approach was a combination of old-fashioned common sense and modern scientific method. Everything was monitored and recorded: weather conditions, soil chemistry, crop yields, numbers of midge larvae (used as fish food) growing in different qualities of water. Data was analysed, techniques were compared, processes were refined, until their organic yields exceeded those of industrial farms. But underpinning it all was John’s belief that natural systems could be duplicated, harnessed and harmoniously interlinked. The wind pumps the water, that waters the garden, that grows the carrots, that feed the rabbits, that fertilise the earthworms, that feed the fish, along with the carrot tops. And it all feeds the people. “Each time we make a connection, as in nature itself, the whole becomes more stable, more strong and more healthy,” John says in the film. In one significant, typically low-tech breakthrough, John began to experiment with 5ft translucent cylindrical water tanks – filling them with pond water and observing the miniature ecosystems that formed inside. As the tanks received more sunlight than a pond would, algae and other life grew much quicker. They were perfect for cultivating fish in (tilapia eat the algae). You could link them together and water would become progressively cleaner as it flowed from one to the next. You could grow vegetables hydroponically on their surface. Most importantly, the water heated up in the sun, so the tanks became an effective store of solar energy – “thermal flywheel”, as John puts it. All of this fed into the New Alchemists’ approach to more complex architecture. Where Le Corbusier famously decreed that a house is a “machine for living”, the New Alchemists believed it should be more like a “living machine” – a combination of architecture and biology. “Our first little experiment used a geodesic structure to literally create a miniature world,” John says, explaining a 1971 forerunner of the pillow dome, which they built over a fish pond. “Inside the structure, the air was the atmosphere; the water was analogous to the 70% oceans the Earth needs to maintain a stable climate; the remaining 30% was a quite complex ecosystem, considering the size of the project. So we were already using the Earth as a model for design.” The New Alchemists’ most ambitious structures were what they called “arks” – two experiments into the “shelter” aspect of their mission. Two young architects from Yale University, David Bergmark and Ole Hammarlund, led the design: one ark in Cape Cod and another on Prince Edward Island, Canada, thanks to a commission from the Canadian government. The Prince Edward Island ark, on a windblown promontory surrounded by the sea on three sides, was the New Alchemists’ architectural high point. We would recognise it today as a show-home for “off-grid” living, employing sustainable design principles that are now common practice but were nascent, untested technologies at the time. Aligned east-west, the Prince Edward Island ark was partly sunken into the earth on its north side, with sloping glazing along its south facade to capture maximum solar radiation. The south facade also featured a row of vertically aligned solar collectors (heating water rather than generating electricity – photovoltaic technology was nowhere near advanced enough yet). A prototype hydraulic wind turbine nearby covered the building’s electricity needs. The dominant space inside was a high-ceilinged greenhouse containing plant beds for growing vegetables, herbs, flowers and tree saplings. Lizards, newts, ladybirds and even a resident snake controlled insect populations. The ark also contained 32 of Todd’s “solar-algae tanks” – primarily for fish cultivation, but the tanks proved so effective at storing heat that the building’s other experimental climate systems became redundant. “We were growing bananas in January,” says Todd. When a winter storm caused a three-day power cut and buried the landscape in snow, the ark remained a stable temperature inside. About one-third of the ark was a home, where the Todds’ New Alchemist friend Nancy Willis and her family lived happily for a time, growing their own produce and managing the “living machine”. Though light and spacious, the ark was not the stuff of high-end design aesthetically, but it represented a potential new way of living – sustainable, self-sufficient, integrated with nature on an intimate scale. Shelter, food, energy. Perhaps a social revolution after all. The Prince Edward Island ark was opened in September 1976 by Canadian prime minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau (father of current PM Justin), who arrived by helicopter with much fanfare to find a bunch of dirty, exhausted New Alchemists who had completed the build hours before. Trudeau gave a stirring speech about how the ark was “the birth of the new philosophy” and told the Todds he would like to have a similar house for his own family. “Very close by was a nuclear plant,” Nancy recalls, “so I said to him, ‘All of this makes nuclear energy completely unnecessary, doesn’t it?’” Trudeau’s answer was noncommittal. The fate of the Prince Edward Island ark mirrors that of not only the NAI itself, but the whole sustainability movement of the 70s. Functionally, the building exceeded expectations. The hydraulic wind turbine proved to be a failure and the solar collectors leaked, but the “living machine” was alive and well, drawing visitors, spreading the sustainability gospel and growing enough vegetables and fish to sell surplus to local restaurants. But politically, the winds were changing. By 1981, their Canadian government allies were no longer in office and financial support dried up. After numerous rescue attempts, the ark was converted into a small hotel and restaurant in the early 80s. Around 2000, it was demolished. A similar change of sentiment hobbled the NAI in Cape Cod. During the 70s, it had been funded by a series of grants from the US government and private foundations. But as the Reagan era set in, those funds became harder to access. The sentiment became more “me” than “we”. The hippies cut their hair, abandoned their geodesic domes and found proper jobs. The NAI survived Reaganism, but much of its energy through the 80s went into merely staying afloat, rather than “pushing the vision”, as John puts it. It eventually dissolved in 1991. But the New Alchemists found other ways to push their vision. McLarney founded an offshoot of the institute in Costa Rica, named ANAI, which has transformed the country’s southern Caribbean coast and become a model for conservation and sustainable development. Architects Bergmark and Ole remained in the Prince Edward Island region practising sustainable design. The New Alchemists’ Cape Cod plot was turned into a co-housing project, complete with a refurbished ark. John Todd retreated from architecture and returned to his first love: water. Those experiments with solar-algae tanks put him on a path of environmental restoration, using natural systems to improve water quality and remove pollution. He realised a long time ago what the world is just beginning to realise now: that ecosystem restoration is key to stabilising the climate, and nature itself can help provide the answers. In 1982 the Todds founded a new initiative, Ocean Arks International, researching and applying this knowledge in multiple situations, from natural wastewater treatment to ocean-going eco-repair vessels to an ambitious project to re-green the Sinai desert (it even involves geodesic domes). It is a continuation of what the New Alchemists began, John says: “Doing good things in bad places.” Rather than feeling bleak about the future, he is surprisingly optimistic.

Fund opponents say it is the latest evidence that design flaws in the scheme are leading to taxpayers’ money being wasted on projects that are commercially viable even without public support. In some cases, the climate funding is going to new fossil fuel projects on the grounds that they are cleaner than the dirty projects they replace. National greenhouse gas emissions have risen each year since the fund, billed by the then-prime minister Tony Abbott as a “direct action” policy, replaced a carbon pricing scheme in 2014. South African mining company Gold Fields is receiving climate funding for a gas-fired station to power the underground Granny Smith mine in outback Western Australia. According to its annual reports, it has received $126,000 and expects to get about $1m over seven years. Gold Fields built the gas plant to replace a diesel-fired generator after it was announced a new gas pipeline would be laid to supply the nearby Tropicana mine. It qualified for the emissions reduction fund because burning gas emits less carbon dioxide than diesel. To qualify to bid into the emissions reduction fund, projects are meant to deliver emissions cuts that would not have happened without public money. But a Gold Fields spokesman told Guardian Australia that it would have built the gas plant regardless of support from the fund. “The investment would have been made, but at the time there was a risk that gas prices could have risen in the future, like we have seen recently on the east coast of Australia. When the investment decision was made, the [fund] was considered a partial mitigation against future price escalation,” the spokesman said. Kelly O’Shanassy, the chief executive of the Australian Conservation Foundation, which has been investigating the fund’s operation, said it was beyond parody that public money earmarked to cut emissions had been handed to a giant gold miner to burn gas for a project it would have built anyway. She said the project may add to damage to the climate by locking the miner into gas ahead of a more rapid shift to renewable energy. Gold Fields recently announced it would be installing solar power and batteries at the mine site to use alongside gas. “Australians should rightly ask whether allocating more money to the emissions reduction fund at this time will mean more cash for big industrial players to burn coal, oil and gas,” O’Shanassy said. “A program like the emissions reduction fund has a role to encourage farmers and landowners to cut pollution, plant more trees and protect vegetation, but methods that pay large corporations to make at best minor changes must be scrapped before any more cash is tipped in.” The $2.55bn fund works as a reverse auction, supporting the projects that promise the cheapest emissions cuts. Payments are made once the cuts are delivered. Across eight auctions, taxpayers have paid out $476m and committed another $1.8bn, with $226m left unspent. On Monday the prime minister, Scott Morrison, promised another $2bn over 10 years to partner with farmers, local governments and businesses to deliver “practical climate solutions” across the economy that reduce emissions. He said the government was committed to “meaningful, practical action” to reduce emissions and would meet its 2030 target of a 26-28% cut in pollution below 2005 levels. Most projections before Monday’s announcement, which also included a commitment to new investments in pumped hydro power and a yet-to-be-released electric vehicle strategy, have found it was not on track to meet the target. “We will continue to play our part in meeting the global challenge of climate change in the 21st century,” Morrison said. Guardian Australia recently reported that the Vales Point coalmine has been registered under the fund for a project to upgrade some turbines, a project that would reduce its emissions by just 1.3% over a decade. It may yet not qualify to bid into the auction as the project will not reduce its emissions intensity below the average of the national grid. But the revelation that a coal plant could qualify for climate funding sparked campaigns from environment groups calling for the scheme to be changed. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has estimated that putting the world on a pathway to limiting global warming to 1.5C and avoiding more significant climate change requires coal use for energy to be cut 59-78% below 2010 levels by 2030. Several problems with the emissions reduction fund have been identified. The bulk of the money has gone to landowners promising to restore or protect carbon stores in vegetation and the land, but across the country deforestation is outpacing habitat restoration by a rate of five to one. It was found landfill sites that capture and burn leaking methane – another regular recipient of contracts under the fund – would have existed without taxpayer support. Many of these problems were predicted. While on the backbench in 2010, Malcolm Turnbull branded the fund “a recipe for fiscal recklessness on a grand scale” and let the fund dwindle. Once prime minister, he let the fund dwindle to almost nothing and promoted alternatives such as the national energy guarantee, which was opposed by conservatives and dumped by Morrison once he assumed the leadership. In the case of Gold Fields, the company has announced that it is expanding both the Granny Smith mine and the gas plant as well as installing solar and batteries. It said the shift would cut its gas use by 10–13%, but the gas plant needed to be expanded to meet increased demand for ventilation, cooling and dewatering at night. The company’s spokesman said it would receive large-scale generation certificates through the national renewable energy target for the solar energy it generates, but the projected future value of the certificates was not encouraging for future clean power investment in Australia. Asked if the company thought helping large businesses shift to a cleaner form of fossil fuels was a good use of climate funding, the spokesman said the few off-grid renewable energy mining projects in Australia to date have had some form of government support. “Without government enabling these early adopters, the movement to cleaner energy will take much longer,” he said. But he said Gold Fields was demonstrating it was feasible to invest in large-scale solar without additional support."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/jan/18/stuart-wenham-scientists-pay-tribute-to-einstein-of-solar-world","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-18T06:12:29Z","webTitle":"Stuart Wenham: scientists pay tribute to 'Einstein of solar world'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/18/stuart-wenham-scientists-pay-tribute-to-einstein-of-solar-world","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jan/18/stuart-wenham-scientists-pay-tribute-to-einstein-of-solar-world","fields":{"headline":"Stuart Wenham: scientists pay tribute to 'Einstein of solar world'","bodyText":"Australia’s scientific community has paid tribute to Prof Stuart Wenham, a solar energy pioneer described as the “Einstein of the solar industry”, whose research increased the efficiency of solar cells a hundredfold. Wenham passed away on 23 December, age 60, after suffering from malignant melanoma. He was the director of the Centre of Excellence for Advanced Photovoltaics and Photonics at the University of New South Wales. Colleagues and friends remembered him as a brilliant scientist and kind mentor whose work revolutionised the affordability of solar energy around the world. He won the Australia prize – the nation’s pre-eminent science prize – in 1999, after holding the world record for solar efficiency for decades along with his mentor Martin Green. His invention of advanced hydrogenation technology boosted the efficiency of solar cells a hundredfold, and won him the UK Institution of Engineering and Technology’s AF Harvey Engineering prize in 2013. One of Wenham’s PhD students, Shi Zhengrong, founded the company Suntech Power in 2001 and, with Wenham as chief technology officer, it became the world’s largest solar cell manufacturer. His UNSW colleague Dr Matthew Edwards hailed him as an “unassuming man” known and loved for “his Crocodile Dundee persona”. “[He] took students to Nepal and Nicaragua to set up solar for communities in need of clean water and power, wrote fundamental solar textbooks, started the first and still only specialised photovoltaic degree in the world,” he said. “He won pretty much every award under the sun except the Nobel, which I wouldn’t have been surprised to see heading his way if he were still here. “He was the Einstein of the solar world and it’s hard to put into words his contribution to the planet.” UNSW’s dean of engineering, Prof Mark Hoffman, said: “Stuart Wenham will be remembered for his selfless and continuous efforts to make the world a better place to live.” Zhengrong described him as “a great global solar leader who made solar affordable and accessible to everyone”, while Australia’s Smart Energy Council praised him as “an unsung Australian hero”. Born in 1957, Wenham grew up in Bexley North in Sydney and graduated from UNSW in 1981 with the university medal in electrical engineering. With Dr Bruce Godfrey, he set up Australia’s first solar cell manufacturing line. His research always aimed at increasing the uptake of solar power by reducing costs and boosting efficiency. “The main barrier to widespread use has always been one of cost,” he said after receiving his Australia prize in 1999. “10 years ago, I expressed considerable scepticism as to the likelihood of solar panels appearing on significant numbers of rooftops … Now I believe it is only a matter of time.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/may/16/leaked-report-warns-cambodias-biggest-dam-could-literally-kill-mekong-river","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-16T06:00:42Z","webTitle":"Leaked report warns Cambodia's biggest dam could 'literally kill' Mekong river","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/16/leaked-report-warns-cambodias-biggest-dam-could-literally-kill-mekong-river","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/may/16/leaked-report-warns-cambodias-biggest-dam-could-literally-kill-mekong-river","fields":{"headline":"Leaked report warns Cambodia's biggest dam could 'literally kill' Mekong river","bodyText":"A Chinese-backed plan to build Cambodia’s biggest dam could “literally kill” the Mekong river, according to a confidential assessment seen by the Guardian which says that the proposed site at Sambor is the “worst possible place” for hydropower. The report, which was commissioned by the government in Phnom Penh, has been kept secret since it was submitted last year, prompting concerns that ministers are inclined to push ahead regardless of the dire impact it predicts on river dolphins and one of the world’s largest migrations of freshwater fish. The proposed hydropower plant would require an 18km-wide barrier across the river at Sambor, Kratie province. This quiet rural district is best known as a place for watching Irrawaddy dolphins, whose critically low numbers have just shown their first increase in 20 years. To examine the environmental impact of the dam and the 82km-long reservoir that would form behind it, the Cambodian government commissioned the National Heritage Institute, a US-based research and consultancy firm, to undertake a three-year study in 2014. But it has refused to make public the results of the Sambor Hydropower Dam Alternatives Assessment, despite numerous appeals from civil society organisations. A copy has now been leaked to the Guardian. In its key findings the report notes: “The impact on fisheries would be devastating as it would block fish migration from the Tonle Sap (Cambodia’s Great Lake), a vital tributary to the Mekong and the spawning grounds upstream.” The Mekong is the world’s most productive inland fisher y, sustaining the food security of 60 million people. The Mekong River Commission puts the value of wild-capture fish at $11b n, shared between the four member states of Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam. The stakes are very high for a country where 80% of Cambodians count on fish as their main source of protein. It is also a potential game-changer for other species in the Mekong’s ecosystem. Marc Goichot, WWF’s water resources specialist, said: “After 15 years WWF and our Cambodian partners are finally winning the battle to conserve Mekong dolphins with 15 new calves born since 2015. A Sambor dam would ruin all those efforts. Together with the plight of the dolphins, fisheries, livelihoods and nutrition of rural communities would all suffer, as well as precipitating the sinking of the Mekong delta in Vietnam.” The plan for the dam dates back to a memorandum of understanding signed with China Southern Power Grid in 2006. Widespread opposition prompted the Chinese investor to withdrew from the project in 2008. The country’s chronic energy shortage, high prices and its 50% import dependency prompted the government to revive the Sambor project in 2016, after Laos had already launched two controversial dams upstream - the Xayaburi and the Don Sahong dams. In the executive summary, the report declares “a dam at this site could literally kill the river, unless sited, designed and operated sustainably. The Sambor reach is the worst possible place to build a major dam.” Cambodia’s deputy minister of energy, Ith Praing , said: “It is a very sensitive issue and too early to publish any kind of information on Sambor.” The survey team looked at 10 alternative locations for a Sambor dam site by deploying the world’s most advanced mitigation technology. The project director, Gregory Thomas, said: “Even the most advanced mitigation measures still pose high risks. There is no evidence that any large dam on a tropical river has ever been successful in the use of the latest fish mitigation technology.” In place of a new dam, the study recommends integrating floating solar photovoltaic panels into the already operational Lower Sesan 2 dam , and operating the reservoir as a single integrated hybrid facility. Power capacity would be doubled to more than 800MW. This technique of augmenting existing hydropower facilities with solar photovoltaics plants has been widely developed in China and India. According to the report, “solar energy is the only option with a positive net economic benefit after all costs and benefits are taken into account, and the cost of solar would be cheaper than the best possible mitigated dam”. Cambodia’s Energy Ministry has so far taken only small steps in the direction of solar energy, and has given a tepid response to the 400MW solar proposal, which suggests it is still batting for a mitigated dam. Praing said no decision would be taken until after July’s general election. If the dam is approved, the leading candidate to build it is China’s Hydrolancang International Energy Company."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2019/jan/14/australia-could-hit-100-renewables-much-sooner-than-most-people-think","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2019-01-13T23:17:59Z","webTitle":"Australia could hit 100% renewables sooner than most people think | Nicky Ison","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/14/australia-could-hit-100-renewables-much-sooner-than-most-people-think","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/14/australia-could-hit-100-renewables-much-sooner-than-most-people-think","fields":{"headline":"Australia could hit 100% renewables sooner than most people think","bodyText":"Not since the invention of the steam engine have we seen the pace of change occurring in energy systems around the world. In Australia our electricity system is changing rapidly, from new technologies and business models to changes in policy and perhaps even regulation. As the year begins, here are five energy trends you should expect to see in 2019. 1. More action towards 100% renewable energy Last year was a boom year for renewables. Despite rhetoric from some political quarters talking up coal and talking down renewable energy, we installed more solar panels and wind turbines than ever before. There are at least 40 large-scale wind and solar projects in construction in Australia, totalling over 6000MWs of new generation capacity. This means renewables will continue on a steep growth curve as analysis by the Melbourne University Climate and Energy College shows. This rapid growth in renewables and soon battery storage is at least in part driven by a corresponding reduction in cost. Bloomberg New Energy Finance analysis reveals a compound annual reduction in cost of battery storage of 21% over eight years. Facts such as these are the engine driving us towards 100% renewables at a pace much faster than most pundits think. At a political level California has just legislated a move to 100% renewables, while at home South Australia, Tasmania and the ACT are on track to be net 100% renewables in the next few years. With everyone from tech billionaires to school students demanding 100% renewables, pressure for a more rapid shift to renewables is likely to continue to build. Many still think that 100% renewables can’t be done. In 2017 ANU, Energy Networks Australia and CSIRO joined the ranks of Australia’s leading institutions on energy that have now done their own plans to show Australia can reliably achieve 100% renewables. This takes the number of 100% renewables plans for Australia to more than 10. In the corporate sector, global initiative The RE100 has arrived in Australia. This initiative which encourages companies to commit to 100% renewables has seen global companies headquartered outside of Australia such as Carlton United Breweries and Ikea lead the way. In late 2018 Commonwealth Bank became the first Australian company to join, signing a large power purchase agreement in the process. 2. Solar for renters and other locked-out energy users The coverage of rooftop solar hit two million roofs in 2018 – a huge achievement considering a decade ago there were less than 100,000 roofs with solar panels on them. However, while households and businesses that own a sunny roof can now benefit from greater energy independence, lower electricity bills and that good feeling of lessening their climate pollution, there are at least 30% of households that cannot put solar on their roof. These households rent, live in apartments, cannot afford the upfront cost or have shaded roofs. Research by startup incubator Energy Lab found that only 4% of rental properties and 4% of apartments have solar on the roof, compared with 29% of owner-occupied households and 38% of owner-occupied standalone houses. For a long time these households have been in the too-hard basket for policymakers and industry alike. However, there are signs that in 2019 this could be changing. The Victorian and South Australian governments have announced policies to support 50,000 rental properties to access solar, and for South Australia, batteries also. In NSW the government is trialling a program of solar for 15,000 low-income energy rebate customers. These are small steps, but if scaled could start to change the current trend towards solar energy haves and have-nots. 3. Community energy going gangbusters Communities are also taking matters into their own hands, developing innovative community-owned clean energy projects and implementing plans to move to 100% renewables. Despite a lack of interest from mainstream energy players and little policy support, Australia’s community energy sector has grown to more than 105 groups and 174 operating projects. Most famously the communities of Yackandandah and Daylesford. Last year Totally Renewable Yackandandah in independent Cathy McGowan’s electorate of Indi set up a community retailer Indigo Power to help it on its way to 100%. In Daylesford, flagship community energy enterprise Hepburn Wind is planning a solar farm and received a Victorian government grant to help them progress. 4. A battle between good and bad hydrogen Hydrogen fuel is not a new idea, yet in 2019 hydrogen is likely to make significant strides towards becoming a major part of our global energy ecosystem. Last September, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency funded 16 renewable hydrogen projects to the tune of $22m, aimed at helping to drive down costs and create a supply chain. Renewable hydrogen could be huge, using excess wind and solar to split water, create hydrogen and export it to sunshine- and land-constrained countries like Japan and South Korea as a renewable fuel for industry and heavy transport. However, hydrogen has also been latched on to by the coal and gas industries. Hydrogen fuel can be created from coal, but generates carbon pollution in the process. Hydrogen can also be injected into the gas grid, up to a certain level (with upgrades), which could help prevent gas pipelines become stranded assets as households and industry increasingly electrify. The question is will hydrogen become yet another lifeline for the polluting coal and gas industries or will it become something that is genuinely used to expand renewables and reduce climate pollution? 5. Clean energy elections No 2019 trend article is complete without mentioning the upcoming elections. According to researcher Rebecca Huntly climate change is a top issue with the electorate and as such both the NSW and federal elections are going to have a focus on climate and energy policy whether politicians like it or not. The federal ALP recently announced its energy policy. Their plan does just enough to show they want to do something, but no more than they have to, given they are so far ahead in the polls. At this point, future announcements are likely to focus on climate and clean transport rather than clean energy. It’s true that sectors other than electricity do need attention to reduce climate pollution. That said, refraining from further renewables commitments would be a missed opportunity to capitalise on the popularity of clean energy in the electorate. The federal Coalition meanwhile looks like it will double down on coal and an electricity price scare campaign if Barnaby Joyce’s diatribe this month is anything to go by. It remains to be seen whether increasing public pressure on the government and the popularity of acting on climate and renewables will lead to a last-ditch course correction as the federal election gets closer; it’s possible, but don’t hold your breath. • Nicky Ison is a research associate at the Institute for Sustainable Futures at the University of Technology Sydney and co-founder of the Community Power Agency."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"food/2020/feb/28/what-noma-did-next-new-nordic-food-rene-redzepi-claus-meyer-locavore-foraging","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2020-02-28T06:00:09Z","webTitle":"What Noma did next: how the ‘New Nordic’ is reshaping the food world","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/feb/28/what-noma-did-next-new-nordic-food-rene-redzepi-claus-meyer-locavore-foraging","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/food/2020/feb/28/what-noma-did-next-new-nordic-food-rene-redzepi-claus-meyer-locavore-foraging","fields":{"headline":"What Noma did next: how the ‘New Nordic’ is reshaping the food world","bodyText":"Few restaurants have enjoyed as much acclaim and influence, or been as widely caricatured, as the Copenhagen fine-dining institution Noma. In its 16 years of existence, it has been at the top of the World’s 50 Best Restaurants list four times. There are three Noma books, two feature-length films and a Noma documentary series. There are Noma dissertations and dozens of “Nomaheads” – dedicated diners who follow the restaurant all over the world, from Yucatan to Tokyo to Sydney and back again. In the early 2010s, there were so many articles about hunting for wild produce with Noma’s charismatic head chef that one writer declared it “The Era of the ‘I Foraged With René Redzepi’ Piece”. There is even a 240-page travelogue, written by an Esquire editor who followed Redzepi across the world for four years. But all the attention that has been lavished on Noma’s hyperlocal, micro-seasonal food – butterflies moulded from blackcurrant leather; 100-year-old mahogany clams served in their shell – has obscured the much more ambitious aims that the restaurant’s creators, alumni and allies have been trying to achieve. Noma as a traditional haute cuisine restaurant, with its elegant cookbooks and high-concept food, is being overtaken by a grander project. The people behind the restaurant are trying to expand New Nordic, a culinary movement they began in Scandinavia 15 years ago, to the rest of the globe. In doing so, they want to transform every link in the long chain of how food is produced and consumed, from the dirt up to your dinner table. The New Nordic movement is bound by a set of 10 principles that stress sustainability, locality and respect for the natural world. Those ideals may sound familiar, but the scale of what its adherents are accomplishing makes New Nordic potentially far more transformative than any previous food movement. It is reaching beyond farms and fine-dining restaurants, and into halls of power, supermarket aisles, canteens and classrooms. Pretty much anywhere in Denmark, you can walk into a supermarket and find ready meals – made with traceable organic produce by co-operative kitchens in Copenhagen – that bear the name of Claus Meyer, Noma’s co-founder. Meyer has also created a food training programme in Denmark’s prisons to reduce recidivism, and he is partnering with Ikea – which feeds 660 million people a year, making it one of the 10 largest food-service operations in the world – to “veganise” its menu. Further afield, in Bolivia, Meyer has opened restaurants and cooking schools to revive the nation’s hospitality industry. In the US, Dan Giusti, a former head chef at Noma, now feeds more than 4,000 school children a day with nourishing meals, while in Albania, Fejsal Demiraj, one of Noma’s current sous chefs, runs a foundation that researches and catalogues the nation’s village recipes to give the country a documented culinary history for the first time. Followers of the New Nordic approach are also working to change food policy and production practices around the world. Building on the success of Noma and the New Nordic manifesto, Nordic governments have set up an institute to promote their region’s food policies to other nations. In addition, Redzepi has set up a non-profit organisation called Mad – it means “food” in Danish – that led a campaign in partnership with the UN in the summer of 2019 against the environmental damage of food production. There are also plans for a Mad Academy, with funding from the Danish government, which aims to become “a Bauhaus of food”, as its executive director, Melina Shannon-DiPietro puts it – a place where all the different steps in food production are taught, and where efforts are geared towards answering the most urgent questions of the day: “How do we make food sustainable? How do we make food available to all? How do we protect food cultures against globalisation?” It’s as if Fergus Henderson took his “nose-to-tail” philosophy into Whitehall, got funding from the National Lottery and ended up getting people across the British isles to butcher their own meat, instead of just feeding offal to well-heeled Londoners. What the New Nordic movement is trying to export is not a single cuisine, but an all-encompassing philosophy of food. * * * Chefs were once courtiers; then, in the 19th century, they became artisans. For a time following the deprivations of the second world war, they were relics – vestiges of lost luxury in a time of hardship and scarcity. As the age of reality television and fast money dawned in the 80s, so too did the bonafide celebrity chef: a hard-living, tortured genius who justified their wealth and fame with a relentless dedication to perfection. Then, around the turn of the millennium, came an era of techno-utopianism and the transformation of the chef into a wizard of molecular gastronomy, with its frozen foams and fluid gels and trompe l’oeil flourishes. The New Nordic movement heralded another shift in the world of fine dining. In our current era of climate emergency and brutal inequality, celebrity chefs have transformed again, from ruthless kitchen dictators such as Gordon Ramsay and Marco Pierre White, or mad scientists such as Ferran Adrià, into crusaders for a better world. Where once the dream was to cook for presidents, now the aim is to work with them. Massimo Bottura, the ebullient owner of the three-Michelin-star Osteria Francescana in Modena, was celebrated in the 2019 Time 100 for his work feeding the homeless. José Andrés, the Spanish chef once credited with bringing tapas to the US, now has an accolade far exceeding a Michelin star: a nomination for the Nobel peace prize, for his disaster relief efforts in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria. The pursuit of Michelin stars and coffee-table cookbooks has been superseded by pursuing a role in public life. Of course, there have been powerful voices challenging the mainstream food industry before. At the height of the first-wave of the environmental movement, in the 70s, Alice Waters’ groundbreaking restaurant Chez Panisse, in Berkeley, California, shone a light on the relationship between food producers and cooks, encouraging diners to reject commercialism and supermarkets, and return to the farmers and ranchers who produce their food in a more sustainable way – even if it means paying more for that produce. Even Jamie Oliver, whose TV persona has been a figure of ridicule to many for the past two decades, invested much of his time in social enterprises, most famously challenging the British government on the quality of school dinners during the heady high-point of the Blair hegemony, and founding the not-for-profit restaurant chain Fifteen, which trained, and was staffed by, apprentices from disadvantaged backgrounds. But the New Nordic movement has done more than any single chef to make doing “more than just cooking” the new normal. Redzepi could have opened up a Noma Dubai, and a Noma in the Vegas Bellagio. That’s what the old French masters, such as Alain Ducasse, Pierre Gagnaire and Joël Robuchon, did when they reached the peak of the profession: snatch up Michelin stars all over the globe for their luxurious outposts in far-flung, glitzy hotels. Instead, Redzepi is devoting his time to Mad and to a revamped Noma – often referred to as Noma 2.0 – just a couple of kilometres from the site of the now-shuttered original. Still, the movement – and the restaurant at its forefront – has its critics, who argue that it can be sanctimonious, or narrow, or inattentive to the simple notion that food should be a pleasurable experience. George Reynolds, writing for Eater, took Noma to task for its self-imposed Nordic exceptionalism, writing that “its borderline isolationist culinary philosophy doesn’t feel quite right for the present age; more than ever, closing yourself off to other influences is not just unnecessarily limiting but politically unpalatable.” The fact is, though, that the rise of New Nordic means there is no longer a bright line between the chef and the activist, the test kitchen and the laboratory. Joe Warwick, the creative director of the World Restaurant Awards, believes that the people leading the New Nordic movement’s restaurants, canteens, labs, thinktanks, policy institutes and cooking schools, have “exerted influence on their industry on a scale that only a few chefs and restaurants in history ever achieve”. * * * Two decades ago, Denmark might have seemed a rather unconducive place for a revolution in haute cuisine, let alone in food altogether. Being generous, you could have said that it was a country of open-faced sandwiches, hot dogs and overproof alcohol. But you might also have associated it with the cheapest processed pork in the EU, known for being made in a grim factory from a candy-pink slurry of something that once was a pig. “Back then, all you could get in the centre of Copenhagen was bad French food or bad Italian food,” the food writer Andrea Petrini told me. “There was no Danish food culture.” One of the New Nordic movement’s first feats was to help to transform Scandinavia from a land of herring cured in lye to the gastronomic centre of the world. In 2000, Claus Meyer, then a TV chef and one of Denmark’s most recognisable faces, had been appointed by the Social Democratic government to overhaul the country’s poor culinary reputation. He led a committee to create a special quality label for the best Danish food producers to apply for, in the manner of France’s Label Rouge system, which certifies the quality of foods such as Bresse chicken and Bayonne ham. But at the next election, in 2001, the Social Democrats fell, the initiative was scrapped and Meyer was dismissed. “I realised when the committee was demolished that working towards a better food culture was not wanted in parliament anymore,” Meyer told me. “I found that so crazy.” So Meyer bankrolled a proof-of-concept restaurant in Copenhagen that would champion Nordic produce. In 2003, Meyer opened Noma – the name is a portmanteau of nordisk mad (“Nordic food”) – with Redzepi, then a rising star with no experience as head chef, at the helm. Around the same time, Meyer corralled 13 of the Nordic region’s best chefs into an 18-hour workshop to carve out what a world-leading food culture would look like. Meyer and the chefs agonised over the precise wording, order and emphasis of what would become the Manifesto for the New Nordic Kitchen, published in 2004 – a 10-point mission statement that sought “to express the purity, freshness, simplicity and ethics we wish to associate to our region”. Noma, which had spent its first year tweaking French classics with Nordic herbs, moved with religious fervour towards locavorism, making everything as wild and Scandinavian as possible. We put the forest, or the shore, or the snow on a plate in front of you, Redzepi’s dishes often seemed to say. The hope was that Scandinavia’s restaurants would realise the potential of the region and set about regenerating a “Nordic food culture”. What took New Nordic from a local concern to a global movement, however, was Noma’s astonishing success. When Noma dethroned the Spanish restaurant El Bulli, a temple of molecular gastronomy, at the top of the 50 Best list in 2010, it represented a transition between two self-defined “eras” of haute cuisine – from the laboratory to the forest cabin, so to speak. El Bulli would close for good a year later, with its head chef, Ferran Adrià, recognising the end of his restaurant’s journey. El Bulli had always sought to push the limits of what a restaurant could be, bringing in scientific rigour and dedicated lab spaces to make its food more daring. Redzepi had been a student of Adrià’s at the height of El Bulli’s fame. Noma’s innovation was borrowing Adrià’s approach and applying it to answer the questions posed by the New Nordic manifesto: how to radically enlarge the scope of what we think of as food, while making it more ethical and accessible. Noma began attracting talents from outside the food world: anthropologists, molecular chemists and agricultural scientists who would work in its Nordic Food Lab. This lab space – which was, for many years, a rigged-up houseboat moored outside of the restaurant – developed new local products, such as miso made with Danish yellow peas, or salt from shoreline seaweeds for the restaurant to use, while doing original research into the culinary biodiversity of Scandinavia. Lars Williams, who was drafted to Noma from Heston Blumenthal’s test kitchen in 2009, moved to the houseboat in 2010 to run the Nordic Food Lab for two years. “We’d be as scientific as chefs could be,” Williams said. “We’d try the same idea 30 different times, with 30 different incremental variations, and record it all to assure we’d been rigorous.” Much like the restaurant, the lab operated with solely Nordic produce, but did its best to stretch that definition: “Things from the Faroe Islands were fair game, things from Northern Norway were fair game – we didn’t just operate around a kilometre’s radius around Copenhagen.” A lot of what the lab worked with – Øland wheat flour, æggeblomme (“egg yolk”) potatoes and other native varietals – had never been tested and examined to such depth before. Through the lab’s research, crops that had all but ceased to be cultivated were finding new uses, and a reason to be grown again. * * * At the peak of Noma’s powers, when it felt as if every other food article was about the majesty of New Nordic, Redzepi began to look beyond the restaurant kitchen. In 2011, he launched what would become a series of annual ideas conferences, the Mad Symposiums, where invited speakers – everyone from the head of the European Environmental Agency to Japan’s most celebrated soba noodle maker – would address an audience of superchefs, interns, farmers, journalists and industry figures on a patch of Copenhagen dockland. These gatherings, which straddled the line between networking events, university lectures and evangelical tent rallies, helped build the movement that is spreading across the globe today. Figures of all stripes and skills would swap business cards, applaud each other’s speeches, plan events and collaborations together, united in the belief that everyone had the destiny of the food world in their hands. In 2012, Redzepi launched the Mad non-profit, to “unite a global cooking community with a social conscience”. Aside from its larger symposiums, Mad has run pop-up salons in London, New York and Sydney, inviting local chefs and journalists to talk about topics as expansive as abandoning ego, indigenous food culture and questioning the very value of life itself. They have partnered with Yale to teach students about leadership, have published essay collections on how food cultures overlap all over the world, and launched a foraging app, VILD MAD (“wild food”), to help users find what’s edible in their local park. Around the same time that Redzepi founded Mad, Meyer, who sold his majority stake in Noma in 2013, began testing New Nordic principles far beyond Scandinavia. After mapping the countries of the world on metrics such as economic development, crime rates and biodiversity, Meyer decided to open a restaurant called Gustu in Bolivia’s capital, La Paz, with another talented young Danish chef, Kamilla Seidler, at the helm. Seidler and her team used Bolivia’s fauna and flora to create the restaurant’s idiosyncratic cuisine – llama tartare, alligator escabeche and a lot of quinoa – and brought the restaurant on to the foodie radar. But more importantly, she completed the restaurant’s primary objective: training the restaurant’s Bolivian staff so she could leave Gustu in their hands. To do this, Gustu opened two Manq’a cooking schools, named after the indigenous Aymaran word for food – one based in the capital, La Paz, and one in Bolivia’s second city, El Alto. Manq’a offered general culinary qualifications that enabled all students to work in the hospitality industry; exceptional students, such as Gustu’s current head chef, Marsia Taha, would be placed on a fast-track scheme to move into the world of fine dining. There are now nine Manq’a schools in Bolivia and two in Colombia, more than 1,000 alumni, three canteens for La Paz locals to eat a freshly cooked three-course meal for just over £1.50, a tour company, a catering service and a fleet of delivery drivers to order a takeaway from. Alongside this, there is now a manifesto for a new Bolivian cuisine, drawn up by Meyer, Manq’a alumni and local figures within the Bolivian food scene; there is a Gustu bar selling Bolivia’s national spirit, singani, and a whole host of restaurants across Bolivia, helmed by ex-Gustu staff, continuing to reimagine Bolivian food and make use of farmers and suppliers providing indigenous produce. In 2014, President Evo Morales had the restaurant cater his third-term inauguration. The following year, the restaurant was asked to devise a recipe for special quinoa communion wafers presented to Pope Francis when he visited the country. Seidler, after Gustu, returned to Copenhagen to carry through her vision of what she calls “social gastronomy” with her latest restaurant, Lola, which operates as both a fine dining restaurant, and a job inclusion programme that trains socially excluded individuals in cooking and hospitality skills. Others, such as Noma’s New Jersey-born former head chef Dan Giusti, have turned their efforts toward improving the food of public institutions. In 2016, Giusti opened Brigaid, a chef-led startup that brings chefs into public schools to train cafeteria staff, ensuring that pupils eat made-from-scratch food every day – beef tacos and chicken teriyaki instead of vending machine snacks or, worse still, nothing. Brigaid has now expanded into three states, feeding thousands of school children every day across 12 public schools. It’s a world away from the 40 covers a night he served at Noma. The volume of social initiatives pushed by Noma affiliates is staggering. Another former head chef, Matt Orlando, runs a scheme that teaches Copenhagen schoolchildren how to grow their own food in small urban spaces. Over the road from him in the docklands of Refshaleøen is Empirical Spirits, a distillery run by Noma alumni that has organised agronomy workshops in the Oaxacan mountain village of Huitepec in Mexico to help the community continue growing its most valuable crop, the Pasilla Mixe chilli. Roberto Flore, former head of culinary research and development of the Nordic Food Lab, now runs a lab at the Technical University of Denmark that offers space to experiment and develop schemes addressing matters such as hunger, food waste and accessible technology for food production. One scheme, called ServedOnSalt, has developed a battery that uses solar energy, salt and water to create a cheap and clean-powered cooking stove for use in refugee camps; another has been focused on improving the safety and storability of milk products across rural Ethiopia. Scandinavia now leads the world in food policy, too. In 2018, Dr Afton Halloran, one of the world’s foremost experts on sustainable food systems, published a collection of innovative food policies from around the Nordic region, the Solutions Menu. It outlined the benefits of 24 innovative food policies, aggregated from successful initiatives around the Nordic region – including universal free school meals, organic food in hospitals and schemes to help farms move towards zero food waste. Halloran and her co-authors cited Noma and the New Nordic movement as their chief inspiration. * * * When the Manifesto for the New Nordic Kitchen was first published, in 2004, the reaction in the world of fine dining was sceptical, if not outright suspicious. The manifesto’s points were criticised for being too vague, too piecemeal, too male – all the signatories were men – and too focused on “encouraging cooperation” rather than challenging the region’s industrial food producers through legislation and policy. At the time, Camilla Plum, a Danish food writer and TV personality, was quoted in Denmark’s newspaper of record, Berlingske, lambasting the manifesto’s toothlessness. “The manifesto reminds me a little of Queen Margaret’s annual New Year’s speech,” Plum said. “There are lots of good-natured thoughts and the usual nice greetings to Greenland. They are beautiful sentiments, but they have no real meaning.” Today, though, it seems indisputable that the manifesto more than succeeded in its aims. Scandinavia now stands alongside Spain, France and Italy as one of Europe’s major gastro destinations, with Michelin stars being found as far north as Trondheim in Norway, 200 miles south of the arctic circle. Thousands of jobs in hospitality have been created and, with them, catering colleges full of new students. There are new food producers and artisans, and more diners engaged with the food of the region in which they live. That said, the desire to shake up Scandinavia’s culinary reputation seems a little bit provincial now. The movement has long since mutated into a much larger phenomenon. The aim was once for the Nordic kitchen to be seen as natural and sustainable; now, anything with bare wood, organic produce and a compost bin can be thought of as Nordic. Beyond that, the movement has established a Nordic way of doing things that can be adapted anywhere in the world, to breathe new life into cuisines that are distinctly Bolivian, or Mexican or Albanian. And these are just the first initiatives that Noma and the New Nordic principles have sparked. “We’ve already seen people who have come from Noma step out into the industry and work towards change,” says Dan Giusti. “But there’s people in that kitchen right now, and more people who will come through there in future, who we haven’t heard yet. In 20 or 30 years, there’s no telling how big the change could be.” • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here. • This article was amended on 4 March 2020.

A massive solar energy boom is being predicted for 2018, after an unprecedented number of industrial solar farms were approved by the New South Wales and Queensland governments last year. Last month also became the biggest January on record for rooftop installations, according to the renewables website RenewEconomy and industry analysts SunWiz. With 111MW of new panels, it saw a 69% rise compared with the same month last year and became one of the top five months ever – largely driven by low installation costs and a boost in commercial uptake. At the same time, nearly 30 new industrial solar farms are scheduled to come on line. NSW approved 10 solar farm projects last year – twice as many as the year before – and has approved another in 2018. Queensland currently has 18 large-scale projects under construction, which is the most in the country. The new farms could be operational within the year, according to John Grimes, the chief executive of the Smart Energy Council. “These solar farms can be built within a matter of weeks,” he said. “They’re really quick and simple.” Together, the new large-scale projects could add between 2.5GW and 3.5GW to the national grid and rooftop installations could add another 1.3GW, according to the Smart Energy Council’s estimates. This would nearly double the nation’s solar energy capacity, currently 7GW, in a single year. “The train tracks are about to converge,” Grimes said. “Rooftop installations and utilities are both booming and could turbo-boost the solar numbers overall.” In Queensland, residential solar panels are already the state’s largest source of energy, producing more combined than the 1.7GW Gladstone power station. Just under a third (30%) of residential homes in the state have solar installed – the most in the country. With the completion of the new solar farms, solar will provide 17% of the state’s energy. “We’ve turned the sunshine state into the solar state,” Queensland’s former energy minister Mark Bailey said in October. In New South Wales, the planning minister, Anthony Roberts, said the 10 new solar farms would generate 1.2GW of energy and reduce carbon emissions by more than 2.5m tonnes – the equivalent of taking about 800,000 cars off the road. In January this year, NSW announced another plant – the 170MW Finley plant in the Riverina – as did Queensland, the 120MW solar farm at Munna Creek. Grimes said the solar boom “was only going to grow” in future. “Solar is the cheapest way to generate electricity in the world – full stop,” he said. “It’s not unusual for grid pricing to be north of 20c per kilowatt hour in a majority of jurisdicitions. A solar array, at an average size for an average home, if you amortise the cost over 20 years, the effective rate is 5c per kilowatt hour. That’s called an economic no-brainer.” He said the rush to install rooftop panels could have been sparked by January’s warm weather and rising energy prices. “I think people are acutely aware of energy prices. People are running air conditioning and thinking, ‘hooley dooley I’m going to get a bill’.” 2017 saw a record 1.25GW of solar power added to the grid nationally, counting both large-scale solar farms and rooftop panels. The predicted rate of rooftop panels alone in 2018 is expected to be 1.3GW."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2018/jul/09/engineer-degree-career-shapes-future","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-09T07:30:26Z","webTitle":"Engineer a career that shapes the future","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/jul/09/engineer-degree-career-shapes-future","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/jul/09/engineer-degree-career-shapes-future","fields":{"headline":"Engineer a career that shapes the future","bodyText":"An engineering degree is a passport to careers that are as varied as your imagination, says Queen Mary University of London aerospace engineering graduate Kinjal Dave, who is now working as a security consultant at defence contractors BAE. She found her forte fighting cybercriminals on the graduate scheme at BAE Systems Applied Intelligence (its cyber-intelligence business). Cybersecurity might not be an immediately obvious choice of engineering career, she says: “People have always had this ridiculous perception of engineers as men who are slightly overweight, covered in oil, wearing hard hats.” Slowly but surely those outdated perceptions are changing. “There are so many routes into engineering,” she continues. “It’s becoming much cooler with the digital revolution – more attractive for younger people and especially women, who are supported with flexible working.” Data analysis and artificial intelligence have led to an explosion in demand for engineering grads. “Engineering is not just for people wearing high-visibility jackets,” says Nigel Fine, chief executive of the Institution of Engineering and Technology. “The work engineers do now is pretty cool stuff. From robotics to 3D printing and blockchain, technology is reshaping the profession.” The industry is crying out for fresh talent – particularly women, who historically may have seen engineering as a largely male occupation. The UK needs 37,000 to 59,000 extra engineering graduates and technicians annually, to meet current employer demand, according to the 2018 Engineering UK report. And with Brexit potentially making it more difficult for UK employers to secure visas and recruit overseas engineers, “employers may hire more domestic students in the near future,” says Verity Davidge, head of education and skills policy at the EEF manufacturers’ organisation. Over 6,000 engineers and tech professionals with job offers had visa applications rejected between December and March. The skills shortage has put a premium on engineers. The average starting salary of engineering and technology graduates was £25,600 in 2015/16 – 18% higher than the average for graduates overall. The highest paid were minerals technology engineers (£28,500) and general engineers (£27,100). The most attractive feature of engineering is that the work has become much more fascinating, says Eleanor Eyre, head of careers at Engineering UK: “Engineers are producing medical vaccines, robotic limbs, developing autonomous cars and commercialising space flight. “The great thing about the profession is that you can follow your passion,” she adds. Many young people are passionate about making a positive impact on society – engineering can contribute to solving the toughest global challenges, such as climate change. Some civil engineers, for example, are developing tidal and solar energy to bring sustainable power to developing countries. “We are helping the world transition to a low-carbon economy,” says Lord Robert Mair, president of the Institution of Civil Engineers. “Engineering is a really rewarding place to begin a career.” The pathway to the profession is often Stem subjects – science, technology, engineering and maths. “But creativity and collaboration skills are just as important as technical capability,” says David Heath associate director of resourcing at engineering and consultancy firm Arup. “Graduates need to design and develop solutions in teams and articulate them to clients.” Arup recruits up to 300 people into its graduate programme each year. “We hire people who want to help us make a difference to the world,” says Heath. “Our engineers shape the future, whether by designing critical infrastructure such as railways or curbing their environmental impact.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/sep/10/london-new-york-cities-divest-fossil-fuels-bill-de-blasio-sadiq-khan","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-09-10T05:00:17Z","webTitle":"As New York and London mayors, we call on all cities to divest from fossil fuels | Bill de Blasio and Sadiq Khan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/sep/10/london-new-york-cities-divest-fossil-fuels-bill-de-blasio-sadiq-khan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/sep/10/london-new-york-cities-divest-fossil-fuels-bill-de-blasio-sadiq-khan","fields":{"headline":"As New York and London mayors, we call on all cities to divest from fossil fuels","bodyText":"This summer it seemed as if our two cities had changed places. London was hot and dry while New York had days and days of rain. According to leading scientists, the heatwave in Europe over recent months was made twice as likely by climate change resulting from human activity. There is also growing evidence of the link between climate change and the frequency of major floods, as well as the severity of hurricanes. It’s clear that what we think of now as freak weather in our cities is likely to become the new normal, and that climate change poses a huge threat to the futures of our children, and many generations to come. As mayors, we are not only committed to taking bold action to tackle climate change and to improve the lives of those we represent, but also to showing others the way. That’s why, ahead of the Global Climate Action Summit in California, we are calling on other cities to stand with us to divest their assets from fossil fuel companies. Today we are announcing a new global initiative for cities on divestment and sustainable investment. Working through the C40 Climate Leadership Group, London and New York will co-chair the Cities Divest/Invest forum, a global network for cities that will not only enable us to share tools, knowledge and experiences, but also to advocate for action on divestment and green investment. London and New York are two of the world’s most dynamic, innovative and forward-thinking cities, and we are determined to push ahead with the goals of the Paris agreement – stealing a march on many national governments. We know that tackling climate change requires action across the board – from how we run our transport networks to using cleaner energy and making our buildings more energy-efficient. But we must also use our economic might to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy. We believe that ending institutional investment in companies that extract fossil fuels and contribute directly to climate change can help send a very powerful message that renewables and low-carbon options are the future. If we want to fund the scale of transformation the world needs, we must foster sustainable investment and use the power of institutional investors, such as pension funds. That’s why – in both London and New York – we are taking all possible steps to divest our city pension funds from fossil fuels. Already, less than 2% of the London Pension Fund Authority’s investments of £5.5bn ($7.1bn) are in extractive fossil fuels – this year, the authority has rid itself of a further £700,000 of fossil fuel investments, including stakes in Shell and BP, and has plans in place to divest its remaining investments. In New York, divestment is under way, with the goal of total divestment within five years. This will mean removing some $5bn (£3.8bn) in investment from the industry. Both our cities are also investing in a sustainable future. London recently launched the £500m Mayor’s Energy Efficiency Fund, working with the European Regional Development Fund and private sector investors to help hospitals, museums, offices, libraries, social housing and universities to become greener and more energy efficient. New York City has increased its solar-energy capacity six-fold since 2013 and is investing $2.7bn in energy-efficiency projects that save New Yorkers money and cut emissions. City government now has more than 1,200 electric vehicles and 500 charging stations. Of course, we acknowledge that divestment and accelerating green investment is not always straightforward. The major portfolios held by public entities are typically pension funds, which aren’t generally under the control of mayors. But we can make progress if we work together with a range of partners – including pension funds, local authorities, campaign groups and the private sector. We believe we can demonstrate to the world that divestment is a powerful tool and a prudent use of resources. And that, together, our cities – New York, London and many others around the world – can send a clear message to the fossil fuel industry: change your ways now and join us in tackling climate change. Climate change knows no borders, and taking this kind of action now could help us make a crucial difference to the people we represent and the future of our planet. • Bill de Blasio is mayor of New York City and Sadiq Khan is mayor of London"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2018/jan/23/donald-trump-tariffs-solar-panels","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-24T07:33:32Z","webTitle":"Donald Trump's tariffs on panels will cost US solar industry thousands of jobs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/23/donald-trump-tariffs-solar-panels","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jan/23/donald-trump-tariffs-solar-panels","fields":{"headline":"Donald Trump's tariffs on panels will cost US solar industry thousands of jobs","bodyText":"Donald Trump’s decision to impose a tariff on imported solar panels will cost the US solar industry about 23,000 jobs this year and risks slowing the growth of clean energy that would help address climate change, renewable energy advocates warned. Trump has imposed a 30% tariff on foreign-made solar cells and modules, with the White House expressing alarm at a huge rise in imported components “spurred on by artificially low-priced solar cells and modules from China”. But solar installers warned that the tariff, which will reduce to 15% within four years, will cost US jobs rather than protect them. The Solar Energy Industries Association said 23,000 jobs would be lost in 2018, pointing out that most solar manufacturing in the US revolves around making parts for cheaper imported panels, rather than the cells and panels themselves. The installation of panels accounts for around 130,000 further jobs. “It boggles my mind that this president – any president, really – would voluntarily choose to damage one of the fastest-growing segments of our economy,” said Tony Clifford, chief development officer of Standard Solar, which finances and installs panels. Bill Vietas, president of RBI Solar, which makes mounting systems for panels, added: “The US solar manufacturing sector has been growing as our industry has surged over the past five years. “Government tariffs will increase the cost of solar and depress demand, which will reduce the orders we’re getting and cost manufacturing workers their jobs.” Trump has long complained that China has an unfair advantage over the US on trade and his stance has been backed by two companies that claim cheap imports have hit American solar manufacturing. Last May, Suniva, a bankrupt US module manufacturer with a Chinese majority owner, lodged a complaint with the International Trade Commission that stated it had suffered “significant harm” due to imported cells and modules. The US arm of SolarWorld joined the petition in order to seek a tariff. Juergen Stein, chief executive of SolarWorld Americas, said he “appreciates the hard work of President Trump”. “We are still reviewing these remedies and are hopeful they will be enough to address the import surge and to rebuild solar manufacturing in the United States,” he said. Environmental groups have decried the move as the latest attempt by Trump to stymie the shift to clean energy and wean the US off the fossil fuels that cause dangerous climate change. Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York, tweeted that the tariffs will “raise Americans’ electric bills and hurt our environment”. But while the tariffs may provide an unwelcome hurdle for the US solar industry, the cost of the technology and installation has dropped so precipitously in recent years that the industry could emerge relatively unscathed. The cost of installing solar panels on rooftops has fallen by more than 70% since 2010, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. Solar now accounts for around 1.4% of US utility-scale electricity generation, up from virtually nothing in 2007."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/dec/21/nuclear-power-renewables-low-carbon-provide-record-share-uk-electricity","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-21T18:10:07Z","webTitle":"Nuclear and renewables provide record share of UK electricity, ONS says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/21/nuclear-power-renewables-low-carbon-provide-record-share-uk-electricity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/dec/21/nuclear-power-renewables-low-carbon-provide-record-share-uk-electricity","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear and renewables provide record share of UK electricity, ONS says","bodyText":"More than half of the UK’s electricity came from nuclear power stations and renewables between July and September, official figures show. The record high share of 54.4% of power from low carbon sources was a result of the rapid growth in solar and wind power, according to the Office for National Statistics. During the same period in 2016 the share for low carbon electricity stood at 50%, and in 2015 it was 45%. The growth of green energy squeezed out fossil fuels, pushing the share of electricity generation from coal and gas plants to a record low of 42%. Including windfarms, solar panels, hydro schemes and biomass plants, renewables accounted for 30% of power in the third quarter. The all-time high was 30.7% in the second quarter of 2017. “This latest record is yet another nail in the coffin for the claim that renewables cannot be a sizeable part of the UK’s electricity mix,” said Dr Jonathan Marshall, an analyst at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit. The three months were not as windy or sunny as the year before, but this was offset by new windfarm and solar installations. The share was also helped by the return to operation of a wood-burning unit at the Drax power plant in North Yorkshire, which was out of action the year before. The green energy records are the latest in a string of milestones this year that demonstrate how dramatically and quickly the UK’s energy mix is changing. Britain went without coal power for a day in April for the first time in more than 130 years. The country has since gone hundreds of hours without the polluting fuel in 2017, and coal generated just 2.9% of electricity between July and September. Solar has set several records and now provides a sizeable amount of power in the middle of the day. For one period on an afternoon in May, all the solar panels in fields and on buildings across the country were even generating more electricity than the UK’s eight nuclear power stations. Wind power capacity has increased, too, though one of the biggest moments for windfarms was not growth but falls in price. In September windfarm developers secured a record low subsidy price to build wind turbines off the coast in the early 2020s in what experts said marked a breakthrough for the technology. Put together, the National Grid has said that renewables were now a “significant part” of the UK’s energy mix. According to one analysis, generation of renewable power has increased by more than 1,000% over the last two decades. Bulb, an energy company that supplies renewable power to more than a quarter of a million customers, said that at the current rate 2017 would prove to be a record year for renewables. The company forecast 100 terawatt hours of power would be produced by renewables by the year’s end compared twith 208 for fossil fuels and nuclear based on an extrapolation of the official data so far this year. “Right now we are at a moment where those new technologies are becoming cheaper than existing technologies. It now just makes much more sense,” said the Bulb co-founder Hayden Wood."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business-to-business/2018/oct/23/banned-ads-and-olympic-product-design-how-heist-is-shaking-up-the-lingerie-market","type":"article","sectionId":"business-to-business","sectionName":"Business to business","webPublicationDate":"2018-10-23T09:06:13Z","webTitle":"Banned ads and Olympic product design: how Heist is shaking up the lingerie market","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business-to-business/2018/oct/23/banned-ads-and-olympic-product-design-how-heist-is-shaking-up-the-lingerie-market","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business-to-business/2018/oct/23/banned-ads-and-olympic-product-design-how-heist-is-shaking-up-the-lingerie-market","fields":{"headline":"Banned ads and Olympic product design: how Heist is shaking up the lingerie market","bodyText":"A man in his mid-30s might not be who you’d expect to find behind a revolution in tights, but Heist chief executive Toby Darbyshire thinks his outsider status has proved his greatest strength. “[The founding team had] so little experience of the industry that we looked at it with very fresh eyes,” he says. “We have the enormous benefit of no legacy … [so] we can stand up and say every single product on the market today is rubbish.” Darbyshire co-founded the company in November 2015 with Edzard van der Wyck (who has since left the business to focus on other projects). In the ensuing three years, the brand has raised $8.1m from venture capitalists, including Net-a-Porter founder Dame Natalie Massenet, and now manufactures 60,000 pairs of tights a month, distributing to 41 countries. In the peak season of winter, Heist sells a pair every 15 seconds. It was a big industry for two amateurs to take on. The global underwear market generated sales of $112bn in 2016 and is expected to reach $145bn by 2021. In the UK, Marks &amp; Spencer sells more than 21m bras every year, and holds a 35% share of the market. More than one in four British women buy their underwear from the store. Yet, despite the sector’s size, it struck Darbyshire that it was ignoring the women that it claimed to serve. “My spark came [in 2015], walking through the London underground and coming across a very traditional underwear ad, picturing a woman in suspenders and heels standing in a library,” he says. “I thought: ‘Hang on a second, is this really how this industry talks to its customers? That’s pretty appalling’ … I thought: ‘Wow, this industry certainly needs something.’” Darbyshire also noticed a lack of innovation in the products – compared with the sportswear industry, for example, which is only slightly bigger, where companies such as Nike will spend billions on research and development. “The lingerie sector spends almost nothing,” Darbyshire says. “These are markets that have been ignored, in part potentially because they ‘only’ cater to women.” Central to Heist’s mission of using technological innovation and improvements in fabrics to make better underwear has been its innovation team led by Fiona Fairhurst. Fairhurst previously worked at Speedo, where she invented the Fastskin swimsuit, which was debuted by athletes at the 2000 Sydney Olympics (83% of the swimming medals were won by swimmers wearing the suit). User feedback has also been incredibly important. When the company first launched, it asked a group of 67 women to share what they found annoying about a humble pair of tights – “the last area of women’s fashion sold by the till in Boots,” Darbyshire says. The most common complaints – that the waistbands dug in, that they were itchy, and that they fell down – were each addressed by Fairhurst’s team. Heist tights have a seamless design, that stops them slipping down, they don’t have a gusset, they’re 5,000 thread count (rather than the usual 500), and there’s an adaptive waistband that shouldn’t dig in. That level of feedback has continued to inform each new iteration of the brand’s range. In 2018, Heist added five new shades, after 85,000 women around the world shared their nude skin tone as part of the company’s Nude Project. The firm also recently opened its first bricks-and-mortar store in Covent Garden, and aims to launch a shapewear range in the next month. Expanding the range is a process that takes years, Darbyshire says. “It all starts with tons of people telling us what they like and what they don’t like,” he adds. “Everybody hates shapewear. Just like tights, nobody came back to us and said: ‘You know what, I go home after a hard day at work and I put on [control pants] and I feel great about myself.’” Despite the three-year-old company’s impressive growth to date – 18.5% month-on-month sales growth and 300% annual growth in production and sales – Darbyshire admits there have been challenges. In 2017, a Heist advert was banned by Transport for London for being “overtly sexual” by showing a woman’s bare back. And spending the amount of time required to develop new products, with investors and customers keen to see the latest release, has also been a constant pressure. “I think that’s going to be our challenge as long as we exist as a business,” he says, adding that he expects it to take three years of work before the brand will be able to launch its first bra. There’s also an acknowledgement that disruptor brands need to respect the big businesses that have gone before, even while capitalising on their blind spots. “M&amp;S might be going through a difficult time at the moment, but it’s much bigger than us,” Darbyshire says. “There should be some element of respecting what they’ve achieved and understanding how they’ve done it.” This isn’t his first business – he founded the solar energy company Engensa in 2010, before it was acquired by Ikea – and he admits his approach to running a company has evolved. “I think I’m much more open to failure now … I’ve had the opportunity to mess up quite publicly a couple of times already. You get more comfortable with it. “Take a swing and see where you get,” he adds, when asked for his advice to other entrepreneurs. “You’re much better off taking on big industries that have a lot of scope, rather than tinkering around the edges. With big industries, you can make a couple of mistakes and still win.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/08/green-groups-target-adelaide-festivals-ahead-of-sa-election-and-reviews-are-mixed","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-07T23:51:11Z","webTitle":"Green groups target Adelaide festivals ahead of SA election – and reviews are mixed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/08/green-groups-target-adelaide-festivals-ahead-of-sa-election-and-reviews-are-mixed","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/08/green-groups-target-adelaide-festivals-ahead-of-sa-election-and-reviews-are-mixed","fields":{"headline":"Green groups target Adelaide festivals ahead of SA election – and reviews are mixed","bodyText":"Renewable energy groups are targeting Adelaide’s festival season ahead of the South Australian election with scorecards rating the major parties’ environmental policies, with the Greens and Labor leading the way. A scorecard distributed by the Australian Conservation Foundation gives its only five-star rating for renewables to the Greens. Labor gets a glowing four-and-a-half star rating for its heavy investment in renewable energy; Nick Xenophon’s SA Best receives a lukewarm two stars, while the Liberals are panned with a scathing half-star rating. Gavan McFadzean, the ACF manager of climate change and clean energy, told Guardian Australia the organisation was promoting the rating along with a more general environmental scorecard. “We’ll be distributing it through a range of events in the next week. It’s Adelaide festival season, with Womadelaide and other events, so there will be a lot of people on the streets, a lot of festivals going on, and we’ll have people out amongst the crowds making people aware of the scorecards,” he said. McFadzean said scores would also be emailed to the 130,000 members of the 33 organisations that contributed to the OurFuture SA analysis, and distributed among polling booths across Adelaide on election day. The renewables ratings were extracted from an assessment of each party’s environmental platform, based on the answers of an online questionnaire completed by the leaders of the four biggest parties contesting the election. Labor’s score plummets down to two stars when all environmental issues are considered. “On the overall scorecard Labor comes back to the field as they weren’t able to commit to half of the ledger; they might be an international leader on clean energy, but they weren’t able to make a strong commitment to rule out fracking in the south east, [or] drilling for fossil fuels in the Simpson Desert and Great Australian Bight,” McFadzean said. The Greens managed five stars in the overall scorecard too, which McFadzean said might not be surprising but shouldn’t be taken for granted. He added SA Best moved up to three stars overall due to a solid performance on its fossil fuel extraction policy, natural protection and expenditure in the state budget for environmental issues. “Unlike other major parties who tended to tank in a couple of areas, SA Best were not outstanding but solid across the board,” McFadzean said. The Liberals rose to one-and-a-half stars partly due to support for a 10-year fracking moratorium in the state’s south-east. Cory Bernardi’s Australian Conservatives ignored invitations to contribute, which McFadzean said represented the party’s “cavalier” attitude towards the environment. Another contributor to the analysis, the solar energy advocacy organisation Solar Citizens, is shifting its volunteer door-knocking team to this weekend’s Womadelaide festival to distribute its own version of the scorecard based on the renewable energy target. Solar Citizens highlighted the Greens leading the way with a 100% target for 2025, Labor in second place with a 75% target, SA Best third with a commitment to maintaining the current 50% target, and the Liberals last with their pledge to scrap the state-based goal in favour of federal action. The Solar Citizens South Australia campaigner Dan Spencer told Guardian Australia the organisation, backed by a range of solar energy companies, hoped to pressure the Liberals into abandoning their plans to scrap the target, saying it jeopardised investment. The rating also factored in each party’s policies needed to realise targets, such as Labor’s Renewable Technology Fund, which has already funded enough projects to go halfway to meeting the party’s new 25% energy storage target. Spencer pointed to Wednesday’s announcement that Neoen would explore development of a $600m hydrogen storage facility, backed up by a combined $5m in grants from Labor’s Renewable Technology Fund and a further $20m in loans if the project advances beyond feasibility stage. The fund has invested in a range of projects, including $7m into Tilt Renewables Snowtown North Solar Farm and the Battery Energy Storage System Project. The Tilt Renewables chief executive, Deion Campbell credited Labor’s “strong support in helping open our facilities and being progressive toward renewables”. He was unconcerned about the Liberal plan to scrap the state RET because so much renewable infrastructure had already been built, and expressed hope Xenophon’s previous hostility to windfarms had been “put to bed” with SA Best’s interest in expanding storage capacity. Of course, the opinion of the critics doesn’t always align with that of the general public, who will provide their own review when South Australia goes to the polls on 17 March – one day before the end of festival season."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/may/10/john-taylor-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-10T11:51:16Z","webTitle":"John Taylor obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/may/10/john-taylor-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/may/10/john-taylor-obituary","fields":{"headline":"John Taylor obituary","bodyText":"My good friend and mentor, John Taylor, who has died aged 88, was a highly talented architect who designed remarkable buildings. In the 1970s he developed a groundbreaking design for low-cost social housing in Sheffield. He arranged smaller flats over larger ones in three-storey terraces, stepping back at each floor, thereby creating generous balconies on the two upper levels. Each flat is approached from those balconies, or from gardens on the ground floor, on the living-room side, as in traditional streets where front parlours face the pavement. This is radically different from other deck-access designs where, to maintain privacy, much of the access is hidden from view. John’s design ensures “eyes on the street”, vital for the safety and self-policing of neighbourhoods. Each flat has a greenhouse porch and the decks have full-length planting boxes, resulting in a colourful display of hanging gardens for much of the year. In all, more than 400 of these dwellings were built in Stannington, Heeley and Gleadless. They nestle into the hillside, easily reached with ramps and bridges from car parking at the end of each terrace. They are all wheelchair accessible, with no need for lifts and stairs. John was born in Cookridge, Leeds, to Russell Taylor, a manufacturer’s manager, and Olive (nee Quilliam). He attended Leeds grammar school and in his teens developed a passion for ornithology. He kept a menagerie of rescued casualties, including a kestrel, which he trained. Love of the natural world never left him. During his architecture degree at Leeds College of Art he did two years’ national service, and after graduation briefly worked for West Riding before moving to the Sheffield city department of planning and design in the mid-50s, where he stayed for his working life. His first project there was the Castle Market, built in 1959. This intricate and popular building was demolished recently after 50 years of useful service. His 1970s social housing flats are still cherished by their occupants, 40 years on. They are a testament to John’s genius for counter-intuitive, modest and humane design, domestic in scale, and adaptable to almost any site. John saw the projects completed shortly before a change of government ended the era of council housebuilding. His design had the potential for further developments, including solar energy for heating; these remained unexplored as he became seriously ill and took early retirement in 1982. In retirement he read the Guardian avidly, as well as works on environmental issues, history and philosophy. He is survived by his wife, Marion Watson, his son, Rowan, daughter, Zoe, stepdaughter, Alison, and younger brother, Guy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2018/jul/12/uk-to-pass-1000-hours-without-coal-as-energy-shift-accelerates","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-13T08:00:49Z","webTitle":"UK passes 1,000 hours without coal as energy shift accelerates","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jul/12/uk-to-pass-1000-hours-without-coal-as-energy-shift-accelerates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jul/12/uk-to-pass-1000-hours-without-coal-as-energy-shift-accelerates","fields":{"headline":"UK passes 1,000 hours without coal as energy shift accelerates","bodyText":"Britain has been powered for more than a thousand hours without coal this year, in a new milestone underscoring how the polluting fuel’s decline is accelerating. The UK’s last eight coal power plants staged a brief revival when the “beast from the east” pushed up gas prices earlier this year, causing coal plants to fire up. However, the blip proved short-lived and immaterial, figures compiled by MyGridGB show. The country passed the threshold of 1,000 coal-free hours in the early hours of Friday. The pace of coal power’s demise is speeding up. Throughout the whole of 2017 there were 624 coal-free hours, up from 210 hours in 2016. Andrew Crossland, an energy expert who runs the MyGridGB site, said: “In 2018, Britain saved its coal use for when it needed it most – during the March cold snap. “Over the rest of the year Britain’s renewable sector has provided record amounts of electricity, with more than 7.4% coming from solar over the past four weeks.” The fall of coal power has been swift. In 2012 it supplied two fifths of electricity – this year so far it has provided less than 6%. The decline will deepen in the second half of this year, with the planned closure in September of a Yorkshire coal plant and one in Northern Ireland. After Eggborough and Kilroot cease generating there will be six coal plants left. For the first time since the industrial revolution, the UK went a day without coal last year, followed this year by three days in a row. Coal’s fortunes have been in contrast to a series of record highs for renewable sources of energy, including wind, solar and biomass. Renewables supplied 30.1% of electricity in the first three months of the year, government figures published on Thursday show. Higher wind speeds than last year helped but new wind turbines coming online also played a big role. Electricity generation from offshore windfarms was up dramatically, by 53%. The recent weeks of sunny weather have also created a series of solar records. The most recent was a new high for solar output over a month, with 1.94 terawatt hours of energy generated between 10 June and 9 July, beating the previous record of 1.77TWh. Alastair Buckley, a solar expert at the University of Sheffield, said: “Some of this increase is due to more solar having been installed since 2017 but most of the increase is climatic, with summer 2018 being the fifth sunniest on record so far. “These figures highlight the growing importance of solar energy as a low-carbon and low-cost source of electricity.” Ministers have pledged to phase out coal entirely by 2025 but generation will dwindle well before then. The government’s own projections forecast the amount of power from coal plants between 2019 and 2025 being less than was produced in 2015 alone, Friends of the Earth pointed out. Cottam in Nottinghamshire and Fiddler’s Ferry in Cheshire are thought by observers to be next in line for closure, from October 2019, when their contracts to supply backup power have expired. Drax in Yorkshire and Ratcliffe in Nottinghamshire are likely to be the last to close in the face of unfavourable economics brought about by the UK’s carbon tax and gas being cheaper. In one scenario outlined by National Grid this week, renewables by contrast are expected to grow from about 29% of electricity generation last year to 75% by 2030. A spokesperson at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said of the coal-free milestone: “The UK leads the world in tackling climate change and this shows the time of unabated coal fired electricity is being ended by a cleaner, greener future increasingly powered by renewable energy.” • This article was corrected on 16 July 2018.

Water. The planet has plenty of it, but most of it is unusable, locked up in salty oceans. But demand is soaring and the strains are starting to show, from China to Latin America, India to California. Almost a billion people lack access to clean water, and the forecast is for this number to grow sharply in coming decades. Last year, Cape Town came dangerously close to running out of water. Even rainy England has been told: carry on like this and you’ll run out of the stuff in 25 years. There are no easy solutions – but one technology that has proved controversial in the past may be on the cusp of a new dawn. Call it desalination 2.0. Freshwater supplies are under increasing pressure across the world, with the 4 billion people currently living in water-scarce areas predicted to rise to 5 billion by mid-century. Climate change, growing populations and our consumption habits are all key factors, while the technology we use relies on groundwater being extracted at a faster rate than it can be naturally replenished, which just stores up problems for the future. The process of converting seawater to something less briny that could be used on farms and in homes has long been viewed as a last resort for meeting our water needs. The technology is expensive, energy-intensive and only suitable in some areas. It also generates a potent byproduct: highly salty brine, which is usually released back into the sea, and the process has the unfortunate effect of disrupting local fish populations by sucking them into the inflow. But could desalination be reformed enough to make it a viable solution to our water needs? David Binns of early-stage innovation company Epicuro believes that advances in renewable energy technology could make small-scale desalination units a revolutionary advance for poor communities in the developing world, particularly in hot countries. “It’s a life-saver,” he says. “It could make an enormous difference to a terrible problem.” In a prototype he co-invented with seed funding from the drinks and property tycoon Howard Raymond, Binns uses solar collectors which heat water to boiling point, then condense it separately from the salt or dirt that rendered it undrinkable. A small photovoltaic system is attached to power the processors necessary to regulate the machine. This method can be used not just for desalination, which requires the users to be near the coast or another source of saltwater, but also in areas where water is available but grossly contaminated, which involves a much bigger slice of the global water-stressed population. Binns is now seeking government and charitable partners to make the technology widely available, and estimates that between £2m and £3m would enable the company to start manufacture. He envisages the devices being used on a small, local scale, with each unit enough to supply the drinking-water needs of an average family. Other innovators are also exploring the possibilities of renewable energy, as one of the biggest handicaps for traditional desalination is its huge consumption of fossil fuels. For instance, US engineering and technology company Honeywell has supplied water stations (which clean water contaminated with fluorides, nitrates and salinity to 480,000 people) in India, where as much as 70% of water supplies are contaminated and 200,000 people die each year from lack of access to safe water. Along with Safe Water Network India, Honeywell has installed 150 stations that rely solely on solar energy. Newer technology is also coming to the assistance of desalination advocates. The wonder substance graphene is inevitably one avenue being explored. A graphene “sieve” was created two years ago at the University of Manchester which cleans salts from brine and, if it can be scaled up, could be used for cheap desalination. Reporting on the work in the peer-review journal Nature Nanotechnology, Professor Rahul Raveendran Nair said: “Realisation of scalable membranes with uniform pore size, down to the atomic scale, is a significant step forward and will open new possibilities for improving the efficiency of desalination technology.” Separately, the British company G20 is working on an alternative way of using graphene oxide filters for desalination, with a process used to apply a coating of graphene oxide to existing polymer-based water filtration membranes. More traditionally, the $1.75m XPrize Water Abundance was awarded last year to technology that uses distillation to take the water content out of humid air. Skywater machines use a distillation process to turn water vapour to liquid, then treat the water with ozone to prevent contamination with micro-organisms. The more humid the air, the more water can be extracted. However, the technology is still expensive, with prices of $18,000 (£14,000) to $28,000 for units that can process up to 300 gallons a day. For some large urban areas, desalination offers an urgent way out of an increasingly pressing problem. Cate Lamb, the director of water security at CDP, which measures companies’ environmental performance, points to the success of Cape Town, which last year managed to stave off the worst of its water crisis by investing in desalination, as well as restricting water use. Some businesses are also investing in the technology on a smaller scale to supply their operations in water-scarce regions. Lamb says: “Desalination is already having a role to play in aiding cities and companies to respond to water challenges. The deployment of the technology in Cape Town is one of the primary ways in which the city is aiming to enhance resilience.” A recent positive report by financial analysts at Moody’s Investor Service found that the success of Cape Town’s desalination, along with demand management and increased investment in water, was paying off in economic growth and stability, too. “A resilient water sector is critical for the health of Cape Town’s economy and the city’s fiscal position,” said Zoe Jankel, senior analyst. “New investment will enhance that resilience.” If Cape Town is the most recent prominent example of desalination being used to plug an urgent gap, Israel holds the crown for long-term investment in the technology as a strategic public service. The country is home to the world’s biggest reverse-osmosis desalination plant, and can now produce more water than it needs from desalination and water recycling. This could potentially allow for freshwater exports to the surrounding region, and more importantly for the export of “virtual water” – that is, agricultural goods from vegetables and grains to clothing fibres, and manufactured products – to boost its economy. As much as 80% of Israel’s drinking water comes from coastal desalination plants, depending on the time of year and the weather. This is proving so energy-intensive that the biggest plants operate mainly at night, to avoid overloading the power grid. Crucially, however, the country has also invested heavily over decades in the treatment of waste water, recycling nearly 90% of its waste water through sewage treatment plants which then redirect the treated water to irrigation. The sludge byproduct is also used as fertiliser and to generate biogas. This strategy highlights the need for desalination, as it is in Cape Town, to be integrated into an overall water management plan. There is no point in relying on such an expensive way of generating water while wasting the resource in other ways. But where desalination is used without renewables on a large scale, there are always accompanying problems. “It does come with a cost – a carbon cost,” says Lamb. “Further, there are risks associated with the discharge of the large quantities of salt generated. Finally, it’s important to realise that this is a technology that is really only applicable close to the sea. For those that don’t have this luxury, other interventions will be required.” The use of large-scale desalination plants is posing an increasing threat to the health of the seas, a recent report from the UN University found. For every litre of freshwater created from a conventional desalination plant, an average of 1.5 litres of brine is also made. Globally, desalination plants now discharge 142m cubic metres of highly salty brine every day, which is about 50% greater than previous estimates. In a year, that quantity would be enough to cover an area the size of Florida with 30cm of brine. The report’s authors warned that the outflows of brine were depleting the dissolved oxygen in the surrounding seas, with damaging effects on marine life. They called for investment in promising new technologies which could reduce the amount of effluent that is wasted, by converting the metal byproducts – such as sodium, magnesium, lithium, calcium and potassium – to a useful form, which is currently uneconomic to do. They also suggested the saline byproducts could be used in fish farms, where saltier water can result in bigger fish, and in the irrigation of salt-tolerant crops. Even with advances in desalination technology, there will still be drawbacks to its widespread use, not least issues of scaling up technology to the size of the water shortage problem. Virginia Newton-Lewis, senior policy analyst for water security at the charity WaterAid, says governments need to focus on myriad ways of providing the most fundamental service – clean water – to their populations, before becoming mired in what could be expensive and hi-tech desalination equipment. “What we need to see is universal provision of household drinking water to become a top political priority,” she says. “Lack of access to safe water supplies is often down to insufficient finance or political will to support basic services, rather than a physical absence of available water.” Even in areas where water is physically in short supply, there are alternatives that should be explored as a matter of urgency. “Improved water management that prioritises household water supplies could have a huge impact, with very low economic costs,” she says. “It’s a matter of prioritising communities’ clean water supplies ahead of industry and agriculture. Desalination is expensive, causes pollution and has a number of limitations. Therefore, although it definitely has a role to play in certain areas, there are often much more appropriate solutions available.” • Fiona Harvey is an environment correspondent for the Guardian • This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

In the next 12 years, we need to reverse the trend of Earth’s increasing temperature or face drought, floods and extreme heat – and devastating knock-on effects felt by all life on the planet. But what can we do? And can we do it quickly enough? Researchers in universities across the UK are working on answers to these huge questions. Here are some of their most exciting recent sustainability findings. A plastic-eating enzyme You’ve probably seen the distressing images of plastic-polluted oceans, or the nearly 50-year-old plastic bottle that just washed up on UK shores. Luckily, scientists from the University of Portsmouth may have a solution. They are part of an international team working on an enzyme that can digest polyethylene terephthalate, a common plastic often found in bottles. This could lead to the millions of tonnes of plastic waste currently polluting the environment disappearing a lot faster than the usual hundreds of years it takes to degrade. The same team has also recently discovered an enzyme that turns waste into useful materials, which could be used to create nylon and bioplastics. A genome map of the golden eagle As gene-sequencing technology becomes more and more advanced, the Wellcome Trust has joined forces with universities across the country to sequence the genomes of 25 species, including a collaboration with the University of Edinburgh to map the DNA of the golden eagle. Their habitats are disappearing and the population is falling, so having the whole genome is a “game-changer”, according to the lead scientist on the project. This will allow for previously impossible research into all aspects of the birds’ lives, including their reintroduction to areas where they have disappeared. A plan to cut carbon emissions Renewable energy technology is advancing, but we need to do all we can to cut carbon emissions. Scientists from Imperial College London and the University of Sheffield have a simple solution: gas. They found that the UK reduced its carbon emissions by 25% in 2016 as a result of using the country’s gas infrastructure at its full capacity, and their projections suggest that global carbon emissions could be cut by 3% per year if other countries adopted the same approach. It’s not a long-term strategy, the team says, but offers a quick and cheap solution to reduce emissions while other approaches are developed. A storage solution for man-made carbon dioxide Removing man-made carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by injecting it into volcanic bedrock was previously dismissed as impractical, because it was thought that the process would take hundreds of years. But an international team of scientists, including an associate professor from the University of Southampton, injected CO2 into a study site in Iceland and found that between 95 and 98% of it had formed “environmentally benign” minerals within two years. An urban wind turbine Wind turbines aren’t just based in remote places for aesthetic reasons – they are only able to harness wind that is travelling in one direction which is why they don’t work in cities, where the layout bends gusts all over the place. The O-Wind Turbine, created by two MSc students at Lancaster University, overcomes this: it’s a 25cm sphere which spins when wind hits it from any direction, generating energy even in built-up urban areas. The project has already won this year’s national James Dyson award. A new fibre made from 98% water Architects and chemists from the University of Cambridge have joined forces to create a new material that mimics spider silk. The artificial fibres are made from 98% water and are incredibly strong (with similar qualities to bungee cord), which means the material could be used in textiles and other industries. Crucially, it is non-toxic and can be created at room temperature, offering a sustainable alternative to the current methods of production of synthetic materials. A biofuel that uses seawater Biofuels are a hot topic, and bioethanol is of particular interest: it’s a liquid petrol substitute than can be created from crops including corn, maize, wheat and waste straw. But the current fermentation process needs freshwater, which puts a drain on another valuable resource. Microbiologists from the University of Nottingham have discovered that seawater and a marine-based yeast can be used in the process, making it an even more sustainable option. A way to convert agricultural waste into clean energy Scientists from the University of Manchester have been working with communities in Vietnam, Colombia and sub-Saharan Africa to turn waste products from agriculture into clean fuel. Now they’re going a step further by partnering with renewable energy companies to build a pilot processing plant in the Philippines that will make use of rice straw, a waste product from rice farming that is usually burned in fields. A new solar energy source The wish-list for any environmentally friendly fuel source includes being cheap, clean and reproducible on a large scale. Researchers from the University of Exeter may have found one that ticks all three boxes: by using a photoelectrode that absorbs light and splits water into oxygen and hydrogen, they’ve developed a new technique for turning the latter into fuel. Because it’s powered by sunlight, the method will reduce carbon emissions and create a “virtually limitless” energy source. A battery that charges electric cars in seconds One of the biggest problems with electric cars is how long they take to charge – getting a full battery often means leaving them plugged in overnight. Chemists from the University of Glasgow have developed a new battery system using “a nano-molecule that can store electric power or hydrogen gas” that could fully charge an electric car battery in just a few seconds, making it far more appealing for consumers.

Party leaders respond","bodyText":"Jeremy Corbyn, Labour: It’s past time all of us stopped looking the other way By taking to the streets today to make their voices heard, young people are educating us about how important tackling climate change is to their generation. They are right to be worried about what kind of planet they will inherit and right to demand far-reaching action. Governments cannot sit back, leaving major decisions to market forces. It hasn’t worked and it never will. Polluting corporations will never do anything serious to solve the crisis. Climate change presents terrible risks. But because it demands such massive change and government action, it’s also an opportunity to transform our economy, making it cleaner, healthier and fairer. Labour already has among the most ambitions carbon reduction targets in Europe and radical plans to create a zero-carbon emission economy by 2050. We plan to achieve that by ushering in a “green industrial revolution”. We have the plans to create hundreds of thousands of well-paid jobs in the renewable energy sector. That will help meet our target of 60% of energy to come from low-carbon sources within 12 years. The next generation will be trained in the skills needed to work in offshore wind, tidal lagoons and solar energy. Transport currently accounts for a quarter of the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions. By investing in public transport and cycle paths we will reduce our reliance on carbon-emitting vehicles. All new homes built will be zero-carbon too. The UK is home to some of the least populated areas of Europe, and under a green industrial revolution they will be allowed to thrive, not destroyed. Every national and local park in this country has been a victory won by communities through struggle. In the 1930s, working-class people staged a mass protest fighting their way up Kinder Scout in Derbyshire to fight for the “right to roam”, paving the way for the establishment of our national parks years later by a Labour government. And it was Labour’s postwar prime minister Clement Attlee who said that the countryside was not just “a means of producing food, but part of our great national heritage of beauty”. Building on this legacy, a Labour government will ensure that farming conserves and creates safe habitats for birds, insects and other wild animals, and encourages the growth of wildflowers. Labour has a strong record of international leadership on the environment, and action on climate change will be at the heart of our development and trade policies. We have a role not just in protecting and promoting biodiversity in the UK but protecting it in other countries and in the oceans that connect us. It’s past time all of us stopped looking the other way, learn from the passion and wisdom of young people and join them in actively organising for a better future. • Jeremy Corbyn is MP for Islington North and leader of the Labour party Conservative party The Conservative party was invited to participate, but declined. Nicola Sturgeon, SNP: It’s right we are all challenged to see where we can do more Climate change is the most serious issue facing the world and is a truly global challenge. We have a moral responsibility to do what we can to prevent and mitigate the effects of climate change for future generations. Scotland has been praised as a world leader for the action we are taking to address the issue. We have introduced a new climate change bill that contains the most ambitious statutory targets of any country in the world for 2020, 2030 and 2040, and will mean Scotland is carbon neutral by 2050. However, the urgency of climate change means it is right that we are all challenged to constantly reassess our approach and to see where we can do more. It is of course extremely important that school pupils attend their lessons, and as first minister, I could not condone repeated absences during term time. But in Scotland our schools teach and encourage our young people to engage in public debate and to learn about the issues that concern them. Lowering the voting age to 16 as we have done since 2014 has only enhanced our political debate and in 2018 we celebrated the Year of Young People. The year gave young people new opportunities for their voices to be heard in all parts of our society and helped foster better understanding, cooperation and respect between generations. On a matter of such importance as climate change, it is inspiring that young people are engaged, interested and ready to take action themselves to hold world leaders and governments to account. Later this month I will be meeting a group of young people from across Scotland who have been active climate change campaigners to discuss the issue and hear their concerns. We must listen to the voice of the next generation and involve them in decision-making and policy development. It is their planet to inherit, and their passion to protect it should inspire us all. • Nicola Sturgeon is first minister of Scotland and leader of the SNP Vince Cable, Liberal Democrats: It’s our responsibility to support young people The students who are taking part in this climate strike are right to highlight what is the most serious issue facing any of us. Just as with Brexit, young people will be most acutely affected, and it’s our responsibility to support them. Liberal Democrats invested heavily in a cleaner environment during our period in government, setting up the Green Investment Bank, encouraging homes to cut emissions through the Green Deal, and cutting plastic bag usage by 85% through the 5p levy. Since Liberal Democrats left government the Conservatives have abandoned the positive record of the coalition. They have effectively banned onshore wind turbines, slashed subsidies to solar power, pursued an ideological obsession with fracking, cut incentives for electric vehicles, scrapped zero-carbon homes, cancelled rail electrification projects and approved a new runway at Heathrow. The hostility now levelled at young people who are taking a stand on this issue demonstrates that these strikes are noticed by those in power. It’s now up to Westminster to act responsibly – coming together across parties – to act on the demands of those who care about our planet. The failing Brexit project has crowded out too many important issues over the last three years, and it’s time our political system addressed itself once again to climate change. The Liberal Democrats will continue to be the greenest party in Westminster, and to argue that climate action can best be achieved at a European and international level – working with our neighbours rather than turning our backs. • Vince Cable is leader of the Liberal Democrats and former secretary of state for business Adam Price, Plaid Cymru: Time is running out If I were a school pupil today I would be striking against climate change and would make sure the whole school was striking with me. The reason couldn’t be simpler: time is running out. Time is running out to make the changes to our way of life, how we produce and use energy, how we travel around this Earth, how we build and warm our homes, how we use our natural resources. The threat is bleak: whole states disappearing underwater because of increases in sea level; not just more drought, but more starvation on an international level; widespread disappearance of species and an environment that is far more challenging to life on this Earth. We’re not just on the brink of ecological catastrophe, we’re in the middle of one. But what I’ve seen so clearly by these school strikers so far is that from speaker after speaker, young person after young person there is such an outpouring of eloquence, of vision, of positivity. To stand up and fight for the Earth is the noblest of all causes. Climate change faces humanity as a whole. It should be the main discussion across chambers, but Brexit has sucked the oxygen from our politics. It feels as if we should skip a generation in politics. Young people are demonstrating the vision and determined leadership to make is possible to make significant and swift progress towards a low-carbon existence. To follow their lead means that we can’t wait until Westminster wakes up. We all must be brave. The small town of Machynlleth in mid-Wales has been one of the very few towns in the world to declare a climate emergency, with ambition to make its buildings eco-friendly, encourage renewable energy developments and ensure its pension fund divested from fossil fuels. What got Machynlleth to make the commitment? It was a petition signed by 500 local people; a small community-sized step with a worldwide impact. • Adam Price is leader of Plaid Cymru Siân Berry, Green party: Youth strikers know the planet can’t wait Hope. That was what I felt when I entered Parliament Square last month to be greeted by hundreds of young people at the first Youth Strike 4 Climate in Britain. That day one young person carried a sign that read: “We are missing our lessons to teach you.” The question now is whether Westminster will listen to the wisdom of youth. Last year the UN warned we have a limited window of opportunity until 2030 to take positive action to limit climate catastrophe. Since then, councils across the country have declared a climate emergency with many committing to gold-standard climate action – often prompted by Green councillors. But parliament is still dragging its heels. This week, the chancellor tried to fob off the rising tide of youth activism with token policies that don’t go far enough. He said he plans to make travel companies offset carbon, yet is still building new runways. He talked about biodiversity, but kept quiet about his devastating cuts to Natural England. And his government is doing nothing to break the toxic hold fossil-fuel bosses have on our lawmakers. Youth strikers across the world know the planet can’t wait. I’m proud it’s my colleague in parliament, Caroline Lucas, demanding the government launch a Green New Deal with money ploughed into thousands of new green jobs and transformed local energy and transport networks. If ministers are serious about securing the planet for our children, they will act now. As a Green elected to represent millions of young Londoners, it’s amazing to see them make these demands of me and my political colleagues. It will be a privilege to stand beside our young people again today as they strike for their futures – I implore those in power to listen to their demands. • Siân Berry is co-leader of the Green party"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"culture/2018/aug/28/how-we-made-bagdad-cafe","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-08-28T05:00:04Z","webTitle":"How we made Bagdad Café","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/aug/28/how-we-made-bagdad-cafe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2018/aug/28/how-we-made-bagdad-cafe","fields":{"headline":"How we made Bagdad Café","bodyText":"Percy Adlon, director It was a Christmas vacation and we were travelling the desert on Route 66 with our kids. We saw these strange lights in the sky, which came from, as we later discovered, a solar energy project. We took photographs and fantasised about writing a story for the actor Marianne Sägebrecht, who we had had a success with in a film I’d directed called Sugar Baby. We just improvised and started joking about our round German star meeting with Whoopi Goldberg, because we had just seen The Color Purple. We saw the name Bagdad on a map, and we went there and there was nothing: just a few trees and a rundown gas station. We brought the two together under those solar lights and created our own Bagdad. The film is a kind of a fairytale. I wanted the desert to look the way I imagine it and not how it really does, which is kind of grey. I wanted it to look like a Salvador Dalí painting. It has its own colours and I wanted them strong, as if they’re coming from inside and not from outside. We had this mix of people: the Native American who is the sheriff, the abused German housewife who has an urge to clean everything and this struggling black family trying to make ends meet. They are all what Trump really hates. Because of our strange time with this exclusion of everybody who is not white, our film is now more urgent and contemporary than when we shot it 30 years ago. Jack Palance at that time had a bad reputation. He was out of luck. I said, “I need somebody for this character who reeks of Hollywood,” and an actress from General Hospital recommended him. He passed on a $1m offer to do a big TV series to make our film and his agents were angry at him, but it was great. He got the Oscar for City Slickers but they said he really got it for Bagdad Café. The song Calling You was written for the film by Bob Telson. Neither of us liked typical film music. When I met him, he said: “I like film music best when Woody Allen turns on the radio.” He delivered Calling You and it changed his life. It was the biggest hit of his career. I think we made some good films, but Bagdad Café is outstanding. We’re very thankful for that. We thought it would not get out of this family of arthouse audiences, and so on. And then it suddenly burst into flames, with everybody. It was amazing. CCH Pounder, actor The best thing about Bagdad Café is how people are so grateful they have seen it – how it has inspired them to do something about their lives. I got tons of letters from people who wanted to leave the corporate world and reawaken their creative life. When they see the film they say: “I’m gonna do it.” Or, many people tell me: “I finally came out to my mum and dad.” I got these kind of letters day in, day out. I knew I had it at the audition: Percy couldn’t stay seated. He kept jumping up, as if he was having fits. And we had incredible fun on set. It was the only film I’ve ever made that’s been shot in sequence. It worked so beautifully because I didn’t know Marianne any more in character than I did in real life. It was one of those inch-by-inch, marvellous things. We were isolated in the desert in a hotel that had just been built and we, the film crew and cast, were the only occupants. The cabaret act was terrific, because we learned the tricks and we were good enough that we actually got into the local magic club. I remember in the beginning Percy, who was so sweet, said: “Could you make it, umm, more black?” And I said: “Percy, look at me. You are doing a film about trying to avoid stereotypes and here you are, falling into your own trap. Be careful.” So that was a good education for all of us that day. I love the suspicion he created between the two women. Brenda, my character, calls the sheriff to say, of Jasmin: “I don’t know what it is but something is wrong with this lady.” But she couldn’t put her finger on it. There were things Percy saw that I really appreciated. I loved the way he left everything open for you to discover. Bagdad Café was transformational, knowing that you had this possibility, with a great film to encourage people to change their lives. For the first time we saw a female in charge of something, particularly a woman of colour. I used to say I regretted that was my first film because it was so magnificent for me, and as an actor you think, “Wow, if I start out like that, can you imagine what other characters I could play?” In fact, sometimes it doesn’t happen. Sometimes it’s just work.

As well as diverting effort into battles with the criminal justice system, it distracts from thousands of ways to decarbonise the economy: pension funds, insurance companies and banks control $400tn in assets, making decisions daily about where to invest, as well as influencing company boards, as Larry Elliott points out (Threadneedle Street’s timely warning for banks and insurers to take climate change seriously, 16 April). Local authorities shape our environment (and own £400bn in assets), and soon voters will decide who should run them. Every employer, school and household can make decisions that turn away from chaos. The suffragettes’ battle for the vote is celebrated as a great victory for direct action, but 100 years later the struggle for women’s equality is still being waged within countless institutions. Creating lasting change takes political skill, as well as passion and persistence. For democracies to solve difficult problems like climate change and inequality, schools need to teach practical politics as a basic skill. Titus Alexander Author of Practical Politics: Lessons in Power and Democracy; convener, Democracy Matters • I agree with Ben Smoke that it’s important not to fetishise the number of arrests in relation to current protests. Extinction Rebellion places too much emphasis on number of arrests. Think the government will negotiate on matters of substance? Think again. I speak as one taking part in the actions this week. The urgency is real, and people need to know the truth. But it will take profound public pressure on other parts of our system that hold us in stasis – vested interests, fossil fuel companies particularly, MPs and ministers, the media, finance, and local government. We need to listen to our allies and work with them, community groups and NGOs particularly. Extinction Rebellion’s sophistication around direct action will need to be matched by effective political strategy to achieve the kind of changes needed. Gill Westcott Cheriton Bishop, Exeter • Thirty years ago I was chair of the Green party’s media committee. Caroline Lucas was the party’s press officer. We were working on the 1989 European election campaign – the one where the Greens won 15% of the vote but no seats (no PR then). Two days ago, I visited three of the four Extinction Rebellion sites and talked to activists. They were deeply impressive, committed people – non-violent, refusing to blame and shame, empathic, compassionate and universalist (Climate protesters target transport and Corbyn, as disruption hits traders, 18 April). Everything the Green party said 30 years ago is coming to pass. The planet can’t wait much longer. I commend the bravery, passion and wit of Extinction rebels. Recognised routes of influencing events have failed. Non-violent direct action led to the birth of civil rights for all in the US. Maybe it can lead to a Green New Deal here. This may be our last chance. Lyn Dade Twickenham, Middlesex • I read the article by Mark Carney, François Villeroy de Galhau and Frank Elderson of the Network for Greening the Financial System (Global finance must go green if we are to fight climate change, 17 April) on the way to an investor meeting, which I had to cancel due to the Extinction Rebellion protests at Oxford Circus. I’m raising investment for a reusable plastic-free biodegradable and compostable paint tin, to stop plastic single-use items ending up in landfill or the ocean in their hundreds of millions. I don’t disagree with the aims of the protest, but targeting all the business community is not right. Some of us get it and are doing something about it; please, activists, focus your protests on those who aren’t. Kim Thonger Finedon, Northamptonshire • The letter about HS2 from Andy Burnham and Steve Rotheram (19 April), mayors of Manchester and Liverpool, might be persuasive if it were not written while Extinction Rebellion takes action against climate catastrophe and David Attenborough delivers his powerful piece on BBC One. The mayors’ letter is peppered with words and phrases that mean growth: economic potential, released capacity and, of course, the yearned-for “powerhouse”. But what the young people of Extinction Rebellion are saying is: how can you offer us a future based on growth? What is the point of releasing capacity if we run out of the planet’s fundamental resources: water, clean air, space to live that will not be flooded with seawater, soil in which food can grow? What we need is a plan – a transport plan, an everything plan – that considers every single aspect in relation to the threat to these resources. Alison Leonard Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire No more tall glass buildings Tall glass buildings have a devastating effect on our collective wellbeing (Global finance must go green if we are to fight climate change, Journal, 17 April). They produce more CO2 per metre squared in construction and operation for every higher floor they support. Their huge energy demand spikes at the hottest/coldest times of day/year, driving grids to the brink of collapse. In future extreme heatwaves, like that of 2003, they can cause power outages across whole regions and resulting citizen deaths. They increase pedestrian discomfort, even killing people with the superwinds created around their structures. When they burn catastrophically, people above the fire may not survive. They reflect heat on to adjacent buildings, driving up their energy consumption and discomfort in those opposite. They shade whole urban areas from winter sun and the ability to generate solar energy in their shadow. They can destroy the mental peace of neighbourhoods by their overbearing dominance of the skyline, like the Walkie Talkie in London. Who will pay to demolish them when they catastrophically fail, like Grenfell Tower did? Yet planners ignore such risks and fall over themselves to give permission for the next one. Norman Foster’s Tulip is the latest unnecessary London ego trip. The Tulip is indeed a huge (light) bulb heating up the sky and driving climate change. Bankers must take the responsible step of de-risking cities by never again financing these structures that should now be seen as gigantic climate risks. Susan Roaf Oxford Invest in low-carbon but not in nuclear In a week when Brexit for once did not lead the headlines, it is the world’s most critical problem that has come back to the fore – the dire concerns over climate change. Mark Carney’s warning to financial regulators, banks and insurers around the world to “raise the bar” can’t come soon enough. The Extinction Rebellion movement has very much focused attention this week on climate change, and whatever their methods, it is really important we focus public policy on this massive threat to our long-term wellbeing. Councils are fully aware of their important responsibility in this as local leaders, and the raft of climate emergency resolutions, coupled with developing programmes of radical action, is our contribution to dealing with this existential threat. It is about time the financiers picked up the baton, as the major societal change required to come anywhere close to dealing with this challenge needs both lots of money and the transformation of economies to work. So I encourage this sector to work more effectively with government at all levels and stop investing in high-carbon fossil fuels, but also in nuclear power, which is just too slow to realise and too expensive to deal with the urgency of the climate crisis. Billions, if not trillions, needs to be invested now in low-carbon energy, storage, efficiency, transport and heating solutions. Politicians can only do so much. Extinction Rebellion is right in that we should have been taking much more urgent action over the past 40 years, and as policymakers we should accept that common failure. Now is the time for rapid change so that all our grandchildren and future generations can have a real chance of a decent life. To the financial sector, I urge them to get on with supporting us in that endeavour. Councillor David Blackburn Chair of UK and Ireland Nuclear Free Local Authorities steering committee Vital that energy sector is nationalised The article by Clive Lewis MP was excellent (Labour’s message to UK’s young climate strikers, theguardian.com, 12 April). But Labour’s ambition for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by mid-century is not fast enough. We will be committed to at least 2C warming by then due to CO2’s long lifecycle. The scientists who publish the IPCC report have been clear – we have 12 years to transform our power infrastructure. That transformation will cost $45tn according to the International Energy Agency. Your article on Mark Carney’s warning to the financial sector cites a figure of $20tn for assets at risk due to climate change. There are only three choices regarding who will pay these gigantic bills: governments, consumers or shareholders. Only the government has the balance sheet, the borrowing capacity and the timeframe to mothball fossil fuel-driven power plants and build new renewable energy assets. As Gordon Brown taught the world in the 2008 financial meltdown, if you want to move fast, nationalise. The only practical way to turbocharge the energy transition is to nationalise the power sector, allowing existing shareholders an exit or opportunity to swap their shares into a renewable sector de-risked by government involvement. In simple terms, a government exists to do what citizens cannot do for themselves. The ability to mobilise resources in the face of an external threat led the UK to its “finest hour”, as Churchill observed. The first paper connecting CO2 and the greenhouse effect came out in the 1970s. Nearly 50 years later the nations of the world have failed to rein in the pollutants responsible for global warming. The next generation are demanding a response to the climate crisis and those with the experience to legislate, to finance and to procure must advance bold measures such as nationalisation to deliver a better future. John Curtis Director, Ventnor Botanic Garden Rebels cannot be all things to all people Regarding Andre Spicer’s article about Extinction Rebellion (The Extinction Rebels have got their tactics badly wrong. Here’s why, theguardian.com, 19 April), semantics are important on the left/right political axis, but what’s more important is the plurality of messaging. Extinction Rebellion cannot be all things to all people. In the wake of the current protests and David Attenborough’s Climate Change – The Facts programme, it’s now the job of other voices across the political and cultural spectrum to sound the clarion of change in language their respective demographics will understand. Extinction Rebellion and Attenborough’s team have opened the door to making that possible. Those of us in the media, the arts and beyond have a duty to get on with it. Blake Wellsted London Environment must top political agenda Sajid Javid referred to protesters “disrupting the lives of others” (Report, 19 April). Presumably far better to leave it until their lives are disrupted by rising sea levels, ferocious storms, flood, drought, crop failure, starvation, mass migration and extinction of much of the life of the biosphere. Any politician with the intelligence, or care for humanity, to see beyond the next election would be in Westminster right now urgently working out how to save the world from approaching catastrophe – but maybe that’s somewhere on the list, after the next-but-one Brexit extension.

Here’s what you might have missed today: Barnaby Joyce was sworn in as deputy prime minister and faced his first question time since returning to the job. New South Wales recorded 10 new cases of Covid-19, on top of the two previously reported, taking the total in the Bondi cluster to 21. All but two of the cases were already isolating, and six are household contacts. NSW has extended the mask mandate indoors for Sydney for another week Queensland reported one new case of Covid-19, a man in his 60s tested who visited the Portuguese Family Centre at Ellen Grove at the same time as a woman who tested positive on Sunday. Queensland and South Australia will open the borders to Victoria from Friday. The Northern Territory will require people visiting from the Waverley or Woollahra local government areas to go into quarantine for 14 days. The NSW government said in handing down its budget on Tuesday it expects a $466m surplus in 2024-25 Amy Remeikis will be back with you tomorrow morning for the second-last sitting day of the Winter sitting calendar. The Morrison government is facing calls from its powerful security committee to list the entirety of Hizballah as a terrorist organisation under the criminal code. This evening, the parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security published its report on the government’s plans to re-list Hizballah’s External Security Organisation (ESO), which has been designated in that way since 2003. The committee backed the re-listing – which will be the seventh. But the committee chair, Liberal senator James Paterson, told the Senate this evening that the committee “was concerned by the decision to, at this stage, only re-list Hizballah’s ESO”. Paterson said the committee’s previous review in 2018 recommended extending the listing to include Hizballah’s military wing: “In this report the committee goes a step further. We recommend the government consider listing Hizballah in its entirety as a terrorist organisation. We do so based on the expert evidence received by the committee that the distinction that we currently draw between Hizballah’s ESO and the rest of Hizballah is an arbitrary one.” Paterson said Australia’s position of listing only the ESO was “increasingly isolated internationally”. “Twenty-two countries and two regional organisations list them in their entirety, including our Five Eyes allies such as the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada; like-minded countries such as Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Japan; and Arab countries and groupings including the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, the Gulf Cooperation Council and the Arab League.” Labor’s Kristina Keneally told the Senate: “This is a bipartisan report, unanimously supported.” The chief health officer of the Northern Territory has declared the Waverley Council and Woollahra Council local government areas Covid-19 hotspots, following the Bondi outbreak growing to 21 cases. Anyone who arrives in the NT from these areas from 5pm on 22 June must undertake 14 days of mandatory, supervised quarantine at the Alice Springs or Howard Springs quarantine facilities. They must also go into quarantine if they are defined as a close contact by NSW Health. Anyone who arrived in the NT between 11 June and 5pm 22 June from those areas must immediately get tested and isolate for 14 days in their home or a suitable place if they’re defined as a close contact. They must remain in quarantine, except to get tested, until noon on the 14th day after they were in a case location, regardless of if they receive a negative result. People who are considered casual contacts and arrived in the same time period must get tested and isolate until they get a negative result. After South Australia and Queensland’s decision to remove quarantine restrictions from Melbourne this coming Friday, Western Australia could remove the quarantine requirement next week, AAP reports. The WA premier, Mark McGowan, says that requirement will likely be removed by next week assuming Victoria remains on its current trajectory of Covid-19 cases. But McGowan indicated the rules for NSW visitors could change in the next few days. People who have been in NSW must isolate until they return a negative test, while anyone who has visited exposure sites must serve the full 14 days quarantine. “We have a pretty strong arrangement in place for NSW currently but if we need to tighten it further, we will,” McGowan told reporters. New South Wales Health has announced the following Covid-19 exposure sites. People who attended at the listed times must call NSW Health on 1800 943 553, get tested and isolate for 14 days, regardless of the result: Wallabies Thai Restaurant (anyone who dined in the outside area), Mascot, Saturday 19 June between 11.30am and 12pm Chanel fragrance and beauty, Level 4, Westfield Bondi, Friday 18 June between 12pm and 12.25pm ANZ 20 Martin Place (anyone on Level 2), Sydney, Thursday 17 June between 11:45am and 3:15pm Anyone who was at the following venues must get tested and isolate until a negative result is returned: Wallabies Thai Restaurant (anyone who dined inside), Mascot, Saturday 19 June between 11.30am and 12pm Starbucks, Level 2, Westfield Bondi, Friday 18 June, between 11am and 12pm ANZ 20 Martin Place (Anyone on Ground and Level 1), Sydney, Thursday 17 June 2021 between 11:45am and 3:15pm Anyone who attended the following places at the listed times should monitor for symptoms and if they appear, isolate and get tested until a negative result is received: Mascot Central Shopping Precinct Etherden Walk, Mascot Anytime from Friday 18 June 2021 to Tuesday 22 June 2021. NSW Health also says fragments of the Covid-19 virus have been found in the Brooklyn and Lough Park sewerage treatment plants, which cover Dangar Island, Cowan, Brooklyn, Mooney Mooney, Cheerio Point, Clovelly, Waverley, Randwick, Centennial Park, Queens Park, Bondi, Bondi Junction, Bellevue Hill, Double Bay, Woollahra. People in those areas are being advised to monitor for symptoms and get tested if they appear. Josh Taylor is coming to my rescue and unchaining me from the blog so I will leave you in his wonderful hands to take you through the evening. There is a bit of a subdued feeling in the building at the moment – I think the events of the last two days are starting to settle in. Today was just a taster. A very big thank you to my eyes, ears and the blog’s heart, Mike Bowers, for all his work today (and always) and to Katharine Murphy, Daniel Hurst, Paul Karp and Sarah Martin for all their brains, work and humour. But as always the biggest thank you has to go to you – thank you for making it all worth it. I’m working my way back through the messages. Thanks to everyone for their thoughts, comments and musings (and even the criticisms) – they always make me think, which, when it’s as fast-paced as this project is, is a very good thing. I’ll be back tomorrow for another day of the Barnaby show – don’t expect too much from Scott Morrison this week, particularly when it comes to Labor, who are deliberately doing all they can to sideline the prime minister from the parliament while he attends remotely. Can’t imagine he is enjoying the week, given how much he likes to control the messaging, and the House. Have a lovely evening, and have fun with Josh. I’ll see you soon – and as always, take care of you. Over in the House of Representatives, MPs have just debated a motion from the independent Zali Steggall to disallow $50m in funding allocated to developing the gas reserves in the Beetaloo Basin in the Northern Territory. (This measure is part of the Morrison government’s gas fired recovery). The Steggall motion triggered a debate in the Labor caucus a couple of weeks ago when the recommendation came to vote against the Beetaloo disallowance. Labor MPs including Ged Kearney, Libby Coker and Graham Perrett said supporting new gas development wasn’t a great idea. Joel Fitzgibbon and Bill Shorten were among other Labor MPs who supported the recommendation to the caucus. In any case, the motion has been debated. Steggall’s proposal was seconded by fellow independent Helen Haines and backed by the Greens leader Adam Bandt. Both Coalition and Labor MPs voted against the Steggall proposal, so it was defeated. The Senate has rearranged its business this evening, at the government’s motion. First up is the attempt to disallow the government’s changes to the Australian Renewable Energy Agency that allowed it to invest in carbon capture and storage. The Greens believed votes on this would be tight - but given the government is bringing this on for a vote it seems likely the Coalition and One Nation will team up to defeat it. If it’s not disallowed, it may only be a matter of time before the instrument is in the courts, because even the Liberal-controlled delegated legislation committee doesn’t think it is consistent with the Act. After that are a series of government bills, including the Online Safety bill which Labor has offered its support for. Last is the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (2021 Measures No.1) Bill 2021. The Greens expect the government will amend its own bill gutting the proposed changes to local content rules after a critical report from the Senate communications committee. These matters will be wrapped up by votes at 9:15pm, if not sooner. There is a lot at stake over not acting on climate change, or doing whatever can be done to ensure at least some of the Great Barrier Reef survives in a warming climate. As Save the Children’s Paul Mitchell points out, that includes Australia’s responsibility to our neighbours: The knock on impacts extend to our Pacific neighbours, such as Fiji, Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands. The threats facing the Great Barrier Reef, such as increasing ocean acidification and temperatures, more intense storms and increasing coastal flooding, impact smaller reefs across the Pacific. Reefs in these countries provide vital contributions to livelihoods and food security in some of the world’s poorest and most vulnerable communities. Unaddressed, this will reduce the food security of people who rely on reef fish and undermine their way of life. As reefs bleach and die, the protection they provide coastal communities from storm surges also erodes - leaving people more exposed to increasingly fierce storms.” Liberal MP Dave Sharma was on the ABC’s Afternoon Briefing reminding us that there are Liberals who will push back against the Nationals increasingly loud rumblings on climate and net zero by 2050: I don’t expect the prime minister will change his position on this. This is a position the cabinet has adopted and reflects the leadership of his party, the Liberal party. It is not a position on the Nationals but in terms of the Liberal party, the prime minister has articulated our views and position on this. He is a leader of the government and the Nationals form part of that government. What he’s had to say on this remains government policy and will continue to remain government policy. I’m not going to pretend there aren’t internal differences of view within our Coalition about this but there are equally internal differences of view within Labor about this – and I won’t seek to capitalise on those and exaggerate those here. We do need to build a broad political consensus within Australia. That involves regions and cities and different states and the more resource-exposed industries if we’re to get this done. The fact we’ve got different representatives who represent different electorates and different views is not all that surprising. As has been pointed out, Barnaby Joyce had daughters his entire political career before this point as well. Today he raised it in question time. Terri Butler was asked about the ‘as the father of daughters’ line while on the ABC and said: Look, I really think people are sick of men in power pointing to the fact they have daughters when they’re asked about issues relating to the status of women. I don’t think it goes very well at all. I think what people want is to see a more diverse parliament, a more diverse government and a government that treats issues relating to women and women’s safety seriously. This year has been a terrible year for this government when it comes to issues relating to the treatment of women. They need to do better. The deputy prime minister of Australia cannot just bat away this really serious question by pointing to the fact he’s a father of daughters. People are really sick of that stuff. They actually want to see real action. I think people take issue with it because women are human beings with inherent value. They’re not just of value because men have female relations. I think people take issue with it because women should be seen as people who are entitled to expect to live in a safe and prosperous nation. And they shouldn’t have to appeal to people’s sense of possession or the fact they’ve got daughters or sense of, because I’ve got daughters, now women become important when they weren’t before. That’s not the way the world works. Women are people. Women’s rights ... human rights. It’s been said for decades and remains true. So this whole situation of having the men of the Liberal and National party stand up and pretend they couldn’t possibly have any problems with the issues, the serious issues relating to the treatment of women and women’s safety in this country because they have female relatives, is nonsense and people are sick of it. Over in the Senate: In the Coalition party room blue on childcare, two senators indicated they may cross the floor: National Matt Canavan and Liberal Gerard Rennick. Canavan kicked off the debate by saying he didn’t support the bill unless there was extra support for parents to care for their children in their own homes. Rennick later said he would struggle to vote for additional support for the sector which already receives $10bn per year. Rennick told Guardian Australia: I’m not happy about the bill – I think we should give a payment to all parents and then they work out how they spend that. Childcare doesn’t help shift workers, it doesn’t help mothers on a farm, or people who do a couple of hours of work but don’t need eight hours of care [the fortnightly minimum to receive childcare subsidies]. This sector receives $10bn – and it all goes into the pockets of the childcare centre owners and unions.” Rennick said the government’s policy “shouldn’t distinguish between stay-at-home parents and those that return to work”, noting that while tens of thousands of parents may want to go back to work if childcare subsidies were higher “how many at work would rather stay at home if they had that choice?” He said: I understand why many want to go back to work. I understand they don’t want to give up their careers. But this is about choice and basically ensuring equality of choice.” Graham Readfearn and Adam Morton have the Queensland government’s side of the Unesco news: Queensland’s environment minister says UN officials recommending the Great Barrier Reef be placed on the world heritage “in danger” list shows the Morrison government must do more to deal with the climate crisis. Meaghan Scanlon’s comments put the state government at odds with the federal environment minister, Sussan Ley, who has accused the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization of a “complete subversion of normal process”. Ley on Tuesday said the UN body assured her department a week ago it would not suggest an “in danger” listing. The Australian government has vowed to fight the recommendation, which will be considered by the 21-member world heritage committee next month. Queensland’s environment minister said she did not want the reef placed on the list but the recommendation clearly “shows that more needs to be done and the world is watching”. The Greens have tried this a few times (and been blocked or gagged) and it looks like the Senate president is making moves to stop them from trying to move it again. The new skilled job shortage list is out. Here is how Mike Bowers saw QT: When Barnaby Joyce first started speaking, Ed Husic could be heard saying, “This is like The Shining! Here’s Barnaby!’ I guess the best horror movies are the ones based on real life. As Amy noted, Bob Katter asked Barnaby Joyce in question time if he was “aware that China holds the chairmanship of Unesco, currently meeting in China”. It was a prelude to Katter suggesting Unesco’s recommendation overnight that the Great Barrier Reef be listed as “in danger” was “a serious erosion of Australia’s sovereignty and another intrusion into the control room of our country” – with China apparently behind it. The question was passed to the environment minister, Sussan Ley, who might have pointed out that she was not aware that China held the chairmanship of Unesco. Because it doesn’t. The chair of Unesco’s executive board is Agapito Mba Mokuy, from Equatorial Guinea. The director general is Audrey Azoulay, from France. Neither is Chinese. As Ley pointed out, China is chair of the World Heritage Committee and will next month host a meeting that will consider the recommendation. Australia also has a seat on the 21-member committee. The Morrison government believes China may be behind the Unesco decision to recommend the reef be listed as “in danger” but the minister has pulled up short of saying so, leaving the accusations to the Australian and Katter. Both seem well briefed on what the government thinks. Here’s our latest story on the issue: Queensland minister says UN warning on Great Barrier Reef status shows Morrison must act. But what wasn’t answered there is very interesting – these are the issues Peter Dutton interjected on, to stop Barnaby Joyce from having to answer. Bob Katter’s question on China and Unesco (jumped up before Joyce had a chance to object himself). Criticism from Mia Davies, who leads the WA Nationals (again, Dutton jumped up, but the question was still ruled in order). His previous comments on the Biloela family (Joyce nodded at Dutton halfway through this question, and Dutton jumped up the moment it was completed). Whether any policy agreement had been made with Scott Morrison (again, Dutton jumped up to object immediately). Well. That was a nice return to 2014. Barnaby is back and so are the coal wars (they never went away – it is just open warfare now). It is over. While this motion comes to its end, Labor MP Amanda Rishworth has responded to an earlier post about the debate in the Coalition party room over childcare. “What century are we in, when we have members of the federal government shaming women for using childcare?” Rishworth told Guardian Australia. “It should not be left to female members of the government to teach their male colleagues why childcare is important for equality. “This is just completely archaic and shows how out of touch this government is with the reality of working families.” The suspension of standing orders is to discuss this motion: A, there is a global pandemic. B, the government had two jobs this year, to roll out the vaccine and establish a safe national system of quarantine. C, instead of effectively rolling out the vaccine, and establishing a safe national system of quarantine and, the incoming deputy prime minister has been focusing on his own job. D, instead of focusing on the needs of Australians, the Abbott-Truss, Turnbull-Truss, Turnbull-Joyce, Morrison-Joyce, Morrison-McCormack and now Morrison-Joyce (government) has been focused on itself. And, E, instead of building the jobs of the future, the incoming deputy prime minister has said investing in renewables is “insane and lemming like”, and said the Nationals have always been opposed to a net zero target. And ... therefore calls on members of the Morrison-Joyce government to focus on the needs of Australians and not their own jobs. (It will be defeated, because Labor does not have the numbers. These motions are only to get TV and social media grabs, because you can say all your talking points at a time in parliament that gets the most coverage. Which is also why so many answers from government ministers are outrageous – gotta get those clicks.) Goodness, Peter Dutton is getting a workout today. Anthony Albanese to Barnaby Joyce: “Will he negotiate a new agreement on policy with the prime minister and will that be made public?” Sgt Dutton: You have ruled on that as recently as yesterday. This is a backdoor way of talking about Coalition agreement, which is not the subject of the deputy prime minister’s portfolio responsibilities. It is not within order to go to the detail of that and the precedent is very clear in relation to these matters. Tony Burke gets up again: The question doesn’t go to an agreement between the parties, it goes to whether there is an agreement being sought between the deputy prime minister and the prime minister about policy. If that is put in the Coalition agreement then the leader of the house is the first to announce that. That is not what the question asks. Tony Smith rules the question out of order – not for Dutton’s point, but because it is not part of his ministerial responsibilities. He goes to move on, but Anthony Albanese moves to suspend standing orders. Anthony Albanese to Barnaby Joyce: “The National Farmers’ Federation has backed the net zero target for emissions by 2050. Are the regional Australians who want the job opportunities from (that) including the National Farmers’ Federation wrong?” Joyce (who is having the time of his life and repeatedly saying “laser-like focus”): I thank the member for Grayndler for his question, I note his reference to job opportunities. This side will always be the side of the House that is absolutely focused on job opportunities and making sure people maintain their jobs. The sort of place we will be focusing on ... to keep their jobs – is the member for Capricornia, coal miners in that seat. We will have a laser-like focus on the member for Flynn’s seat so that those miners keep their jobs. We will be laser-like focused on all the people in the seat of Paterson to make sure they keep their jobs and the member for Shortland, we will be laser-like focused to make sure the people in the seat keep their jobs. We will be laser-like in our focus to make sure they keep their jobs and you keep yours. We want to keep his job. We want him to remain the leader of the opposition, we want him to stay there for years and years and years. We want you to get long service leave as the leader of opposition, because on the side we care about jobs, and I know it’s hard for the member for Grayndler because you are tied to the aspirations of an inner-suburban electorate and Green preference and that is a tough sell. (Tony Smith tells him to be relevant) Joyce: I’m sorry. I take your instruction, Mr Speaker. Talking about regional jobs, as leader of the opposition brought up, yes, on our side we focus on regional jobs all the time ... Like the live cattle trade. We focused on regional jobs that would be lost when you brought in a carbon tax. What we note is when we focus on regional jobs – now there is within the opposition two groups, one group that’s kind of supposed to be in the Labor party but not really and wish they weren’t. (Smith pulls him up again) Joyce: We are doing a very good job on regional jobs. Looks like there has been some talks beforehand about how to protect Barnaby Joyce from questions – in the middle of this one from Anthony Albanese, Joyce turns to Peter Dutton and gives him a very firm nod. Albanese: I refer to his quote this month when he said ‘Tharnicaa and Kopika were born in Australia, maybe if their names were Jane and Sally, would think twice about sending them back to another country which they are not from’. In his capacity as minister for regional development, does he still support the government letting them and their family go back to Biloela in Queensland? Dutton gets up immediately, almost before Albanese has left the box. Dutton: The (question’s) aim is to hold ministers (to) account for their portfolio responsibilities. This is not within the ministerial responsibilities of the deputy prime minister, and that is very clear. As such, the question should be ruled out of order. Tony Burke argues it is relevant: Mr Speaker, to the point of order, there are many times in this house where ministers have answered questions where they do not have the decision making within their portfolio, but the outcome of the decision making is relevant to the areas they represent. It happens in agriculture all the time, it happens in regional Australia all the time, where if there is an impact on their stakeholders, they take questions. And there will be days of parliament where on the basis of what the minister has said or what the house has said, almost all of the government’s questions from the outside would be ruled out, if that were to be the standard. This question goes immediately to the impact on regional Australia, and whether the minister will be advocating in that way or not. I will put it in these terms, Mr Speaker. When a trade agreement is agreed, there is one minister responsible for the trade agreement, but we get 10 questions across the whole front bench because they have stakeholder interests ... Here, regional Australia has a stakeholder interest. In this family. And that is what is being asked. Tony Smith rules the question out of order: He is being asked about a statement he made ... when he was a backbencher not the deputy prime minister, and the this is made very clear, those questions are out of order. I know he is being to answer it, if the question is out of order, it’s out of order, as simple as that. So Joyce avoids having to answer the question – which is what the government wants. To prove that point, here is how Barnaby Joyce finishes that answer: We are the party that looks after regional Australia, we continue to look after regional Australia, and that is why regional Australia votes for us and you have left them so far behind that there is only a couple of seats left, one is up there [Joel Fitzgibbon], and he is only just with you, he is only just with you, and the rest have all gone! Barnaby Joyce isn’t addressing any of his answers to anyone other than the backbenchers. His whole shtick is about ‘power’ and coming out strong with attacks, so even though nothing changes in terms of policy or actual action, it seems a lot more energised. So none of this is about anything other than throwing some weight around. And he’ll keep doing it, because that’s what he does. Nothing of substance changes though, other than people get a lot rowdier with the things they were already saying. Labor’s Anne Aly to Barnaby Joyce: “My question is to the deputy prime minister, and I refer to yesterday’s comments by the WA Nationals leader, Mia Davies, who in 2018 called the deputy prime minister to resign. I quote, ‘I am disappointed the party felt they needed to change leaders. It shows they are focused on internal matters instead of the people of regional Australia’. In his capacity as minister for regional water development, is Davies correct? Peter Dutton interjects: I believe that question should be ruled out of order. The deputy prime minister does not have responsibility in relation to those comments that the honourable member has cited. I don’t know the accuracy of those comments, and I don’t think the deputy prime minister should be asked to respond to it. Tony Smith: I am going to rule the question out of order and give the opportunity to the member for Cowan to rephrase the question, and I tell you why. I have made it very clear in the past, and I know the member for Isaacs hasn’t forgotten this, that the substance of the question has to be in order. In other words, you cannot use the majority of what is asked, and that is deliberately out of order, and then simply bolt on the reference to the ministerial responsibility out of it and. In other words, there was very little question and a lot of comment about what was related to internal party matters, which is prohibited ... But I am happy to hear from the leader of the opposition of business on this. Anthony Albanese objects: The quote from Mia Davies is about, the quote is, I think it’s because they’re focused on internal matters instead of the people of regional Australia. There cannot be any quote more in order than to ask the minister for regional water development whether or not there focused on the interests of regional Australia or internal matters. Smith changes his mind and Joyce has to answer the question. He just talks about regional grants. And yet, if everything was going amazing for regional Australia, why did the Nationals have to change leaders again? How terrible it is that Barnaby Joyce finds it demeaning to address his past behaviour in parliament. It must be so difficult being back doing that, in exactly the position he wanted back, and got back. Thoughts and prayers. Catherine King to Barnaby Joyce: “This week the assistant minister for children and families, the member for Capricornia, said of the deputy prime minister – if he got the job again there would be women out there who would be unhappy with that. “Is the assistant minister correct or is the deputy prime minister’s return to the job good for the women of regional Australia?” Joyce: I respect the right of any person to make their concerns clear, and I make sure I stay in close correspondence with both my colleagues and my family. And by so doing, I endeavour to make sure as we all do, to try to make the better person of myself. I know that it is imperative that in the considerations I had over three years on the back bench, that like all of us, we have to see our way to a better self, and I am doing that, and I find that it’s a little bit demeaning though to go through to litigate this at the despatch box but I’m happy that is what you want to do. Josh Frydenberg shouts about some things. Julie Collins to Barnaby Joyce: “In his capacity for minister for regional development, what does the deputy prime minister to say to women in agriculture?” Joyce: I thank the member for her question, might I say, as a father of four daughters ... I have an incredible vested interest in making sure women in agriculture and every section of society have the best opportunity in the safest environment they could possibly live in. In agriculture, as we well know, so many businesses are a partnership, where that family unit is instrumental in the success of the operation. That was the family unit I grew up in with my mother and my father, and where mother, if she wasn’t running the finances of the farm, she was also at times the worker in the paddocks with Dad. In farming, it is really, truly a partnership between both the mother and father, and the unit, to try and make sure that business operation works. More so, I would say many other areas of work within the nation. Without a shadow of a doubt, I have the greatest respect for what is truly part of the reason the Australian agriculture has had success that it has had. Bob Katter asks a question that is a bit of a curve ball: The deputy prime minister, the Courier Mail front page said David Attenborough labelled the Great Barrier Reef magnificent, not endangered but magnificent. China holds the chairmanship of Unesco, currently meeting in China. Isn’t the proposed declaration by Unesco of the Barrier Reef as endangered a serious erosion of Australia’s sovereignty and another intrusion into the control room of our country? Peter Dutton is on his feet in less than two seconds to stop Barnaby Joyce from answering the question. He says it is one for the environment minister, Sussan Ley. Katter says as much as he loves the leader of the house, it’s a question on sovereignty not the environment. Tony Smith says Joyce can pass the question on to someone else, if he wishes. Which is true, but he didn’t ask to do that – he didn’t have a chance to do that. Dutton was on his feet doing it first. So it seems that the government doesn’t trust Joyce to speak on issues involving China. Take from that what you will. This entire question time is just an exercise in ego. I honestly cannot imagine why anyone would tune into this, if they didn’t have to. Anthony Albanese to Barnaby Joyce: “I refer to the deputy prime minister’s statement: ‘I don’t want the government anymore in my life. I am sick of the government being in my life!’ “Does the deputy prime minister agree, government has a role to play in securing regional Australia’s recovery from Covid, including a good and effective vaccine rollout and creation of national quarantine, and isn’t that just a wacky thing for the deputy prime minister to say?” Joyce, who is already back to shouting everything while eagerly looking back to his benches for encouragement, or I don’t know, a treat: I suppose I was reflecting on what would have happened if the member for Grayndler was in government. And I must say, at the time it was terrifying, it was terrifying. I was overcome with fear. Fear and trepidation. As to what might happen if the Labor party was to be the government. But later on, after I cooled down, I realised, we are the government, everything was fine. Going to the rollout, we have over 6.6 million people, I think, have now been part of the process of being vaccinated, and that’s a great outcome, one in four adults, one in four adults. And Australia has ... a sense of pride about what we have been able to do, what we have been able to do in other areas, where hundreds of thousands of people have died. Other nations, where millions of people have died. Australia has been so blessed, and we have also been so fortuitous, and we also have the best government in place! We have had the best government in place*. And it’s because ... of the diligence, because of the diligence. *If it was the best government, then why the need for the change? Joyce continues, but honestly, it’s just more shouty guff. Then Greg Hunt gets up and adds to it. Joyce then moves on to a dixer, which is just all about coal. Australia, this is your government. Scott Morrison once again warns of all the uncertain times Australia is living in. Tony Burke pops up to ask where the prime minister is, because the screen is blank. Then Scott Morrison turns up on the screen. But the sound is all the way up, so he is distorted. All in all it’s going exactly as well as you would think it is. It’s the Barnaby Joyce show today. Anthony Albanese says to the current deputy prime minister: “The deputy prime minister has mounted two leadership challenges: one on the very day on which this parliament honoured bushfire survivors, and one during a global pandemic. Why is the deputy prime minister only focused on his own job, and not on the real needs of Australians, including those in regional communities?” Joyce: I thank the honourable member for his question and first and foremost I would like to say a huge thank you to the work for the member of Riverina, who did a remarkable job. A man who is noted for the ... way he conducted his office, a person who will go on to serve and further represent our nation as a person, an incredible asset, and here I am. We know there is a sense of division on the other side, because I think I am looking at someone here who might be under a little bit of pressure himself. A little bit of pressure himself. A little bit of pressure himself. And while ... I was on the backbench, I got to know quite a few people from the Labor party, and it’s an interesting conversation to have about the current leader, the current leader, but I tell you what, I tell you what, the member for Grayndler. I am his biggest fan. I am this man’s biggest fan. I want you to be there for the long haul! Albanese interrupts with a point of order on relevance but is overruled. Joyce: Well, thank you, Mr Speaker, and why stop the fun? There is the preamble, there is the outcome. There is the outcome over there ... we know where we’re off to, we know where we’re off to. But I tell you what, when you need the numbers to stay there, come and call me. Because I am you’re biggest supporter. We need you there. We are, we are a big supporter of you, because you are going so very, very well. You are going so very, very well. Every time the member – every time we are struggling with an argument, out in the regions, in Wagga and Beaudesert and Tamworth, if it’s getting a bit uncomfortable for us, we just say the alternative, the alternative, is Mr Albanese, the member for Grayndler, and then the argument is all over. Like, I just – it’s remarkable, it’s remarkable. You have been here, you were also the deputy prime minister, weren’t you, I think, for 83 days? I hope you enjoyed that experience, because it is as high as you’re ever going to get. Barnaby Joyce is giving the revised ministry list, which includes him as deputy prime minister. Question time is about to begin and Barnaby Joyce is already in the prime minister’s chair. He’s waited three years and three months for this moment. He’s not going to miss it. The Senate, following a motion by Labor senator Katy Gallagher, has ordered Richard Colbeck to table a document outlining the nation’s Covid-19 vaccine supply. That was after Colbeck told the Senate during question time that he would table it in the Monday night Covid committee hearing (and didn’t). So now he has to produce it to the Senate by 7.20pm tonight. That leaves plenty of time for it to suddenly become “cabinet in confidence”. We’ll let you know how that one ends. Question time is in about 15 minutes – and Barnaby Joyce will be in the prime minister’s chair, while Scott Morrison beams in from a screen. In Labor caucus, Anthony Albanese noted the return of Barnaby Joyce by claiming he had “failed” in all his ministries in the last term of government. Albanese said the government is focused on itself not its two principal jobs (hotel quarantine and vaccines). Labor has set up a protecting pensions taskforce – an inquiry to be run by MP Justine Elliot, Peta Murphy and Anthony Chisholm into concerns that the cashless debit card could be expanded to pensioners. The government has never said they would do this but two weeks ago Elliot refused to delete a social media post claiming they might, prompting an argument with the prime minister’s office. The shadow health minister, Mark Butler, also warned about how recent Medicare changes will increase patient costs, particularly for surgery, and how this fits in with a “pattern” of government neglect of Medicare. In terms of legislation, Labor will move to amend a government social security bill to remove an eight-day waiting period for people applying for payments online. Labor will support the telecommunications international production orders bill, which makes it easier to share material gathered in Australia with law enforcement in allied countries like the US. The parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security asked for amendments including ruling out international cooperation for death penalty cases, which Labor believes the government has honoured. How lovely that when the men started speaking nonsense about childcare changes in the Coalition party room meeting, it was the women who had to remind them about equality. Doesn’t seem like any of their male colleagues spoke up in defence. Which is always so much of the problem – women are expected to not only carry their load, but also carry the load men place upon them. A fiery debate took place in the Coalition party room over the government’s proposed childcare changes, with Queensland senators Matt Canavan, Gerard Rennick and MP George Christensen talking about the need to support women who chose to stay at home with their children. Female Liberal MPs, including the minister Jane Hume, Katie Allen, Celia Hammond, Hollie Hughes and Perin Davey, spoke in favour of the changes, saying it was about providing “equality of opportunity”. One of the male MPs suggested that women might be “forced” back to work by the changes, prompting a rebuke from one of the women MPs that it was about “equality of opportunity” and removing barriers. Another MP suggested that women using childcare were “outsourcing parenting” prompting Victorian MP Katie Allen to remind MPs to be cognisant of the language used and to not use language that might be offensive to working women. Hume told MPs that there were about 100,000 women who could not afford to work because of the cost of childcare. One of the male MPs spoke about the need for the government to consider providing financial support to families on farms who accessed help from live-in nannies rather than through the family daycare system. Those job figures are interesting because they show some of the actual week-to-week changes in employment. I only just learned this, but the monthly unemployment data (the one where we get the unemployment rate) doesn’t include non-resident workers who have worked in Australia for less than 12 months. The quarterly data is everyone who has contributed to economic activity, but the monthly data essentially excludes a large chunk of people who are on foreign working visas. Which means that the official job numbers don’t include all the non-permanent resident workers who left Australia during the pandemic. As a blog watcher also just pointed out to me, the payroll figures started to dip when jobkeeper ended. Employment may be up in the monthly figures, but in the two weeks to 5 June, the ABS reports payroll jobs were down. Between the weeks ending 22 May and 5 June 2021: Payroll jobs decreased by 0.9%, compared with an increase of 0.4% in the previous fortnight. Total wages paid decreased by 1.6%, compared with an increase of 0.4% in the previous fortnight. And in the state breakdowns that meant: Payroll jobs: Victoria decreased by 2.1% Tasmania decreased by 1.1% Australian Capital Territory decreased by 1.1% Total wages: Victoria decreased by 2.8% Tasmania decreased by 2.0% The resources minister, Keith Pitt, just held a quick door stop to talk about the radioactive waste management bill (the government had to amend the bill to not name a specific site, because if the community doesn’t want a nuclear waste dump, they can’t be legally bound by it. It’s been one of the hold-ups with the bill and last night, the government folded on it.) Pitt was talking about the “win” with a special guest appearance from Matt Canavan, whose job he took in the cabinet, and who could have a cabinet spot back if he decided he wanted back in now that Barnaby Joyce is back. So not awkward at all. Scott Morrison also said there was a “healing process that needed to occur” in the government and said MPs would “focus on the Australian community and not us”. He also warned there was “no time for individual agendas or pet projects”, saying the focus was on winning the next election “because that’s what Australians need us to do”. Barnaby Joyce has told MPs that he will be a “servant to the party and the nation” while saying the government needs to rally around a “unifying cause” that assures Australians of their freedoms. Talking about a geopolitical shift from “Pax Americana” to China – which he referred to as a “new superpower that is different” – Joyce said voters wanted the government to respond to their concerns about the change. “It’s more important to this nation than anything else,” Joyce said. “The times that we live in today are different to those we were born into, and certainly to what our parents were born into. “But our liberties and freedoms that we took as a birthright ... might be challenged like they never had before. “We need to ensure that we give our children and grandchildren the strength and the liberties and the capacity to say what they like and the capacity to be who they want to be. And the Australian people have to make a decision about who can deliver that. Is that the Labor party or the Liberal-National Coalition? “If we deliver on these questions to the Australian people, there’s only one clear choice.” Joyce’s return to the deputy prime minister’s role was also acknowledged by the prime minister, Scott Morrison, who urged the Coalition remain “strong and united”. He said the Coalition would win the next election by being “stable and united”, by showing that “we get stuff done” and by having a “clear plan for the future”. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, also spoke at length about the common purpose of the Liberal and National parties. And there was a debate on childcare – we’ll bring you more on that soon. Who would have thunk it? Dominic Perrottet is one of our big-spending treasurers. The New South Wales budget papers reveal he’s increased expenditure by 8.7% in 2020-21 and 7.9% in 2021-22. “It’s a budget with heart,” he explains, when asked about his conversion from economic dry to big spender. And he’s “investing in the future”, he says. The state budget reveals the continuation of many programs designed to stimulate spending during Covid-19 and an increase in wages for the NSW public service. The NSW government had copped flak for announcing it would cap pay rises for state employees at 1.5% during the pandemic, with Labor pointing out that many of these people – nurses, police and ambos – were on the frontline of the Covid response. Now Perrottet, awash with funds from the property boom, is returning to the 2.5% wage cap at an additional cost of $2.7bn to the state wages bill. There are also $100 vouchers for families to teach kids to swim and $100 for people to go out in the Sydney CBD, which remains graveyard-like after we all discovered working from home was better than the office. Thank God it’s Friday – yep, that’s what the program is called. Everything is totally fine: New South Wales will achieve a quicker-than-expected turnaround from the Covid-19 downturn, with the state expected to be back in the black by 2024-25 with a $466m surplus. In the meantime, this year’s 2020-21 deficit has halved to $7.9bn thanks to surging property prices, which have delivered a stamp duty bonanza. But NSW is counting on being able to continue with its “open for business” strategy despite the recent Bondi cluster of Covid cases. It’s also counting on international borders being open by mid 2022. The treasurer, Dominic Perrottet, says it costs NSW $300m a week not to have international travel. There were very liberal doses of Howard and Menzies quotes about party unification and the strength of the Coalition in the joint party room meeting this morning. (That’s the party room equivalent of posting happy family social media photos when you’re absolutely miserable.) But everyone is totally cool with Barnaby Joyce’s return to the leadership. No one is worried at all. It’s all totally fine. Mike Bowers tells me Darren Chester walked into the House and exclaimed, “Here I am with all my supporters” to the empty benches. So things seem like they are great in the National party room right now. (Chester expects to move back to the backbench now that Barnaby Joyce is in charge again – the two are not exactly friendly and never really have been.) One big happy family: Oh – and David Littleproud says he wasn’t unhappy yesterday, he was just cold. The bells are ringing for the start of parliament. Huzzah! Is a lockdown on the cards for Sydney? Gladys Berejiklian: At this stage we follow Dr Chant and the health advice. At this stage because all but one case is linked to an existing case and that case was only discovered a few hours ago, that gives us a degree of confidence that what we have asked people to do matches the risk that is there at the moment. If that changes, if we suddenly have a number of unlinked cases and if we suddenly have them outside the geographic region they are concentrated in that will obviously adjust the health advice and we will respond to that. At this stage, given Dr Chant did advise us already that she foresaw that household contacts would get the virus, and I think this demonstrates how important it is to isolate when you are asked to isolate. You might have a negative test and no symptoms but subsequently during that 40-day period you start feeling unwell and get tested, we know a family member who was negative on day one might on day five or day 14 become positive and that is why it is really important for everyone to listen to the health advice and please also again refer to Dr Chant’s updated advice in relation to Westfield Bondi. Clearly there had been a number of transmissions in and around that shopping complex and Dr Chant and Health have updated the dates at which you need to get tested and isolate if you had not already followed that instruction. The NSW chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant, confirms it is just two cases authorities are worried about at this point: The two cases that demonstrate risk to the community are a young lady in her 20s who, we believe, acquired infection at the Junction. She is a worker at Bondi Junction and we believe she was exposed again, probably through fleeting contact with one of the infectious people as they moved around Bondi Junction. For this reason, we are calling out for anyone who has been at Bondi Junction, including the car parks, any time between 12 June and 18 June, to get a test. If you’ve been to one of the close contact venues, you should have been contacted about being in isolation for the 14 days or [for] the casual contact venue check the specific advice, but if you don’t have symptoms and are just going forth because we are asking you to attend, you don’t need to self-isolate. What we are asking you to [do is] minimise your contact with others until you have a negative test. This is because we are casting the net very wide because you want to pick up any of these inadvertent transmission. You can see how if we miss a case, over the next cycle of three days [to] a week, we have many cases coming from that single missed case. We want everybody to come forward and get tested. The other case that is under investigation and literally this test result came in a few hours ago, we want to thank and acknowledge the cooperation of the St Charles primary school for their cooperation but I reiterate what the premier has said. The school is working with health officials to develop a plan for the children to be discharged home to their parents and we want to provide advice and a mechanism to get testing because we want to find out how this child was exposed and establish that because cases where we don’t understand the acquisition means we have missed the case, missed cases, and in this case, we don’t have preliminary information, a source for this child’s exposure, so we are looking for an intermediate source. In light of the additional cases (only two of which are not linked to direct cases as yet) the mask restrictions are continuing. Gladys Berejiklian: As a result of what has occurred, the New South Wales government will be extending the existing mask wearing provisions for an additional week. Previously, Wednesday midnight or Thursday morning at 12.01am, the existing ask in relation to masks was to expire. It will now continue as mandatory for another week. We will extend it to all of greater Sydney, excluding the Central Coast and excluding the Hunter. [Under the compulsory mask rule] people will be required to wear masks indoors for hospitality workers, when we are going shopping, going grocery shopping, going to events inside. It is only when you are eating or drinking indoors at a venue that you can’t or shouldn’t wear a mask. In every other circumstance, if you live or are in Sydney, you must wear a mask for another week beyond Wednesday midnight. You can find a little more information on the new Sydney cases here (from NSW Health): There are now 21 cases linked to the Bondi cluster. Of the five locally reported cases to 8pm last night: Two were announced yesterday: A woman in her 50s from Sydney’s northern suburbs. She is a close contact of a previously reported case and has been in isolation. A man in his 30s from Sydney’s eastern suburbs. He is a close contact of a previously reported case and has been in isolation. Three further cases were reported to 8pm last night: A woman in her 60s from the Illawarra. She is a close contact of a previously reported case and has been in isolation. A woman in her 40s from Sydney’s northern suburbs. She is a close contact of a previously reported case and has been in isolation. A woman in her 20s from the eastern suburbs. She is linked to the Bondi cluster. Further investigations are under way. NSW Health can also advise there have been seven locally acquired cases notified overnight since 8pm. Six of these are household contacts of previous cases who have been in isolation. One case is a child who attends primary school in the eastern suburbs. These seven cases will be included in Wednesday’s numbers. NSW Health is asking anyone who was in Westfield Bondi Junction (including the car park) at any time between 12 June and 18 June to get tested for Covid-19. Only people with symptoms and those who have been to specific exposure venues at the listed times need to test and isolate. Anyone who does not have symptoms and has not been to specific exposure venues at the listed times should get tested but does not need to isolate. However, these people are strongly urged to avoid gatherings and minimise their movements, such as not attending the cinemas or trips to the ski fields until they return a negative test. If you can work from home, please do so. Going through the additional NSW Health data, all but two of those cases were already in isolation. That makes 21 in the Bondi cluster now. We’ll be hearing from Gladys Berejiklian very soon. In total there are 12 cases being reported today, two of which we knew about yesterday – there are another three in today’s numbers and another seven that were recorded after the evening cutoff, which will be in tomorrow’s numbers. There was one new community-acquired case in Queensland, but the chief health officer, Dr Jeannette Young is not worried: This is a gentleman in his 60s who attended that restaurant at Ellen Grove at the same time as that person from Portugal attended. He went into home quarantine the next day when he was contacted, so we are just confirming with him whether or not he went out and about on that Sunday morning. All of the 36 people who attended the restaurant during the timeframe when the lady from Portugal did are in home quarantine, so we will continue to assess them and test them going forward for the 14 days. I think that is good news, and that is all in hand. Queensland is opening its borders to Victoria from Friday (1am) – also just in time for the school holidays. Gladys Berejiklian will be holding her press conference at 11.30. She is likely to announce the social distancing measures that are in place will be extended. Lilley Labor MP Anika Wells was sent out with something to say this morning: Barnaby Joyce may be the only dinosaur to ever come back from extinction. Literally no one in my electorate has been calling on us, here in the Australian parliament, to bring back the bonk, but here we are. In a national reckoning about the appalling treatment of women in workplaces, we now have this. Apparently, the idea that there are no permanent consequences for anyone about this culture, except the women themselves. Since I was elected to this place two years ago, I have been constantly, incredulously asking: “What does it take to get sacked by Scott Morrison?” But this week, I now have to ask: “What standards of behaviour is Scott Morrison prepared to accept from the second-highest office in the land?” It’s like the Coalition has brought back their unhinged, creepy uncle to Christmas lunch, and told him to preside over carving the turkey, but the consequences are far more serious than that. This is a person who, in the Senate when debating the water efficiency labelling and standards amendment, said to Senator McKenzie, who was presiding at the time: “Madame Acting Deputy President McKenzie, you are looking wonderful tonight. You are a flash bit of kit in this chamber, there is no doubt about you.” And Senator McKenzie, objecting justifiably, says, “I mean, I’m sure there’s a standing order somewhere senator, but …”, and he said, “It is non-contro. Roll with me on this.” I mean, in her workplace! She is just trying to do her work, in her workplace! The Australian Senate! And Barnaby Joyce, our new deputy prime minister, thinks that is acceptable conduct. Australian women watching us here in this place, now feel that is what Scott Morrison considers acceptable conduct. I was in my electorate on the weekend in Stafford, and a woman was asking me: “As a woman, how do you go in this place? How does it feel when the prime minister turns his back on you whenever you stand up, or when Peter Dutton shuts you down three seconds after you start talking?” And I said: “What would you say if you had three seconds before the leader of the House shut you down, to give your message this government, what would you say?” And she said: “How do you people live with yourselves?” There was a lot going on yesterday, so you may have missed it – but the head of the vaccine rollout, Gen John Frewen, confirmed that there was no vaccine campaign because the government was worried about supply. Instead, the government is in the “rallying phase”. But there won’t be a campaign, until the government knows it can match demand with supply. Just something to keep in mind, given the government’s reluctance to admit there is an issue with that at the moment. The party room meetings are wrapping up – we’ll bring you what happened there very soon. It was the first joint party room meeting where Barnaby Joyce took lead as the Nationals leader. He’s having a function tonight to celebrate his swearing-in as deputy prime minister. Yesterday, NSW Health announced it had two new cases of Covid come in after 8pm – those cases will be included in today’s data. We’re still waiting on the official word, but you’ll find exposure sites here: South Australia has announced it will open its borders to residents from greater Melbourne – just in time for the school holidays. Libby Coker’s staff are across it: The latest Guardian Essential poll shows Australian voters are concerned the nation is being left behind on climate. As Murph reports: A majority of voters fear Australia will be left behind unless the Morrison government follows the lead of other countries in prioritising serious action to combat global heating, according to the latest Guardian Essential poll. The findings from the fortnightly survey of 1,087 respondents come as Barnaby Joyce deposed Michael McCormack and returned to lead the National party after a week where senior Nationals expressed open hostility about the government adopting a net zero emissions target by 2050. Scott Morrison says achieving net zero as soon as possible is Australia’s preference. Joyce was asked on Monday whether or not he would make fresh climate policy demands when he renegotiated the Coalition agreement with Morrison. The returning National party leader and deputy prime minister deflected. “I’ll be talking with my party room, about what they believe is best for them, and then fighting on that premise,” he said. I’m sure they all feel just great with the news Barnaby Joyce is back. That’ll make it allllllll better. Meanwhile, while the government is crowing about Australia’s strong economy, Grogs has taken a look at inequality. Spoiler – it’s growing New data from the bureau of statistics shows the drop in spending by households due to the pandemic increased the level of savings, but while incomes rose strongly for low-income households due to a big rise in social assistance, inequality remains worse than it was at the start of the century. Then there is this: Chris Bowen was asked about the argument that climate change is a global issue and Australia can’t be responsible for the rest of the world when he was on ABC radio this morning. (That was one of the points the reef envoy and local member Warren Entsch just made in that press conference as well.) Here is how Bowen answered it earlier today: That’s the tired, old trope we get from people who don’t believe in strong action on climate change from Australia – the world’s largest emitter per capita – that somehow every other country has an obligation here, but not us. But it’s not just about obligation. It’s also about the fact that the world’s climate emergency is Australia’s jobs opportunity. And under eight years of Liberal-National party government, we have not been embracing that opportunity and that is about to get a lot worse with the change that was made yesterday. Oh good, Bob Katter is now getting involved on the reef issue and in his media release announcing his press conference, makes a point of referencing the committee chair’s nationality. The government’s main argument against the Unesco draft decision to list the Great Barrier Reef as “in danger” seems to be: “we know climate change is the biggest threat to the reef, but we don’t believe that what Australia is doing (or not doing) on climate should count towards whether we are doing enough to protect the reef”. Sussan Ley: Now I know, and I know [the Liberal MP for Leichhardt] Warren [Entsch] knows, that climate change is the biggest threat to the reef and in no way am I stepping away from that recognition, and countries including European countries have got strong views about what policies different countries should have on climate change, and I understand that as well but this is not the convention in which to have those conversations. The correct place to have those conversations is the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. So on the one hand we have actually got a draft decision that commends Australia for its sound and serious investment in the reef, but on the other hand points to the Paris targets and climate change and almost suggests that the world needs to do more. We know that we are punching above our weight when it comes to those targets an our commitment and Angus Taylor as energy minister has set that out very clearly. We are not “punching above our weight” on those targets, and we do not have a climate plan. There have been no locally acquired cases in Victoria again overnight. Hopefully that means it is looking good for the easing of restrictions: John Howard, an 81-year-old white man, who joined the Liberal party in the 1950s and worked as a politician for the majority of his life, having been elected to one of Sydney’s wealthiest electorates in 1974, doesn’t believe there is racism in Australia. This shouldn’t be news: Howard’s views that Australia was not a racist country shaped much of the nation’s social policy under his prime ministership, going so far as to reject the Eureka research anti-racism study his government commissioned in the late 1990s, because it found there was in fact, racism in Australia. This didn’t “align” with Howard’s views Australia wasn’t racist, so the report was suppressed until 2011. (Instead the government set up “Harmony Day”, which is essentially a day borne from the government’s desire to *not* confront racism.) Then there were the 2005 Cronulla race riots, which targeted the Middle Eastern community, in particular the Lebanese community, and had been spurred on by radio shock jocks such as Alan Jones, whose comments were found to have “likely to encourage violence or brutality and to vilify people of Lebanese and Middle Eastern backgrounds on the basis of ethnicity”. Howard didn’t accept that was racist either and said at the time: I do not accept that there is underlying racism in this country. Overnight, Howard was a guest on the ABC special report Australia Talks – which went through the survey results of the ABC’s Australia Talks survey. Howard was there because he was voted Australia’s favourite prime minister (seriously). Co-host Nazeem Hussain (who had been listed on the TV guide as Waleed Aly, again, because – Australia) questioned Howard on his views on racism, given that 76% of respondents to the survey said they believed Australia had an issue with racism. Howard, though, still disagrees. That has not been my experience. I have to say, respectfully, to that 76%, say I don’t think there is underlying racism in Australia. Asked directly if he believed there was racism in Australia, Howard said, “No, I don’t.” And he still doesn’t believe the Cronulla riots had anything to do with race: My view about the Cronulla riots is that it was not an example of underlying racism. ... I think that is a supremely pessimistic view of the Australian community and I’ve seen so many examples of where people of different races have worked together in a seamless fashion for the common good. I think that’s a hugely pessimistic view of the Australian community. Which goes a long way to explaining why he is, apparently, Australia’s favourite prime minister. Because if a white, powerful man doesn’t see racism as an issue, because that hasn’t been his personal experience, then obviously there is no issue, right? May we present Australia’s government. (Thank Mike Bowers for this moment.) But if the Morrison government had given any indication it was serious about climate, by ... I don’t know, agreeing to net zero by 2050 (net zero also doesn’t mean zero emissions by the way), would Sussan Ley have to be having this conversation this morning? Does the environment minister agree that the world environment heritage committee probably was looking for something serious on climate from Australia? Ley: No, I don’t. The process has been flawed and I’m seeking to have that corrected, as is the foreign minister in our conversation. However, we expect, because we’ve seen the draft decision published overnight, that it will go forward to the committee meeting in July, and I will certainly be speaking to all of the members of the World Heritage Committee. So, the point is that this contravenes all previous approaches. Now, if Unesco wants to break faith with us and its own processes, that is very much a matter for them, but it is very much a matter for me to stand up for the people of the reef, for the farmers that have worked so hard to deliver the best quality catchments along the reef, and for the fact that it is a marine park managed, as I said, to the highest possibly standard. We are restoring ecosystems, working with traditional owners, we have world-leading science on coral restoration and I just want to make this point: the World Heritage Committee didn’t use the latest data, they did a desktop review. On all levels, I’m sorry, I’m giving them a big fail and I’m fighting for the reef. Sussan Ley says climate change should be seperate to conversations about environmental heritage sites like the Great Barrier Reef. She told the ABC: Absolutely not. This decision, as I said in the framework on the Unesco convention on world heritage properties, is about how an individual country manages its properties. Conversations about climate change – and I know the Europeans don’t agree with us in many instances – are correctly had in another forum. There are 20-something reefs on the world heritage property list, and this sends a very poor signal to all of those other reefs, none of whom can approach our level of management and investment, but to look to us for leadership ... so for us to be singled out is quite unreasonable. And here was Anthony Albanese on Sydney radio 2SM on Barnaby Joyce’s return: Well, everyone knows that this has always only been about Barnaby. It hasn’t been about the people of Australia. This is an act of self-indulgence at a time when we’re still dealing with the pandemic. Of course, the last time that Barnaby Joyce tried to seize the leadership of the National party was at the height of the bushfires. This is someone who is self-obsessed, who never has the national interest at the heart of what his actions are. And I think that showed yesterday. Yup. Labor, at least, seems thrilled that Barnaby Joyce is back in the deputy PM’s job, because it gives the party something tangible to fight. Here was Anthony Albanese on ABC TV this morning: Barnaby Joyce is a failed former deputy prime minister. He failed last time he had the job. We know how this movie ends because we’ve seen it. ... This is Barnaby Joyce The Sequel. We will continue to put forward our strong arguments for regional development. The fact is, if you talk about central Queensland, I’ve visited the Rio Tinto aluminium refinery there at Gladstone, one of the biggest employers in Gladstone, a critical facility. What Rio Tinto is looking at is powering that facility with solar energy. They are looking at lowering their prices, their costs of production by embracing renewables. That’s what’s happening on the ground. I was in Townsville last week. The premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, announced a major renewable energy precinct and supporting industries there. I’ve met with companies there that want to manufacture solar panels and manufacture renewable energy there that will create jobs, but the big opportunity there is how do we lower our energy prices in order to boost manufacturing in the regions? We lower our energy prices by embracing the lowest cost of energy. Sussan Ley will hold a press conference at 9am. The government is very, very worried about the Unesco draft decision to list the Great Barrier Reef as “in danger”. Well that was quick. It was almost like Anthony Albanese’s social team had this planned: It’s happened and is now official – Barnaby Joyce is Australia’s deputy prime minister. Sussan Ley, though, is very shocked: Chris Bowen, Labor’s environment spokesman, has spoken to ABC’s Radio National about the Unesco decision and says it really shouldn’t come as a shock: [The government] shouldn’t be surprised about the fact that the reef has encountered three bleaching events in the last five years and their complete response has been to gift almost half a billion dollars to an unaccountable charity. Graham Readfearn has looked at the Unesco decision: The Great Barrier Reef should be placed on to a list of world heritage sites “in danger”, according to a recommendation from United Nations officials that urges Australia to take “accelerated action at all possible levels” on climate change. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (Unesco) says the world’s biggest coral reef system should be placed on the list at the World Heritage Committee meeting next month. The recommendation has sparked a flurry of activity from the Australian government, with the environment minister, Sussan Ley, saying she had already joined the foreign minister, Marise Payne, in a call to Unesco’s director general, Audrey Azoulay. Happy Tuesday. In just a few short hours, Barnaby Joyce will once again be your deputy prime minister. And he’s already renegotiating the Coalition agreement, which sets out what the Liberals and Nationals want from each other and can dictate decisions from ministries to government policy, but you won’t ever be allowed to see it. Good times! And given Joyce has spent the past three years on the backbench agitating for more coal, and his party just decided to vote him leader, you know what just got a lot more harder? Doing anything on climate! Just wonderful. Coincidentally Joyce officially becomes deputy prime minister on the day Unesco has ruled the Great Barrier Reef should be listed as “in danger” in a draft decision. Why? Because of the climate, mostly (and also farming run off). Sussan Ley, the environment minister, says the government was “blindsided” by the decision. (Which seems strange because I remember covering the warnings when I was still a reporter in Queensland and that was more than five years ago.) Queensland is also where the Nationals want to build a new coal-fired power station, so you can see where this is all going. The Great Barrier Reef is not only an environmental wonder that is critical for ocean health, it also supports a multi-billion-dollar industry and jobs for an entire region. So it being officially listed as “in danger” is an issue. We’ll bring you all of the fallout, as well as everything else happening today. Last night, NSW Health released new exposure sites – so the Sydney cluster is not over as yet. We’ll bring you those updates as well.

Opposition parties have been sceptical of the achievement, calling it a political ruse ahead of important state and national elections. Indian media have also highlighted cases of villages supposedly electrified but where power appears to be non-existent, intermittent or available only to a few. The Indian government considers a village to be electrified if basic infrastructure such as schools are connected to the grid as well as at least 10% of households. About 270 million Indians, more than one-sixth of the population, are estimated to live without electricity, according to a World Bank report last year. The prime minister, Narendra Modi, tweeted at the weekend that Saturday would be “remembered as a historic day in the development journey of India”. “We fulfilled a commitment due to which the lives of several Indians will be transformed forever”, he said, announcing every village in the country was “powered and empowered”. Efforts to provide electricity to every Indian have historically been hampered by poorly designed and implemented schemes that encouraged contractors to do the bare minimum to make sure a village qualified as electrified. However, Surjit Singh Ningthoujam, who runs computer literacy programmes in the remote district of Manipur, where the last village to receive electricity is located, said progress in the area in the past three years had been impressive. “When electricity comes, people usually buy a TV and that totally changes their lives,” he said. “It is also a hilly area, so with lights they can go from house to house at night-time.” Still, he said, the supply in many villages remained unreliable and he often had to run his computer training courses using solar energy, which has reached some villages before government power lines. In Rajghat, a village in Rajasthan, solar panels are all that power the few lights in the community. Dilip Kumar, a resident, greeted Modi’s announcement bitterly. “I have shifted my brother and children from this village so they can study,” the farmer, 26, said. The government had refused for years to connect the village to the grid because it is legally considered to be on forest land, he said. “And now we have to use mustard oil to light our lamps, since the government banned kerosene because it is too polluting. But mustard oil is too expensive.” A spokesman for the opposition Congress party, Randeep Singh Surjewala, tweeted that the previous government led by his party had electrified 97% of the country’s nearly 700,000 villages but “did not boast”. He said Modi had only needed to connect 18,452 villages to declare full electrification. Modi promised in his independence day speech in 2015 that every Indian village would be electrified within 1,000 days. Saturday, when Leisang was connected to the grid, was 988 days since that promise. The government has said all of India’s 180m rural Indian households will have electricity by 2019. About 82% have electricity as of Monday, according to its real-time progress tracker."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/oct/31/electric-food-sci-fi-diet-planet-food-animals-environment","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-10-31T06:00:12Z","webTitle":"Electric food – the new sci-fi diet that could save our planet | George Monbiot","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/oct/31/electric-food-sci-fi-diet-planet-food-animals-environment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/oct/31/electric-food-sci-fi-diet-planet-food-animals-environment","fields":{"headline":"Electric food – the new sci-fi diet that could save our planet","bodyText":"It’s not about “them”, it’s about us. The horrific rate of biological annihilation reported this week – 60% of the Earth’s vertebrate wildlife gone since 1970 – is driven primarily by the food industry. Farming and fishing are the major causes of the collapse of both marine and terrestrial ecosystems. Meat – consumed in greater quantities by the rich than by the poor – is the strongest cause of all. We may shake our heads in horror at the clearance of forests, the drainage of wetlands, the slaughter of predators and the massacre of sharks and turtles by fishing fleets, but it is done at our behest. As the Guardian’s recent report from Argentina reveals, the huge forests of the Gran Chaco are heading towards extermination as they are replaced by deserts of soya beans, almost all of which are used to produce animal feed, particularly for Europe. With Jair Bolsonaro in power in Brazil, deforestation in the Amazon is likely to accelerate, much of it driven by the beef lobby that helped bring him to power. The great forests of Indonesia, such as those in West Papua, are being felled and burned for oil palm at devastating speed. The most important environmental action we can take is to reduce the area of land and sea used by farming and fishing. This means, above all, switching to a plant-based diet: research published in the journal Science shows that cutting out animal products would reduce the global requirement for farmland by 76%. It would also give us a fair chance of feeding the world. Grass-fed meat, contrary to popular belief, is no alternative: it is an astonishingly wasteful use of vast tracts of land that would otherwise support wildlife and wild ecosystems. The same action is essential to prevent climate breakdown. Because governments, bowing to the demands of capital, have left it so late, it is almost impossible to see how we can stop more than 1.5C of global warming without drawing carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. The only way of doing it that has been demonstrated at scale is to allow trees to return to deforested land. But could we go beyond even a plant-based diet? Could we go beyond agriculture itself? What if, instead of producing food from soil, we were to produce it from air? What if, instead of basing our nutrition on photosynthesis, we were to use electricity to fuel a process whose conversion of sunlight into food is 10 times more efficient? This sounds like science fiction, but it is already approaching commercialisation. For the past year, a group of Finnish researchers has been producing food without either animals or plants. Their only ingredients are hydrogen-oxidising bacteria, electricity from solar panels, a small amount of water, carbon dioxide drawn from the air, nitrogen and trace quantities of minerals such as calcium, sodium, potassium and zinc. The food they have produced is 50% to 60% protein; the rest is carbohydrate and fat. They have started a company (Solar Foods) that seeks to open its first factory in 2021. This week it was selected as an incubation project by the European Space Agency. They use electricity from solar panels to electrolyse water, producing hydrogen, which feeds bacteria that turn it back into water. Unlike other forms of microbial protein (such as Quorn), it requires no carbohydrate feedstock – in other words, no plants. Perhaps you are horrified by this prospect. Certainly, there’s nothing beautiful about it. It would be hard to write a pastoral poem about bacteria grazing on hydrogen. But this is part of the problem. We have allowed a mythical aesthetic to blind us to the ugly realities of industrial agriculture. Instilled with an image of farming that begins in infancy – about half the books for very small children involve a rosy-cheeked farmer with one cow, one horse, one pig and one chicken, living in bucolic harmony – we fail to see the amazing cruelty of large-scale animal farming. The blood and gore, filth and pollution. We fail to apprehend the mass clearance of land required to feed us. The Insectageddon caused by pesticides; the drying up of rivers; the loss of soil; the reduction of the magnificent diversity of life on Earth to a homogeneous grey waste. The compound the Finnish researchers have produced from air, water and electricity is most likely to be used as a bulk ingredient in processed food. But (though this goes well beyond the company’s current plans) is there any reason why, with modifications of the process, it could not start to deliver the proteins required to make cultured meat, or the oils that could render palm plantations redundant? Is there any reason why it should not eventually replace much of what we eat? According to the researchers’ estimates, 20,000 times less land is required for their factories than is needed to produce the same amount of food by growing soya. Cultivating all the protein the world now eats with their technique would require an area smaller than Ohio. The best places to do it are deserts, where solar energy is most abundant. When electricity can be generated at €15 (£13) a megawatt hour (a few years hence), their process becomes cost-competitive with the cheapest source of soya. Could a similar technique also be used to produce cellulose and lignin, eventually replacing the need for commercial forestry? Is there any inherent reason why the hydrogen pathway could not create as many products as photosynthesis does today? Could it help to change our entire relationship with the natural world, reducing our footprint to a fraction of its current size? There are plenty of questions to be answered, plenty of possible hurdles and constraints. But think of the possibilities. Agricultural commodities, currently using almost all the Earth’s fertile land area, could be shrunk into a few small pockets of infertile land. The potential for ecological restoration is astonishing. The potential for feeding the world, a question that has literally been keeping me awake at night, is just as electrifying. None of this means we can afford to relax and wait for an infant technology to save us. In the meantime, as urgent intermediate steps, we should switch to a plant-based diet and mobilise against the destruction of the living planet. You could start by joining the Extinction Rebellion movement, which launches today. But if this works, it could help – alongside political mobilisation – to change almost everything. Places that have become agricultural deserts, trashed by giant corporations, could be reforested, drawing carbon dioxide from the air on a vast scale. The ecosystems of land and sea could recover, not just in pockets but across great tracts of the planet. A new age of global hunger becomes less likely. Crude and destructive technologies got us into this mess; refined technologies can help get us out of it. The struggle to save every possible species and ecosystem from the current wave of destruction is worthwhile. One day, perhaps within our lifetimes, they could repopulate a thriving world. • George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/2017/mar/27/solar-power-florida-new-york-renewable-energy-policies","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-27T07:00:00Z","webTitle":"Sunshine state shuns solar as overcast New York basks in clean energy boom","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/27/solar-power-florida-new-york-renewable-energy-policies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/mar/27/solar-power-florida-new-york-renewable-energy-policies","fields":{"headline":"Sunshine state shuns solar as overcast New York basks in clean energy boom","bodyText":"If you were to fly a camera-laden drone several hundred feet above Pani Herath’s house in south Miami, Florida, it would become clear his rooftop is an oddity compared with virtually all of his neighbors. Despite living in a part of the world that bakes in the sun throughout the year, just a few thousand people across Florida, such as Herath, have installed solar panels. “Unfortunately, not many people know about solar. That’s why nobody around here has solar at all,” said Herath. He has become an object of curiosity in his tidy neighborhood, where watering the manicured lawn and scooping debris from the pool is of greater concern. “I was telling my friend next door about it and he was wondering why I would want to go solar,” said Herath, who has had solar-heated water for the past six years and is now looking to lower his electric bills with more panels. “I wish that everybody would know about it.” Despite its Sunshine state moniker, Florida is barely harnessing its bountiful rays for energy. The Solar Energy Industries Association ranks the state third in the US for rooftop solar potential but just 12th in terms of installed capacity. Despite some growth in commercial solar, the number of Florida households getting solar panels is not projected to squeak past 100 a year until 2021, a paltry rate for a state with more than 20 million residents. The gloom of renewable energy and climate advocates in Florida is exacerbated by envy at the solar boom occurring in the north-east states and out west in California. “You see states with snow and far more cloud than Florida and they have more solar than us,” said Alissa Schafer, communications and policy manager at the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy. “That can be a bit frustrating. These other states are kicking our butt, to put it bluntly.” This disparity is no longer a mildly diverting quirk. Donald Trump’s administration has been gleefully crushing any federal policy with any whiff of climate change about it, and the president is expected on Tuesday to sign an executive order undoing Obama’s clean power plan. So the urgent task of emissions cuts is starting to depend more heavily upon cities and states. Currently, Florida derives less than 1% of its electricity generation from solar. “Political beliefs have held solar back in Florida, and the utilities like the way things currently are,” said Schafer. Critics say the utilities are not active enough in helping develop the solar market, and rooftop capacity by homeowners, because it could be a threat to their roles supplying traditional energy sources. In many states, a solar company can lend panels to a homeowner and then sell the cheap power generated directly to the owner. But that isn’t allowed in Florida. Nor is a homeowner able to sell on his or her generated solar power to anyone else, such as a neighbor or tenants. By Florida logic, anyone with rooftop panels is providing a utility and therefore must be able to provide power 24 hours a day. And as only the state’s vast monopoly utilities, such as Florida Power &amp; Light, can do this on demand, households are barred from this sort of third-party ownership. “It’s ludicrous that Florida outlaws such a thing,” said Justin Hoysradt, chief executive of Vinyasun. His West Palm Beach company has instead attempted to boost solar sales through loans structured like car or mortgage repayments. “Places like New York, Massachusetts and California have recognized the jobs and environmental benefit of solar. We have more of a challenge.” Florida Power and Light, which serves around 10 million people in the state, insists that it has been a proponent of solar power. “FPL has been leading the smart, cost-conscious expansion of solar in Florida since we built our first solar power plant back in 2009,” Eric Silagy, president and CEO of FPL, said in January. He spoke as it officially connected three new solar power centers to the grid and announced plans to build eight more plants, and other local schemes, by 2018. It said the plants built last year generated enough solar for 15,000 homes and the target for next year was 120,000. The challenge to move Florida up the league table of states providing solar power could have become much more difficult if a state ballot measure hadn’t narrowly failed last year. The measure, called amendment 1 and backed by more than $20m in campaign funding from various utilities firms, was presented as pro-solar and endorsed as such by Florida’s supreme court. But critics insist it would have deceptively opened the way for new fees on rooftop solar and snuffed out the industry. Al Gore, the former vice-president, called amendment 1 a “phony baloney initiative”. Jim Kallinger, chairman of the Florida Faith &amp; Freedom Coalition and a supporter of the amendment, said the measure would have “said no to corporate welfare” while ensuring the right to have solar panels in the state constitution. Solar will continue to be a niche industry as long as Florida maintains its cheap electricity rates, Kallinger added. “It’s hard for solar PV [photovoltaic panels] to compete with other energy sources,” he said. “I think solar is more of a novelty for folks who might have some disposable income. Yes, we have a lot of sunshine in Florida but we have a lot of cloud cover. In other states, you have the government intervening more, but here we have pushback against that sort of thing.” New York: mushrooming capacity North-eastern states may not be bathed in sunlight as much as Florida is but the ambition for solar dwarfs that of the balmier southern state. This is driven by the retail politics of electricity prices as much as it is of acceptance of climate disruption – while New York’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, has said warming temperatures are costing the state “not only in dollars but already in lives”, his Florida counterpart, Rick Scott, will be forever saddled by reports that he banned public servants from uttering the words “climate change”. Generous city and state tax breaks, combined with the plummeting cost of solar, are starting to reap dividends in New York City, where solar panels are popping up in unexpected rooftops in the Bronx and Brooklyn. Installed solar capacity has mushroomed 800% in the past five years, with state efforts to get panels on to churches and schools. In August, Cuomo announced that utilities would be required to source half of the state’s electricity from solar and wind by 2030. Florida has no such target. “Solar in New York City is finally hitting its renaissance, I think,” said Posie Constable, business development manager at New York City Energy Efficiency Corporation (NYCEEC). “I think we’re at a point now where it was really just a matter of coming up with innovative financing models that allowed New Yorkers to catch up with what’s been happening across the country.” NYCEEC, a not-for-profit lender, has been using loans and other incentives to get different types of buildings to go solar. Cooperative dwellings are proving an increasingly fertile area, with a number of such residencies across New York City opting to get solar on their roofs. Elmo Homes, a co-op in the Brooklyn district of Sunset Park, got an $86,000 loan from NYCEEC for its panels. With the various city, state and federal tax credits, about three-quarters of the project’s $200,000 cost will eventually be wiped out. The 30-apartment building is making energy savings of around $10,000 a year. Eric Appleton, president of Elmo Homes, said residents were interested in the environmental benefit of adopting solar but the main attraction was financial. “Rather than just saving on energy costs, we’re actually collecting that money and then we can put it into the upkeep of the building, whether that’s maintaining the exterior, dealing with plumbing issues, fixing the roof,” he said. “New York state is giving a lot of support to solar and it’s critical. I don’t think we would have been able to make this step without that support.” While renewable energy remains wildly popular with the public regardless of political outlook, a perception lingers in some quarters that it is flaky and propped up by taxpayer largesse. Trump is a member of this camp, writing in his 2015 book Crippled America that the push for renewables was being driven by “the mistaken belief that global climate change is being caused by carbon emissions”. The now president added: “If you don’t buy that – and I don’t – then what we have is really just an expensive way of making the tree-huggers feel good about themselves.” The economic reality increasingly casts a shadow over these views. Job growth in solar is outstripping the rest of the economy, with more Americans now working on installing and maintaining panels than in the oil and gas sectors combined. “There is this stigma of solar being a bunch of hippies using the solar electricity to grow pot and go to a Grateful Dead show,” said Jeff Johnston, who has worked as a solar contractor in south Florida for the past two decades. “But it’s far beyond that. It’s a trade. We want to be recognized as a trade. I don’t even like to think about what our commander-in-chief has said about climate change. But I think the ultimate consensus is that people do want solar no matter what their politics.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2019/may/18/climate-crisis-heat-is-on-global-heating-four-degrees-2100-change-way-we-live","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2019-05-18T15:00:37Z","webTitle":"The heat is on over the climate crisis.

Only radical measures will work","bodyText":"Drowned cities; stagnant seas; intolerable heatwaves; entire nations uninhabitable… and more than 11 billion humans. A four-degree-warmer world is the stuff of nightmares and yet that’s where we’re heading in just decades. While governments mull various carbon targets aimed at keeping human-induced global heating within safe levels – including new ambitions to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 – it’s worth looking ahead pragmatically at what happens if we fail. After all, many scientists think it’s highly unlikely that we will stay below 2C (above pre-industrial levels) by the end of the century, let alone 1.5C. Most countries are not making anywhere near enough progress to meet these internationally agreed targets. Climate models predict we’re currently on track for a heating of somewhere between 3C and 4C for 2100, although bear in mind that these are global average temperatures – at the poles and over land (where people live), the increase may be double that. Predictions are tricky, however, as temperatures depend on how sensitive the climate is to carbon dioxide (CO2). Most models assume that it is not very sensitive – that’s where the lower 3C comes from – but a whole new set of models to be published in 2021 finds much greater sensitivity. They put heating at around 5C by the end of the century, meaning people could be experiencing as much as 10C of heating over land. Such uncertainty isn’t ideal, but for our purposes let’s plump for an entirely feasible planetary heating of 4C by the end of the century. If that seems a long time away, consider that plenty of people you know will be around then. My children will be in their 80s, perhaps with middle-aged children and grandchildren. We are making their world and it will be a very different place. Four degrees may not sound like much – after all, it is less than a typical temperature change between night and day. It might even sound pleasant, like retiring from the UK to southern Spain. However, an average heating of the entire globe by 4C would render the planet unrecognisable from anything humans have ever experienced. The last time the world was this hot was 15m years ago during the miocene, when intense volcanic eruptions in western North America emitted vast quantities of CO2. Sea levels rose some 40 metres higher than today and lush forests grew in Antarctica and the Arctic. However, that global heating took place over many thousands of years. Even at its most rapid, the rise in CO2 emissions occurred at a rate 1,000 times slower than ours has since the start of the Industrial Revolution. That gave animals and plants time to adapt to new conditions and, crucially, ecosystems had not been degraded by humans. Things look considerably bleaker for our 2100 world. Over the past decade, scientists have been able to produce a far more nuanced picture of how temperature rise affects the complexities of cloud cover and atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns and ecology. We’re looking at vast dead zones in the oceans as nutrients from fertiliser runoff combine with warmer waters to produce an explosion in algae that starve marine life of oxygen. This will be exacerbated by the acidity from dissolved CO2, which will cause a mass die-off, particularly of shellfish, plankton and coral. “We will have lost all the reefs decades before 2100 – at somewhere between 2C and 4C,” says Johan Rockström, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. Sea levels will be perhaps two metres higher and, more worryingly, we will be well on our way to an ice-free world, having passed the tipping points for the Greenland and west Antarctic ice sheets, committing us to at least 10 metres of sea-level rise in coming centuries. That’s because as ice sheets melt, their surface drops to a lower altitude where it is warmer, speeding up melting in a runaway feedback loop. Eventually, dark, heat-absorbing land is exposed, speeding the melting process even more. By 2100, we will also have lost most low-latitude glaciers, including two-thirds of the so called third pole of the Hindu Kush-Karakoram-Himalayan mountains and Tibetan plateau that feeds many of Asia’s important rivers. However, most rivers, especially in Asia, will flood more often, according to research by Richard Betts, head of climate impacts at the Met Office Hadley Centre, because the hotter atmosphere will produce more intense monsoons, violent storms and extreme rainfall. His studies predict a wide equatorial belt of high humidity that will cause intolerable heat stress across most of tropical Asia, Africa, Australia and the Americas, rendering them uninhabitable for much of the year. Tropical forests of heat-tolerant species may well thrive in this wet zone with the high CO2 concentrations, especially with the disappearance of human infrastructure and agriculture, although the conditions will probably favour lianas (vines) over slower-growing trees, Betts says. To the south and north of this humid zone, bands of expansive desert will also rule out agriculture and human habitation. Some models predict that desert conditions will stretch from the Sahara right up through south and central Europe, drying rivers including the Danube and the Rhine. In South America, the picture is more complicated: increased precipitation could enhance the Amazon rainforest, leading to mightier river flow. Other models predict a weakening of the easterlies over the Atlantic, drying the Amazon, increasing fires and turning it from forest to grassland. The tipping point for the Amazon could well be triggered by deforestation; while the intact forest could cope with some drought because it generates and maintains its own moist ecosystem, areas that have been opened up through degradation allow moisture to escape. “A combination of climate change and deforestation could push it into a savannah state,” Rockström says. All of nature will be affected by the change in climate, ecosystems and hydrology and there will be plenty of extinctions as species struggle to migrate and adapt to an utterly changed world. Daniel Rothman, co-director of MIT’s Lorenz Center, calculates that 2100 will herald the beginning of Earth’s sixth mass extinction event. But what about us? This is undoubtedly a more hostile, dangerous world for humanity, which by 2100 will number around 11 billion, all of whom will need food, water, power and somewhere to live. It will be, in a giant understatement, problematic. The good news is that humans won’t become extinct – the species can survive with just a few hundred individuals; the bad news is, we risk great loss of life and perhaps the end of our civilisations. Many of the places where people live and grow food will no longer be suitable for either. Higher sea levels will make today’s low-lying islands and many coastal regions, where nearly half the global population live, uninhabitable, generating an estimated 2 billion refugees by 2100. Bangladesh alone will lose one-third of its land area, including its main breadbasket. From 2030, more than half the population will live in the tropics, an area that makes up a third of the planet and already struggles with climate impacts. Yet by 2100, most of the low and mid latitudes will be uninhabitable because of heat stress or drought; despite stronger precipitation, the hotter soils will lead to faster evaporation and most populations will struggle for fresh water. We will have to live on a smaller land surface with a larger population. Indeed, the consequences of a 4C warmer world are so terrifying that most scientists would rather not contemplate them, let alone work out a survival strategy. Rockström doesn’t like our chances. “It’s difficult to see how we could accommodate eight billion people or maybe even half of that,” he says. “There will be a rich minority of people who survive with modern lifestyles, no doubt, but it will be a turbulent, conflict-ridden world.” He points out that we already use nearly half the world’s ice-free surface to produce food for 7 billion people and thinks meeting the needs of 11 billion in such hostile conditions would be impossible. “The reason is primarily making enough food, but also we would have lost the biodiversity we’re dependent on and be facing a cocktail of negative shocks all the time, from fires to droughts.” Others are more sanguine. “I don’t think that humans as a species or even industrial civilisation is seriously threatened,” says Ken Caldeira, climatologist at the Carnegie Institution for Science in California. “People live in Houston, Miami and Atlanta because they live in air conditioning through the hot summers. If people are rich enough to air-condition their lives, they can watch whatever is the successor to Game of Thrones on TV, as the natural world decays around them,” he says. But he points out that while richer people risk a loss to their quality of life, the poorer risk their actual lives. So how might we give all of humanity the best chance? Our best hope lies in cooperating as never before to radically reorganise our world: decoupling the political map from geography. However unrealistic it sounds, we’d need to look at the world afresh and see it in terms of where the resources are and then plan the population, food and energy production around that. It would mean abandoning huge tracts of the globe and moving Earth’s human population to the high latitudes: Canada, Siberia, Scandinavia, parts of Greenland, Patagonia, Tasmania, New Zealand and perhaps newly ice-free parts of the western Antarctic coast. If we allow 20 sq m of space per person – more than double the minimum habitable space allowed per person under English planning regulations – 11 billion people would need 220,000 sq km of land to live on. The area of Canada alone is 9.9m sq km and, combined with all the other high-latitude areas, such as Alaska, Britain, Russia and Scandinavia, there should be plenty of room for everyone. These precious lands, with tolerable temperatures and access to water, would also be valuable food-growing areas, as well as the last oases for many species, so people would need to be housed in compact, efficient high-rise cities with reflective roofs and resource-recycling systems. That risks raising local temperatures to intolerable levels, because compact cities function as heat islands, so solar-powered cooling or even artificial winds would be needed to counteract this. There is also an increased risk of epidemics in such densely populated spaces. Peter Cox, a climatologist at the University of Exeter, thinks this is viable, but would require a massive programme of infrastructure to manage waste, air quality and water needs. City-scale underground reservoirs could supply domestic needs and efficient recycling would keep water – and other resources – circulating in the population for years rather than hours. Post-fossil fuels, we will require unprecedented electricity production. This could come from vast arrays of solar- and wind-power plants in a belt across the uninhabitable desert regions. High-voltage direct current transmission lines could relay this power to the cities or it could be stored as thermal energy in molten salts and transported in hydrogen – after solar energy is used to split water to provide hydrogen for fuel cells. Hydrogen production will be on an industrial scale and it could be used for nonelectric transport, for instance. Wave farms, nuclear fission (and potentially fusion) and solar power will help meet our electricity needs. In the meantime, the effective capture from the air of today’s carbon emissions will with luck be a reality; they can be stored or used in the manufacture of materials. Food production will need to be more intensive, efficient and industrial. This will be a mostly vegetarian world, largely devoid of fish and without the grazing area or resources for livestock. Poultry may be viable on the edges of farmland and synthetic meats and other foods will meet some of the demand. Heat-tolerant, drought-resistant crop varieties, such as cassava and millet, will replace many of our current unmodified staples such as rice and wheat and they will grow faster and with greater water efficiency because of the high CO2 levels. One problem is that almost all of our agriculture will need to be at higher latitudes, because the tropics will be too dry or too hot for farmworkers. And that means less land and less sunlight in winter. “Global agriculture could be limited by the geometry of Earth’s orbit around the sun,” Cox says. “However, studies have shown that crops thrive with artificial light delivered by LEDs at exactly the right frequencies for photosynthesis. This means we could grow crops through the winter months, hydroponically in smaller spaces, stacked up in warehouses or even underground, leaving valuable land surfaces for other uses.” Cultivation of algal mats and crops grown on floating platforms and in marshland could also contribute, while crops could potentially be grown in uninhabitable regions, farmed and processed remotely by artificial farmers. Either way, we would need to use far more precise nutrient and irrigation systems to avoid polluting more fertile ecosystems and reduce food loss and waste. A 4C warmer world may well be survivable, but it would be eminently poorer than the one we currently enjoy. Rockström believes it takes us beyond our adaptation capabilities. Delivering our children to such a deadly home is a horrifying proposition. Given what’s at stake, it may be worth deploying geoengineering tools, which reflect the sun’s heat away from Earth, and so keep global heating to safe levels. This wouldn’t address the problem of dissolved carbon killing oceanic life, but it could buy us more time to decarbonise and achieve negative emissions. Crucially, keeping Earth cooler for longer would help the poorest people to adapt. “We have come to a point where different forms of geoengineering cannot be excluded,” admits Rockström, “but SRM [solar radiation management] is a very dangerous geopolitical tool to deploy: who decides which part of the globe to shade? How would we govern it?” he asks. We’ve already warmed the world by 1.1C, and we’re experiencing the effects: the International Federation of the Red Cross estimates there are as many as 50 million climate refugees. Once we reach 4C, most models agree it will be impossible to return to today’s abundant world. “For me, the issue is that we are transforming (and simplifying!) our world for many thousands of years into the future with millennia of rising sea [levels], acidified oceans and intolerable tropical temperatures, just because we weren’t willing to pay the small differential between fossil-fuelled prosperity and prosperity fuelled by non-greenhouse-gas-emitting energy systems,” says Caldeira. We are now making the climate of 2100 and however hard it seems to meet our emissions targets, it’ll be far harder for our children if we don’t. With international cooperation and regulation, we can make it livable. • This article was amended on 28 November 2019.

On Tuesday the Clean Energy Regulator released new data which showed a record 3.5m solar panels were installed on Australia rooftops last year. The record 1,057 megawatts of capacity in small-scale systems installed across the country smashed the previous record set in 2012, and had the capacity to produce the equivalent output of a medium-sized coal-fired power station. It prompted a warning that the increase in supply to the grid could lead governments to cut feed-in tariffs because the power is “essentially worthless”. Tony Wood, the director of the Grattan Institute’s energy program, said high solar take-up could have the unintended consequence of over-supplying the grid during low demand periods. It would mean governments and retailers were subsidising solar energy that had no real value. “If it becomes that inefficient, it’s not beyond reckoning that governments would think, ‘well, hang on, why are we doing this,’” he said. “Obviously in the short term anyone benefiting from those subsidies doesn’t like it when it’s reduced or removed.” Wood thinks that means governments need to reform tariffs to make them more “cost effective”, as well as advocate for the roll-out of smart meters which can limit output during low-demand periods. But other energy experts say that the timeframe and scope of over-supply to the grid is so marginal that it isn’t a serious issue. Tristan Edis from Green Energy Markets said the rate of advance in storage capacity meant it was unlikely to ever be a problem. “You could foresee that we will reach a point if we kept the current rate of installations where, for example, on Christmas Day that a state like South Australia - which has very small base-load industry demand - five to 10 years down the track, you could end up with a situation where solar generation exceeded available demand,” he said. “But we’re talking one day of the year for a few hours in one state.” Edis said advances in battery technology as well as storage capacity projects such as the Snowy Hydro 2.0 scheme meant it was unlikely that solar supply would outstrip demand. “Right now the penetration of solar on a very good day in South Australia may reach 30% of total demand,” he said. “Over time that will creep higher and higher [but] we might be talking a 10 year timeframe. That’s enough time to expect batteries are going to achieve substantial cost declines such that they become an economically viable and sensible way of soaking up demand and generation during the day.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/jun/23/green-energy-subsidies-community-projects-fossil-fuels","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-23T11:34:52Z","webTitle":"Green energy feels the heat as subsidies go to fossil fuels","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/23/green-energy-subsidies-community-projects-fossil-fuels","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jun/23/green-energy-subsidies-community-projects-fossil-fuels","fields":{"headline":"Green energy feels the heat as subsidies go to fossil fuels","bodyText":"The number of people generating their own power has almost flatlined, with only one new group formed in the UK last year, according to the body representing grassroots energy organisations. Cuts to subsidies for homeowners to install solar panels and a “hostile planning approach” that has in effect banned new wind turbines are behind the “wholesale decline”, Community Energy England (CEE) said in its 2018 State of the Sector report. Grassroots schemes can slash electricity bills in half at a time when the “big six” energy companies have raised their prices so that the average household is paying £1,150 to £1,200 a year. But setting up a project is risky, with the cost of installing solar panels or constructing turbines paid up-front, and nearly 30% of community energy groups saw some of their schemes fail last year, the report said. Subsidies can hedge the risks, but in 2015 the government cut them for green energy, including the “feed-in tariff” households get for supplying excess energy back to the national grid, capping the total at £100m by 2019. Fossil fuel subsidies are more than 30 times higher – companies running oil or coal-fired power stations received more than £3bn last year through the capacity market, funded partly by household fuel bills. “There is a clear link between recent subsidy changes and an increasing number of failed or stalled community projects,” said CEE’s chief executive, Emma Bridge. “If government is serious about creating a new renewable energy industry to meet the nation’s power needs it has got to embrace the community energy sector and restore the modest support that it needs to thrive.” Community energy groups were growing by 30 a year until 2015, but only one was formed last year, bringing the total to 228, serving 48,000 members. One of the successes is Energise Barnsley, which has installed solar panels and batteries in 321 council homes, municipal buildings and schools, focusing on people at risk of fuel poverty. Elaine Marsh, a retired NHS secretary, used to pay £350 a year for her electricity, but now her annual bill is only £185. “The battery stores what I don’t use during the day so I can use it at night,” she said. “So I do all my laundry at night when it’s free. I use as much of my utilities at night as I can.” Other big projects include Drayton Manor solar farm in Warwickshire, Newton Downs solar farm in Devon and Mean Moor wind farm in Cumbria, but campaigners say Britain is falling behind other European countries. Emily Rochon, an energy lawyer with ClientEarth, said: “Pouring public money into fossil fuels while slashing support for community energy makes no economic sense. Homegrown renewable energy has the potential to mitigate rising and volatile electricity prices by decreasing reliance on fossil fuels. “The government’s pennywise but pound-foolish approach will only cost the economy in the long run. Getting our power from fossil fuels makes it overly expensive to keep the lights on and failure to support clean energy will drive technological innovation and job creation in this sector abroad. “Other countries have recognised that community-owned renewable energy delivers greater economic, social and environmental benefits and will reap the rewards as a result. The UK, on the other hand, will miss the opportunity.” The Bavarian village of Grossbardorf has been entirely converted to solar energy and biogas from crops grown by local farmers. Grossbardorf FC’s new stand is covered in solar panels, paid for by fans who receive a season ticket or a free sausage at home games. The homes of the village’s 950 inhabitants are connected to a district heating network, where water is heated at a local power station, then pumped directly into the radiators of the 120 houses. In Stockholm a new development of 10,000 homes will be heated by computer servers in a data centre operated by DigiPlex, according to Fredrik Jansson, its chief strategy officer. “When my five-year-old daughter does stuff on her iPad, a process starts in the data centre, heat comes up from the servers,” Jansson said. “It’s captured and put out into the central heating system, so when she’s sitting on her bed, looking out on to a snowy Stockholm landscape, the data is heating the radiator.” BeauVent in the Belgian port of Ostend will also be capturing heat from a waste incinerator, while in Spain, the Catalan government is planning to let householders with solar panels sell electricity to each other directly via peer-to-peer trading. And Respond, a project funded by the EU’s Horizon 2020 programme involving five countries, will look at ways to automate smart household appliances so they come on at times when demand for energy is low. Although the cost of solar panels has fallen significantly in the past few years, large-scale renewable energy projects have also stalled in the UK. Last week, the trade body Solar Power Europe revealed that the number of new solar power installations in Britain had fallen by half for the second year in a row."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/may/29/stone-circle-haroon-mirza-texas-stonehenge","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-29T15:00:52Z","webTitle":"Stone Circle: the story behind Haroon Mirza's Texas Stonehenge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/may/29/stone-circle-haroon-mirza-texas-stonehenge","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/may/29/stone-circle-haroon-mirza-texas-stonehenge","fields":{"headline":"Stone Circle: the story behind Haroon Mirza's Texas Stonehenge","bodyText":"Ever since New York artist Donald Judd relocated to Marfa in 1979, this small Texas town has become an art destination. It isn’t exactly a place you’d expect to find a booming creative scene, but artists and galleries moved here in the 1980s to take advantage of empty spaces and cheap rents, while also paying tribute to Judd’s legacy. The Ayn Foundation – which currently boasts Andy Warhol’s The Last Supper – opened in Marfa in 1993, and art galleries like Inde/Jacobs and Rule Gallery, as well as design boutique Wrong Marfa, are all set up in Marfa. So is a landmark fake Prada boutique on the roadside, which is an artwork by Elmgreen &amp; Dragset from 2005. Just last year saw the small town of 2,000 people host Solange Knowles at a concert for Judd’s Chianti Foundation. Next up, Marfa will see a new solar powered Stonehenge project by British artist Haroon Mirza. The piece, entitled Stone Circle, is a set of black marble-like rocks in the Texas desert until 2023 (but potentially indefinitely). Every full moon, there will be a musical concert and light show in what Mirza calls “solar symphonies”, with the first one held on 28 June. “On full moons, the stones will start to play composed electrical signals, which will be quite musical,” said Mirza over the phone from his London studio. “You will hear the electricity as sound.” The stone pieces stand in a circle, like the ancient Stonehenge or the famed Nine Ladies site in Derbyshire. Set in the high desert, eight chunks of marble will sit in a circle with the ninth as the “mother stone”, charging the circle through a bank of batteries underground. “You see the electrical current as light and you hear it as sound,” said Mirza. The stones are made of marble shipped from Mexico, which light up at night. “During the day, they look like quartz crystals, but at night they glow with electricity,” he said. Mirza, who is the winner of the Silver Lion for Most Promising artist at the 54th Venice Biennale in 2011, has made solar-powered artworks in the past, like wall-works which generate sound from electricity, including Duet for a Duo (Solar Symphony 7) from 2015. He recalls his first mystified experience with the Stonehenge as he drove past it decades ago. “I remember thinking it was an alien thing, like a UFO landing,” he said. “It has an incredible aura to it, from a distance and up close.” It wasn’t about replicating the Stonehenge, but presenting a new experience. “The feeling of being at the Stone Circle is a sense of commune with nature,” said Mirza. This artwork is more than just a journey out into the desert, as it also promotes solar power in the south. Freedom Solar, the Austin-based solar panel company, donated half of the solar panels for the project. They’re also offering a rebate for new solar customers referred through the gallery which is presenting this project, Ballroom Marfa. (Freedom Solar also offers local workshops for west Texans wanting to switch to solar power at home and at work.) Surprisingly, it’s working. “When I first visited Marfa, I didn’t see one solar panel anywhere, which I thought was surprising because there is a lot of sun,” said Mirza. “There is controversy around it, but there is potential for solar energy in that part of Texas and people have started installing solar panels, which is a positive move.” “It’s a no brainer, actually,” he adds. “If you live in a climate like that, it makes a massive difference.” The project was no easy feat, as Stone Circle took five years to materialize, and it didn’t help that the marble was stuck at the Mexican border for nine months. “I thought it was going to be easy, but it was complicated and expensive,” said Mirza. “Sometimes it’s better to be naive and have ambition and think big.” For the first full moon gathering, the marble ‘stones’ will light up and play sounds that call to mind electronic music. “I’ve composed the electrical signals,” said Mirza. “It depends what you regard as music.” Even though the Stonehenge was used as a site for worship, there will be no sacrificial lambs. “People are perceiving and preaching it as a spiritual gathering, but I don’t have an intention of it being a spiritual thing,” said Mirza."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/18/uk-and-india-sign-agreement-laying-ground-for-free-trade-deal-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-18T18:36:53Z","webTitle":"May woos Modi as UK pursues free-trade deal with India","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/18/uk-and-india-sign-agreement-laying-ground-for-free-trade-deal-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/18/uk-and-india-sign-agreement-laying-ground-for-free-trade-deal-brexit","fields":{"headline":"May woos Modi as UK pursues free-trade deal with India","bodyText":"Britain and India have laid the ground for a possible post-Brexit bilateral free trade deal and signed off on a series of commercial agreements worth up to £1bn, according to Downing Street. Brexit opponents claim the chances of Britain securing a trade deal with India superior to a Indian-EU deal are a fantasy unless the UK makes major concessions on Indian skilled labour accessing UK markets. Karan Bilimoria, the British Indian entrepreneur and life peer, insisted Modi’s priority was a free trade deal with the EU. Britain is nevertheless lavishing diplomatic attention over Narendra Modi, the Indian prime minister, thanking him for breaking a decade of Indian indifference to the Commonwealth by personally attending the Commonwealth summit and so giving the post-colonial assembly greater relevance. Modi did not attend the Commonwealth summit in Malta two years ago, and his predecessor, Manmohan Singh, missed the 2011 summit in Australia and its successor in Sri Lanka in 2013. But Modi, who was personally courted by both Prince Charles and Theresa May to attend the talks, regards the Commonwealth as a useful multilateral forum from which China, India’s great rival, is absent. He is also looking for allies in any trade war with the US. In common with most Commonwealth leaders, Modi also sees the visit as a chance to woo the City of London and court foreign direct investment. The Indian prime minister has been rewarded for his commitment to the Commonwealth with Wednesday’s lengthy bilateral meeting with May, an audience with the Queen, a visit with Prince Charles to the Science Museum and a commitment that British intelligence will help fight Pakistan-based militant groups. In a further sign of British respect, Modi’s plane from Sweden was greeted at Heathrow by the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson. Modi’s aides also claimed he was travelling in a limousine when many other heads of state were due to travel to a Windsor retreat in a bus. At a packed town-hall-style meeting in Central Hall Westminster, Modi spoke of his rise from tea seller to visitor to a royal palace, and said the days of incremental change in India were over. Throughout the day he was also pursued by hundreds of demonstrators protesting gainst his attitude to Kashmir, Hindu nationalism and the failure to act against horrific instances of sexual violence against women, including the rape of an eight-year-old Muslim girl. British ministers say a free trade deal with India is a priority after Brexit, but the joint Indian-UK statement issued after the bilateral meeting acknowledges that the UK cannot sign any new deal until the Brexit transition period ends. The EU is also locked in talks with India over a free trade deal, a subject Modi will raise with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, in a stopover before he returns to India from London. After Brexit the UK will initially simply seek to replicate the EU-Indian free trade deal, but any bespoke agreement will be hard to negotiate since India will be looking for concessions on visa travel from India to the UK. The lengthy bilateral deal signed by the two countries covers cyberspace, technology sharing, solar energy, sustainable urban development, water management, animal husbandry, safe use of nuclear energy, artificial intelligence and big-data analytics. The joint agreement said a “secure, free, open, inclusive and prosperous Indo-Pacific” was in the interests of India, the UK and the international community, adding: “The UK and India will also work together to tackle threats such as piracy, protect freedom of navigation and open access, and improve maritime domain awareness in the region.” India regards the statement as significant given Beijing’s tough approach to disputes to the South China Sea and attempts to increase its footprint in the Indo-Pacific region."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2017/apr/30/powerhouse-incubator-accelerator-solar-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-04-30T13:00:00Z","webTitle":"Powerhouse: the startup making solar the most accessible energy in the world","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/apr/30/powerhouse-incubator-accelerator-solar-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2017/apr/30/powerhouse-incubator-accelerator-solar-energy","fields":{"headline":"Powerhouse: the startup making solar the most accessible energy in the world","bodyText":"It started with a crowdfunding startup, an investment from Prince, and the idea to help new solar companies tackle business challenges that can be hard to overcome on their own. Now, four years later, the idea has morphed into a group called Powerhouse, and notably, in a world flush with tech startups, it’s one of the only incubators out there focused on launching and growing solar companies. Powerhouse runs an accelerator and an incubator program. An accelerator typically provides a small amount of funding, free or low-cost office space, and networking opportunities with investors and customers for young companies that are still developing their first technology and business plans. Since its launch in 2013, Powerhouse has invested hundreds of thousands of dollars collectively into 15 startups, and this summer plans to welcome another few solar entrepreneurs into the program. The group’s incubator division rents office space to more established solar and energy startups across 15,000 sq ft and three floors in downtown Oakland, California. Sometimes the accelerator entrepreneurs graduate into rent-paying companies in the co-working space. Powerhouse now hosts about 15 companies and about 100 people across both groups. Its goal is simple. The organization wants to play a unique role in fostering a new wave of tech innovation in the solar market. Many of the Powerhouse companies are using software, data and the web to make selling or designing solar systems cheaper and easier. They rely on the advice and networking opportunities through Powerhouse to raise money, find customers or exit – through an initial public offering or acquisition. “Powerhouse gave us so much validation and credibility at the beginning, when we didn’t have much to show. It was just enough to get people to believe in us,” says Elena Lucas, the co-founder and CEO of UtilityAPI, an energy data startup. An earlier wave of solar startups was dominated by companies experimenting with different materials and designs for solar cells and panels. Many of those materials-focused solar startups failed in getting the desired technical performance despite large investments from the Bay Area’s venture capitalists. As the price of solar panels dropped dramatically in recent years, the new generation of entrepreneurs and startups are chipping away at other stubborn problems, such as shortening the time it takes to get permits or honing the sales pitch to homeowners. It’s like when fast internet connections finally got cheap and ubiquitous enough to attract the entrepreneurial-minded to build new websites and services on top of it. Tough challenges remain for solar startups. Big utilities and power companies, who are potential investors or customers, don’t generally have experience working with young, renewable energy companies. Meanwhile, US government funding for energy innovation is minimal, particularly with potential federal budget cuts looming and a lack of clean energy support in the White House. But as solar energy becomes cheaper, it’s attracting public and private investments worldwide, evidenced by the $116bn that flowed into solar projects, companies and technologies in 2016, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. “The ultimate mission of Powerhouse is to make solar energy the most accessible form of energy in the world,” says Emily Kirsch, co-founder of Powerhouse. Sitting on a bean bag in a nook of the seventh floor of Powerhouse’s headquarters, Kirsch says that despite the rise and success of Silicon Valley-style tech accelerators such as Y Combinator and Techstars, no one else has tried to do the same targeting only the solar industry: “We’re it so far.” The group’s model is showing some success, at least on a small scale, though it’s still early days. Powerhouse takes a small equity stake in its accelerator companies and makes money if they get acquired or go public. Currently Powerhouse gets the bulk of its investment money from a combination of grants, corporate sponsors, like SolarCity and SunPower, and office space rental fees. It’s considering raising money from angel investors so that it could make larger investments and in more companies. None of the companies in its portfolio has gone public or been bought yet, but some of them have attracted funding since going through the accelerator program and increased the value of the companies in the process. Kirsch says the top startups in the accelerator program have seen their values increase by as many as 40 times. Four of the startups in its incubator program have been acquired so far, says Kirsch, though the company doesn’t take a stake in those. But their exits help to build Powerhouse’s reputation among entrepreneurs and investors. A home for solar Kirsch has been involved since day one. Years ago, when Kirsch was working for Van Jones, an environmental and human rights activist who briefly served as a green jobs adviser to former President Obama, he asked her if she would be interested in helping the then new startup called Solar Mosaic, which provides financing to install solar panels on rooftops, pilot a solar program in Oakland. Meanwhile Jones’s friend Prince was looking to invest a quarter of a million dollars into solar projects in Oakland, and ended up funding Solar Mosaic’s first four solar buildings. Based on that experience – connecting a young solar startup with partners and capital – Kirsch and Danny Kennedy, a former Greenpeace campaign manager who co-founded solar installer Sungevity, launched a company to try to see if the model could work for many more young solar companies. They changed the name of the company, SFunCube, to Powerhouse two years ago. On a visit earlier this year to Powerhouse’s headquarters, dozens of entrepreneurs were heads down working on their products and mingling with potential partners during a weekly open house event. The Powerhouse team connected UtilityAPI with its first investor, Better Ventures, as well as an adviser, Jon Wellinghoff, who is a former chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. After going through the accelerator program, UtilityAPI, which creates software to collect data about a building’s energy use and deliver it to customers such as solar or energy storage installers, has grown to nine people from the two co-founders. It now has an office space on the sixth floor of Powerhouse after previously using shared desks. Lucas says the co-working space served as a “brain trust” because all the entrepreneurs brought with them different types of expertise. That allowed her to get quick answers about energy policy or technical standards. Another accelerator program graduate, BrightCurrent, which works with big box retailers and solar companies on marketing solar panels and installation services, now employs 120 people and became profitable last year, says John Bourne, the co-founder and CEO of the five-year-old company. Bourne says Powerhouse helped his company connect with investors (like Better Ventures) and customers and hone his sales pitch. During the accelerator program, Bourne met with Kirsch or Kennedy once a week to walk through BrightCurrent’s plans and brainstorm for ways to overcome obstacles. “It can be really isolating, lonely and tough being an entrepreneur. You’re working alone and trying to build something,” Bourne says. When he joined, Powerhouse was operating out of Sungevity’s offices and, he says: “It was a warm great environment, and I found people who cared about what I cared about. That was a huge win for me.” Solar Mosaic’s co-founder and CEO, Billy Parish, says that his company – which is now six years old and employs more than 150 people – has partnered with at least three of the Powerhouse startups on projects, including UtilityAPI, Sunible and BrightCurrent. “Powerhouse is one of the hubs of the solar ecosystem and they are helping bring breakthrough ideas for the industry into existence. Being close to them keeps us in touch with those new ideas and entrepreneurs,” says Parish. In total numbers, Powerhouse is still pretty small. Its companies have contributed to the installation of 242 megawatts of solar, employ 386 people, and have generated $52m in revenue. That’s probably the group’s biggest drawback – it’s limited, it’s very narrowly focused and it’s still operating on a tiny scale. But they’re part of a larger movement to invest and nurture new companies in low-carbon energy. Other companies running energy-related accelerator programs include Cyclotron Road, which has partnered with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and Otherlab in the Mission District of San Francisco. Last year, Bill Gates and a group of investors launched Breakthrough Energy Ventures to spend $1bn on early stage breakthroughs in energy. Powerhouse co-founder Danny Kennedy, who now heads up the California Clean Energy Fund, describes the importance of ventures like Powerhouse and the California Clean Energy Fund like this: “We need early-stage energy investing programs now more than ever to enable the energy transition. It’s critical.”"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"environment/2018/jul/20/life-after-coal-the-south-australian-city-leading-the-way","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-19T18:00:46Z","webTitle":"Life after coal: the South Australian city leading the way","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/20/life-after-coal-the-south-australian-city-leading-the-way","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jul/20/life-after-coal-the-south-australian-city-leading-the-way","fields":{"headline":"Life after coal: the South Australian city leading the way","bodyText":"The largest solar farm in the southern hemisphere lies on arid land at the foot of the Flinders Ranges, more than 300km north of Adelaide. If that sounds remote, it doesn’t do justice to how removed nearby locals feel from the energy debate in Canberra. As government MPs and national newspapers have thundered in recent days over whether taxpayers should support coal-fired power, occasionally mauling advice from government agencies as they went, residents of South Australia’s Upper Spencer Gulf region have been left to ponder why decision-makers are not paying more attention to what is happening in their backyard. In mid 2016, this region was on the brink, hit by the closure and near collapse of coal and steel plants. Now it’s on the cusp of a wave of construction that investors and community leaders say should place the region at the vanguard of green innovation – not just in Australia but globally. There has been an explosion in investment, with $5bn spread over the next five years. There are 13 projects in various stages of development, with more than 3,000 construction and 200 ongoing jobs. The economy of this once-deflated region has been transformed and those who live here are starting to feel hopeful again. The Port Augusta mayor, Sam Johnson, a 32-year-old former Liberal member, is continually surprised at how resistant some are to the idea that the energy environment has changed. “You might choose to ignore what’s happening here now because we’re out of sight, out of mind, but the reality is that what’s happening here is going to be happening on the eastern seaboard in the next 10 years,” he says. * * * In simple terms, the Upper Spencer Gulf transition story goes like this. Port Augusta was a coal town, home to the state’s only two lignite – or brown coal – plants, Playford B and Northern. Playford B, ageing and failing, was mothballed in 2012. Northern, the larger and younger of the two, closed in May 2016 when owner Alinta Energy decided it was no longer economically viable. The Leigh Creek mine that supplied it, by then offering up mostly low-quality coal, shut at the same time. About 400 workers at the plant and the mine lost their jobs. Roughly a third retired, a third found other employment locally and a third had to leave town to find work. At the same time, further around the gulf, the steel town of Whyalla was teetering precipitously after the owner, Arrium, put the mill in voluntary administration facing debts of more than $4bn. Yet as the doom hit, there were also rays of hope as several clean power projects were mooted for the surrounding area. Two years on, the Port Augusta city council lists 13 projects at varying stages of development. And Whyalla has unearthed a potential saviour in British billionaire industrialist Sanjeev Gupta, who not only bought the steelworks but promised to expand it while also spending what will likely end up being $1.5bn in solar, hydro and batteries to make it viable. Gupta says the logic behind his investment in solar and storage is simple: it’s now cheaper than coal. Johnson says he expects the Upper Gulf region to receive $5bn in clean energy investment over the next five years. “My gut feel – and I’m an optimist – is that they will all go ahead,” he says. “They are different technologies and they are playing in different markets, so they are not competing for power purchase agreements.” By any measure, the Bungala solar power plant is vast. Once its second stage is complete, 800,000 photovoltaic modules will cover an area the size of the Melbourne central business district. The scale is neatly summarised by Chris Rowe, the plant’s operations manager and, with maintenance officer Andrew Bartsch, our tour guide around the site. Both men recently returned to Port Augusta after working away to take up positions with Enel Green Power. One day Rowe decided to stroll back from the 275MW farm’s outer edge, weaving in and out of the rows of panels as he went. By the time he got back to his office, he had covered 12km. “At that point I thought, ‘gee, this is really something’,” he says. Bungala is nearing completion, with work on the $425m plant expected to be finished by January. Its first section started feeding into the national electricity grid in May. Further west, ground has been broken on the 59-turbine, 212MW Lincoln Gap wind farm, though progress has temporarily stalled after developer Nexif Energy discovered unexploded ordnance from historic military testing on site. As Guardian Australia visited the region, the South Australian Liberal government gave final approval for a $600m hybrid wind-and-solar energy park on the south-eastern edge of Port Augusta that proponent DP Energy says will be the largest development of its kind in the country. A second stage with more solar and a 400MW battery is slated to follow. At Cultana, just north of Whyalla, Energy Australia is investigating building the country’s first saltwater pumped hydro energy storage plant. It would draw water from the Spencer Gulf, pump it uphill when energy is plentiful and cheap, and convert it to hydro electricity at times of high demand. A decision on the project is expected in 2019. All are potentially agenda setting, but none are as anticipated as the Aurora solar thermal power station. It is the culmination of a push that began in 2010. A research paper by advocacy group Beyond Zero Emissions formed the basis for the creation of Repower Port Augusta, a community group that built widespread support for bringing the developing technology to the region among councils, business and unions. US developer SolarReserve took notice. It plans to use a field of mirrors to heat a molten salt system inside a 234-metre tower. It will both generate electricity and store eight hours of energy that can be sent out when the sun isn’t shining. The company says the $650m plant, to be built at the Carriewerloo sheep station about 30km north of Port Augusta, will be the world’s largest solar tower with storage and provide 5% of the state’s energy needs. The SolarReserve vice-president, Mary Grikas, stresses the plant will operate “just like a conventional coal or gas power station, reliably generating electricity day and night – except without any emissions”. With the increasing emphasis on “firming” power to back up variable renewables, solar thermal is seen as a potentially major player in filling the gaps, along with other fast-starting options such as pumped hydro, lithium-ion batteries and peaking gas. The 150MW Aurora plant is underpinned by a 20-year power supply contract with the South Australian government, but the company is still to finalise a $110m concessional loan with the federal government, the result of a deal with former senator Nick Xenophon in return for his support for company tax cuts. Dan Spencer worked on the solar thermal campaign as an activist with the Australian Youth Climate Coalition and Solar Citizens, relocating from Adelaide for six months to help build local support. Now a campaigner with the Australian Services Union, he is still pinching himself that it is set to become a reality. “The transition from coal hasn’t been perfect, but in a couple of years we will be seeing this incredible project that people not that long ago thought was just pie in the sky,” he says. “The local community really deserves the credit.” * * * Aurora is not the only solar-thermal project linked to the region. Port Augusta is already home to a small concentrated solar-thermal plant owned by Sundrop Farms that it uses to run a hydroponic greenhouse that provides Coles with tomatoes. Also on the horizon, and just as unique design-wise, is a proposal by Solastor, chaired by former Liberal party leader John Hewson. It promises new graphite-based technology to capture solar energy and store it in a load-shifting battery. Hewson says it will be a world-class project. “Solar thermal will take the market, there’s no doubt about that,” he says. Why are developers choosing the Upper Spencer Gulf? Investors say it has several things going for it: great sunshine; a history of electricity generation that left strong connections into the national grid; nearby industry – particularly mine developments – demanding reliable energy; strong facilitating support from the Weatherill Labor government that has continued under the new Liberal premier, Steven Marshall. Ross Garnaut is a former Labor climate policy adviser who is now the president of Zen Energy, a solar and battery firm that has projects in the region and is 51% owned by Gupta. “The Upper Spencer Gulf happens to be a very good place to start,” Garnaut says. “Some coal generation regions have good renewables and others don’t, and no others have them as good as Port Augusta. [But] the Port Augusta developments could be replicated in any region that has good solar and wind resources.” The inclusion of solar thermal is crucial as it means jobs on a semi-industrial scale. Wind and solar photovoltaic plants bring plenty of jobs in construction, but few in operation. Solar thermal has more in common in operation with coal, using steam to spin a turbine. SolarReserve expects to have a 50-strong permanent workforce at the Aurora plant. It is an important point. While enthusiasm about the new projects in the gulf is high, the shift away from coal has not been seamless – less a transition than a period of loss followed by rebirth. There remains significant disappointment, in some cases anger, about what some consider the unnecessary pain caused by a failure to plan for life after coal. Gary Rowbottom is a case in point. A mechanical technical officer at the town’s power stations for 17 years, he joined the Repower Port Augusta campaign in 2012 and became the public face of the campaign. He was persuaded that solar thermal was the future and hopeful Alinta would be persuaded to embrace the technology to replace coal. He says he was naive about how easy that would be. When the company announced Northern’s closure earlier than expected, he was 55 and left hunting for work. Fifty job applications and 11 interviews later, he was still looking. After about 18 months he left town to take a position on a coal plant in central Queensland. He now sees his wife, Debbie, only every couple of months. “It’s not been ideal,” he says. “I did my best to get a job that would have kept me home. I guess it was hurting me financially, watching my redundancy steadily getting eroded away, and I had a growing sense of failure. I worry that others are going through the same thing.” Rowbottom is buoyed by the developments under way at home, and hopeful the Aurora solar thermal plant will provide his ticket back. “It’s great it is happening. We just wish it could have happened a bit sooner,” he says. “What is hard for many of us to understand is why the closure couldn’t have been organised as a proper transition.” Johnson, who ran unsuccessfully for Xenophon’s SA Best party at the state election, says Port Augusta is set to be the renewable energy capital of the country, with more ongoing jobs if all proposed projects in the Upper Spencer Gulf go ahead than at the former coal plant. But he says both the former Labor state and current Coalition federal governments failed to offer the community the support it needed when the coal plant closed. The ramifications of the rapid closure were significant. Some small businesses and shut. Dirt and coal ash continue to blanket Port Augusta when the wind blows from the south-east because the former coal plant site was not properly rehabilitated. Wholesale electricity prices across the state increased more than they would have had more significant replacement generation been readied earlier. “I’d love for people to learn from what’s happened here [about] what not to do when you’re closing a power station,” Johnson says. * * * Whyalla seems to have fewer issues in the wake of Gupta’s arrival in July 2017. Seeing a business opportunity that governments and publicly listed companies did not, he promised to initially spend $1bn to double the steel mill’s production and convert it to a “green steel” model he has applied in other countries. This includes using more recycled steel and investing heavily in clean energy close to the plant. He is spending $700m building two farms of solar panels, a cogeneration plant to convert the waste gases from steel production into electricity, the country’s largest lithium-ion battery and up to three pumped hydro plants in disused mining pits in the Middlebank Ranges. He says more will follow. Both Gupta and Johnson say the message for the rest of the country is: embrace change. Gupta says: “Be braver. Be more entrepreneurial. Take risks … It is very difficult to change things in Australia. Everyone is too stuck in their ways.” Johnson says: “You can resist change as much as you like, but the reality is, if you’re in a community that has a coal-fired power station, its days are numbered. The market is dictating that change whether we like it or not. “My advice is: learn from the Port Augusta experience. I wish the federal government would.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2016/jun/17/solar-energy-fortune-500-apple-bloomberg-business","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-06-17T15:26:24Z","webTitle":"Businesses have seen the light with solar energy and it's finally paying off","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/jun/17/solar-energy-fortune-500-apple-bloomberg-business","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2016/jun/17/solar-energy-fortune-500-apple-bloomberg-business","fields":{"headline":"Businesses have seen the light with solar energy and it's finally paying off","bodyText":"A visit to a small hospital in northern Ghana changed Mahama Nyankamawu’s life forever. “It was dark, they had no electricity and the medicines they had had all gone bad,” recalled the 40-year-old, who went to the hospital after a car accident in 2014. The experience inspired Nyankamawu to create Volta, a company that builds solar power projects for health clinics, schools and farms across Ghana. Volta’s customers pay for 25% of the capital costs upfront, and the rest via monthly payments over two years. None of Nyankamawu’s customers have ever missed a payment, Nyankamawu said. “Our model works best when it’s a substitute for people who are already using diesel generators,” he added. “They’re saving up to 45% on their costs by switching to solar.” I met Nyankamawu at the Clean Energy Ministerial in San Francisco earlier this month, an annual gathering of energy leaders from 23 countries and the European Union. The meeting marked the first time the ministers met since more than 170 countries signed the Paris climate agreement to limit the global temperature rise to under 2C, a goal that won’t be met without strong domestic policies that give the businesses incentives to invest in a low-carbon future. I often hear criticisms that businesses, which account for most of the manmade emissions that are causing global warming, aren’t doing their part to keep the rising temperatures in check. Surveys and anecdotal evidence show that many corporate leaders don’t see their role in this global effort. But that’s not what I have seen. A growing number of companies are turning to renewable energy to reduce their carbon footprint. I am impressed with entrepreneurs like Nyankamawu and other business leaders who work on making renewable energy affordable and accessible. And they represent progress. Putting money in renewable energy, whether through power purchase agreements with big solar and wind farms in the US, or tiny household-sized solar projects in Africa, was a rarity even just five years ago. Many Fortune 500 companies recognize a direct connection between climate change and their financial wellbeing. Earlier this month, a half-dozen major companies, including TD Bank and Interface, joined RE100, a coalition of businesses that are switching to 100% renewable electricity. The shift has been especially strong in the US, where large corporate buyers contracted a record 3.2 gigawatts of renewable energy last year, nearly 20% of the 16.4 gigawatts of renewables added to the US electric grid overall. That means tens of thousands of workers rely on solar and wind power to do their jobs, and that number will only go up. One of the most impressive efforts I heard at the San Francisco meeting came from Lisa Jackson, who leads Apple’s environmental and social initiatives. Jackson talked about the company’s effort to use solar and wind energy to run its own global operations and the factories in China that make its iPhones and iPads, including a plan to bring online 2,000 megawatts of green energy there. The company would work with its suppliers there to build those projects. Some of the most compelling stories came from Africa. Home to the world’s fastest growing population, the continent is a key front in the Paris climate agreement’s quest. In Tanzania, Off-Grid Electric allows homes and small businesses to install solar systems and pay for them via mobile phone payments. Off-Grid says it’s currently installing more than 10,000 solar units every month in Tanzania and Rwanda, and recently raised $70m from San Francisco-based DBL Partners and other investors to help hire more staff and expand operations. More businesses will switch to renewable energy if they are able to finance it. We saw a record $329bn in global clean energy investment last year, but that falls short of the estimated $1tn that will be needed every year through 2050 to help achieve the 2C goal. A major emission producing country such as India, which aims to install 175 gigawatts of wind and solar power by 2022, will need an estimated $200bn to reach that milestone. The country attracted $10.9bn in clean energy investments last year, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. There is one group of investors who could help fill that gap, but they have yet to value renewable energy investments: institutional investors. They manage public pension, insurance and other funds that are worth trillions of dollars. These investors are dipping their toes in clean energy in US and Europe but remain on the sidelines in emerging markets, which they consider particularly risky. Michael Liebreich, founder of Bloomberg New Energy Finance, likened the challenge of fighting climate change to climbing Mount Everest: “We’ve just reached base camp.” No doubt, getting to the top of the mountain will require huge participation from the business community globally. The window of time to summit is now – and they’ll need to move quickly."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"technology/2018/jan/26/elon-musk-tesla-battery-boost-grows-tenfold","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-26T15:59:44Z","webTitle":"Tesla boss Elon Musk pursues his most unlikely goal yet: a $55bn bonus","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jan/26/elon-musk-tesla-battery-boost-grows-tenfold","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/jan/26/elon-musk-tesla-battery-boost-grows-tenfold","fields":{"headline":"Tesla boss Elon Musk pursues his most unlikely goal yet: a $55bn bonus","bodyText":"Racy valuations for loss-making businesses are nothing new to hard-nosed Wall Street types. The dotcom boom of the late 1990s and early 2000s made a fortune for the brave souls who backed a plethora of small start-ups that are now giants of the stock market, such as Apple, Amazon and Facebook. Plenty also lost their shirts with punts on the “next big thing”. Elon Musk knows more than most about this tricky game of risk and reward. The entrepreneur founded and sold software company Zip2 for $305m to Compaq; he also established online payment giant PayPal, which was sold to eBay for $1.5bn. Musk’s latest venture, Tesla, has again asked investors to get the crystal ball out and to imagine what the business – a pioneer in the growth markets of electric vehicles and renewable energy storage – might become. The naysayers believe Tesla’s current $60bn valuation (around the same as General Motors) is already wildly optimistic for what is essentially a loss-making luxury car manufacturer. Musk, however, who also has a rocket and space exploration venture, SpaceX, seems to believe that not even the sky is the limit. Even compared with the bullish financial modelling that has propelled Tesla to its current valuation, its new executive pay targets outlined last week look pretty ambitious. According to the package, Musk will continue to not take a salary but could ultimately earn $55bn in a series of stock option payments if Tesla can turbocharge its market valuation to a dizzying $650bn within 10 years. However, Musk noted: “If all that happens over the next 10 years is that Tesla’s value grows by 80% or 90%, then my amount of compensation would be zero.” Tesla, based in Palo Alto, California, has more than 33,000 employees worldwide and recently launched the Model 3 saloon, a more affordable “mass market” electric car that is key to its efforts to become profitable. Until now, Tesla has struggled to ramp up production of the car, so it is no surprise to see that the proposed bonus plan no longer includes vehicle output targets, which were included in previous compensation deals. Instead, Musk will be paid stock options in 12 tranches that vest over 10 years. To secure each tranche, Musk must hit a pair of milestones – one linked to Tesla’s market value, the other to revenue and profitability. Every tranche depends on Tesla’s market value increasing by $50bn. If he hits all 12 targets and increases Tesla’s valuation from $60bn to $650bn, plus revenue of $175bn and earnings of $14bn, Musk’s shares bonus could pay out the full $55bn. Christian Stadler, a professor of strategic management who researches the car industry at Warwick Business School, said: “It’s hugely ambitious. In terms of revenue, the targets are even more ambitious. At $175bn we are talking about 17 times what they had in revenue last year. Considering the biggest problem is on the operational side of the business, it makes it harder still to achieve than the market valuation.” Musk is certainly being asked to do a lot. Tesla’s last quarter saw it score just under $3bn of revenue, but make a net loss of $619m. At one point last year, the California-based company was burning through $8,000 every 60 seconds, according to Bloomberg. It also has a habit of missing its own production deadlines. This month, it pushed back production targets for the Model 3 for the second time. An even bigger concern than Tesla’s own stuttering performance is that the giants of the automotive world are stirring. VW, Ford, Toyota, GM and Nissan are preparing an assault on the electric vehicle market that will see them pour billions into developing a new range of “greener” cars to replace petrol- and diesel-powered models over the next few years. “It seems astronomic at the moment – $650bn within 10 years. I don’t think so,” Stadler said. “The fact that you have everyone else piling into this makes it much harder. The others also already have the ability to scale it. To get to that valuation, Tesla would have to be absolutely dominant in electric vehicles.” To put it in context, only three companies had a market value of more than $650bn at the end of 2017: Apple, Microsoft and Alphabet (Google’s parent). GM’s market capitalisation is $61.5bn and Ford is worth $41bn. Even those that have been bullish on Tesla shares express some doubts about the incentive package and stretching valuation targets. Adam Jonas, analyst at Morgan Stanley, said: “We see Elon Musk’s ambitious long-term awards plan as an aspirational marketing tool to attract talent and capital ahead of an upward inflection in competition.” Tesla’s ambitious target implies the shares will rise by about 27% a year, a feat achieved by just a handful of large American companies in recent years, including Amazon, Priceline Group (the owner of Booking.com) and Domino’s Pizza. Stadler believes propelling Tesla into this gilded group of success stories could be the key motivating factor for Musk – far more than any promised riches. Musk is already the biggest shareholder in Tesla and has an estimated net worth of $20bn, according to Forbes. So it would be difficult for the board to incentivise him by dangling an even bigger carrot. “Musk is happy to have something that makes him potentially no money because he is already wealthy. The one thing that might motivate him is that the valuation target is roughly reflective of what Amazon did, so it might motivate him to want to do better than Jeff Bezos did,” Stadler said. “However, it’s a different industry [to Amazon]. Tesla is trying to be strong in a space that is already strong.” The true believers reckon those who see Tesla as just another carmaker are missing the point. At the moment, the solar energy storage part of Tesla accounts for just 1% of its business. But it has plans to “expand solar energy generation through Solar Roof and other solar products, and seamlessly integrate them with battery storage” and to “build out Tesla’s vehicle product line to cover all major forms of terrestrial transport”. Stadler added: “Musk does see Tesla as a ‘vertically integrated sustainable energy company’, so it wouldn’t be surprising if he views that as the growth part.” If Musk is right, Tesla may just confound its critics: and drive its charismatic leader to unimaginable riches."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2017/jan/16/geothermal-cooling-cycle-paths-and-jobs-what-does-it-take-to-get-six-green-stars","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-01-16T02:35:57Z","webTitle":"Geothermal cooling, cycle paths and jobs: what does it take to get six green stars?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/jan/16/geothermal-cooling-cycle-paths-and-jobs-what-does-it-take-to-get-six-green-stars","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2017/jan/16/geothermal-cooling-cycle-paths-and-jobs-what-does-it-take-to-get-six-green-stars","fields":{"headline":"Geothermal cooling, cycle paths and jobs: what does it take to get six green stars?","bodyText":"With murder rates double, and robbery rates three times, the state average, the Sydney suburb of Blacktown is not an obvious choice as a world leader of sustainable living. But, in 2016, a new master-planned estate in the suburb became the first residential community in New South Wales to be awarded a top, six-star Green Star community rating by the Green Building Council of Australia (GBCA). Not only that, Fairwater, developed by Frasers Property, is the largest geothermal community in the southern hemisphere. Houses are cooled or heated by a refrigerant that pumps air underground then back to the surface, using less power than air-conditioning or heating and saving residents of a three-bedroom house $500 to $600 a year. “There’s this avenue of mature trees with this massive lake and lovely terrace houses – yoga by the lake, cycling paths, all these people walking,” says the GBCA chief executive, Romilly Madew. “If I said ‘Blacktown’ that’s not the image that would have come to your mind. It’s all about healthy and active living.” Green-star buildings produce, on average, 62% fewer greenhouse gas emissions and use 51% less potable water and 66% less electricity than average buildings in Australia, according to GBCA’s 2013 report The Value of the Green Star. Since launching in 2003, hundreds of buildings around the country have been certified for the rating system and 120,000 people are now moving into Green Star communities. Out of 46 registered Green Star communities projects, 26 are already certified. Yet only 16 so far have attained the gold standard of six stars. So how do communities achieve the accolade? The key is looking at the project holistically, says Madew. “It’s about going back to that old adage of community: people, walkability, liveability, places for the kids to play. [We want to] change the way people think about how they live.” Developers, ultimately, “are there to sell house and land packages – so they’re not going to be successful unless they’re building something people want to buy. Take ‘sustainability’ out and ask what [buyers] want. They want something close to amenities – schools, public transport, shops and parks. And a home that is cheap to run.” Jessica Stewart, sustainability manager at Ginninderry, which is located in the ACT and is the latest community to achieve a six-star rating in September last year, has seen a significant shift in sustainable thinking. “Creating a sustainable community is about creating behavioural change just as much as it’s about using the right materials, designing better roadways etc. A community is only as good as the people who live there.” Straddling the Murrumbidgee River and Ginninderra Creek, Ginninderry is leading the way in water sensitive urban design, using a network of wetlands, basins and bioretention swales to “capture, cleanse, recycle and infiltrate” water on site. Meanwhile solar panels on all houses in the community, jointly developed by the ACT government and Riverview Developments, are mandatory; a third of the site is reserved as a conservation corridor; and Spark, a social initiative project, will provide local employment opportunities (contractors on site, for example, must hire a certain number of residents from the area). Five elements are assessed to achieve a six-star rating: governance, liveability, economic prosperity, environment, and innovation. Within these, innovation, as Fairwater and Ginninderry have demonstrated, is critical. Fairwater’s geothermal technology was an industry first. But developers also made sure that it was used to create jobs, partnering with Australian companies QPS Geothermal and Actron Air to design, manufacture and install components using largely local labour. Fairwater is not alone. Last year Lendlease and LandCorp’s Alkimos, a 710-hectare master-planned community in Perth, which is due to deliver 2,000 homes for 6,000 residents, became the first in the country to receive a six-star rating. Crucial is a $6.9m residential battery storage trial, in which more than 100 homes will be connected to a 1.1MWh solar energy storage system, lowering demand from the grid. Open space is measured, as is access to public transport and employment opportunities. Alkimos, when completed, will have 3.6ha of playing fields, 6ha of conservation reserves and 41ha of foreshore reserves. Each home will be located within 800m of transport links and 200m from a park. Compulsory solar panels, meanwhile, are expected to reduce energy bills by up to 50%. Despite this, “community initiatives are just as important as the physical ones”, says Lendlease’s managing director of communities, Matthew Wallace. One example is the Sprout Hub, a social enterprise café-cum-co-working space, designed to encourage new local businesses. In Fairwater, meanwhile, residents can use the free Live Life Get Active fitness camp (offering classes and nutrition plans), as well as the multitude of cycling paths and walking trails. Developers see such community enterprises as a point of difference that will attract buyers. “More people are taking a greater interest in living a sustainable lifestyle,” says Paolo Bevilacqua, the general manager of sustainability at Frasers Property Australia. “So there are marketing advantages.” There are challenges, however, too – not least due to the sheer size and vast time scales of these communities. Ginninderry, for one, plans to deliver 11,500 new homes by 2055. “What will car use look like in 40 years?” asks Stewart. “What do people do as work, how do they live, how do they interact together? All those things can change.” In order to avoid complacency – and to make sure that promises are delivered – projects must re-certify every five years. Most important in achieving a six-star rating is starting the process in the planning phase, ensuring that everyone from stakeholders to construction firms know what is required. As Bevilacqua says, “It cannot be an afterthought.”"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"us-news/2017/mar/01/solar-panel-home-installation-energy-environment-explainer","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-01T10:00:05Z","webTitle":"How to install solar panels at home – to save the Earth and your bank account","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/01/solar-panel-home-installation-energy-environment-explainer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/mar/01/solar-panel-home-installation-energy-environment-explainer","fields":{"headline":"How to install solar panels at home – to save the Earth and your bank account","bodyText":"Installing solar panels on the roof of your home is a big project – but it can pay dividends in more ways than one. There’s the obvious environmental benefit, but for many homeowners, the joy comes with a dollar sign attached. Turning your home into a mini power plant can save you good money on the electric bill. Here is a guide to get you started. An average, 5-kilowatt system will cost about $15,000 to $20,000, depending on where you live in the US. So it pays to find out if your state or utility offers rebates or other incentives to help lower the cost of going solar. Here is a sure bet: the federal government offers a 30% tax credit (though it’s set to decline starting in 2020). You can start your research with this federally funded, comprehensive database that lists all sorts of incentives and policies for renewable energy by state. If that seems daunting, then begin your homework by contacting the state agency that regulates utilities. Some states with strong policies to promote solar energy use, such as California, New York and Massachusetts, have created their own websites listing incentives, financing options and tips for hiring a contractor to install the solar panels. Your utility might offer a similar helpful guide. As with any major home improvement project, finding a good contractor is crucial. A trustworthy installer will secure the necessary permits, properly connect the solar energy system to your home and the local electric grid, and apply for incentives for you. Some states – or local utilities – post a list of certified solar service companies. Many consumers ask friends and neighbors for recommendations. Googling works just as well. Regardless of the approach, you should always get several quotes and chat with the installers to find a good match. Another big decision is how to pay for the equipment and services. You can pay for them outright, of course. A solar energy system lasts about 20 years, so paying for it upfront will be a cheaper option over time than to lease it. As an owner, you get a bonus incentive if you live in a state that allows you to sell excess solar electricity to your utility. The money you earn will show up as a credit on your bill. Another popular option is to leave the ownership and maintenance of the solar panels to your installer (and its investors) and pay only for the electricity produced from the rooftop system. This arrangement is done through what’s commonly called a power purchase agreement, which can last 15 years or more. Your solar company typically sweetens the deal by charging you a lower electric rate than your utility would. Be sure to read the contract to see how your installer sets the electric rates over time. Those rates are likely to change. The solar energy market is growing because the average price for solar energy systems has fallen so much – 54% between 2010 and 2016, according to GTM Research. While your solar panels may not produce all the electricity you need, they are becoming a good investment to lower your bill."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
