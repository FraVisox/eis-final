Prominent backbencher Barnaby Joyce followed up with a call for a parliamentary inquiry. Joyce and Barilaro revived this idea after the release of a report by Industry Super Australia, which took as the starting point the need to replace most of Australia’s coal-fired power stations by 2040. The report concluded: “It is difficult to see how the the problem can be resolved without some nuclear in the mix.” It would perhaps be churlish to observe that the small reactors advocated by Barilaro exist only as designs and may never be built. There is a much bigger obstacle which is essentially impossible to overcome. To make the central point as bluntly as possible: even with a crash program there is no chance of deploying nuclear power in Australia in the required timeframe. I looked at this question in a submission to the South Australian royal commission into the nuclear fuel cycle and concluded that “there is no serious prospect of Australia producing nuclear energy before 2040”. That was in 2015, and the news for nuclear power since then has all been bad. All of the nuclear power plant construction projects under way in the developed world have experienced substantial delays (the VC Summer plant in the US has been cancelled with a loss of billions of dollars). Most of these projects (Flamanville in France, Olkiluoto in Finland and Vogtle in Georgia) received their initial approval around 2005, and none is now likely to start before 2020. So, to be sure of getting nuclear power going by 2040, we’d need to have projects in their initial stages before 2025, in the term of the next parliament. To see how absurd this is, consider some of the steps that will be needed before a project could begin. First, both major parties need to be convinced of the case for nuclear power. That’s highly unlikely but let’s suppose it can somehow be done by 2020. Next, the current ban on nuclear power needs to be repealed. This ban looms large in the minds of nuclear advocates but actually it’s such a minor problem we can ignore it. The first big problem is the need to set up, from scratch, a legislative and regulatory framework for nuclear power. That would require adapting an overseas model such as that of the US, where the nuclear industry is regulated by at least eight different acts, covering more than 500 pages. Back in the 1970s the French government could do this kind of thing by fiat, without parliamentary debate, but that’s not a feasible option for Australia. Having passed the necessary legislation, the next task would be to establish and staff a regulator similar to the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission or the UK Office for Nuclear Regulation. The only Australian body with any relevant expertise is the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation which operates a 20 megawatt (research reactor at Lucas Heights. Ansto has little or no capacity to deal with the problem of licensing and regulating commercial reactors of 1,000MW. Even with a massive effort, and assuming no political obstacles, it’s hard to see these tasks being accomplished within five years, which would already take us to 2025. But there are many more remaining difficulties. Most obviously, as the Industry Super report states, we would need a carbon price or a market mechanism with similar effects, such as an emissions trading scheme. On any realistic political analysis, that’s impossible – the overlap between supporters of nuclear power and advocates of carbon pricing in Australia is virtually zero. At a minimum, the adoption of a carbon price would require a change of government at the next election, which may happen though it doesn’t seem likely at the moment. Even if it would occur (and assuming, improbably, that a Labor government relying on Green support could be persuaded to back nuclear power), there would be further delays before the carbon price could be put in place. But that’s just the beginning. Before any project could be considered, it would be necessary to license designs that could be built and operated here. The processes of the NRC in the US, which were expedited in the hope of spurring a “nuclear renaissance” typically take three to four years. We could simply accept the judgement of overseas regulators, but even then we would have a problem – there may be no designs available. In my submission to the SA royal commission, I argued that the only serious contender for Australia was the Westinghouse AP1000. Since then, however, cost overruns and cancellation have sent Westinghouse bankrupt, almost taking its owner, Toshiba, with it. There is no serious prospect of any more plants of this design being built. Areva, which is building its EPR model in Europe, is in similar difficulty. There’s a serious risk that the only contenders would be Chinese or Russian designs, which would pose some obvious problems. The most difficult step would be the need to identify greenfield sites for multiple nuclear power plants, almost certainly on the east coast, and go through the relevant environmental processes. Reliance on overseas models won’t be of much use here. All the plants under construction in western countries are “brownfield”, that is, situated next to existing plants, built last century, and approved as far back as the 1970s. In summary, it would be a heroic endeavour to get construction started on a nuclear plant even by 2030. Getting it finished and generating electricity by 2040 is virtually impossible. Fortunately, there are alternatives, though the Industry Super report dismisses them. The combination of solar photovoltaics and battery storage is already cheaper than new coal-fired power. As a backup, Australia has huge potential for storage using pumped hydroelectricity. We don’t need to call on the phantom of nuclear power to secure a reliable, carbon-free electricity supply for the future. • John Quiggin is professor of economics at the University of Queensland"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"careers/2020/jul/07/mentoring-job-ads-flexible-working-making-civil-engineering-more-appealing-to-women","type":"article","sectionId":"careers","sectionName":"Guardian Careers","webPublicationDate":"2020-07-07T10:57:23Z","webTitle":"Mentoring, job ads, flexible working: making civil engineering more appealing to women","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2020/jul/07/mentoring-job-ads-flexible-working-making-civil-engineering-more-appealing-to-women","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/careers/2020/jul/07/mentoring-job-ads-flexible-working-making-civil-engineering-more-appealing-to-women","fields":{"headline":"Mentoring, job ads, flexible working: making civil engineering more appealing to women","bodyText":"There are around 83,000 civil engineers in the UK, according to government figures, yet only 12% of them are women. The good news is that the number of women studying civil engineering had increased from 13.5% to 20% in the 10 years between 2007 and 2017, according to a study by Ucas. Penny Marshall, North East regional director at the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE), says while considerable progress has been made over the last decade, it’s disappointing this has not yet delivered a step change in the number of women coming into the profession. “The zero-carbon imperative and the need to adapt to cope with the changing climate will provide many more opportunities over the next decade, and I hope will entice more women to join our ranks,” she says. Faye Bowser, head of energy performance and service at Siemens says the sustainability factor makes civil engineering more appealing to women. “I have worked across the energy industry for over 16 years and I am left with one overriding impression: sustainability attracts women.” Bowser puts this down to the fact the roots of the industry lie in centralised state owned coal, gas and nuclear power, all historically male-dominated industries, whereas the energy sector is fresh, innovative and inspiring. Bowser, for example, was attracted by the role she could play in helping to tackle the climate crisis. “The modern energy industry is driven by wind, solar, batteries, multinational companies, constant innovation and intense competition,” she says. “The energy system is brilliantly transforming, and it creates a need to transform our workforce, set aside stereotypes and tap into the value of diversity in thought.” Fiona Tiley, head of design, North West and Scotland, at Network Rail, says that 19% of the train operator’s engineering team are women but they do have an issue attracting women to work for them. They are currently in the process of revamping their job adverts to try and make them more appealing to women and minority groups by using more diverse imagery and interview panels, says Tiley. “As a longer-term strategy we are focusing on our staff engaging in Stem activities and mentoring to attract young people both at primary and secondary school to engineering, irrespective of gender or ethnicity,” she says. Yvonne Murphy, chair of ICE Wales Cymru, says the UK should be looking to learn from other countries across Europe. “Around 50% of engineers are female in eastern Europe,” she says. Murphy believes engineers have something of an image problem and a number of confusing stereotypes. “On TV kids see scientists in lab coats, policemen and women in uniform, doctors, nurses, firefighters and teachers but rarely engineers,” she says. “Plumbers, electricians and lift maintenance operators, are called engineers, which makes it a bit more challenging for those of us who are practising civil engineers to explain to kids and/or prospective engineers of the future where they might fit in.” Civil engineering, like any other sector, should reflect the society it serves, says Murphy. “We design civilian infrastructure that must be useful and accessible to all – rich, poor, race, culture, language, religion, gender, special needs, elderly, children etc.” Bowser believes organisations such as Siemens are slowly shaking off the “jobs for the boys” perception of the industry. “There are challenges across the board, which we refer to as the ‘leaky pipeline’,” she says. “Each stage of the pipeline has its own complexities, which is why Siemens has a range of initiatives. For example, unconscious bias training is mandatory for all managers and we offer a number of development programmes targeting women in leadership roles.” Fiona Moore, divisional business manager at Land and Water, which has almost a 50:50 ratio of men and women on its operational board, says she believes the engineering sector is “admirably inclusive”. “I think gender is irrelevant. When it comes down to finding a position, what’s most important – for both men and women – is finding a company which suits you,” Moore says. Her firm doesn’t specifically target women but tries to incorporate women at all stages of their careers. “Our teams are filled with exceptional women and we are always prepared to upskill staff and move people within the business to trial different roles, no one is limited,” Moore notes. The irony is, Tiley says, that civil engineering is actually a brilliant career for women. “Many engineering firms, including Network Rail, promote a flexible working culture and offer family-friendly policies. Throughout my career, I have always been either the only woman, or one of two or three but I have never seen it as a disadvantage and have always been treated equally to my peers.”"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"environment/2020/mar/10/we-always-get-a-fukushima-strives-to-prove-local-food-safe-before-tokyo-games","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2020-03-10T13:33:08Z","webTitle":"'We always get an A': Fukushima strives to prove food safety before Tokyo Games","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/10/we-always-get-a-fukushima-strives-to-prove-local-food-safe-before-tokyo-games","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2020/mar/10/we-always-get-a-fukushima-strives-to-prove-local-food-safe-before-tokyo-games","fields":{"headline":"'We always get an A': Fukushima strives to prove food safety before Tokyo Games","bodyText":"Knives are wielded in silence as chunks of meat are sliced up and placed in containers, the reputation of an entire region resting on every step of the process being completed without a hitch. Staff at the Fukushima Agricultural Technology Centre are dissecting samples of beef neck; on other days it could be batches of cucumbers and peaches, or fish from the nearby Pacific Ocean. In an adjacent room, the containers are placed inside machines to be tested for the radionuclides caesium-134 and caesium-137. Every sample shows radiation levels well within national safety standards. These daily rituals are central to a testing regime that officials in Fukushima prefecture say proves that the region’s produce is safe to eat, nine years after the nearby Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant suffered meltdowns in three of its reactors, all but destroying the local brand. “The image of Fukushima produce took a hit after the March 11 disaster, and some of that reputational damage is still there,” says Hideaki Suzuki, an official in the prefectural government’s agriculture, forestry and fisheries department. “Some people have a certain fixed image, so it is up to us to provide them with accurate information.” As Japan prepares to mark the anniversary of the triple disaster – in which a magnitude-9 earthquake caused a tsunami that killed more than 18,000 people and triggered the nuclear plant crisis – producers are preparing to demonstrate their recovery on the biggest stage in world sport: the Olympics. Organisers have dismissed speculation that the coronavirus outbreak would force them to cancel the Games, but there is lingering concern about food safety. An organising committee official confirmed this week that produce from areas affected by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, including Fukushima, would be served at the athletes’ village, but that specific menus and catering plans had yet to be finalised. The agricultural centre tests as many as 200 samples of different foods a day, according to Kenji Kusano, the director general of the agricultural safety promotion department at the Fukushima prefectural government. “Experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency come every year to check our work,” Kusano tells the Guardian during a tour of the facility. “We always receive an A grade.” The Fukushima prefectural government says that, post-disaster, its food safety standards are among the most stringent in the world. The government-set upper limit for radioactive caesium in ordinary foodstuffs, such as meat and vegetables, is 100 becquerels per kilogram, compared with 1,250Bq/kg in the European Union and 1,200Bq/kg in the US. Between April 2018 and March 2019, the prefecture tested more than 9m samples of local unpolished rice. Not a single sample exceeded the safety standard. Thousands of samples of fruit and vegetables, seafood and meat yielded similar results. But those reassurances have failed to convince sports authorities in South Korea, who have voiced concerns that food served at the athletes’ village could contain “contaminated” Fukushima produce. The Korean Sport and Olympic Committee has said it will take its own non-perishable food to Tokyo 2020 and carry out radiation checks on meat and vegetables that can only be sourced locally due to stringent quarantine regulations. Alternatively, when the committee finalises its plan next month, it could ask Japan’s government to relax quarantine rules on fresh South Korean produce during the Games. “For this Olympic Games, food is our team’s main focus, so athletes can be provided with safe meals and not have any radiation worries,” Shin Dong-keun, a member of South Korea’s parliamentary sports committee, told Reuters in December. That level of caution, coinciding with a rise in political tensions between the two countries, irritates cattle farmers near Fukushima Daiichi who, having been told to destroy their animals after the disaster, are now selling meat again. “No meat goes to market without being tested,” says Fumiya Koga, a prefectural government agriculture official. “If we didn’t do that, and meat was found to be above the limit, it would do serious damage to Fukushima’s reputation. In the nine years since the disaster, not one beef sample has exceeded the safety standard.” Other agricultural sectors have mounted a similar recovery. Shipments of anpokaki (dried persimmons) – a popular, if pricey, winter delicacy – were banned for two years after the disaster, recalls Takeshi Haga, the director of anpokaki promotion at the Fukushima Mirai agricultural cooperative. “Radiation fears really affected us at first,” he says. While local farmers struggled to counter harmful rumours swirling around Fukushima produce, Haga and his colleagues quickly set up their own testing regime, imposing an upper limit of 50Bq/kg of fruit, half the maximum permitted by the government. “We test every single persimmon, even now,” says Haga. Each one is packed and given a quality control sticker showing its radiation reading, before being sold in north-east Japan, and the Tokyo and Osaka areas. “Some local sellers ask us if it’s really still necessary to have stickers on each fruit nine years on from the disaster,” he adds. “But we think it’s best to keep reassuring consumers that our fruit is 100% safe, even if it means creating extra work.” As they prepare to promote their region’s food to visiting athletes and spectators, officials are encouraged by the shrinking list of countries that continue to ban or limit imports of Fukushima produce. Initially, more than 50 countries and regions refused to import items from Fukushima, but the number has since fallen to about 20, with Singapore recently joining countries such as the US and Australia in lifting or easing import bans. China, however, has kept its ban in place, while South Korea continues to prohibit seafood imports. Noboru Tamogami, a 77-year-old cattle farmer in Koriyama, more than 50 miles west of the ruined nuclear power plant, believes concerns over food safety are misplaced. “I’ve been a farmer for 30 years and I’m so confident that my beef is safe that I give it to my own grandchildren,” he says. “None of us is the slightest bit worried.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"careers/2020/jul/24/we-have-a-valuable-contribution-to-make-the-women-returning-to-engineering","type":"article","sectionId":"careers","sectionName":"Guardian Careers","webPublicationDate":"2020-07-24T13:14:14Z","webTitle":"women returning to engineering career break","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2020/jul/24/we-have-a-valuable-contribution-to-make-the-women-returning-to-engineering","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/careers/2020/jul/24/we-have-a-valuable-contribution-to-make-the-women-returning-to-engineering","fields":{"headline":"‘We have a valuable contribution to make’: the women returning to engineering","bodyText":"With the UK needing an estimated 124,000 new engineers and technicians a year to meet a shortfall in skilled labour, the sector can no longer afford to ignore the huge pool of talent made up of women looking to restart their careers. Yet according to The Hidden Workforce [pdf], a new report from the organisation STEM Returners, 63% of engineers returning to the sector believe the biggest barrier to restarting a career is bias in the recruitment process. The report, which is based on the experiences of 350 returners, found that there was a perception among recruiters that a CV gap automatically means a deterioration of skills. As a result, these CVs are filtered out and seldom make it through companies’ standard recruitment channels, feeding into unconscious bias at the shortlist stage. “The report shows that women face almost insurmountable barriers to return to engineering and I think the sector would be incredibly disappointed in this unintentional fact,” says STEM Returners director Natalie Desty. “The industry’s view of women returners is positive, it needs them and recognises the skills and experience that they have to offer,” she says. “The issue is a broken recruitment system which biases against people returning from a career break, who in the main are women.” STEM Returners was launched in 2017 and has helped more than 150 engineers get back to work, 46% of them women like Maria Holloway-Strong, who put her career on hold to start a family, but never envisaged it would be 17 years before she was in the jobs market again. “I didn’t seriously think I would be able to get back into the industry,” she says, but heard through STEM Returners that her former employer, Atkins, was holding an open day for geotechnical engineers. Despite being concerned that her skills were rusty and out-of-date, she went along and discovered that the sector had changed culturally from her experience 20 years earlier. “I feel it’s a much kinder industry now,” she says. “There’s much more acceptance of diversity and inclusion (and) much more knowledge of work-life balance. “There seems to be a buy-in to the idea that having a diverse team improves the product – and I think the STEM Returners programme feeds into that.” Natalie Ryott also cut short a career as a weapons engineer with the RAF to start a family. “I did fear that when I left the RAF that could be the end of my career in engineering,” she says. “I applied for a few jobs, and they all seemed quite excited by my experience, but then I never heard anything back.” Ryott says she puts this down to a reluctance on the employer’s part to invest in retraining her for a different role. Eventually, with the help of STEM Returners she found a new role as a mechanical engineer for BAE in maritime services. Domestic violence forced Renee Bose to give up her career as an environmental scientist. To make ends meet she took various administration jobs, and worked for an organisation that helps survivors of violence, before deciding to kickstart her engineering career again. “Because I had a career break, and had also carried on a career outside of engineering, it was extremely difficult to find employment,” she says. It was because of this that she decided to go back to university to complete a degree in nuclear waste management. She then heard that Cavendish Nuclear was running a Stem Returners programme, and although low on confidence, she decided to attend. Impressed with her skills, the company offered her a position and she now works as a project assistant, helping to service EDF’s nuclear power stations. “I never thought that I’d be able to get back into it. I thought I’d have to give up,” she says. “Don’t lose hope, because there are ways to get back into work.” Emma Lyon, head of learning and talent development at Cavendish Nuclear, explains: “We recognise that returners often face almost insurmountable barriers to returning to work after a career break, be that because of unconscious bias, a lack of flexibility or flaws in the recruitment process.” To combat this, Cavendish Nuclear embraced STEM Returners, and, says Lyon, “found some incredibly talented individuals who were simply unable to navigate their way through the more traditional recruitment routes”. But sometimes, says Holloway, finding a job is only half the battle, and companies could do more to help ease people back into the workplace after a break. “You can feel a little bit like a square peg in a round hole,” she says. More peer-to-peer support and mentoring would be useful, she says. “I think that’s a really powerful way of supporting people when they are returning to work.” Holloway also believes that managers and other staff would benefit from training too, with more comprehensive advice on how to interact with someone who is restarting their career. “There are people like me out there, lurking, who do have skills and do have a valuable contribution to make, but we’re a bit of an untapped resource,” she says."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"world/live/2022/apr/13/russia-ukraine-war-latest-biden-accuses-putin-of-genocide-russia-building-up-troops-on-eastern-border-satellite-images-show-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-14T05:07:07Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: Zelenskiy pleads for weapons to avoid ‘bloodbath’; Ukraine says east of country braced for attack – live","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/apr/13/russia-ukraine-war-latest-biden-accuses-putin-of-genocide-russia-building-up-troops-on-eastern-border-satellite-images-show-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/apr/13/russia-ukraine-war-latest-biden-accuses-putin-of-genocide-russia-building-up-troops-on-eastern-border-satellite-images-show-live","fields":{"headline":" International Criminal Court chief prosecutor says ‘Ukraine is a crime scene’ after visiting Bucha – as it happened ","bodyText":"This liveblog is now closing. Please follow all the latest developments on the war in Ukraine by reading our latest coverage in the link below. It is approaching 8am in Ukraine as the country wakes to face its 50th day of war. Here is where the situation currently stands: The Russian defence ministry has said the entire crew of the warship Moskva, reported to be struck by Ukraine in the Black Sea late on Wednesday, has been evacuated after an ammunition explosion resulted in a fire on the ship. “The cruiser Moskva of the Black Sea Fleet was seriously damaged as a result of the detonation of ammunition that occurred as a result of a fire, the crew was evacuated,” Russian state media outlet TASS reported, citing the Russian defence ministry. The ship was defied by Ukrainian troops on Snake Island at the start of the war. A Ukrainian official earlier said the Moskva had been hit by two missiles but did not give any evidence. The 12,500-tonne ship has a crew of about 500. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy called for an oil embargo in his nightly address on Wednesday. “First of all, we need an oil embargo. And Europe’s clear readiness to give up all Russian energy. The European Union must stop sponsoring Russia’s military machine.” Zelenskiy confirmed forensic experts from the international criminal court visited Bucha on Wednesday to investigate possible war crimes. “Responsibility for the Russian military for war crimes is inevitable. We will drag them all to the tribunal. And not only for what was done in Bucha.” International Criminal Court chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, told reporters “Ukraine is a crime scene” after visiting Bucha on Wednesday. US president Joe Biden announced an additional $800m in military assistance to Ukraine including heavy artillery ahead of a wider Russian assault expected in eastern Ukraine. The package, which brings the total military aid since Russian forces invaded in February to more than $2.5bn, includes artillery systems, artillery rounds, armoured personnel carriers and unmanned coastal defence boats, Biden said in a statement after a phone call with Zelenskiy. The US state department on Wednesday defended Biden’s charge that Russia is carrying out a genocide in Ukraine, saying its forces are trying to destroy the country and its civilian population. Biden levelled the accusation at president Vladimir Putin’s forces for the first time on Tuesday, saying it had “become clearer and clearer that Putin is just trying to wipe out the idea of even being able to be a Ukrainian”. US state department official, Victoria Nuland, told CNN: “I am going to predict that what president Biden called it is what we will ultimately likely find when we are able to gather all of this evidence. Because what is happening on the ground is not an accident.” The French president, Emmanuel Macron, declined to repeat Biden’s accusation that Russia was carrying out “genocide” against Ukrainians, warning that verbal escalations would not help end the war. Zelenskiy responded: “Such things are very painful for us, so I will definitely do my best to discuss this issue with him.” More than 1,000 Ukrainian marines defending the besieged port city of Mariupol have surrendered, Moscow has claimed. In one of the most critical battles of the war, Russia’s defence ministry said on Wednesday that 1,026 soldiers from Ukraine’s 36th Marine Brigade, including 162 officers, had “voluntarily laid down their arms” near the city’s Ilyich iron and steelworks. There was no independent confirmation of the claim. The Russian retreat from around Kyiv has led to the discovery of large numbers of apparently massacred civilians, drawing international condemnation and calls for a war crimes investigation. The Kyiv district police chief said the bodies of 765 civilians, including 30 children had been found around the capital. Negotiations are reportedly underway on the exchange of 169 servicemen of the National Guard of Ukraine who were taken prisoner at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, Ukraine’s minister of internal affairs said. The presidents of four countries bordering Russia – Poland, Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia – travelled to Kyiv in a show of support for their Ukrainian counterpart and his embattled troops. It follows Kyiv’s reported refusal to meet the German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who visited Poland on Tuesday and said he had planned to go on to Ukraine but “was not wanted”. Senior US officials are weighing whether to send a top Cabinet level official to Kyiv as a high profile representative in a show of solidarity with Ukraine, a source familiar with the situation said on Wednesday. Zelenskiy told Estonian MPs, without providing evidence, that Russia was using phosphorus bombs in Ukraine. Ukrainian forces in Mariupol said a drone had dropped a poisonous substance on the city, but there has been no independent confirmation that Russia used banned chemical weapons. Zelenskiy also warned that the war will become an “endless bloodbath, spreading misery, suffering, and destruction” without additional weaponry. In a speech at the Atlantic Council on Wednesday, US treasury secretary Janet Yellen said that countries on the fence of Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine could face global isolation. “The unified coalition of sanctioning countries will not be indifferent to actions that undermine the sanctions we’ve put in place.” Finland’s prime minister, Sanna Marin, said the country would decide on whether to apply for Nato membership “within weeks”. Speaking at a joint news conference with her Swedish counterpart, Marin said that as a Nato partner – but not a member – Finland was not covered under article 5, which states that an attack on one member should be considered an attack on all. The UK government has imposed sanctions on another 206 individuals, including 178 people it said were involved in propping up the self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk. Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, said the latest sanctions were imposed in a direct response to the “horrific rocket attacks” on a train station in Kramatorsk, eastern Ukraine, that killed dozens of civilians. Australia has also imposed targeted financial sanctions on 14 Russian state-owned enterprises on Thursday, including defence-related entities such as truckmaker Kamaz, and shipping companies SEVMASH and United Shipbuilding Corp. A Russian court ordered an artist to be held behind bars for allegedly replacing supermarket price labels with messages protesting against Moscow’s military campaign in Ukraine. Russia is imposing sanctions on 398 US House representatives and 87 Canadiana senators, Interfax news agency reported. The European Space Agency said is has ended cooperation with Russia on three missions to the Moon due to Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, following a previous decision to do the same for a Mars mission. Russia will seek peace or leave the international arena forever, Zelenskiy said in his latest national address. “Either the Russian leadership will really seek peace, or as a result of this war, Russia will leave the international arena forever.” UN chief, Antonio Guterres, said that a ceasefire in Ukraine “doesn’t seem possible,” possibly indicating that the UN is still waiting on a response from Russia on evacuating Ukrainian civilians and providing aid. Russia is attempting to mobilise up to 70,000 people in the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic in eastern Ukraine, the Ukrainian military claims. It has been established that the Russian command has assigned the task of mobilising 60-70,000 people in the territory of the so-called ‘DPR’,” the general staff of the armed forces said in its latest morning operational report, adding that the specified figures were completed “by only 20%”. Russian forces continue to expand units near the eastern border and restore and replenish ammunition, officials added. Ukrainian troops thwarted eight Russian attacks over the past 24 hours in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, the report read. The European Space Agency said is has ended cooperation with Russia on three missions to the Moon due to Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, following a previous decision to do the same for a Mars mission. The ESA said it would “discontinue cooperative activities” on Luna-25, 26 and 27, a series of Russian lunar missions on which the European agency had aimed to test new equipment and technology. In late March, collaboration on ExoMars, a plan to land a rover on Mars to drill into the soil and search for signs of life, was suspended as well. “As with ExoMars, the Russian aggression against Ukraine and the resulting sanctions put in place represent a fundamental change of circumstances and make it impossible for ESA to implement the planned lunar cooperation,” the ESA said in a statement. The ESA had planned to have a navigation camera called Pilot-D on the Luna-25 probe, whose launch is scheduled for this summer. ESA Director-General Josef Aschbacher told a press briefing the camera was going to be dismantled and taken off the launch, and that Russia’s space agency, Roscosmos, had already been informed. Fiji police are questioning the captain of a luxury vessel owned by a Russian oligarch that arrived in the Pacific islands nation on Tuesday without customs clearance, Reuters reports. Fiji newspapers reported on Thursday that police had seized the superyacht Amadea, owned by a Russian billionaire, Suleiman Kerimov, who has been sanctioned by the United States, Britain and the European Union over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and detained its crew. An official at the National Police Command and Control Centre confirmed to Reuters the captain of the vessel was being questioned on how it came to Fiji without customs clearance. Russian President Vladimir Putin, lawmakers and businessmen have faced wide-reaching sanctions in the wake of the invasion, which Moscow calls a special military operation, while European countries have seized property including villas and boats. Commissioner of Police, Brigadier General Sitivini Qiliho told the Fiji Sun newspaper the Fiji Attorney General’s office had been contacted by a foreign government requesting assistance in a criminal matter, and Fiji had agreements with other countries to enforce sanctions on Russian oligarchs. The United States embassy and European Union delegations in Fiji had requested cooperation, the Fiji Times reported. Fiji had been alerted to the approach of the Amadea before it moored at Lautoka Wharf, the media reports said. The Marine Traffic website showed Amadea left Mexico 18 days ago. Australia has imposed targeted financial sanctions on 14 Russian state-owned enterprises on Thursday, including defence-related entities such as truckmaker Kamaz, and shipping companies SEVMASH and United Shipbuilding Corp. Sanctions will also extend to electronic company Ruselectronics, responsible for the production of around 80% of all Russian electronics components, and Russian Railways over Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, foreign minister Marise Payne said in a statement. Our targeting of Russia’s state-owned enterprises in coordination with key partners undermines their capacity to boost the Russian economy. By preventing dealings with these important sources of revenue for the Russian Government, we are increasing the pressure on Russia and undercutting its ability to continue funding Putin’s war,” Payne said. Australia has now sanctioned about 600 individuals and entities, including most of Russia’s banking sector and all organisations responsible for the country’s sovereign debt. It has also supplied defence equipment and humanitarian supplies to Ukraine, while banning exports of alumina and aluminium ores, including bauxite, to Russia. A Russian court has ordered an artist to be held behind bars for allegedly replacing supermarket price labels with messages protesting against Moscow’s military campaign in Ukraine. Alexandra Skochilenko faces up to a decade in jail for her stealth protest, after she was charged under a new law banning “fake news” about Russia’s armed forces. Saint Petersburg’s Vasileostrovsky district court ruled that Skochilenko must remain in pre-trial detention in prison until 31 May, the court’s press service said on Telegram. Investigators accused her of “putting fragments of paper in place of price tags, containing knowingly false information about the use of the Russian armed forces” in a Perekryostok supermarket on 31 March. They described her motive as “political hatred for Russia”, which means she faces a harsh sentence if found guilty, ranging from a fine of 3m roubles (£27,000) to between five and 10 years in jail. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy denounced French President Emmanuel Macron’s refusal to call killings in Ukraine “genocide” and his reference to Russians as a “brotherly” people. “Such things are very painful for us, so I will definitely do my best to discuss this issue with him,” Zelenskiy said at a press conference n Wednesday with the visiting presidents of Poland and the Baltic states. France and Germany declined Wednesday to repeat US President Joe Biden’s accusation that Russia was carrying out “genocide” against Ukrainians, warning that verbal escalations would not help end the war. Instead, Macron said leaders should be “careful” with the terminology on genocide in these situations, especially as “the Ukrainians and Russians are brotherly peoples”. “I would say that Russia unilaterally unleashed the most brutal war, that it is now established that war crimes were committed by the Russian army and that it is now necessary to find those responsible and make them face justice,” Macron said. “It’s madness what’s happening, it’s incredibly brutal,” he added. “But at the same time I look at the facts and I want to try as much as possible to continue to be able to stop this war and to rebuild peace. I’m not sure that verbal escalations serve this cause,” he said. Although the US State Department defended Biden’s remarks that Russia is carrying out a genocide in Ukraine, it stopped short of promising to launch its own inquiry saying it would instead support international efforts to hold Russia accountable. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the Biden administration would further assess whether to launch its own formal review. Price said the United States supported international lawyers trying to determine whether a legal threshold was met, but did not say whether the United States would launch its own inquiry. “What we are doing is the most effective means of achieving that ultimate goal of accountability,” Price said. Such a state department determination normally follows a meticulous internal process, but the final decision is up to the secretary of state, who weighs whether it advances American interests, officials said. The US State Department has defended President Joe Biden’s remarks that Russia is carrying out a genocide in Ukraine, saying its forces are trying to destroy the country and its civilian population. Biden levelled the accusation at President Vladimir Putin’s forces for the first time on Tuesday, while adding however that it would be up to lawyers to decide if Russia’s behaviour actually qualifies as genocide. “I am going to predict that what President Biden called it is what we will ultimately likely find when we are able to gather all of this evidence,” undersecretary of state for political affairs, Victoria Nuland, said on CNN. “Because what is happening on the ground is not an accident,” she said. “It is an intentional decision by Russia, by its forces to destroy Ukraine and its civilian population,” she added. State Department spokesman Ned Price earlier said: “The president was speaking to the impression that he had garnered from watching the horrific footage that we’ve all seen from places like Mariupol, from places like Bucha, from Kharkiv and from other places. “It is much less important what you call it, rather than how you respond to it, and we’re responding to it, resolutely, by providing our Ukrainian partners with precisely what they need to defend themselves against this Russian aggression. “Whether this is a war crime, whether this is an atrocity, whether this is genocide, it does not change our strategy.’ Senior US officials are weighing whether to send a top Cabinet level official to Kyiv as a high profile representative in a show of solidarity with Ukraine, a source familiar with the situation said on Wednesday. US secretary of state Antony Blinken or defence secretary Austin Lloyd are potential candidates to pay a surprise visit to Kyiv, but no final decision has been made, the source said. The discussions were first reported by Politico. Other Western leaders, including British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, have made trips to Ukraine in show of support following Russia’s invasion in February. Here are some of the latest images to come out of Ukraine today. A 12-year-old boy holds a cat standing on the debris of his house destroyed by Russian forces’ shelling in the outskirts of Chernihiv, Ukraine. His mother, Liudmila Koval, had to have her leg amputated and was injured in her abdomen after shelling. She is still waiting for proper medical treatment. Chernihiv, a northern Ukrainian city, has been besieged by Russian forces. Shells and bombs that rained down on the city for weeks have reduced its buildings and neighbourhoods to rubble. US President Joe Biden earlier announced an additional $800m in military assistance to Ukraine including heavy artillery ahead of a wider Russian assault expected in eastern Ukraine. The package, which brings the total military aid since Russian forces invaded in February to more than $2.5 billion, includes artillery systems, artillery rounds, armoured personnel carriers and unmanned coastal defence boats, Biden said in a statement after a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. This new package of assistance will contain many of the highly effective weapons systems we have already provided and new capabilities tailored to the wider assault we expect Russia to launch in eastern Ukraine. These new capabilities include artillery systems, artillery rounds, and armoured personnel carriers.” Biden said he had also approved the transfer of additional helicopters, saying equipment provided to Ukraine “has been critical” as it confronts the invasion. “We cannot rest now. As I assured President Zelenskiy, the American people will continue to stand with the brave Ukrainian people in their fight for freedom,” Biden said. The new package includes 11 Mi-17 helicopters and 18 155mm howitzers, along with 40,000 artillery rounds, counter-artillery radars, 200 armoured personnel carriers and 300 additional Switchblade drones. It will be the first time howitzers have been provided to Ukraine by the United States. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said some of the systems, like the howitzers and radars, will require additional training for Ukrainian forces not accustomed to using American military equipment. “We’re aware of the clock and we know time is not our friend,” Kirby said when asked about the speed of deliveries. Negotiations are reportedly underway on the exchange of 169 servicemen of the National Guard of Ukraine who were taken prisoner at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, Ukrainian officials say. The ministry made the announcement in an update on the Telegram messaging app, citing Ukraine’s minister of internal affairs, Denis Monastyrsky. Chernobyl is a tragic page in our history. Unfortunately, we have to state that 169 servicemen of the National Guard were taken prisoner there. Today, some of them, according to our information, are in the territory of the Republic of Belarus, some - in Russia. We were at the place where they were kept. This is a dungeon without light, without the ability to communicate properly. They were deprived of all means of communication while they were there. And then they were taken out. Unfortunately, I can’t say what their fate is. Negotiations are underway to exchange them. But we understand that this will probably be only after the end of the active phase of hostilities.” Here is a little bit more about what we know on the Russian warship strike. The Moskva was reportedly hit by two Ukrainian missiles late on Wednesday night, a Ukrainian official earlier said. The 12,500 tonne ship has a crew of around 500. Russian news agencies said the Moskva was armed with 16 anti-ship ‘Vulkan’ cruise missiles, which have a range of at least 700km (440 miles). The Moskva is the flagship of the Black Sea fleet. Last month Ukraine said it had destroyed a large Russian landing support ship, the Orsk, on the smaller Sea of Azov to the northeast of the Black Sea. The Russian defence ministry has said the entire crew of the warship Moskva, reported to be struck by Ukraine in the Black Sea late on Wednesday night, has been evacuated after an ammunition explosion resulted in a fire on the ship. The ship was famously defied by Ukrainian troops on Snake Island at the start of the war “The cruiser ‘Moskva’ of the Black Sea Fleet was seriously damaged as a result of the detonation of ammunition that occurred as a result of a fire, the crew was evacuated,” Russian state media outlet TASS reported, citing the Russian defene ministry. “As a result of a fire, ammunition detonated on the Moskva missile cruiser. The ship was seriously damaged. The crew was completely evacuated,” the ministry added. Earlier this evening, Ukraine said it struck and damaged a Russian warship in the Black Sea, according to a Telegram messaged posted by Odessa governor Maksym Marchenko. “It has been confirmed that the missile cruiser Moskva today went exactly where it was sent by our border guards on Snake Island!” Marchenko said. On the first day of the invasion, the small garrison refused calls from the ship for it to surrender, telling the ship to “go fuck yourself”. Ukrainian presidential aide Oleksiy Arestovych said the ship could have as many as 510 crew members on board. Russian troops are stepping up activity in the eastern and southern regions of Ukraine, Zelenskiy added. They are trying to retaliate for their defeats. Rocket bombings and artillery strikes continue. New columns of equipment are being brought in. They are looking for reserves. They are trying to recruit residents of the south of our country - that is, from these temporarily occupied areas in addition to the so-called mobilisation in certain districts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.” However, Zelenskiy noted that the recent “feverish activity” of Russian forces reflects Russia’s insecurity and inability to defeat Ukraine. Even with significant stocks of Soviet military equipment and a significant number of soldiers, whom the commanders do not spare at all, the Russian troops doubt their ability to break us, to break Ukraine. Well, we do everything to justify their doubts.” “This war against Ukraine can only end in Russia’s strategic defeat - sooner or later,” he added. Either the Russian leadership will really seek peace, or as a result of this war, Russia will leave the international arena forever.” Zelenskiy confirmed forensic experts from the International Criminal Court visited Bucha on Wednesday to investigate possible war crimes. Responsibility for the Russian military for war crimes is inevitable. We will drag them all to the tribunal. And not only for what was done in Bucha. The president added that the clean-up of mines left by Russian troops in the north of Ukraine continues. The occupiers left tens of thousands of unexploded shells, mines and tripwire mines - a lot of everything. Therefore, everyone who wants to return home to the liberated territory should be as careful as possible, as attentive as possible. And immediately inform the police and rescuers in case you find a strange object, an explosive object.” Ukraine’s president Zelenskiy has called for an oil embargo in his latest national address. First of all, we need an oil embargo. And Europe’s clear readiness to give up all Russian energy. The European Union must stop sponsoring Russia’s military machine.” Zelenskiy added that he discussed western sanctions policy with a group of international and Ukrainian experts who “assessed the sanctions imposed and how Russia is trying to circumvent them”. The group has prepared concrete proposals on how to remove sanctions loopholes and how to immediately enhance sanctions to make it tangible for Moscow, Zelenskiy added. It’s 6 PM ET/3 PM PT here in the US. I’m signing off and will be handing over the blog to our colleagues in Australia. Here’s what happened so far: More than 1,000 Ukrainian marines defending the besieged port city of Mariupol have surrendered, Moscow has claimed. In one of the most critical battles of the war, Russia’s defence ministry said on Wednesday 1,026 soldiers from Ukraine’s 36th Marine Brigade, including 162 officers, had “voluntarily laid down their arms” near the city’s Ilyich iron and steelworks. There was no independent confirmation of the claim. Ukraine claims it damaged a Russian warship in the Black Sea on Wednesday, according to a Telegram messaged posted by Odessa governor Maksym Marchenko.“Neptune missiles guarding the Black Sea caused very serious damage to the Russian ship. Glory to Ukraine!” Marchenko’s message read. The Guardian could not independently confirm the attack. In a speech at the Atlantic Council on Wednesday, Treasury secretary Janet Yellen said that countries on the fence of Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine could face global isolation. “The unified coalition of sanctioning countries will not be indifferent to actions that undermine the sanctions we’ve put in place,” Yellen said at the Atlantic Council. Russian troops are reportedly suffering from “low morale and disenchantment” amongst some of the younger troops. While speaking at a press conference today, Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby also said that Russian troop leaders are “frustrated” as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine continues. The presidents of four countries bordering Russia – Poland, Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia – have travelled to Kyiv in a show of support for their Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and his embattled troops. It follows Kyiv’s reported refusal to meet the German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who visited Poland on Tuesday and said he had planned to go on to Ukraine but “was not wanted”. The former German foreign minister is facing heavy criticism for his past policy of rapprochement towards Moscow. Zelenskiy told Estonian MPs, without providing evidence, that Russia was using phosphorus bombs in Ukraine. Ukrainian forces in Mariupol said a drone had dropped a poisonous substance on the city, but there has been no independent confirmation that Russia used banned chemical weapons. Zelenskiy warned that the war would become an “endless bloodbath, spreading misery, suffering, and destruction” without additional weaponry. Speaking in English in a video published on Twitter, Zelenskiy said: “Freedom must be armed better than tyranny. Western countries have everything to make it happen.” The Russian retreat from around Kyiv has led to the discovery of large numbers of apparently massacred civilians, drawing international condemnation and calls for a war crimes investigation. The Kyiv district police chief said the bodies of 765 civilians, including 30 children had been found around the capital. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has declined to repeat Joe Biden’s accusation that Russia was carrying out “genocide” against Ukrainians, warning that verbal escalations would not help end the war. The US president said on Tuesday it had “become clearer and clearer that Putin is just trying to wipe out the idea of even being able to be a Ukrainian”. In response, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov described Biden’s comments as “unacceptable”. Finland’s prime minister, Sanna Marin, said the country would decide on whether to apply for Nato membership “within weeks”. Speaking at a joint news conference with her Swedish counterpart, Marin said that as a Nato partner – but not a member – Finland was not covered under article 5, which states that an attack on one member should be considered an attack on all. The UK government has imposed sanctions on another 206 individuals in response to Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, including 178 people it said were involved in propping up the self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk. Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, said the latest sanctions were imposed in a direct response to the “horrific rocket attacks” on a train station in Kramatorsk, eastern Ukraine, that killed dozens of civilians. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, said it was not possible to open any humanitarian corridors on Wednesday. She said the situation along the routes was “too dangerous”, and accused Russian forces of violating an agreement to halt shooting while people escape. Vladimir Putin’s closest ally in Ukraine and the leader of Ukraine’s biggest opposition party, Viktor Medvedchuk, has been captured by Ukrainian law enforcement. Zelenskiy proposed releasing him to Russia in exchange for Ukrainians captured by Russian forces, warning Russia: “Let Medvedchuk be an example for you. Even the former oligarch did not escape, not to mention much more ordinary criminals from the Russian boondocks. We will get everyone.” The BBC has warned that a video carrying its branding which claims that a missile attack on a railway station that killed dozens was carried out by Ukraine is fake. The video gives the false impression that the BBC has confirmed that Ukrainian armed forces were behind the recent attack on the Kramatorsk railway station. No such video has been produced by the BBC, the broadcaster said. Ukraine says it struck and damaged a Russian warship in the Black Sea on Wednesday, according to a Telegram messaged posted by Odessa governor Maksym Marchenko. “Neptune missiles guarding the Black Sea caused very serious damage to the Russian ship. Glory to Ukraine!” Marchenko’s message read. In a YouTube broadcast, Ukrainian presidential advisor Oleksiy Arestovych said “a surprise happened with the flagship of the Russian Black Sea Fleet”, AFP reported. The Guardian could not independently confirm the attack. AFP did not receive any confirmation from the Russian military of an attack on the warship. The US won’t say whether it will launch its own probe into whether Russia has committed genocide in Ukraine, Reuters reports. Though Biden said on Tuesday that Russia’s actions amount to a genocide, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the administration would assess whether to launch their own review. In the meantime, US State Department spokesperson Ned Price said the country supported international efforts to determine whether Russia’s actions met the legal threshold to qualify as a genocide but would not say if the US would launch its own probe. “What we are doing is the most effective means of achieving that ultimate goal of accountability,” Price said. On Wednesday, Russia said it disagreed with Biden’s description of the country’s actions in Ukraine as “genocide”. In a speech at the Atlantic Council on Wednesday, Treasury secretary Janet Yellen said that countries on the fence of Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine could face global isolation, the Wall Street Journal is reporting. The US has urged China not to undercut sanctions or provide aid to Russia and has asked countries like India to take a tougher stance on Russia. Yellen said those countries “sitting on the fence” will not be ignored. “Let me now say a few words to those countries that are currently sitting on the fence, perhaps seeing an opportunity to gain by preserving their relationship with Russia and backfilling the void left by others. Such motivations are shortsighted,” Yellen said. “And let’s be clear, the unified coalition of sanctioning countries will not be indifferent to actions that undermine the sanctions we’ve put in place.” The only country Yellen mentioned by name was China saying, “The world’s attitude towards China and its willingness to embrace further economic integration may well be affected by China’s reaction to our call for resolute action on Russia.” She also said that new trade agreements should be drawn up to reduce the reliance on non-allied nations. “We cannot allow countries to use their market position in key raw materials, technologies or products to have the power to disrupt our economy or exercise unwanted geopolitical leverage,” she said In a new letter, close to 3 dozen House Democrats put pressure on US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to recalibrate the US-Saudi relationship, the AP is reporting. Led by Rep Gerry Connolly, a Virginia Democrat and senior member of the committee on foreign affairs, and Rep Jim McGovern, a Massachusetts Democrat and chairman of the committee on rules, lawmakers wrote that Saudi Arabia has been a bad strategic partner following its refusal to help ease the skyrocketing demand for oil during Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “Governments that have formed genuine, ironclad alliances with the United States, forged in shared values of democratic norms and respect for human rights, have answered the call to action in the wake of unprovoked invasion. Unfortunately, our longstanding relationship with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has not produced a similar response,” Democrats wrote. “Saudi Arabia’s inability to stand up for international law exemplifies the short- and long-term risks associated with maintaining uncritical US support for the Saudi regime,” the letter added. Global leaders are split on whether to follow US President Biden’s lead and accuse Russia of carrying out a genocide, AFP is reporting. While Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau told reporters it was “right” that more people will be “using the word genocide in terms of what Russia is doing, what Vladimir Putin has done”, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, said it was important for world leaders to be careful about avoiding “verbal escalations”. “I would say that Russia unilaterally unleashed the most brutal war, that it is now established that war crimes were committed by the Russian army and that it is now necessary to find those responsible and make them face justice,” Macron said. “But at the same time I look at the facts and I want to try as much as possible to continue to be able to stop this war and to rebuild peace. I’m not sure that verbal escalations serve this cause,” he said. In a radio interview, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said war crimes were being committed in Russia but did not use the term genocide. “This is a terrible war in eastern Europe. And I think that’s what shouldn’t be minimised,” Scholz said. “War crimes are being committed.” Russian troops are reportedly suffering from “low morale and disenchantment” amongst some of the younger troops. While speaking at a press conference today, Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby also said that Russian troop leaders are “frustrated” as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine continues. From ABC News: Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau said today that it is correct to call what is happening in Ukraine a “genocide,” reported AFP. Following US president Joe Biden calling Russia’s actions in Ukraine a “genocide” yesterday, Trudeau parroted that language, saying to reporters in Quebec: I think it’s absolutely right that more and more people be talking and using the word genocide in terms of what Russia is doing, what Vladimir Putin has done... We have seen this desire to attack civilians, to use sexual violence as a weapon of war...This is completely unacceptable. Trudeau, along with Biden, is one of the first world leaders to use the term “genocide” when describing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. As a rising number of children are impacted by Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine, volunteer groups are dropping into shelters to help young people cope. In the Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhya, volunteers used a therapeutic dog to lead group therapy session with children. From the Reuters’ Idrees Ali: The UN chief said today that a ceasefire in Ukraine “doesn’t seem possible,” possibly indicating that the UN is still waiting on a response from Russia on evacuating Ukrainian civilians and providing aid, reported AFP While speaking at a press conference, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said: That was our appeal for humanitarian reasons, but it doesn’t seem possible. Guterres recently sent UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths to Russia and Ukraine with the goal of finalizing a ceasefire. Aid agencies have repeatedly tried to evacuate civilians from Ukrainian cities including Mariupol, which has been besieged for weeks by Russian forces. The US Pentagon said today that some military equipment that is being provided to Ukraine will require training, reports Reuters. In a briefing today, the Pentagon spokesperson, John Kirby, said that some of the new equipment being sent to Ukraine would require training in its use. In terms of training options, the US will likely train a small number of Ukrainian forces who will then go and train more of their colleagues. From Reuters’ Idrees Ali: Here is a statement from US president Joe Biden on his talk with Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy today and the decision to provide Ukraine with an additional $800m in military assistance. From CNN’s Natasha Bertrand: Russia’s foreign ministry on Wednesday said it was expelling a senior Czech diplomat from Moscow, reported Reuters. Russia’s foreign ministry on Wednesday said it was expelling a senior Czech diplomat from Moscow after Prague last month told a top Russian official at the embassy to leave. In a statement, the ministry said the Czech diplomat had to leave Russia before the end of day on 16 April. Russia is imposing sanctions on 398 US House representatives and 87 Canadiana senators, reports Reuters citing a Russian news agency. According to Interfax news agency, Russia’s foreign ministry said the move to impose sanctions came after the US announced sanctions last month against 328 members of the Russian Duma, or parliament. Russia plans to announce additional sanctions in response to U.S. punitive measures soon, Interfax said. Poland’s president, Andrzej Duda, called the war in Ukraine “terrorism” today, adding that those who committed crimes must be brought to justice along with those who gave orders, reports Reuters. While meeting with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, along with leaders from three Baltic states, Duda said: This is not war, this is terrorism. While visiting Ukraine, Duda also visited the Ukrainian town of Bucha, where the discovery of hundreds of slain civilians sparked global outrage. Russia has routinely denied targeting civilians and has dismissed allegations of committed war crimes as fake news. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said that he was not approached about a meeting with the German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, following reports that Ukraine refused to meet with Steinmeier, reports Reuters. During a press conference today about his meeting with Poland and three other Baltic countries, Zelenskiy said: We were not officially approached by the German president or the office of the German president for this visit. Steinmeier, a supporter of Ukraine’s reconciliation with Russia, had said earlier that Ukrainian officials had refused to meet with him. A Ukrainian official later denied that Zelenskiy had refused a visit from Steinmeier. The US president, Joe Biden, announced today that the US will be giving an additional $800m in military assistance to Ukraine, reports Reuters. With the additional funds announced today, the total aid that the US has given Ukraine is more than $2.4bn. This latest package includes artillery systems, artillery rounds and armored personnel carriers, said Biden in a statement today following a call with the Ukraine president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. It is just past 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: More than 1,000 Ukrainian marines defending the besieged port city of Mariupol have surrendered, Moscow has claimed.

I’ll be back tomorrow but my colleague, Gloria Oladipo, will continue to bring you today’s developments from the war in Ukraine. The US is continuing to see “significant morale issues” among Russian troops in Ukraine, with new intelligence reports of low morale even at officer level, a senior US defence official said. The official said the US has recent evidence that Russian forces “have been disillusioned by this war, weren’t properly informed, weren’t properly trained, weren’t ready, not just physically, but weren’t ready mentally for what they were about to do”. The US also has indications that Russian officers are “frustrated with their troops’ performance, frustrated with their colleagues’ performance”, said the official. “Almost half” of the Russian troops in Ukraine are conscripts “who don’t receive a lot of training”, they noted. There still are morale and unit cohesion problems that are bedeviling the Russians even as they now try to refit, resupply, and focus on a more concentrated geographic area. Foreign Policy’s Jack Detsch shared additional highlights from the US defence official’s briefing today: The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and his US counterpart, Joe Biden, discussed additional defensive and financial aid for Kyiv as well as sanctions and alleged Russian war crimes, Zelenskiy said. A member of the Ukrainian delegation, Mykhailo Podolyak, has accused European politicians of “closing eyes on Russian crimes for years”. Writing on Twitter, Podolyak said Ukraine needed “not words of support or sympathy, but actions”. Russian forces are fully ready for a fresh assault in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region and southern Kherson region, Ukraine’s armed forces command said, Reuters reports. In a Facebook post, the armed forces said: In the Donetsk and Tavria (Kherson) directions, according to available information, the enemy is ready for offensive actions. Standing next to a Chernobyl checkpoint, Vasily Davidenko recalled the day Russia invaded. “They were hooligans,” he said, pointing to a tourist kiosk shot up and adorned with the words “Chernobyl ice-cream”. Next to a pockmarked bus stop was debris left behind by Vladimir Putin’s army: machine-gun bullets, cigarette packets and an empty tin of tuna. “It was a difficult time. People are worried the Russians might come back,” Davidenko said. He added: I talked to the Russian soldiers as they drove past. They were young guys from Siberia. They asked me: ‘Batya [Dad], how are you living?’ I answered: ‘We are fine here, thanks very much.’ Russian forces trundled into the Chernobyl exclusion zone on 24 February in the early hours of the invasion. According to Davidenko, they crossed over the Pripyat River from Belarus using a pontoon bridge. They then headed towards the Chernobyl nuclear power station, covered with a giant sarcophagus, the scene of the disastrous 1986 accident. By breakfast time they had seized the station. Russian troops disarmed the 169 Ukrainian national guards based at the plant and rounded up its technical staff, 103 people. They established a command centre and began digging fortifications including tank shelters, trenches and an underground kitchen. For 1,000 servicemen, Chernobyl became home. The Kremlin seemed unaware of – or indifferent to – the risks posed by radiation to its service personnel. The bulk of Putin’s invading army kept going. It headed south through the pine forest and along a smooth asphalt road leading to Kyiv, 130km away. The route goes past bucolic mini-lakes and bogs, and past gulls and the odd swan. Read more of Luke’s report: ‘They were hooligans’: Chernobyl locals reeling after Russian invasion Russian forces are potentially planning to launch a “large-scale offensive” to “conquer” the Donbas in eastern Ukraine, French military spokesperson Col Pascal Ianni said. Ianni told reporters: Within the next few days, 10 days or so maybe, Russia could relaunch its efforts with a large-scale offensive in the east and south to conquer the Donetsk and Luhansk regions […] or even to push as far as the Dnipro [river] if its capacities allow it. Russian forces were carrying out airstrikes and bombings in Ukraine not only “to weaken the coherence of the Ukrainian defence system, but also to disrupt Ukrainian logistical movements and capacity”, Ianni added. He also noted that there were “no significant advances at this stage in terms of territorial gains for the Russian forces on the eastern front.” A puppy was pulled out alive from the rubble of a shelled building by rescuers with the Donetsk regional police in the Donetsk oblast area. The Ukrainian police organisation said the dog, recovered in the town of Mykhailivka, belonged to a 77-year-old man they claimed the man miraculously survived Russian shelling and his puppy was recovered from the debris from the explosion. An adviser to the mayor of Mariupol, Petro Andriuschenko, has dismissed Russian reports of more than 1,000 marines surrendering in the besieged port city. Ukraine still holds several areas of the city, Andriuschenko told the BBC, dismissing Russia’s statements as “impossible”. Andriuschenko said: They don’t control our harbour, they don’t control Azovstal [iron and steel works]. It is not currently possible to verify his comments as the full picture of what is going on in Mariupol is still unclear. It is just past 6.30pm in Kyiv. Here’s a quick roundup of what’s been happening so far: More than 1,000 Ukrainian marines defending the besieged port city of Mariupol have surrendered, Moscow has claimed. In one of the most critical battles of the war, Russia’s defence ministry said on Wednesday 1,026 soldiers from Ukraine’s 36th Marine Brigade, including 162 officers, had “voluntarily laid down their arms” near the city’s Ilyich iron and steelworks. There was no independent confirmation of the claim. The presidents of four countries bordering Russia – Poland, Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia – have travelled to Kyiv in a show of support for their Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and his embattled troops. It follows Kyiv’s reported refusal to meet the German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who visited Poland on Tuesday and said he had planned to go on to Ukraine but “was not wanted”. The former German foreign minister is facing heavy criticism for his past policy of rapprochement towards Moscow. Zelenskiy told Estonian MPs, without providing evidence, that Russia was using phosphorus bombs in Ukraine. Ukrainian forces in Mariupol said a drone had dropped a poisonous substance on the city, but there has been no independent confirmation that Russia used banned chemical weapons. Zelenskiy warned that the war would become an “endless bloodbath, spreading misery, suffering, and destruction” without additional weaponry. Speaking in English in a video published on Twitter, Zelenskiy said: “Freedom must be armed better than tyranny. Western countries have everything to make it happen.” The Russian retreat from around Kyiv has led to the discovery of large numbers of apparently massacred civilians, drawing international condemnation and calls for a war crimes investigation. The Kyiv district police chief said the bodies of 765 civilians, including 30 children had been found around the capital. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has declined to repeat Joe Biden’s accusation that Russia was carrying out “genocide” against Ukrainians, warning that verbal escalations would not help end the war. The US president said on Tuesday it had “become clearer and clearer that Putin is just trying to wipe out the idea of even being able to be a Ukrainian”. In response, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov described Biden’s comments as “unacceptable”. Finland’s prime minister, Sanna Marin, said the country would decide on whether to apply for Nato membership “within weeks”. Speaking at a joint news conference with her Swedish counterpart, Marin said that as a Nato partner – but not a member – Finland was not covered under article 5, which states that an attack on one member should be considered an attack on all. The UK government has imposed sanctions on another 206 individuals in response to Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, including 178 people it said were involved in propping up the self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk. Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, said the latest sanctions were imposed in a direct response to the “horrific rocket attacks” on a train station in Kramatorsk, eastern Ukraine, that killed dozens of civilians. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, said it was not possible to open any humanitarian corridors on Wednesday. She said the situation along the routes was “too dangerous”, and accused Russian forces of violating an agreement to halt shooting while people escape. Vladimir Putin’s closest ally in Ukraine and the leader of Ukraine’s biggest opposition party, Viktor Medvedchuk, has been captured by Ukrainian law enforcement. Zelenskiy proposed releasing him to Russia in exchange for Ukrainians captured by Russian forces, warning Russia: “Let Medvedchuk be an example for you. Even the former oligarch did not escape, not to mention much more ordinary criminals from the Russian boondocks. We will get everyone.” The BBC has warned that a video carrying its branding which claims that a missile attack on a railway station that killed dozens was carried out by Ukraine is fake. The video gives the false impression that the BBC has confirmed that Ukrainian armed forces were behind the recent attack on the Kramatorsk railway station. No such video has been produced by the BBC, the broadcaster said. Hello, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong here bringing you all the latest developments from the war in Ukraine. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. Jersey has frozen more than $7bn (£5.4bn) of assets linked to the sanctioned Russian oligarch and Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich, Rupert Neate and Pjotr Sauer report. The Royal Court of Jersey announced on Wednesday that it had imposed “a formal freezing order” on “assets understood to be valued in excess of US$7bn which are suspected to be connected to Mr Abramovich and which are either located in Jersey or owned by Jersey incorporated entities”. The government of Jersey, a self-governing British crown dependency favoured by the world’s wealthy for its very low taxes and reputation for strict banking secrecy, said the local police had raided several properties linked to Abramovich. The island’s Law Officers’ Department said in a statement: Search warrants were executed by the States of Jersey police on Tuesday 12 April 2022 at premises in Jersey suspected to be connected to the business activities of Roman Abramovich. The Guardian last week revealed that a 50-metre superyacht linked to Abramovich had been transferred to a Jersey company on the day of Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. The department would not comment on the yacht, and said it would not be providing any further details. A spokesperson for Abramovich did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The yacht, Aquamarine, is the fifth vessel to have been linked to Abramovich. On 24 February, ownership of the yacht passed from a company previously controlled by Abramovich to a close associate of his, the Russian businessman David Davidovich. The BBC has warned that a video carrying its branding which claims that a missile attack on a railway station that killed dozens was carried out by Ukraine is fake. The video, mocked up with a BBC News logo and using a similar graphics style to the broadcaster, gives the false impression that the BBC has confirmed that Ukrainian armed forces were behind the recent attack on the Kramatorsk railway station. The clip has been aired on Russian state television and spread across social media, and appears to have originated among pro-Kremlin accounts on the social media app Telegram, the BBC said. No such video has been produced by the BBC, it said, adding that it has not yet been possible to verify the source of the missile. The BBC press office said: The BBC is taking action to have the video removed. We urge people not to share it and to check stories on the BBC News website. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has released a new video in which he warns that the war will become an “endless bloodbath, spreading misery, suffering, and destruction” without additional weaponry. Speaking in English, Zelenskiy says Ukraine has been defending itself against Russia “much longer than the invaders planned”. But Russia still has the capacity to attack “not only against Ukraine”, Zelenskiy continues: Poland, Moldova, Romania, and the Baltic states will become the next targets if the freedom of Ukraine falls. More weapons were needed to “save millions of Ukrainians as well as millions of Europeans”, he says: We need heavy artillery, armoured vehicles, air defence systems and combat aircraft. Zelenskiy concludes the video by saying: Freedom must be armed better than tyranny. Western countries have everything to make it happen. The final victory over the tyranny and the number of people saved depends on them. The Czech Republic has reopened its embassy in Kyiv, the Czech foreign ministry said. The ministry said: It is one of many steps expressing our support for Ukraine. Czechia has and always will stand behind Ukraine. Internationally appointed human rights monitors have found “clear patterns” of violations of international humanitarian law by “Russian forces in their conduct of hostilities” in a preliminary assessment of the conduct of the seven-week-long war in Ukraine. The three experts, appointed by the 57-country OSCE, whose members cover Europe, North America and central Asia, said that had Russia respected humanitarian law and avoided shelling hospitals and other protected infrastructure then “the number of civilians killed or injured would have remained much lower”. “Considerably fewer houses, hospitals, cultural properties, schools, multi-storey residential buildings, water stations and electricity systems would have been damaged or destroyed,” the monitors continue in a report released by the OSCE on Wednesday. But it also found human rights “violations and problems” attributable to Ukraine, in particular “the treatment of prisoners of war, who originally were considered criminals” after video emerged that appeared to show Russian soldiers being shot in the leg by their captors. The UN office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has so far formally recorded 4,450 civilian casualties in Ukraine since the war began, of which have been 1,892 killed and 2,558 injured. But the figure is almost certainly an underestimate due to the difficulties of accurate documentation while fighting is ongoing. Ukraine was one of 45 OSCE countries that agreed to appoint the monitors, but Russia did not cooperate, meaning that the monitoring group had to rely on Russian public statements, where available, for its perspective on alleged human rights violations. Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba has just tweeted that he has been speaking on the phone with his British counterpart Liz Truss. He said: Focused call with Liz Truss. Grateful to the UK for its leadership in increasing sanctions pressure on Russia. Underscored the importance of speeding up arms deliveries to Ukraine. Discussed further steps to hold Russia accountable for its crimes. While Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy was addressing the parliament in Estonia, and Estonia’s president Alar Karis was heading to Kyiv, there was a dramatic protest outside the Russian Embassy in the Estonian capital, Tallinn, against the rape and abuse of women and children in Ukraine by Russian forces. A group of women surrounded the Russian embassy on Pikk tänav with their hands tied behind their backs, bags over their heads, and fake blood applied on their underwear and down their legs. The protesters’ statement was reported by Estonia’s ERR public broadcasting channel as saying: Russian soldiers are raping and murdering innocent women and children in Ukraine. People who support this war also support war crimes, jarring murders to which they are accomplices. That is our message to the supporters of the Putin regime in Russia, Estonia and everywhere. Here is Jon Henley’s round-up of the latest reports from the war on Ukraine: More than 1,000 Ukrainian marines defending the besieged port city of Mariupol have surrendered, Moscow has said, as the presidents of four countries bordering Russia head to Kyiv in a show of support for Ukraine. In one of the most critical battles of the war, Russia’s defence ministry said on Wednesday 1,026 soldiers from Ukraine’s 36th Marine Brigade, including 162 officers, had “voluntarily laid down their arms” near the city’s Ilyich iron and steelworks. There was no independent confirmation of the claim. The city, the main target yet to be brought under Russian control in the eastern Donbas region, has been encircled and largely reduced to rubble during Moscow’s seven-week invasion. The city’s mayor has said 21,000 civilians have died. Its capture would mark the first fall of a major Ukrainian city and would help Russia secure a land passage between the self-proclaimed republics in Donetsk and Luhansk in Donbas and Crimea, which Moscow occupied and annexed in 2014. Read more of Jon Henley’s round-up here: More than 1,000 Ukraine marines have surrendered in Mariupol, says Russia Russia has responded to Joe Biden’s comments about genocide. The US president said his Russian counterpart “is trying to wipe out the idea of being able to be Ukrainian”. Reuters reports Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on a conference call with reporters: We consider this kind of effort to distort the situation unacceptable. This is hardly acceptable from a president of the United States, a country that has committed well-known crimes in recent times. Russia will view US and Nato vehicles transporting weapons on Ukrainian territory as “legal military targets”, the Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, said, Reuters reports. Speaking in an interview with the Russian state-owned news agency Tass, Ryabkov said: We are warning that US-Nato weapons transports across Ukrainian territory will be considered by us as legal military targets. We are making the Americans and other westerners understand that attempts to slow down our special operation, to inflict maximum damage on Russian contingents and formations of the DPR and LPR (Donetsk and Luhansk People’s republics) will be harshly suppressed. Joe Biden has upped the ante in his criticisms of Vladimir Putin’s actions in Ukraine by accusing him of genocide, saying the Russian leader is “trying to wipe out the idea of even being Ukrainian”. But how significant is the allegation and how likely is Putin to face genocide charges? Genocide is one of four crimes prosecuted by the international criminal court (ICC) and generally considered to be the most grave. The court defines it as being: Characterised by the specific intent to destroy in whole or in part a national, ethnic, racial or religious group by killing its members or by other means: causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; or forcibly transferring children of the group to another group. The court, based in The Hague in the Netherlands, has been criticised over its limited number of successful prosecutions: 10, all for war crimes and/or crimes against humanity, with none for genocide. When the ICC prosecutor, Karim Khan, announced in February that he was opening a case into events in Ukraine, he said there was “a reasonable basis to believe that both alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity have been committed”. The UK is imposing sanctions on 178 individuals who are deemed to be “propping up the illegal breakaway regions” in eastern Ukraine, the British Foreign Office has said. In a statement today, the UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said: In the wake of horrific rocket attacks on civilians in eastern Ukraine, we are today sanctioning those who prop up the illegal breakaway regions and are complicit in atrocities against the Ukrainian people. We will continue to target all those who aid and abet Putin’s war. In total, the UK government announced new sanctions for 206 individuals, including 178 separatists, six oligarchs, their close associates and employees, and a further 22 individuals. Among those sanctioned are Sergei Kozlov, the self-styled chairman of the government of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic, and Alexander Ananchenko, whom the Foreign Office named as the self-professed prime minister of the Donetsk People’s Republic. Maria Lavrova, the wife of Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, is also among those subject to a travel ban and asset freeze. From tomorrow, the UK government is “banning the import of Russian iron and steel, as well as the export of quantum technologies and advanced materials that Putin sorely needs”, Truss said, adding: We will not rest in our mission to stop Putin’s war machine in its tracks. The presidents of Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia have arrived in Ukraine for talks with their Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Lithuania’s president, Gitanas Nauseda, tweeted earlier that he was heading to the Ukrainian capital “with a strong message of political support and military assistance”. The Latvian president, Egils Levits, said the visit to Ukraine was intended to show “full solidarity with the heroic people and their President”. The office of the Polish president, Andrzej Duda, also tweeted about the visit: The meeting will focus on ways to assist civilians and the military in Ukraine, as well as with investigations of war crimes, a spokesperson for Estonia’s president, Alar Karis, said. The four presidents’ offices declined to provide details of the visit for security reasons. The International Criminal Court’s chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, visited the Ukrainian town of Bucha today, telling reporters: “Ukraine is a crime scene”. The ICC is investigating potential war crimes committed by Russian forces during the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. The ICC has “reasonable grounds to believe that crimes within the jurisdiction of the court are being committed”, Khan said, AFP reports. Khan said: We have to pierce the fog of war to get to the truth. That requires independent, impartial investigation. Khan said an ICC forensic team was set to work “so that we can really make sure we separate truth from fiction”. We have to keep an open mind and we have to follow the evidence. Khan met with Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova in the capital Kyiv, the ICC said. The pair agreed that “deepening engagement and further strengthening partnerships” was “crucial to delivering accountability” for possible international crimes committed in Ukraine, it said. Here’s more from Finland’s prime minister, Sanna Marin, who has told reporters that the country would decide on whether to apply for Nato membership “within weeks”. Finland’s government is expected to publish an update of its foreign and security policy in a white paper later today. Marin stressed that as a Nato partner – but not a member – Finland was not covered under Article 5, which states that an attack on one member should be considered an attack on all, AFP reports. She said: There is no other way to have security guarantees than under Nato’s deterrence and common defence as guaranteed by Nato’s Article 5. From the Economist’s Shashank Joshi: Sweden is also reviewing its security policy with conclusions expected next month. Swedish prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, said it was important to carry out a thorough analysis of whether the country should also apply to join the alliance. Andersson said: There are of course pros and cons with being a member of Nato as there are pros and cons of other security choices. She added: Being a member of Nato, you do have the security with Article 5... You also have another responsibility towards other countries. Jamie Rann, a lecturer in Russian at the University of Glasgow, writes for us today about how Ukrainians’ enthusiastic use of bad language contrasts with Putin’s linguistic prissiness – and shows that Russia doesn’t own Russian: A man, cigarette jammed into his mouth, carries a land mine off a road. A woman teases a tank driver with threats of witchcraft. A coastguard responds to the threat of bombardment with the now infamous line “Russian warship, fuck off”. The people in these viral videos, as in many others that have emerged from Ukraine’s resistance to Russia’s barbaric invasion, are doing the same three things: they are showing incredible courage in defending their homeland, they are speaking Russian, and they are swearing. Taken separately, there is nothing surprising in these things. Of course people swear in wartime and the fact that many Ukrainians, especially in the east and south, speak Russian has long been a talking point for armchair experts. What underinformed Ukraine-watchers, with Vladimir Putin foremost among them, failed to anticipate is that speaking Russian in no way guarantees support for the Russian state. But the combination of these three things – resistance, Russian and expletives – and their prominence in the coverage of the war is itself significant. Obscenity might seem a trivial sidenote in such a horrific conflict, but understanding it is a way of understanding language, and language has played a big part both in Moscow’s professed motivations for this invasion and in Kyiv’s defiant response. Finland will make a decision about whether to apply to join the Nato alliance in the next few weeks, the country’s prime minister, Sanna Marin, said. Speaking at a joint news conference with her Swedish counterpart, Marin told reporters: There are different perspectives to apply (for) Nato membership or not to apply and we have to analyse these very carefully. But I think our process will be quite fast, it will happen in weeks. On Monday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov warned Finland and Sweden against joining Nato, claiming the alliance’s further expansion would “not bring stability to the European continent”. Russia has also previously warned it would have to “rebalance the situation” with its own measures if the two countries join Nato. Finland, an EU member state, shares a 1,300km (810-mile) border with Russia. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said Russia can easily redirect exports of its vast energy resources away from the west to countries that need them, Reuters reports. Speaking at a meeting with officials to discuss development in the Russian Arctic, Putin said domestic consumption of oil, gas and coal could also be increased. He also accused “unfriendly countries” of destroying supply chains in Russia’s Arctic regions and said some nations were not fulfilling their contractual obligations, which he said had created problems for Russia. 1,026 soldiers of Ukraine’s 36th marine brigade, including 162 officers, have surrendered in the besieged port city of Mariupol, according to a statement from the Russian defence ministry. Ukrainian authorities say that have no information on the reported surrender. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in an address to Estonia’s parliament that Russia was using phosphorus bombs in Ukraine, accusing Moscow of using terror tactics against civilians. He did not provide any evidence to back up the claim. The world’s chemical weapons watchdog has said it is “concerned” over reports of the use of chemical weapons in the besieged Ukrainian port of Mariupol. Zelenskiy had previously said it was not possible to draw 100% firm conclusions about allegations that Russian forces had used chemical weapons. Russia has denied it has used the weapons, with the Russian embassy in the US claiming that all of Russia’s stockpile of chemical weapons was destroyed in 2017. US president Joe Biden has labelled Russia’s actions in Ukraine as “genocide”, saying Russian president Vladimir Putin “is trying to wipe out the idea of being able to be Ukrainian”. “We’ll let the lawyers decide internationally whether or not it qualifies, but it sure seems that way to me,” he added. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy promptly responded: “True words of a true leader. Calling things by their names is essential to stand up to evil.” Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said it was not possible to open any humanitarian corridors on Wednesday. She said “The situation along the routes is too dangerous. The occupiers not only disregard the norms of international humanitarian law, but also cannot properly control their people on the ground”, accusing Russian forces of violating an agreement to halt shooting while people escape. The mayor of Mariupol, Vadym Boichenko, said in televised remarks that more than 100,000 people still remained in the city awaiting evacuation. More than 6,000 alleged war crimes committed by Russian troops in Ukraine are under investigation, Ukraine’s prosecutor’s office has said. Putin’s closest ally in Ukraine, Viktor Medvedchuk, has been captured by Ukrainian law enforcement. Medvedchuk is the leader of the Opposition Platform for Life, Ukraine’s biggest opposition party. Zelenskiy proposed releasing him to Russia in exchange for Ukrainians captured by Russian forces. Zelenskiy also warned Russia: “Let Medvedchuk be an example for you. Even the former oligarch did not escape, not to mention much more ordinary criminals from the Russian boondocks. We will get everyone.” Polish president Andrzej Duda and the presidents of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia are on their way to Kyiv to meet Ukraine’s president Volodimir Zelensky in person. The United Nations’ refugee agency has called on the UK government to intervene to stop single British men from being matched up with lone Ukrainian women seeking refuge from war because of fears of sexual exploitation. Joe Biden has accused Russia of carrying out genocide in Ukraine, saying that Vladimir Putin is “trying to wipe out the idea of even being Ukrainian”. The Pentagon will host leaders from the top eight US weapons manufacturers on Wednesday to discuss the industry’s capacity to meet Ukraine’s weapons needs if the war with Russia lasts years. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I am handing over to Léonie Chao-Fong for the next few hours. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in an address to Estonia’s parliament that Russia was using phosphorus bombs in Ukraine, accusing Moscow of using terror tactics against civilians. He did not provide any evidence to back-up the claim. The world’s chemical weapons watchdog has said it is concerned over reports of the use of chemical weapons in the besieged Ukrainian port of Mariupol. Zelenskiy had said previously it was not possible to draw 100% firm conclusions about allegations that Russian forces had used chemical weapons. Russia has denied it has used the weapons, with the Russian embassy in the US claiming that all of Russia’s stockpile of chemical weapons was destroyed in 2017. [see 7.59am] Reuters reports that Zelenskiy also told Estonia’s lawmakers: The visits of Polish president Andrzej Duda and the presidents of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia to Kyiv later today is an important symbol of solidarity. Sanctions are needed to continue to apply pressure on Russia. He also said that instruments need to be found to prevent Russia forcibly deporting people from Ukraine. He also asked that Ukraine become an EU ‘candidate country’. At least seven people were killed and 22 wounded by shelling in Ukraine’s north-eastern region of Kharkiv over the past 24 hours, governor Oleh Synegubov has said. Reuters reports he said in an online post a two-year-old boy was among those killed in the 53 artillery or rocket strikes he claimed Russian forces had carried out in the past day in the region. The information has not been independently verified. Russia has repeatedly denied making civilians targets in Ukraine. Lana Estemirova writes for us this morning, saying that everything Russian president Vladimir Putin is doing to Ukraine, he did to her home, Chechnya, first: The indiscriminate shelling, the looting, the evidence of rape, torture and executions, and, above all, the sense of enthusiasm with which these war crimes are being carried out are painfully familiar. In recent days, my mind has kept wandering to a photo, taken 18 years ago in Rigakhoy village in Chechnya by my mum, human rights activist Natalya Estemirova. It shows the corpses of five tiny, grey-faced children, all siblings, lined up according to height. The oldest is five years old, the youngest – twins – were not even 12 months old. The children and their mother, Maydat Tsintsayeva, were killed in a deliberate bombing by the Russians on 9 April 2004. This was one of the many unprosecuted crimes committed by the Russian army in the name of “counter-terrorism” in Chechnya. My mum hoped that these photos would alert the world to what Chechen civilians were going through, but it was to no avail. Years later it was her turn – as someone took a grainy photo of her lifeless, bullet-ridden body lying on the side of the road in the sunburned grass. Her murderers walk free. That is Russia’s legacy in Chechnya. Read more here: Lana Estemirova – Putin’s terror playbook: everything he is doing to Ukraine, he did to my home, Chechnya, first A quick snap from Reuters here that Ukraine’s defence ministry spokesperson, questioned on the Russian claim that 1,026 Ukrainian marines have surrendered in Mariupol, told reporters that they had no information on any surrender. The United Nations’ refugee agency has called on the UK government to intervene to stop single British men from being matched up with lone Ukrainian women seeking refuge from war because of fears of sexual exploitation. In the wake of claims that predatory men are using the Homes for Ukraine scheme to target the vulnerable, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) told the Guardian “a more appropriate matching process” could be put in place to ensure women and women with children are matched with families or couples. The suggestion from the global refugee agency follows reports that Ukrainian refugees, predominantly women and sometimes accompanied by children, are at risk in the UK of sexual exploitation. Read more of Rajeev Syal’s report here: Stop matching lone female Ukraine refugees with single men, UK told 1,026 soldiers of Ukraine’s 36th marine brigade, including 162 officers, have surrendered in the besieged port city of Mariupol, according to a statement from the Russian defence ministry. “In the town of Mariupol, near the Ilyich Iron and Steel Works, as a result of successful offensives by Russian armed forces and Donetsk People’s Republic militia units, 1,026 Ukrainian soldiers of the 36th Marine Brigade voluntarily laid down arms and surrendered,” it said in a statement. There was no immediate comment from the Ukrainian president’s office, the Ukrainian general staff or the defence ministry. Ukraine’s general staff, in its morning report, had said that Russian forces were proceeding with attacks in Mariupol on the Azovstal iron and steel works and the port. Russia said 151 wounded Ukrainian soldiers were treated on the spot and taken to Mariupol’s city hospital. Russian television had showed pictures of what it said were marines giving themselves up at the iron and steel works in Mariupol on Tuesday. Reuters reports that earlier the Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov has said more than 1,000 Ukrainian marines had surrendered, and he urged remaining forces in the Azovstal steel mill to surrender. “Within Azovstal at the moment there are about 200 wounded who cannot receive any medical assistance,” Kadyrov said in his post. “For them and all the rest it would be better to end this pointless resistance and go home to their families.” In a Facebook post on Monday, the last Ukrainian soldiers defending Mariupol said they were “running out of ammunition” and expected to be killed or taken prisoner very soon. “We were bombed from airplanes and shot at by artillery and tanks. We have been doing everything possible and impossible. But any resource has the potential to run out,” said the 36th brigade. AFP is carrying a couple of further quotes from Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk’s message about the lack of humanitarian corridors being set up today. It quotes her saying: Unfortunately, we are not opening them today. The situation along the routes is too dangerous and we are forced to refrain from opening humanitarian corridors today. The occupiers not only disregard the norms of international humanitarian law, but also cannot properly control their people on the ground She said that around Zaporizhzhia in the south, Russian forces were blocking buses used in the evacuations, and that in the east Lugansk region Moscow’s army was violating an agreement to halt shooting while people escape. The claims have not been independently verified. One civilian was killed in Russian shelling of Ukraine’s eastern Luhansk region over the past 24 hours, Luhansk governor Serhiy Gaidai said this morning. Reuters reports he said in a post on the Telegram messaging app that three trains would be offered on Wednesday to residents who wanted to leave the region, which he said was under constant shelling and may face a new large offensive by Russian forces. Earlier today, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said it was not possible to open any humanitarian corridors for Wednesday, and she accused occupying Russian forces of violating a ceasefire and blocking buses evacuating civilians. Russia said on Wednesday that claims by the US and Ukraine that Russia could use chemical weapons in Ukraine were disinformation because Moscow destroyed its last chemical stockpiles in 2017. US department of state spokesman Ned Price told reporters yesterday that the US was concerned Russia may seek to resort to chemical weapons in Ukraine. Reuters reports Russia’s embassy in Washington said Ukrainian radicals were preparing to stage provocations with the use of chemical weapons and that the state department’s Price was spreading disinformation. “We call on Washington to stop spreading disinformation,” the embassy said in a statement. “Ned Price once again distinguished himself by his idle talk, not substantiated by a single piece of evidence.” The claim that chemical weapons have been used in Mariupol is based on video posted by Ukrainian fighters in the area, and has not been independently verified. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said it was not possible to draw 100% firm conclusions about whether Russian forces had used chemical weapons. Russia has dismissed the claims. Matti Maasikas, the European Union’s ambassador to Ukraine, has been asked on Sky News in the UK about the prospects of the country joining the EU, which he said was being done at an accelerated pace. He told viewers: The Ukrainian’s EU path has started. And it has started with an unprecedented speed. What is normally being done over a two-year period is now being attempted in three months, namely the first assessment by the European Commission of Ukraine’s compliance with the basic criteria of membership, namely a working democracy and a working market economy. Or that’s the working assumption – to hear more in June. Reuters reports that the mayor of the besieged Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, Vadym Boichenko, said in televised remarks this morning that more than 100,000 people remained in the city awaiting evacuation. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said it was not possible to open any humanitarian corridors on Wednesday. She accused occupying Russian forces of violating a ceasefire and blocking buses evacuating civilians. Reuters reports Vereshchuk added in a statement on the Telegram messaging app that authorities would work to reopen the humanitarian corridors as soon as possible. This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog now. You can reach me at martin.belam@theguardian.com China’s overall trade with Russia rose by more than 12% in March from a year earlier in dollar terms, in sync with previous gains, even as Beijing criticised western sanctions on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine. Overall trade with Russia increased 12.76% in March to $11.67bn and jumped 30.45% in the first quarter from the same period last year, Chinese customs data showed on Wednesday, according to Reuters. The gains in total trade – comprising the values for both exports and imports – were in line with previous increases, with Russia a major source of oil, gas, coal and agriculture commodities for China. Beijing has refused to call Russia’s action an invasion and has repeatedly criticised what it says are illegal western sanctions to punish Moscow. Several weeks before the attack on Ukraine, China and Russia declared a “no-limits” strategic partnership. Last year, total trade between China and Russia jumped 35.8% to a record $146.9bn. As sanctions against Russia mount, China could offset some of its neighbour’s pain by buying more. But analysts say they have yet to see any major indication China is violating Western sanctions on Russia. China’s economic and trade cooperation with other countries including Russia and Ukraine remains normal, customs spokesman Li Kuiwen said at a news conference. The world’s chemical weapons watchdog has said it is “concerned” over reports of the use of chemical weapons in the besieged Ukrainian port of Mariupol. Reports first emerged on Monday from Ukraine’s Azov battalion that a Russian drone had dropped a “poisonous substance” on troops and civilians in Mariupol. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) said in a statement: The Technical Secretariat of the OPCW is monitoring closely the situation in Ukraine. The Secretariat is concerned by the recent unconfirmed report of chemical weapons use in Mariupol, which has been carried in the media over the past 24 hours. This follows reports in the media over the past few weeks of shelling targeted at chemical plants located in Ukraine, together with accusations levelled by both sides around possible misuse of toxic chemicals. All 193 OPCW Member States, including the Russian Federation and Ukraine, are parties to the Chemical Weapons Convention, an international treaty of major importance in the field of disarmament that has been in force since 1997. In doing so, they have solemnly and voluntarily committed never to develop, produce, acquire, stockpile, transfer or use chemical weapons.” The Pentagon will host leaders from the top eight US weapons manufacturers on Wednesday to discuss the industry’s capacity to meet Ukraine’s weapons needs if the war with Russia lasts years, two people familiar with the meeting said on Tuesday. Demand for weapons has shot up after Russia’s invasion spurred US and allied weapons transfers to Ukraine. Resupplying as well as planning for a longer war is expected to be discussed at the meeting, the sources told Reuters on condition of anonymity. The Pentagon’s office of Acquisition and Sustainment, the weapons buyer for the US Department of Defense, will host the 90-minute meeting and deputy secretary of defence Kathleen Hicks was expected to attend, one of the people said. The Pentagon has said that the most useful weapons are smaller systems such as Javelin anti-tank missiles and Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, which Washington and allies have been shipping to Ukraine on a nearly daily basis. The intense usage, as well as the battlefield effectiveness displayed by Ukrainian forces, has driven interest in restocking these weapons. Raytheon Technologies and Lockheed Martin Corp jointly produce Javelins, while Raytheon makes Stingers. Other top weapons makers are Boeing Co Northrop Grumman , General Dynamics and L3Harris Technologies. More than 6,000 alleged war crimes committed by Russian troops in Ukraine are under investigation, Ukraine’s prosecutor’s office has said. A total of 6,261 cases have been reported and 191 children have been confirmed to have been killed, the office added. US president Joe Biden’s administration is expected to announce another $750m in military assistance for Ukraine as soon as Wednesday, two US officials familiar with the matter told Reuters. The equipment would be funded using presidential drawdown authority, or PDA, in which the president can authorise the transfer of articles and services from US stocks without congressional approval in response to an emergency. One of the officials said final determinations were still being made about the mix of equipment. A senior congressional aide said the equipment to be announced would likely include heavy ground artillery systems to Ukraine, including howitzers. The White House said last week that it has provided more than $1.7bn in security assistance to Ukraine since the 24 February invasion of Ukraine. The congressional aide said some lawmakers had been informed within the last 24 hours about the upcoming announcement, which was expected within the next 24 to 48 hours. Weapons shipments have included defensive anti-aircraft Stinger and anti-tank Javelin missiles, as well as ammunition and body armour. Here is a selection of some of the latest images to come out of Ukraine today. Volunteers load bodies of civilians killed in Bucha onto a truck to be taken to a morgue for investigation, on the outskirts of Kyiv, Ukraine, on Tuesday. A woman shows a hole in a house after shelling in the village of Zalissya, northeast of Kyiv. Firefighters work to extinguish a fire after a Russian attack destroyed the building of a school in Kharkiv. Polish President Andrzej Duda and the presidents of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia are on their way to Kyiv to meet Ukraine’s President Volodimir Zelensky, an adviser to the Polish leader said on Wednesday. “Our countries are showing support to Ukraine and President Zelenskiy in this way,” Jakub Kumoch, the adviser, posted on Twitter. Lithuanian president, Gitanas Nausėda, also posted an image showing himself and his team appearing to step off a Ukrainian train. “Heading to Kyiv with a strong message of political support and military assistance,” Nausėda posted to Twitter this morning. “Lithuania will continue backing Ukraine’s fight for its sovereignty and freedom.” Russia’s appointment of a new army general as commander of the war in Ukraine represents an attempt to “centralise command and control” and reflects its “ineffective pre-war planning”, forcing Russia to reassess its operations, the UK’s Ministry of Defence has said. The latest British intelligence report, published just after 6am GMT, reads: Russia’s appointment of Army Gen. Alexander Dvornikov as commander of the war in Ukraine represents an attempt to centralise command and control. An inability to cohere and coordinate military activity has hampered Russia’s invasion to date. Like many senior Russian generals, Dvornikov has previous command experience in Syria. Furthermore, since 2016 he has commanded Russia’s Southern Military District bordering Ukraine’s Donbas region. Russian messaging has recently emphasised progressing offensives in the Donbas as Russia’s forces refocus eastwards. Dvornikov’s selection further demonstrates how determined Ukrainian resistance and ineffective pre-war planning have forced Russia to reassess its operations. Joe Biden has accused Russia of carrying out genocide in Ukraine, saying that Vladimir Putin is “trying to wipe out the idea of even being Ukrainian”. Biden first used the word in passing on Tuesday at a domestic policy event in Iowa about the use of ethanol in petrol. “Your family budget, your ability to fill up your tank, none of it should hinge on whether a dictator declares war and commits genocide half a world away,” he said. Questioned later on whether he intended to apply the term to Russians actions in Ukraine, Biden told journalists: “Yes, I called it genocide because it’s become clearer and clearer that Putin is just trying to wipe out the idea of even being Ukrainian. “And the evidence is mounting,” he said. “More evidence is coming out of the horrible things that the Russians have done in Ukraine. And we’re going to only learn more and more about the devastation. We’ll let the lawyers decide internationally whether or not it qualifies, but it sure seems that way to me.” The prosecutor at the international criminal court in the Hague opened a case in February saying there was “a reasonable basis to believe that both alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity have been committed in Ukraine”. Proving a case under the 1948 Genocide conventions requires an “intent [by the accused] to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group”. Biden has been consistently outspoken in denouncing Russian wholesale killing of Ukrainian civilians, labelling Putin as a “war criminal” in mid-March. Multiple investigations are under way into Russian atrocities in Ukraine, which include the razing of Mariupol and the executions of civilians in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha. Satellite images suggest Russia is building up troops and equipment in at least three regions near Ukraine’s eastern border. According to images released by Maxar Technologies, a convoy of armoured vehicles and trucks was seen on a highway in the village of Vilkhuvatka, near Kharkiv, over the weekend. Multiple deployment areas and equipment in revetments were also seen at Kherson airbase with on April 7 with some of the vehicles displaying the Z marking. A closer view of a convoy of military vehicles was purported to be seen near Bilokurakyne in the Luhansk region in east Ukraine earlier this week. Hello and welcome back to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I will be bringing you all the latest developments as they unfold. Here is a comprehensive re-cap of where things stand: US president Joe Biden has labelled Russia’s actions in Ukraine as “genocide”, saying Russian president Vladimir Putin “is trying to wipe out the idea of being able to be Ukrainian”. “We’ll let the lawyers decide internationally whether or not it qualifies, but it sure seems that way to me,” he added. Ukranian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy promptly responded: “True words of a true leader. Calling things by their names is essential to stand up to evil.” Putin’s closest ally in Ukraine, Viktor Medvedchuk, has been captured by Ukrainian law enforcement. Medvedchuk is the leader of the Opposition Platform for Life, Ukraine’s biggest opposition party. Zelenskiy proposed releasing him to Russia in exchange for Ukrainians captured by Russian forces. Zelenskiy also warned Russia: “Let Medvedchuk be an example for you. Even the former oligarch did not escape, not to mention much more ordinary criminals from the Russian boondocks. We will get everyone.” Zelenskiy said it is “not yet possible” to draw 100% conclusions about what kind of substance was used in Mariupol during his national address late on Tuesday. Earlier, he voiced concerns that Russian forces were preparing “a new stage of terror” that could involve the use of chemical weapons in Ukraine. Andriy Biletsky, the leader of the Azov volunteer regiment, claimed on Monday that three people in the southern port city had experienced “poisoning by warfare chemicals, but without catastrophic consequences”. The world’s chemical weapons watchdog, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), said it is “concerned” over reports of the use of chemical weapons in Mariupol. Britain’s armed forces minister James Heappey said “all options are on the table” if evidence of chemical weapons use emerges in an interview with Sky News. “There are some things that are beyond the pale, and the use of chemical weapons will get a response,” he added. Ukraine’s interior ministry said it has received $4m- worth of equipment to digitise Russia’s war crimes. “Two private companies, AXON and Benish GPS, have donated $4m-worth of special equipment (chest video recorders) to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine,” the agency said in an update over the Telegram messaging app. Civilians have fled eastern Ukraine in advance of a widely forecast attack and Russian forces closed in on the ruins of the southern city of Mariupol. Ukrainian forces were preparing for a new Russian offensive in the east of the country, with the governor of Luhansk, Serhiy Gaidai, urging residents to evacuate as soon as possible using agreed humanitarian corridors. The mayor of Mariupol, Vadym Boichenko, said the latest estimate was that about 21,000 civilian residents had been killed in the city since the start of the Russian invasion. The number of deaths in Mariupol could be as high as 22,000, Pavlo Kyrylenko, the head of the Donetsk regional military administration, told CNN. The mayor of the Ukrainian town of Bucha, near Kyiv, said authorities had so far found 403 bodies of people they believed were killed by Russian forces during their occupation of the area. That number was still growing, Anatoliy Fedoruk said, adding that it was too early for residents to return to the town. Putin said Ukraine had deviated from the agreements made at a peace conference in Istanbul, and that talks were in a “dead end”. When asked about the Russian president’s comments, a member of the Ukrainian delegation, Mykhailo Podolyak, said negotiations with Russians were very hard but were continuing. Vladimir Putin also claimed Russia’s military operation was going as planned, and that Russia’s aim in Ukraine was to meet all its goals and minimise losses. “We will achieve our objectives, there are no doubts,” Putin told workers at the Vostochny cosmodrome in Russia’s far east. “Its goals are absolutely clear and noble,” he said of Russia’s military campaign. He said Russia “had no other choice” but to launch what he calls a “special military operation”, and vowed it would “continue until its full completion and the fulfilment of the tasks that have been set”. The Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, defended Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, claiming it was a pre-emptive strike against the west. The World Bank is planning financial support to Ukraine worth $1.5bn (£1.2bn) to help keep critical services running as the country fights a fresh assault by Russia. The bank said the funds would be used to support the continuation of key government services, including wages for hospital workers, pensions for elderly people and social programmes for vulnerable people. Without Europe’s abandonment of Russia’s energy resources and the complete restriction of Russia’s banking system, Russia’s leadership will not attempt to seek peace, Zelenskiy argued. Ukraine’s border force said more than 870,000 people who fled abroad since Russia’s invasion have returned to the country, including a growing number of women and children, AFP reports. US president Joe Biden’s administration is expected to announce another $750m in military assistance for Ukraine as soon as Wednesday, two US officials familiar with the matter told Reuters. The Pentagon will host leaders from the top eight US weapons manufacturers on Wednesday to discuss the industry’s capacity to meet Ukraine’s weapons needs if the war with Russia lasts years, two people familiar with the meeting said on Tuesday. The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, spoke with Biden on Tuesday to discuss boosting military and economic support to Ukraine as well as the need to end western reliance on Russian oil and gas."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/oct/17/gen-z-on-how-to-save-the-world-young-climate-activists-speak-out","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-10-17T06:00:19Z","webTitle":"Gen Z on how to save the world: young climate activists speak out","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/oct/17/gen-z-on-how-to-save-the-world-young-climate-activists-speak-out","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/oct/17/gen-z-on-how-to-save-the-world-young-climate-activists-speak-out","fields":{"headline":"Gen Z on how to save the world: young climate activists speak out","bodyText":"When I was 20, I dropped out of university to live on a road protest. I was terrified by the oncoming apocalypse of climate change, and loathed the short-term, environmentally catastrophic logic that prioritised road-building over trees. The data, even in 1997, was clear: human activity was heating the globe, with increasingly devastating effects. Time was short, and a sea change in behaviour was required. Nearly a quarter of a century has passed since then, and very little has been achieved, thanks in large part to corporate interests invested in maintaining our dependence on non-renewable resources. Far more people understand and accept the reality of anthropogenic climate change, and yet we seem paralysed by despair, caught in a spell of inertia, even as the most lurid of predictions – floods, fires, plagues – come to pass. I say we, but the generation born into the reality of global heating are refusing to accept this lethal status quo. The testimonies of these teens and early twenty-somethings are humbling and often thrilling. By setting up a student bank based on recycling waste, José Adolfo Quisocala single-handedly changed child poverty and environmental pollution in his town in Peru. Though their projects vary widely, these young activists have a strikingly shared sense of what must be changed, from education and the foregrounding of indigenous voices to making people appreciate the value of nature. As Hilda Flavia Nakabuye, an activist from Uganda, says: “We are a generation of scared people. But we are very persistent. And very united.” This is the kind of vision and ambition necessary from the delegates at COP26. The stakes could not be higher. If only our leaders had the courage of these kids. Olivia Laing Marinel Ubaldo, 24, Philippines It was in November 2013 that the urgency of the climate crisis became clear to Marinel Ubaldo. A typhoon had been forecast in the Philippines and it was due to hit the peaceful village in Eastern Visayas where she lived with her family. Initially, she wasn’t especially worried. “We had been living with typhoons all our lives – it was not new to us,” she remembers. Her father, a fisherman, told her to go to a nearby shelter that was on higher ground. It was the right decision: Haiyan hit the Philippines with winds up to 195mph, one of the world’s strongest ever typhoons. Buildings that Ubaldo had thought were strong were ripped apart in seconds. More than 7,360 people were killed or went missing and at least 4 million were displaced. The disaster dramatically altered the way Ubaldo saw the planet. “It gave me a new perspective on what the future could be,” she says. Two years later, Ubaldo won a scholarship to study social work in Tacloban, a city devastated by the typhoon, working alongside studying so that she could help her family, who had lost everything as a result of the typhoon. Increasingly, she devoted her time to fighting the climate crisis. Ubaldo has since protested at Shell’s Manila headquarters, in front of the Wall Street Bull in New York, and helped organise the first climate youth strike in Eastern Visayas. Her proudest moment, she says, was testifying as a community witness to the Philippines Commission on Human Rights as part of their investigation into corporate responsibility for climate change. In 2019, the commission found that 47 major oil, coal, cement and mining companies could be held liable for the impact of their operations on Filipino citizens. The landmark ruling illustrated “the power of people”, says Ubaldo. “Even if you are poor, or just only one, or from a remote community, you have power. You can always call out corporations and leaders who are fuelling climate change.” Ubaldo, who now works full time on climate issues, focuses on supporting grassroots initiatives. She co-founded the group Youth Leaders for Environmental Action Federation, is a climate justice youth adviser for Greenpeace Philippines and also works with Living Laudato Si’ Philippines, an interfaith movement that advocates for the divestment of coal. Her work is high risk. According to Global Witness, 29 activists were killed last year in the Philippines. It is common for activists to receive threats or be subject to “red tagging” – labelled by the state as communists or terrorists. Last year, four activists and a journalist from Tacloban were arrested for possession of firearms following an illegal raid. It has been claimed that security forces had falsified evidence and Amnesty International has called for an investigation. At the time of the raid, Ubaldo received a message suggesting she too would be arrested and moved to stay with a friend as a precaution. “The thing is,” she says, “they don’t just come for you, they come for your family, for your friends… That worries me more than my own safety.” But the threats, she says, are at least a sign that those in power are hearing your voice.“This is very personal for me. If I do not continue fighting I will feel that I am betraying the people who perished because of climatic disasters. Because they are not just numbers, they are not just climate statistics.” Who is your climate villain? “The corporations, all of them. They are profiting from our suffering.” Lab beef or grass fed? “I don’t eat meat but I have to remain pescatarian or my father [a fisherman] would be really angry. When I go home I love to eat paksiw fish, which is cooked in soy sauce, vinegar and a little oil with onion and garlic. Everything is just fresh, even the herbs that you put on your food – you can just get them outside of your house.” If you had the power to make one change to combat the climate crisis, large or small, what would it be? “I would go to the community and ask them what they want and support their own grassroots climate actions. And I would let the fossil fuels stay in the ground.” Rebecca Ratcliffe Anjali Sharma, 17, Australia Not many 17-year-olds have ground-breaking judicial decisions named after them, but as lead litigant in Sharma and others v Minister for the Environment, Anjali Sharma achieved that world first when Judge Bromberg ruled in May this year that the minister did have a duty of care not to harm children. Sharma became involved in School Strike 4 Climate in 2019 after hearing about the impact climate change had on relatives who are farmers in India. “This stuff drives people to anxiety, it drives people to tears because it’s just so real for us right now,” she says. Her hope with the legal case was to stop the extension of a coal mine in New South Wales. But last month, the expansion was approved. Sharma found out by text message between school exams. “We went to court in a completely novel legal battle and we won, and yet [Australian environment minister] Sussan Ley approved the mine. Sometimes it feels like nothing is happening,” she says. Plenty is happening for Sharma. First, the Australian government is appealing against the duty of care ruling later this month, then she has exams. She’s also focused on her twin passions of music and netball. “At school everyone knows me as ‘that kid’. It’s completely different when I go to netball where I can be a normal teenage girl – because that’s what I am.” If you could make one change… “I’d cut all Australian government ties with mining companies such as Origin and Santos, which have constantly procured grants for new fossil fuel exploration projects and influenced Australia’s climate policy due to their Australian political connections. Instead I’d have our climate policy influenced by our First Nations people and those on the frontlines. These are the people who have a true connection and love for the land.” Meg Keneally Aadya Joshi, 18, India/US For years, twice a day Aadya Joshi walked past a scrapyard in her neighbourhood of south Mumbai on her way to and from school. Originally meant to be the garden of the local police station, it had become an overgrown, toxic eyesore with a decade’s waste festering in the heat. When she was 15, in her summer holidays, Joshi decided to do something about it. “I walked in to the police station and was like, ‘Can I please clean your garden?’” recalls Joshi. “It took three or four weeks of me just being like, ‘Please, please, please, please, please,’ and coming back every day, rain or shine. I had to convince them that I was not going to flake halfway and leave them with more work.” The plot of land is long and thin: about the dimensions of a cricket wicket. But, over the course of four Sundays in the summer, with help from local residents, Joshi did more than clear it. She replanted it with native Indian plants and trees. It was gruelling but rewarding work: “When I say toxic I really mean it,” says Joshi. “The first day that we cleaned up I made the mistake of not wearing gloves and I was sick for two weeks.” The idea for native planting came from Joshi’s reading on the Miyawaki method of afforestation and the work of University of Delaware ecologist Douglas Tallamy. These both argue that planting the right trees can have a significant impact on restoring insect and animal biodiversity. The results in Mumbai were pretty well instantaneous: monkeys now hang out at the police station, and butterflies and birds have made the garden their home. “It’s definitely difficult being a kid telling adults what to do,” says Joshi. “Not everyone is always receptive, but I think there’s a benefit with having actual science to back up what you’re saying.” After creating the garden, Joshi developed a database of 2,000 plants indigenous to the Indian subcontinent and last year was awarded the annual Children’s Climate prize, founded by Swedish energy company Telge Energi. She also began planning larger projects, but these were curtailed first by Covid, and now because she has just started as an undergraduate on the Earth Systems Program at Stanford University. Her advice for others looking to follow in her footsteps is to start small. “If you bite off more than you can chew in the beginning, you stagnate and you lose motivation,” she says. “But something small, like your neighbourhood police station, it’s very manageable.” Who is your climate hero? “Dr Douglas Tallamy. His book Bringing Nature Home is all about how native plants preserve biodiversity. The whole point was to take that research and put it into a local context for India.” How do you relax? “A good book. Recently Indica: A Deep Natural History of the Indian Subcontinent by Pranay Lal and In the Kingdom of Ice by Hampton Sides. It’s very depressing, but it’s very good.” If you could make one change… “It would be to plant native everywhere.” Tim Lewis Hilda Flavia Nakabuye, 24, Uganda “Your beds may be comfortable for now but not for long,” Hilda Flavia Nakabuye told the 2019 World Mayors Summit in Copenhagen. “You will soon feel the same heat we feel every day.” As a child, Nakabuye watched heavy rains, strong winds and drought gradually devastate her grandparents’ farm. Cassava, matoke and potato gardens withered; livestock died and eventually her family was forced to sell off the land. At Kampala University, she made the connection that their suffering was a direct result of global heating and in 2019 she founded Uganda’s Fridays for Future campaign, which now has 53,000 youth members. Nakabuye is fiercely critical of the unequal representation of countries from the global south in terms of decision-making . She is campaigning for equal participation for the Most Affected People and Areas (Mapa) at Cop26, where she says it is vital to drum into world leaders that “global emissions are [currently] expected to rise by 16% by 2030 yet we need to drop them by 50% by 2030.” “We are a generation of scared people,” she says, “but we are very persistent. And very united.” If you could make one change… “Haha, that sounds like a lot of power! Within one hour I would shut down all fossil fuel industries.” Sarah Donaldson Yusuf Baluch, 17, Pakistan Yusuf Baluch became an activist last year in the wake of a massive forest fire near his home town of Gwadar, southwest Pakistan, though he says the climate crisis has shadowed his life since childhood. Now he spends much of his time organising for Fridays for Future and engaging in school strikes, despite the threat of arrest from Pakistan’s military. “Giving up is not an option,” he says. “I have to fight on.” If you could make one change… “There should be climate clubs and centres everywhere, at a local level, so people can get educated – so we can fight this together.” Killian Fox Vic Barrett, 22, US Vic Barrett does not speak Polish. The tattoo artist he met did not have much English. But, during some downtime at the 2018 United Nations climate change conference in Katowice, Barrett presented his arm to him along with a rough sketch of a geometric design featuring the number “370”, the “greater than” sign and two diamonds. “We still had a pretty good time,” says the 22-year-old Barrett now, laughing. “And it was a special trip and it just felt right to somehow commemorate it.” The 370 in the tattoo refers to a measurement in parts per million of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere: this was the level it was at when Barrett was born in 1999. It’s now more than 400ppm, which most scientists agree is a hazardous indicator of human-made climate change. Barrett turns serious: “The tattoo is a reminder to myself and to others that there are generations of young people who have been born into a world that we know scientifically is incapable of sustaining them,” he says. “It’s highlighting this unique experience of being a young person on the planet right now.” Barrett’s awakening to the climate emergency came in 2012, when Hurricane Sandy tore up the east coast of North America. He was living in New York and while the damage was widespread – around 650,000 homes were destroyed; 8.5 million people were stranded without power – he noticed that the devastation was especially severe for low and middle-income people, whose homes were more likely to be built in flood-prone areas and who were less likely to have insurance. Aged 14, Barrett, who has black and indigenous Honduran heritage, began working with the nonprofit Global Kids and dived deep into “environmental racism”. In 2015, Barrett was one of a group of 21 young people who sued the US government for violating their fifth and ninth amendment rights by encouraging the use of fossil fuels since the 1960s. Juliana v United States has now been in the courts for a quarter of Barrett’s life and the case continues to rumble on. Much of the past six years has clearly been thrilling: speaking at the UN, hanging out with Greta Thunberg, becoming a powerful voice of youth activism. But Barrett hopes that the next generation will not have to follow his path. “I don’t really want my kids to have to sue the US federal government or to have to be environmental activists in school, to speak at the UN,” he says. “I’m sure that would be awesome for them, but I don’t want them to have to fight the way we did.” Who is your climate hero? “Berta Cáceres. She’s a Honduran water protector, who ended up being killed for fighting against a dam that was going to harm the indigenous people of her community.” And your climate villain? “Hypocritical politicians. In the US now we have an administration that claims to have more progressive values, but, for example, there are still pipelines being built through indigenous-treaty territories.” If you had the power to make one change to help solve the climate crisis what would it be? “I want to see a better version of the United Nations framework convention on climate change (UNFCCC) process. Right now it’s all hired negotiators from different countries and their whole job is to negotiate. I would like to see more indigenous leaders included, more black leaders included, more leaders from the global south included.” How do you relax? “I like to go kayaking, hang out with my friends, go out to the bar sometimes, play video games. Regular kiddo stuff.” TL José Adolfo Quisocala, 16, Peru When he was seven, José Adolfo Quisocala created a bank for school friends in his home town of Arequipa, Peru, to save money to buy books, stationery and uniforms. Now, nine years later, the Bartselana Student Bank has 6,700 clients, all aged under 18. As well as saving, children can earn money by bringing plastic and paper to recycle at school drop-offs – the money is automatically credited to their bank accounts. Every month, the bank recycles between 15 and 16 tonnes of paper and plastic through local companies. The idea came to Quisocala when he saw children begging at traffic lights and wondered how he could help them and their families earn and save, as well as recycle household rubbish that would otherwise become litter or go into landfill. He missed out on school to pursue his idea, but it was worth it, he says. “In my town, I was able to considerably reduce the level of child poverty, the school drop-out rate and environmental pollution.” Quisocala also helped create the Bartselana Foundation, which converts donations of recyclable waste from local companies into funds to combat child hunger and improve education. Since the onset of the pandemic, the foundation has been making free online educational videos – explaining, for example, how to distinguish different types of plastics and paper for recycling – which it puts out via social media. “This is such important and relevant information that is not taught in school, that we had to make it public and free to watch,” says Quisocala. Now 16, he plans to hand over the running of the bank to a new (also young) CEO in order to go to university. He intends to continue his social activism, working with the “least-favoured or forgotten groups in Latin America” and helping them profit by carrying out environmental services. If you could make one change… “I would teach children, the young, adults and senior citizens what awaits us in the future if we continue living the way we are now. The climate plays a role in every aspect of our lives; our money, our health, agriculture, our flora and fauna. With education, people can take small steps to improve the relationship between humans and nature.” Dan Collyns Melati, 18, and Isabel Wijsen, 20, Bali It was a school lesson on Nelson Mandela and Martin Luther King that made sisters Melati and Isabel Wijsen think about how they could change the world and in 2013, aged 10 and 12, they launched Bye Bye Plastic Bags, an initiative to stop single-use bags which is now active in 30 countries. “It organically started to grow,” explains Melati, now 20. “Young people could see a real-life example of what was possible.” The girls’ campaign was exemplary. They started making educational booklets to explain the dangers of marine pollution and set up a pilot scheme for a plastic-free village. Next came a how-to video on making a river barrier from recycled material to prevent rubbish reaching the sea and a social enterprise scheme employing local women to make reusable bags. In 2018 they resorted to hunger strike when the governor of Bali wouldn’t meet and discuss government policy. He caved in two days later and by 2019, single-use plastic bags were banned from the island. Now the Wijsens have launched an online learning platform called Youthopia. “It has masterclasses, workshops and mentorship. We want it to become the world’s HQ for young change-makers.” It’s hard to imagine they won’t make it happen. If you could make one change… “I would adapt the education system to teach about these problems and create spaces for innovation. Young people are not given the tools or the guidance to think big and create new systems.” Alice Fisher Scarlett Westbrook, 17, UK Scarlett Westbrook is a 17-year-old with an open expression, friendly smile and plaits like bell-pulls. It would be natural to assume – had you never heard her speak – that she was an ordinary schoolgirl and not the formidable climate justice activist she is. But by the age of 10, Scarlett was already going on marches and canvassing for local elections (at the time, she was “really into” Ed Miliband’s climate policies). She has grown up in inner-city Birmingham and her encouraging parents – not in any political party themselves – would tag along with her as she knocked on doors. It must have been clear then that Scarlett was not born to be one of life’s passengers. At 13, she distinguished herself by passing an A-level in government and politics – the youngest person ever to do so. She taught herself in seven months. Her speciality was climate and education which was what, in part, led to her later work as a member of the UK Student Climate Network (UKSCN). Neither her parents nor her teachers believed Scarlett when she told them she intended to sit the A-level, so Westbrook emailed the exam board… “I kept arguing until I got my way!” (A useful talent in an activist.) Westbrook has been one of the leading organisers of the school strikes in Birmingham and is the youngest known “regular policy writer” in parliamentary history. She won the Women of the Future Young Star award in 2020 and the Diana award this year, for humanitarian work. Scarlett is invariably modest about her achievements – not wishing to distract from what matters most to her. She now heads up Teach the Future, the impressive student-led campaign founded by her friend Joe Brindle, which aims to transform the British education system by putting the climate at its centre. It is responsible for “the first ever student bill, the English Climate Emergency Education Act” and for holding a parliamentary reception, organised and led by Westbrook, for more than 100 MPs and Lords. (It has secured cross-party support from everyone except the DUP.) She argues that climate should be “woven like a golden thread into every single subject”. And her own thinking proves impressively joined up: she talks eloquently about climate crisis in relation to capitalism, colonialism, gender inequality and pandemics. Teach the Future’s research shows that “only 4% of students feel they know a great deal about [the climate emergency]”. But the percentage of students who are concerned is much higher (with six in 10 said to be “extremely worried” ). Scarlett believes climate action and strong community support are the way forward, adding: “Our government could choose to act on the climate but is actively choosing not to…” While she believes in the importance of individual action, she is keen to emphasise the shocking figures that reveal collective responsibility: “A hundred companies are responsible for 71% of [global] emissions,” she says, while “the entire continent of Africa is responsible for only 2-3% of emissions.” She points out that 70% of flights are taken by 15% of people. Listening to her, I find myself daydreaming that she could make, one day, the most amazing prime minister. But when I ask if she is planning to become a politician, she flinches. “Absolutely not. I specifically want to go into medicine. I want to be a humanitarian trauma surgeon working in natural disasters or war to help people out. With the climate crisis, that is going to be an increasingly important job.” How do you relax? “It often feels like the weight of the future is on our shoulders so it is really important to wind down and spend time with people you care about to maintain your capacity to act, and your wellbeing.” Solar or nuclear? “Solar!” If you could make one change… “I would implement an international Green New Deal, which would aim not only to decarbonise the economy through a 10-year, government-led mobilisation but also to create jobs and to bridge the inequality divide through investment in the areas that need it most.” Kate Kellaway Fionn Ferreira, 20, Ireland “My two loves are exploring and inventing,” says 20-year-old Fionn Ferreira, who won the top global award at the 2019 Google Science Fair for his work on reducing plastic pollution in water. It was while kayaking around the coast of West Cork, where he grew up, that Ferreira became keenly aware of the problem – not just large plastics bobbing on the waves but microplastics pervading the water around him. Aged 15, he designed his own spectrometer to measure the amount of microplastics in local water – the readings were so high that at first he thought the machine was broken. Then he set about finding a way to remove them. “I thought, what’s plastic made of? It’s made of crude oil. And why does crude oil float on top of water? Because the polarity is different.” By adding magnetite to oil, he discovered that he could attract the microplastics in a sample of water and remove the vast majority of them with a magnet. Now the chemistry undergrad has created his own startup, Fionn &amp; Co, and has received funding from Robert Downey Jr’s Footprint Coalition to build a prototype device that can filter more than 90% of microplastics from tap water. He hopes to expand the technology to work in wastewater treatment plants and even at the mouths of rivers, while letting his inventive mind fly in other directions too. Winning awards and backing at such a young age has given Ferreira a sense that youth should not be a barrier to effecting real change. “I feel like we need more people involved in innovation and invention at a small level, because every idea has the power to make a difference,” he says. If you could make one change… “We need to get everybody to fall in love with the environment and be really, really angry about what’s happening to it. Because only with everybody on board, doing their bit, can we create change.” KF Mya-Rose Craig, 19, UK Mya-Rose Craig was nine days old when she first went birdwatching near her home in Bristol. “My parents and my older sister were massive birdwatchers. I can’t remember a time when I didn’t love birds,” she says. She has been blogging about birds as Birdgirl since she was 11 and posting on Twitter as @BirdgirlUK since the age of 12. “That was when I started becoming passionate about environmental issues, especially climate change,” she says. It was also around this time she started noticing something about outdoor spaces. “My mum is Bangladeshi and my sister and I are half Bangladeshi and I became aware that I never saw anyone who looked like us out in the countryside. As I looked into it, I realised this wasn’t a superficial thing, it was systemic exclusion linked to the racial make-up of conservation bodies and the costs of getting into nature, among other things. Conversations with my cousins made me aware that birding and being in the outdoors are seen by non-white people as really white hobbies.” Craig set up Black2Nature, a non-profit organisation that campaigns for equal access to nature for all, runs nature camps and activities for people traditionally excluded from the countryside and campaigns to make the nature conservation and environmental sectors ethnically diverse. Her activism has won her a platform on television (Springwatch, Countryfile) and radio (Start the Week) and a doctorate in science from the University of Bristol. Now 19 and studying at Cambridge University, Craig has just published We Have a Dream (Magic Cat), a book of interviews with 30 young environmental activists of colour – “people who weren’t getting the platform from the media that they deserve”. If you could make one change…. “I’d get genuine action from our leaders, right now.” Lisa O’Kelly Iris Duquesne, 18, France Dubbed “France’s Greta Thunberg” by the French media, Iris Duquesne was 16 when she joined 15 other teenage climate activists, including Thunberg, in late 2019 to bring a landmark legal complaint to the United Nations against France, Brazil, Germany, Turkey and Argentina. Their charge – that these countries were violating their rights as children by not taking sufficient measures against climate change – resonated around the globe. Last week the UN declared it was unable to rule on the case, saying the young people must first bring lawsuits in each of the five state’s national courts, despite tomes of case law showing that no such procedures would succeed. Speaking through her legal team at the non-profit Earthjustice, Duquesne said: “We are all very disappointed but unfortunately not surprised. We have seen governments and officials ignore the climate crisis over and over again and today was no exception. The fight for climate justice is not over, and we will keep pushing with or without the Committee’s help.” If you could make one change…. “I’d use education worldwide to instil a real sense of climate responsibility in the next generation.” LO’K Jakob Blasel, 21, Germany Jakob Blasel’s blond curls have been a regular sight at Fridays for Future protests in Germany since the then 18-year-old organised the country’s first climate strike, outside the regional parliament in Kiel in December 2018. He proved a canny organiser and passionate motivator, rallying students through WhatsApp chat groups or by spraying messages on the pavement outside their schools. “From day one it was very important to me that Fridays for Future wasn’t just made up of kids who already cared about environmental issues,” he says. “It was about starting a movement that spoke to an entire generation.” Three years later, Blasel is knocking on the doors of the Bundestag in Berlin: as a Green party candidate in his home constituency in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany’s northernmost state, he gained 23,831 votes at September’s federal elections, only narrowly missing out on a parliamentary seat via the party’s list. The eldest of three brothers, Blasel says he was vaguely aware of climate change as a child. “But it wasn’t until I was 15-16 that the climate crisis became something that caused me distress.” In 2017 he watched a Norwegian documentary about the global textile industry. “How could it be, I asked myself, that my teenage peers and I were wearing clothes that were produced under inhumane conditions in the global south? From that, I moved on to thinking about how clothes could be produced in a way that was not just socially fairer, but also more environmentally sustainable.” The teenager started wearing more secondhand clothes, and he convinced his parents to switch to get their electricity from renewable providers. “But there was a point where that approach reached a limit: even if I change my behaviour as a consumer, we’re still headed for an ecological and societal crisis. If I really cared about making a difference, I realised, I needed to take a political approach.” In his campaign and on social media, Blasel describes himself as an “1.5C ultra”, claiming a term usually employed by fanatical football supporters. “Maybe that’s a little bit of a joke,” he says, “but in terms of real politics, it means I am convinced that every possible effort needs to be made to limit global warming to 1.5C. “Now I see a lot of politicians realising that we need to have more ambitious climate targets. But they are still telling fairytales about how we will get there: that technology will magically solve climate change, that we just need to leave it up to the markets. We already have these technologies, we just need to use them. And at the moment that’s not happening to the right extent.” Blasel says his run for the Bundestag has made him understand better why the political debate on the climate crisis has got stuck, and how it could be made to start moving again. “Being an activist means constantly pushing your own interest to the foreground, while the art of being a politician lies in reconciling different interests.” The German Green party could hold a key role in the next government, as one of three coalition partners in a liberal-left power-sharing deal. Blasel says he’s planning to slip back into his old activist roles to remind his party of its promises while coalition talks are ongoing. “I will keep on giving my best to fight the climate crisis. Whether I do that from parliament or as an activist is almost irrelevant.” Who is your climate hero? “Stefan Rahmstorf, the German climatologist who was one of the earliest scientists to lay bare the dramatic extent of the climate crisis.” Solar or nuclear? “Solar. People don’t feel safe around nuclear power plants. I don’t think most people who are still evangelising about nuclear power have thought their position through.” If you had the power to make one change to help solve the climate crisis what would it be? “The switch to renewable energy has to be the basis for every step we take to address the crisis.” Philip Oltermann Disha Ravi, 22, India Disha Ravi experienced climate change growing up in rural India long before she knew what it was. “My grandparents are farmers and faced water shortages; my mother had to carry water from the common well before she left for school and none of us realised that this was the result of the climate crisis. Only when I was 18 did I understand it – and the inaction from our leaders.” Ravi co-founded the Indian branch of Fridays for Future (FFF) in 2019 and spent two years organising workshops, local clean-ups and tree planting. She is also the family breadwinner, with her job at a vegan food company in Bengaluru, where she lives with her mother. One campaign close to her heart was the 2020–2021 Indian farmers protest when a set of farm bills that seemed to favour corporations over farmers sparked huge outcry in India, especially over minimum prices for produce. When Greta Thunberg tweeted about the campaign in February, it was Ravi who made international headlines. She was arrested for sedition and criminal conspiracy and taken to Delhi where she was held for 10 days. Police said a social media toolkit Ravi had edited for the campaign had caused disaffection and disinformation. Ravi is unable to discuss her ongoing legal case but her campaigning spirit is undiminished. “I have seen my own house fill with water in a landlocked city, trees cut to grow the GDP, and poison released in rivers as businesses push off responsibility. I refuse to let this continue for others.” If you could make one change… “People in India face the climate crisis on a daily basis, but access to the latest science around the environment is still limited to elite private schools. Education will bring about awareness and the climate action we need.” AF Lesein Mutunkei, 17, Kenya Lesein Mutunkei was 12 when he decided that for every football goal he scored, he’d plant a tree. He realised the idea could go big – after all, “the climate crisis is a universal problem and football is a universal game”. He got his school in Nairobi signed up and started Trees for Goals as a movement. In 2019, aged 14, he went to the Kenyan Ministry of Environment and the scheme became national. This year he’s a Children’s Climate prize finalist. If you could make one change… “I would ensure Fifa, all leagues, clubs and schools and 3.5 billion fans across the world took up Trees for Goals and use the power of football to tackle deforestation, which is the second biggest contributor to climate change.” AF Amy and Ella Meek, 18 and 16, UK Amy and Ella Meek founded Kids Against Plastic in 2016 after finding out for the first time about the effects of plastic pollution. The sisters were being home schooled and their parents, both teachers, decided they should learn about the UN’s global goals for sustainable development. The goal that piqued their interest was number 14: Life below water. “We started seeing all these images of sea creatures tangled up in plastic,” says Amy, now 18. “It was just heartbreaking to see and really shocking.” “Plastic pollution wasn’t so much in the news then, so we were completely unaware of how the plastic we were using and throwing away was having such a negative impact,” says Ella, 16. “We realised that a lot of other ordinary people were probably unaware of it too, so we decided to take action.” Their campaign against plastic waste had small beginnings. “We were quite young, only 10 and 12, so we started off by litter picking. As soon as we started picking up plastic we saw how quickly it was being replaced and that was really motivating,” says Ella. In the five years since the sisters have picked up a massive 96,685 pieces of single-use plastic. Their target is 100,000, because that is the number of sea mammals that die each year as a result of being trapped in plastic or eating it. They have also given hundreds of talks at schools and festivals, including a TEDx talk, and launched nationwide “Plastic Clever” schemes to help UK schools, restaurants, businesses, festivals and councils to reduce the amount of single-use plastic they use. How do you both relax? “We’re just normal teenagers so if we’re not campaigning we’ll spend time together, watch TV, read books, talk to our friends.” Lab beef or grass-fed? “We’re vegan!” If you could make one change… “We’d make sure people with the power to take action take on board advice from young people.” LO’K Noga Levy-Rapoport, 19, UK In 2019, Noga Levy-Rapoport, just 17 at the time, was instrumental in organising the massive 20 September climate strikes across the UK. This involved “months of tireless work – emails, backroom meetings, travelling from school to workplace to company HQs to persuade as many as we could to join us on the streets”. Levy-Rapoport, now a full-time student at Warwick University as well as continuing to energetically campaign, believes “the impact of that work can still be seen today”. If you could make one change… “I’d ensure governments and global leaders put an end to the greenwashing that corporations are constantly using. Greenwashing places all responsibility for an international, terrifyingly huge crisis on us as consumers, rather than on fossil fuel companies for taking advantage of our people and planet. Corporations like BP and Shell, responsible for so much damage to our environment, know that a decarbonised world is possible, a sustainable future and equitable society is possible, but for that to exist we have to end the unregulated power they have over our energy, jobs, and livelihoods.” KF Jamie Margolin, 19, US A Colombian-American from Seattle, Margolin founded the coalition Zero Hour in 2017, which led the Youth Climate March the following July. She was one of 13 children who sued the state of Washington in 2018 for infringing their constitutional rights by “actively worsening the climate crisis”. She now studies film-making at NYU, continuing to campaign climate matters and queer rights. If you could make one change… “I would halt all deforestation and destruction of natural places.” KF Autumn Peltier, 17, Canada “I was eight years old and attending a water ceremony in a First Nations community not far from mine,” says Autumn Peltier, recalling the moment that spurred her to become a clean-water advocate. “I went to the bathroom and all along the hallways there were signs that read ‘Do not drink the water’ and ‘Boil water advisory in effect’.” Quizzing her mother afterwards, she learned that the drinking water in this community, in northern Ontario, Canada, had been contaminated for 24 years. Now, aged just 17, Peltier is chief water commissioner for the Anishinabek Nation. She first attracted attention when, at the Assembly of First Nations in 2017, she told prime minister Justin Trudeau that she was “very unhappy” with his record on water protection and oil pipeline projects. The following year, she addressed world leaders at the UN General Assembly on the subject of water pollution. “Those platforms tell me that my message is being heard and Canada has to answer at that level,” she says. “It shows me I’m being effective for the water, the children and our rights as indigenous people of this land.” If you could make one change… “I would encourage any new member of parliament to spend a week on the land and in a community that can’t drink water and live in the houses that need repairing. Have the ones in power experience what we are fighting for and why we do this advocacy work.” KF Grace Maddrell, 16, UK After attending a first climate school strike as barely a teenager, Grace Maddrell, at just 16, has now published Tomorrow Is Too Late (Indigo Press), a book of essays and stories by young activists from around the world illustrating why it is imperative that we act now to avert climate catastrophe.

Already pursuing one of the most ambitious nuclear new-build agendas in the world, Britain is seeking to buck 50 years of experience to develop an entirely new and untested design of small modular reactors (SMRs). In 2016, then energy and climate secretary, Amber Rudd, summed up the government’s position: “Investing in nuclear is what this government is all about for the next 20 years.” Despite unique levels of long-term policy support, this nuclear new-build programme is severely delayed, with no chance of operations beginning as intended “significantly before 2025”, Costs have mushroomed, with even government figures showing renewables like offshore wind to already be far more affordable. With renewable costs still plummeting, global investments in these alternatives are now already greater than for all conventional generating technologies put together. With worldwide momentum so clear, the scale of UK nuclear ambitions are an international anomaly. Unswerving British nuclear support contrasts sharply with obstructive national policy on other technologies. In 2015 various strategies supporting renewables and energy efficiency were abandoned, with the cheapest UK low-carbon power (onshore wind), effectively halted. The consequences of these cuts are now clear. The output of community energy projects has fallen by 99.4%. National investment in renewables has halved. Meanwhile, UK industrial strategy continues to prioritise nuclear. Nuclear R&amp;D gets 12 times as much funding as renewables in the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy’s “Energy Innovation Programme”. Instead of considering alternatives to spiralling nuclear costs, the UK government is looking to accommodate them with entirely new models of public financing. It seems clear that – for some undeclared reason and regardless of comparative costs or global trends – Britain simply must have new nuclear power. The depth of this Whitehall bias creates a challenging environment for reasoned debate over British energy policy. To many, it seems scarcely believable that UK plans are so massively out of sync with current trends. The sheer weight of UK nuclear incumbency has successfully marginalised the entirely reasonable understanding that – like many technologies before it – nuclear power is simply going obsolete. With direct reasons for the UK’s eccentric national position still unstated, we should pay attention to body language. Here, clues may be found in the work of the National Audit Office (NAO). Its 2017 report of 2017 points out serious flaws in the economic case for new nuclear – highlighting “unquantified”, “strategic” reasons why the UK still prioritises new nuclear despite the setbacks and increasingly attractive alternatives. Yet the NAO remains uncharacteristically unclear as to what these reasons might be. An earlier NAO report may shed more light. Their 2008 costing of military nuclear activities states: “One assumption of the future deterrent programme is that the United Kingdom submarine industry will be sustainable and that the costs of supporting it will not fall directly on the future deterrent programme.” If the costs of keeping the national nuclear submarine industry in business must fall elsewhere, what could that other budget be? Although unstated, by far the most likely source for such support is a continuing national civil nuclear programme. And this where the burgeoning hype around UK development of SMRs comes in. Leading designs for these reactors are derived directly from submarine propulsion. British nuclear submarine reactor manufacturer Rolls-Royce is their most enthusiastic champion. But, amid intense media choreography, links between SMRs and submarines remain (aside from reports of our own work) barely discussed in the UK press. This neglect is odd, because the issues are very clear. Regretting that military programmes are no longer underwritten by civil nuclear research, a heavily redacted 2014 MoD report expresses serious concerns over the continued viability of the UK nuclear submarine industry. And Rolls-Royce itself is clear that success in securing government investment for SMRs would “relieve the Ministry of Defence of the burden of developing and retaining skills and capability” for the UK’s military nuclear sector. Other defence sources are also unambiguous that survival of the British nuclear submarine industry depends on continuation of UK civil nuclear power. Many new government initiatives focus intently on realising the military and civil synergies. Some nuclear enthusiasts have called this analysis a conspiracy theory, but these links are now becoming visible. In response to our own recent evidence to the UK Public Accounts Committee, a senior civil servant briefly acknowledged the connections. And with US civil nuclear programmes collapsing, the submarine links are also strongly emphasised by a former US energy secretary. Nuclear submarines are evidently crucial to Britain’s cherished identity as a “global power”. It seems that Whitehall’s infatuation with civil nuclear energy is in fact a military romance. So why does the UK debate on these issues remain so muted? It is now beyond serious dispute that nuclear power has been overtaken by the extraordinary pace of progress in renewables. But – for those so minded – the military case for nuclear power remains. In a democracy, it might be expected that these arguments at least be tested in public. So, the real irrationality is that an entire policy arena should so comprehensively fail to debate such crucial issues. In the end, all technologies become obsolete. If we are not honest about UK civil nuclear policy, the danger is that British democracy may go the same way."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2020/aug/08/10-best-uk-seaside-cafes-beach-shacks-chosen-by-food-writers-chefs","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2020-08-08T10:00:06Z","webTitle":"10 of the UK's best seaside cafes and beach shacks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/aug/08/10-best-uk-seaside-cafes-beach-shacks-chosen-by-food-writers-chefs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2020/aug/08/10-best-uk-seaside-cafes-beach-shacks-chosen-by-food-writers-chefs","fields":{"headline":"10 of the UK's best seaside cafes and beach shacks","bodyText":"Fresh From The Sea, Port Isaac, Cornwall Port Isaac has a medieval harbour, which once handled coal and pottery.

Ministers said they had reached an initial agreement with the Japanese conglomerate Hitachi to back the Wylfa plant but emphasised that no final decision had yet been made and negotiations were just beginning. The business secretary, Greg Clark, announcing the Wylfa agreement in the Commons, said: “For this project the government will be considering direct investment alongside Hitachi and Japanese government agencies.” The Wylfa project is expected to create thousands of jobs and generate low carbon power for around 5m homes, or around 6% of UK demand. However, the use of billions of pounds of taxpayer money will be highly controversial at a time when there is pressure to increase NHS funding and alternatives such as solar and wind power are falling in cost. For decades, ministers have opposed the idea of taking a direct stake in new nuclear projects, to avoid exposing public finances to the risk of budget overruns. In 2010, the Conservatives insisted there “must be no public underwriting of construction cost overruns” on new nuclear plants. However, the Wylfa deal overturns that position. The power station is expected to cost in the region of £16bn, financed equally by the UK government, the Japanese government and Hitachi. The government stake has also reduced the guaranteed price of power from the plant, which is paid through subsidies on household energy bills, to around £75-£77 per megawatt hour, the Guardian understands. That is much lower than the £92.50/MWh for EDF Energy’s Hinkley Point C in Somerset, criticised as “risky and expensive” by the spending watchdog. Clark said: “A key focus of discussions with Hitachi has been and will continue to be providing lower-cost electricity for consumers.” However, the figure is considerably higher than the average £62.14/MWh awarded for offshore wind farms, which are due to come online years before Wylfa is powered up in the mid-2020s. Onshore wind and solar developers believe they could build for even cheaper contracts but have been barred by government from competing for subsidies. Speaking in parliament on Monday, Clark said the UK would need new nuclear projects to meet its climate targets, particularly as electric cars take off. Rebecca Long-Bailey, Labour’s shadow business secretary, said she was pleased to hear of the progress on Wylfa after a period of uncertainty. However, she said: “I am deeply concerned in how the financing has been or will be negotiated, namely the lack of transparency or parliamentary scrutiny so far.” The Labour MP also attacked the government for indecision on whether to support a trailblazing £1.2bn tidal lagoon project in Swansea, which was backed by a government review 17 months ago. Ministers are believed to to have privately decided to turn down the clean energy scheme but in parliament Clark would only promise an update soon on the lagoon. “To assume that Swansea is somewhat redundant given the plan for investment in Wylfa is a very short-sighted outlook,” Long-Bailey said. Unions welcomed the announcement and the nuclear industry lauded it as “good news towards meeting our decarbonisation targets”. Sue Ferns, the senior deputy general secretary at the Prospect union, said taking a direct stake in Wylfa should not be a one-off for low carbon energy projects. “Brexit, our climate targets and the need to renew our energy infrastructure need to see this latest change as the start of a new approach,” she said. But Caroline Lucas, the co-leader of the Green party, said: “Taking a stake in this nuclear monstrosity would see taxpayers locked into the project and paying out for a form of electricity generation that’s not fit for the future.” Greenpeace attacked what it called a “bailout” of the project and accused Clark of being coy about what Hitachi had been offered."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2019/apr/08/john-howlett-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2019-04-08T16:03:11Z","webTitle":"John Howlett obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/apr/08/john-howlett-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2019/apr/08/john-howlett-obituary","fields":{"headline":"John Howlett obituary","bodyText":"My brother, John Howlett, who has died aged 78, had a varied career as a novelist, scriptwriter and biographer. His admiration of the rebel and actor James Dean and his research for the 1975 TV documentary James Dean: The First American Teenager led him to write a biography of the actor the same year and subsequently a West End musical, Dean, which had notable success in Japan – though less so in London. Screenplays followed for his own Murder of a Moderate Man (1985), then a serial adaptation of Len Deighton’s Game, Set and Match (1988) for Granada TV, as well as several original radio plays for the BBC. He also co-wrote an outline story for a film, Crusaders, which became the basis of Lindsay Anderson’s award-winning 1968 hit, If… From the mid-1970s John published a series of novels – mainly thrillers focusing on contemporary issues such as nuclear power, air safety, the Troubles in Northern Ireland and the origins of the Aids crisis. His leftwing sympathies and distrust of the establishment characterised these novels as well as much of his other work in the 80s and 90s. John’s interest in the first world war, sparked by his teenage conversations with veterans of that conflict, allied to the meticulous research that characterised all of his work, provided the basis for Love of an Unknown Soldier (2010), which became the first of a six-volume saga set against the background of the political turmoil of the first half of the 20th century, covering the rise of fascism, the Spanish civil war and the second world war. John was born in Leeds to Rex Howlett, a senior civil servant, and his wife, Leila (nee Cagna), who was born and raised in Milan. His early writing work was rooted in his experience as a rebellious student at Tonbridge school in Kent and then Jesus College, Oxford, where he studied history. It was with fellow Tonbridgean David Sherwin that he wrote Crusaders, which satirised public school life. Later in his career, never having been comfortable with the commercial world of publishing, John found new creative stimulus and freedom through self-publishing and re-issuing his work online. Living in Stone-in-Oxney, Kent, and then in Rye, East Sussex, with his Italian wife, Ada (nee Finocchiaro), whom he married in 1967, he was an active member of his local communities, renowned for his warm hospitality and strong opinions.

Mike Pompeo said the US was ready to assist Britain with whatever it needed after Beijing reportedly threatened to punish HSBC and break its commitments to build nuclear power plants in the country if the UK did not allow the Chinese technology firm Huawei to build its 5G network. “The United States stands with our allies and partners against the Chinese Communist party’s coercive bullying tactics,” Pompeo said in a statement. He added that displays of support for Beijing received little in return, although the Chinese government “continues to use the bank’s business in China as political leverage against London”. Pompeo said China’s treatment of HSBC was a “cautionary tale” and referred to the bank’s Asia Pacific chief executive, Peter Wong’s, decision to sign a petition supporting Beijing’s plans to enact new security legislation in Hong Kong. HSBC is based in London but makes the majority of its profits in Hong Kong and China. HSBC also came in for criticism from one of Britain’s biggest investors, Aviva Investors, which hit out at the bank and its rival Standard Chartered for voicing their support for China’s new laws. In a rare instance of public criticism, Aviva’s investment boss, David Cumming, said he was “uneasy” about the banks’ support “without knowing the details of the law or how it will operate in practice”, adding that corporate responsibility comes with making political statements. “Consequently, we expect both companies to confirm that they will also speak out publicly if there are any future abuses of democratic freedoms connected to this law,” he said. Aviva, which is among HSBC’s top 20 shareholders, confirmed it had spoken to senior representatives at HSBC about the issue. HSBC’s chief executive and his counterpart at Standard Chartered – which is also London-based but is one of Hong Kong’s biggest banks – have already been censured in a letter from Labour frontbench MPs, the shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, and the shadow foreign secretary, Lisa Nandy, and urged to revoke their support for Beijing’s new legislation. The members of the shadow cabinet warned the banks in a letter that they could face a boycott and urged them to uphold Britain’s democratic values. The US secretary of state has repeatedly criticised the behaviour of China and its Communist party, and its dealings with other countries, including how it trades with Australia. Pompeo added that Australia and Denmark, among other countries, had recently faced pressure from Beijing and it showed why countries should not be too reliant economically on China. The US has also long campaigned against Huawei, which Pompeo called “an extension of the Chinese Communist party’s surveillance state”, and has urged US allies not to include it in their mobile networks. Beijing’s new national security laws have been condemned inside and outside of Hong Kong over fears that they could permanently undermine its autonomy under the “one country, two systems” framework and could limit freedoms for Hong Kong citizens. The backlash against HSBC and Standard Chartered over their support for Beijing’s new legislation underlines the difficult balancing act faced by western companies that rely on the country for much of their revenue, at a time when there are growing geopolitical tensions between China, and the US and the UK. The US has been joined by Australia and Canada in its criticism of China’s imposition of new laws on the former British colony. When Hong Kong was handed back to China in 1997, its autonomy was guaranteed by a Sino-British joint declaration. Responding to a question in parliament over whether he would consider publishing a consultation paper on developing a long-term strategy for engaging with China, the prime minister called himself a “Sinophile”. However, Boris Johnson said that the UK should raise its concerns with Beijing, whether over “the protection of our critical national infrastructure or indeed over what is happening in Hong Kong”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2020/apr/16/low-demand-for-power-causes-problems-for-national-grid","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2020-04-16T17:46:15Z","webTitle":"Low demand for power causes problems for National Grid","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/16/low-demand-for-power-causes-problems-for-national-grid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2020/apr/16/low-demand-for-power-causes-problems-for-national-grid","fields":{"headline":"Low demand for power causes problems for National Grid","bodyText":"National Grid has warned that record low demand for electricity during Britain’s coronavirus lockdown could lead to windfarms and power plants being turned off, in order to avoid overloading the electricity grid. The energy system operator has forecast that the lockdown could cut demand for electricity 20% below normal levels, potentially leading to an oversupply of electricity at times. British households are using more electricity than usual through the lockdown but overall demand for power is far lower since schools, offices, factories and restaurants were forced to close last month. Roisin Quinn, the head of National Grid’s control room, said low demand could put the network under high levels of stress. She said: “The assumption will be that lower demand makes it easier for us to do our job, with less power needed overall and therefore less stress on the system. In fact, as system operator, it’s just as important for us to manage lower demand for electricity as it is to manage the peaks,” she said. The combination of high levels of power generation and low demand can raise the risk of overloading local energy grids and also reduces the energy system’s resilience to sudden changes in frequency – a measure of energy intensity – which can lead to temporary blackouts. The National Grid control room expects to pay flexible windfarms – which can power down quickly – to switch off at short notice while cutting electricity imports through subsea cables from Europe to avoid overwhelming the electricity grid. The energy system operator said it will also pay hydro power projects to act as giant “virtual batteries” by using the extra electricity to pump water up into lakes before releasing it again later if power supplies threaten to eclipse the country’s demand. National Grid’s director, Fintan Slye, said that although the situation was “very fluid” the company was “implementing a number of measures so that consumers in the UK will continue to receive secure and reliable electricity supplies during these uncertain times”. Many of these measures have been used in the past, particularly in regional networks in the north of Scotland where demand for electricity is often low while wind power levels are higher, but these are likely to be used “more frequently and for longer than in past summers”. On some days this summer electricity demand may fall below the “baseload” output from inflexible power plants, such as nuclear power reactors, which can take hours to shut down safely, meaning there is a risk that National Grid may be forced to issue emergency orders to turn off power plants to avoid overloading the grid. National Grid set out its forecasts for the summer days after electricity demand fell to record lows of 15.2GW over the Easter weekend, sharply below its forecast lows of 17.6GW for this summer due to the mild, sunny weather. “We know that millions of people rely on us every day to keep the lights on and we want to reassure everyone that we do not expect the operation of the electricity system to be adversely affected,” Quinn said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2019/jan/18/scrapping-of-nuclear-plant-should-see-uk-renewables-filling-the-void","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2019-01-18T16:13:31Z","webTitle":"Scrapping of nuclear plant should see UK renewables filling the void | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/18/scrapping-of-nuclear-plant-should-see-uk-renewables-filling-the-void","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2019/jan/18/scrapping-of-nuclear-plant-should-see-uk-renewables-filling-the-void","fields":{"headline":"Scrapping of nuclear plant should see UK renewables filling the void","bodyText":"The pulling out of Hitachi from the proposed Wylfa nuclear power plant is a good thing for energy policy – not a serious blow as said in the article (Hitachi scraps £16bn nuclear power station in Wales, 18 January). Nuclear power is now one of the most expensive form of electricity there is. But beyond the economics, it no longer fits with the digitalising world that we live in. The global energy system is undergoing change similar to that in telecoms and computers over the last few decades. The energy system is becoming smarter and more flexible and it is on the path to being operated in a completely different way than hitherto because of that. Nuclear – with its huge, inflexible output – is the equivalent of a giant boulder in the middle of a motorway. We, the energy customers of Britain, would have ended up paying way over the odds for Wylfa, which would have also undermined the UK’s move to a smart and flexible system – which really is the future. We are already going to do that for Hinkley Point C. Going down the nuclear route has been a wasted decade for UK energy policy. Exiting from the EU and the loss of flexibility we may end up with because of difficulties to do with interconnectors and market arrangements is a far greater threat to security than some phantom nuclear power plant from a previous age. Catherine Mitchell Professor of energy policy, University of Exeter • Everyone knows that nuclear power creates lethal waste which hundreds of future generations will have to manage, and, despite the risk being very low, can lead to accidents (or terrorist attacks) with enormous impacts. But Hitachi’s abandonment of the new Wylfa nuclear power station is more evidence, as if any were needed, that nuclear power is also fundamentally uneconomic. Renewable energy is already cheaper than all fossil fuels and new nuclear. And yet, £16bn spent on grid-level energy storage in the UK would enable a further plummet in the price of renewable energy – a huge boost to the UK economy, to energy independence and security, and to a cleaner future. Why do successive governments of both main parties continue to support these massive white elephants? Stephen Psallidas Newcastle upon Tyne • The withdrawal of Hitachi from the Anglesey nuclear power station project is another blow to the government’s energy policy. Obviously, the fact that solar and wind power are intermittent posits a need for a constant source to back it up. What is difficult to understand is why we can’t use tidal lagoons as the backup. The amounts of energy provided by tidal flows around Britain are almost incalculable, and the simple expedient of closing the gates and leaving millions of tons of water poised to flow through turbines whenever needed is a clear alternative to nuclear. Why aren’t we adopting it? Jeremy Cushing Exeter • What a good opportunity for the government to give the go-ahead to the environmentally friendly Swansea Bay tidal lagoon power plant. Hilda Reynolds Bristol • Energy supply is endlessly debated; less is said about demand. Building new homes to Passive House standards and retro-fitting existing buildings (all buildings) would reduce demand hugely. It would also offer local employment and skills training across all regions. Green Keynesian economics in action. Bring it on.

The quake was moderate, which can cause considerable damage, and was centred 53km (33 miles) east of Bushehr, a nuclear facility on Iran’s southern coast of the Persian Gulf. The quake struck at 5.23am local time (0153GMT), at the relatively shallow depth of 38km. There were no immediate reports of damage, Iranian state television reported. “No reports have been received on any possible damage from the earthquake,” it said. A magnitude 5 earthquake can cause considerable damage. The Bushehr nuclear power plant was designed to withstand much stronger earthquakes. “No damage has been reported to us so far based on the checks by the Red Crescent Society, village councillors and officials in the area,” Jahangir Dehqan, the head of the provincial emergency department, told the semi-official news agency ISNA. Iran sits on major fault lines and is prone to near-daily earthquakes. In 2003, a 6.6-magnitude quake flattened the historic city of Bam, killing 26,000 people. Bam is near the Bushehr nuclear plant, which wasn’t damaged at that time. In 2019 Iran announced plans to enrich uranium beyond the levels allowed under the terms of the 2015 nuclear deal after Donald Trump pulled the US out last year. Tehran says its nuclear programme is entirely for civil nuclear purposes."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2020/jul/15/seven-vessels-catch-fire-in-southern-iranian-shipyard","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2020-07-15T18:27:13Z","webTitle":"Seven vessels catch fire in southern Iranian shipyard","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/15/seven-vessels-catch-fire-in-southern-iranian-shipyard","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2020/jul/15/seven-vessels-catch-fire-in-southern-iranian-shipyard","fields":{"headline":"Seven vessels catch fire in southern Iranian shipyard","bodyText":"At least seven vessels have caught fire in a southern Iranian shipyard, in the latest in a series of explosions and fires that analysts speculate could be part of a state-sponsored sabotage campaign targeting the country’s industrial, nuclear and military sites. No casualties were reported at the port of Bushehr, the city that hosts Iran’s only nuclear power plant, but images distributed by state media showed plumes of thick smoke billowing into the air and several fire trucks at the site. “Right now, fire in the vessel-making factory of Tangak, all sectors have come in – army, fire fighters, airport,” an unnamed source said in a video from the shipyard posted on social media. Another showed dark fumes over the surrounding area: Jahangir Dehghani, the head of the provincial emergency department, said the fire broke out about 1pm and was still raging seven hours later. The cause of the fire was unclear and would be investigated after it was extinguished, he told the state-linked Tasnim news agency. Wednesday’s blaze is one of a spate of incidents across Iran in recent months including at sensitive sites that have raised suspicions the country is being subjected to a covert US or Israeli military campaign. In the past three weeks alone there has been an explosion at a centrifuge assembly facility at the Natanz nuclear site, another at a suspected missile production facility east of Tehran, reports of blasts in two towns including one that hosts military garrisons, a fire at a petrochemical facility, a deadly fire at a medical laboratory in the capital and several more blazes including at a petrochemical facility on Sunday. The Natanz blast in particular appeared to be a hostile act, targeting a facility believed to be producing advanced centrifuges capable of more quickly enriching uranium to weapons-grade levels. Iranian officials initially described the site as an “industrial shed” but later admitted the incident had caused major damage and set back its centrifuge development for the “medium term”. Israeli and US officials have declined to comment in detail, but some have offered cryptic denials that have fuelled rumours of their involvement in at least some of the incidents. Several, such as a gas explosion at a residential building in Tehran four days ago, are thought to be more likely the result of poor infrastructure, maintenance or training. Even if most were accidents, analysts said it was clear Iran’s adversaries were trying to mount something more explicit and public than Israeli and US efforts to sabotage the Iranian nuclear programme a decade ago, which involved cyber attacks and assassinations that attracted less immediate publicity. “It tells us we’ve entered a new era in this kind of shadow war,” said Dina Esfandiary, a fellow at the Century Foundation thinktank. “One where the Israelis and the Americans don’t care about the casualties or consequences of these attacks becoming public and increasingly visible, and coming under international scrutiny for carrying them out.” It was notable that Iran had resisted directly blaming Israel or the US, said Aniseh Bassiri Tabrizi, a research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute and an expert on the Iranian nuclear programme. “If it points the finger it means there has to be a response,” she said. She said Iranian leaders were understood to be waiting out Donald Trump’s presidency in the hope that he is defeated in November’s presidential elections, and then replaced by a Democratic administration more amenable to a diplomatic approach. As a result, even provocative acts such as the assassination of Revolutionary Guards general Qassem Suleimani, one of the country’s most popular officials, had drawn a response carefully calibrated aimed at avoiding escalation, she said. The sabotage incident could be an effort to goad Tehran into a confrontation before the political atmosphere shifted. “Iran has a wait-it-out strategy, but there are those who are trying to curb Iran’s nuclear programme by [non-diplomatic] means and maybe trigger a response from Iran that might create more chaos before the US election – which I think Iran is taking into account,” Bassiri said. Amos Yadlin, Israel’s former military intelligence chief, told the Guardian the possible suspects included the US, as part of its maximum-pressure campaign to force Iran to renegotiate the nuclear deal, as well Israel, internal Iranian dissidents, or Saudi Arabia, which blames the Islamic Republic for a drone attack on its oil processing facilities last October. Whoever the culprits are, he agreed the timing of the incidents was likely linked to the US presidential polls. “I believe that it all has to do with the fact that there are elections in the US and these elections may change the policy of the US and some people may think this is the last time to react against Iran,” Yadlin said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2020/feb/16/the-big-picture-kung-fu-fighting-sheffield-1980s-john-darwell","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2020-02-16T07:00:24Z","webTitle":"The big picture: high kicks in Sheffield","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/feb/16/the-big-picture-kung-fu-fighting-sheffield-1980s-john-darwell","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2020/feb/16/the-big-picture-kung-fu-fighting-sheffield-1980s-john-darwell","fields":{"headline":"The big picture: high kicks in Sheffield","bodyText":"Just over 30 years ago, John Darwell was asked by the Untitled Gallery in Sheffield to produce a series of photographs documenting the changing face of the city. “Oh God, don’t tell me things like that,” he says, contemplating the passage of time. Born and bred in Bolton “within earshot of the factory whistle”, Darwell was already known for his work on the Manchester Ship Canal and the industrial landscape around Manchester. So he was a natural choice to explore the regeneration of Sheffield and its move away from heavy industry after the closure of its steelworks under Thatcher. “What I found in the city was this melting pot with Turkish cafes and chip shops and Indian fabric shops all side by side that were in danger from gentrification,” says Darwell, now a professor of photography at the University of Cumbria. “It felt like this colourful way of life that was getting left behind. “I was going in and out of shops and cafes with my camera on a tripod when these two guys asked me what I was doing. One said, ‘I do kung fu, I’ll show you my kung fu!’ He was about 6ft 4in so I wasn’t going to say no. I set up and said, ‘OK, show me what you can do.’ It’s hard to see in the picture but if you look on the other side of the street there’s a little old lady with her hands over her mouth. I’m sure she was convinced I was being attacked.” Darwell spent two years photographing Sheffield and its citizens; his pictures were published in a series of five books called Sheffield in Transition 1988-89, now reissued in a box set by Café Royal Books. Afterwards, he moved to Cumbria, where he found himself living in the shadow of Sellafield and became fascinated with nuclear power. He went on to photograph Chernobyl, Nagasaki, Hiroshima and Three Mile Island. “You wouldn’t be able to do it now,” he says. “Security would be on you so quickly.

The proposed twin reactors at Wylfa were given the green light by the UK’s nuclear regulator in December, with backers hoping to win financial support from the government. The Welsh plant would have a capacity of 3GW, similar to the 3.2GW of the nuclear power station being built at Hinkley Point in Somerset. Horizon Nuclear Power, a subsidiary of the Japanese conglomerate Hitachi, told planning authorities it would submit its planning application for the Wylfa plant by the end of March, which it called a “major milestone”. But the company postponed submitting the development consent order because it needs to thrash out the impact building the power station will have on colonies of sandwich, Arctic and common terns. The species are protected under the EU birds and habitats directive. Nearby Cemlyn nature reserve is home to thousands of sandwich terns, which account for about a fifth of the birds’ UK population and is the biggest on the country’s west coast. Wildlife groups are concerned about the effect of noise and light from the power station’s construction, as well as a reduction in food for the birds to forage on. Land clearance for the vast site is also expected to displace potential predators, such as rats and foxes. Chris Wynne, a senior reserve officer at North Wales Wildlife Trust, said: “We are looking at a range of ecological impacts at one of the most significant tern colonies in the UK.” Horizon is talking with Natural Resources Wales, the Welsh equivalent of the Environment Agency, and has committed to avoiding fracturing rock from a local outcrop during the breeding season of the terns, which are notoriously fickle breeders. The company hopes to resolve the issues with the Welsh agency and submit the development consent order (DCO) before the end of June. The delay is expected to be a bump in the road rather than major headache for Horizon, which believes Wylfa could be generating electricity by the mid-2020s. But the firm said its target date for a licence from the UK’s nuclear regulator may be postponed as a result of the planning delays. Hitachi is one of four companies hoping to build a nuclear power station in the UK, and Wylfa is the most advanced in terms of progress, after EDF Energy’s Hinkley Point C. Notes of meetings between Horizon and the government’s planning inspectorate also reveal that the company expects the plant to generate more power than previously thought. Due to more efficient turbines, the power station will have a capacity of 3GW, up from 2.7GW. Hinkley Point C’s 3.2GW of capacity would provide about 7% of the UK’s electricity. Horizon is also less than three months away from the self-imposed deadline beyond which it will not commit any more funding without a financial support package from the government. The company has already spent £2bn, and is spending more than £1m a day on the project. Duncan Hawthorne, its chief executive, said last year: “By the middle of 2018, we need to have something tangible to show to our shareholders that allows them to keep funding.” A Horizon spokesperson said of the planning delays: “Before we finally submit the DCO we intend to take a little more time to finalise our approach to dealing with protected bird habitats near to the Wylfa Newydd site. We’re confident we’ll resolve this and make a strong DCO submission.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2020/jun/24/lets-end-australias-climate-and-energy-warfare-albanese-tells-morrison","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2020-06-23T17:30:53Z","webTitle":"Let's end Australia's climate and energy warfare, Albanese tells Morrison","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/24/lets-end-australias-climate-and-energy-warfare-albanese-tells-morrison","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2020/jun/24/lets-end-australias-climate-and-energy-warfare-albanese-tells-morrison","fields":{"headline":"Let's end Australia's climate and energy warfare, Albanese tells Morrison","bodyText":"Anthony Albanese has dumped Labor’s former backing of Malcolm Turnbull’s national energy guarantee and opened the door for taxpayer support for carbon capture and storage technologies, in a major overture to Scott Morrison to reach bipartisan agreement on energy policy. The Labor leader will use a speech to the National Press Club on Wednesday to set out his guiding principles for an agreement to end more than a decade of political warfare on climate and energy policy. In a letter sent to the prime minister before Wednesday’s address, Albanese says Labor is open minded on a new policy mechanism to guide investment as long as the emissions reduction targets are scalable – meaning a future government of either persuasion could dial them up, or wind them back – and as long as the mechanism isn’t the Coalition’s existing emissions reduction fund. The Labor leader has also told the prime minister the opposition is open to CCS, which remains a controversial technology with many environmentalists, as long as projects are not funded through the national renewable energy bodies the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency. But Albanese says Labor will not support domestic nuclear power. The Morrison government has flagged examining “emerging nuclear technologies” as part of Australia’s energy mix in the future in a new discussion paper kicking off the process of developing its much-vaunted technology investment roadmap. While Albanese has signalled that Labor cannot accept the Coalition’s emissions reduction fund – the heavily criticised policy that replaced Labor’s carbon price in 2013 – as the bipartisan mechanism, he says a future Labor government would not seek to unwind contracts entered during this parliament, including any contracts involving support for CCS. Labor’s new position reflects an attempt by Albanese to balance divided views within his own ranks. Some in the right faction believe Labor’s commitment to climate policy ambition has cost the party electorally, and Labor will not win the next federal election unless it reconnects with workers in carbon-intensive industries in New South Wales and Queensland. But it is also an effort to challenge Morrison to use the post Covid-19 recovery to display genuine bipartisanship in the service of fixing a problem that has festered in Australia for more than a decade. Albanese’s repositioning also comes as the major parties accelerate their campaigns in the marginal seat of Eden-Monaro, where climate change is an issue, with the byelection due on 4 July. The Coalition has successfully weaponised climate change against Labor at every federal election since 2013, but the government is also under pressure from business groups and major institutions to end the policy uncertainty that is undermining investment in critical infrastructure. Facing sustained pressure to adopt a 2050 target of net zero emissions, pressure it is continuing to resist despite signing the Paris agreement which has that ambition embedded within it, the government plans instead to develop the technology roadmap as the cornerstone of the Coalition’s mid-century emissions reduction strategy. Given that the government has launched the roadmap, Labor is taking the opportunity to launch its own pivot on energy policy, and attempt to open the door to a new round of discussions. A leading Australian business organisation, the AiGroup, has called for the two biggest economic challenges in memory – recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic and cutting greenhouse gas emissions – to be addressed together, saying that would boost economic growth and put the country on a firm long-term footing. A number of other community and investor groups have expressed similar sentiments. In his letter to Morrison, Albanese says Australia has lacked a national energy policy since the renewable energy target was met in late 2019 and Morrison dumped Turnbull’s Neg shortly after taking the prime ministership. Labor adopted the Neg as policy during the last parliament in an effort to see whether any common ground could be reached between the major parties, but that proved fruitless. The letter says the lack of a settled mechanism has increased investor uncertainty “and new investment in renewable energy generation fell by 50% in 2019, according to the Reserve Bank of Australia and industry analysis”. “We have an opportunity to move past partisan approaches to energy policy, to draw on the community’s clear desire for more bipartisan approaches to difficult policy areas, and to finally deliver an enduring, effective and bipartisan energy policy for Australia,” Albanese writes. Labor has adopted a net zero target by 2050 as policy post-election, but it remains unclear what interim emissions reduction targets will be."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/live/2022/aug/11/tory-leadership-liz-truss-rishi-sunak-brexit-economy-uk-politics-latest","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-11T20:36:52Z","webTitle":"Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss compete for Tory members’ support in Cheltenham leadership hustings – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2022/aug/11/tory-leadership-liz-truss-rishi-sunak-brexit-economy-uk-politics-latest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/live/2022/aug/11/tory-leadership-liz-truss-rishi-sunak-brexit-economy-uk-politics-latest","fields":{"headline":"Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss compete for Tory members’ support in Cheltenham leadership hustings – as it happened","bodyText":"In the latest hustings in Cheltenham, Liz Truss has warned the UK is in “real danger” of “talking ourselves into a recession” as she defended her plans to cut taxes. But Rishi Sunak criticised Truss’s approach as he said that he is not willing to “pursue policies that risk making inflation far worse and last far longer”. Truss again criticised the media, two days after apologising for criticising the media during the last hustings. The foreign secretary also pledged to “reform the BBC licence fee and I certainly think it is completely wrong that so many women are in jail for non-payment of it”. Asked why he believed Tory MP Chris Skidmore had defected from his campaign to Truss’s, Sunak pointed out he “led in every single round” of the parliamentary stage of the contest. The former chancellor said: “We are only half way through this thing. I am going to fight until the last day with everything I have got because I am fighting for what I believe in.” Rishi Sunak frustrated government attempts to realise benefits of Brexit, Liz Truss allies claim. Number of patients waiting more than 12 hours in A&amp;E in England was up 33% in July from the previous month. A record 29,317 people had to wait more than 12 hours in A&amp;E departments in England in July from a decision to admit to actually being admitted. Hospital waiting lists in England reach a record high of 6.7 million. The number of people in England waiting to start routine hospital treatment has risen above previous records. Wes Streeting accuses Tory leadership contenders of ignoring “biggest crisis in NHS’s history”. Streeting, the shadow health secretary, accused Truss and Sunak of ignoring what he called “the biggest crisis in the NHS’s history”. He posted this in response to the latest performance figures from NHS England. Energy bosses start talks with Nadhim Zahawi and Kwasi Kwarteng. The bosses of some of the UK’s biggest energy companies have started a meeting with the chancellor and the business secretary, who are expected to pressure them to invest in green energy rather than payouts for shareholders. Gordon Brown’s call for nationalisation as a possible solution to energy bills crisis receives mixed reception. The former Labour prime minister has used an article in today’s Guardian to propose that the government should halt the increases in the energy price cap planned for later this year and next year and, if necessary, take energy companies into public ownership to ensure that they keep prices down. Suella Braverman got £10,000 from climate sceptic for Tory leadership campaign, while Tom Tugendhat raised £120,000, first donation records show. Boris Johnson tells energy bosses it will be up to his successor to decide any new announcements on energy bills. Downing Street has released its readout of what happened at the meeting with energy company bosses this morning. Boris Johnson joined the meeting, which was originally just meant to be hosted by Zahawi and Kwarteng. And that brings the hustings in Cheltenham to an end. Scrapping the independence of the Bank of England would be “a massive mistake”, according to Sunak. He said: “I’m very nervous about things I hear elsewhere; about people who seem to think that from Liz’s camp and her that we should scrap Bank of England independence. “I think that would be a massive mistake for our country and international investors would not look very highly on it at all.” Sunak was told that as someone who went to a private school he had been afforded opportunities that many people would never have access to. The former chancellor replied: “Yes I have and … I am not going to apologise for what my parents did for me, you must be joking.” Earlier, Truss criticised the media, two days after apologising for criticising the media during the last hustings. She said: “Today we’re sponsored by the Telegraph, and I would love the media to spend more time talking about trade deals.” Following an interjection by the paper’s Camilla Tominey reminding her “you have written for us about trade deals”, the foreign secretary said: “I have written for you on trade deals. “But the point is that trade deals open the doors for business, but then we need to help businesses actually get their product into market. “We set up the exports support service to help do that, but I would love to see the press write about that rather than about political rows.” Asked if he had spoken to Boris Johnson since he quit as chancellor, Sunak said: “I have messaged and called but unsurprisingly he hasn’t returned my calls.” Asked how he would help families dealing with rising energy bills, Sunak cited his proposed cut to VAT on energy bills . He said he would also bring forward help for the most vulnerable and pensioners. Asked what specifically he could do for those groups, Sunak said he would provide “direct financial support to those groups of people”. He warned that Liz Truss’s plan of favouring tax cuts instead of direct support could “leave millions of incredibly vulnerable people at the risk of real destitution”. Now it is Sunak’s turn for some questions. Asked why he believed Tory MP Chris Skidmore had defected from his campaign to Truss’s, Sunak pointed out he “led in every single round” of the parliamentary stage of the contest. The former chancellor said: “We are only half way through this thing. I am going to fight until the last day with everything I have got because I am fighting for what I believe in.” Truss, who says she will not have an election before 2024, has dismissed suggestions she might be modelling herself on Margaret Thatcher, insisting: “I am my own person.” “Don’t get me wrong, I’m a massive fan of Mrs Thatcher, but we live in different times.” Answering questions from the public, Truss said “I absolutely don’t support” a windfall tax on oil and gas firms. Truss was asked what she would consider success to be after her first 90 days in Downing Street if she wins. She said she would want to show that the UK is “moving in the right direction” and that pressures on household finances are “being reduced”. The foreign secretary said she would also want to see evidence of growing investment in the UK and to “get a grip” of NHS waiting lists. Will she scrap the BBC licence fee, Truss replied: “I will reform the BBC licence fee and I certainly think it is completely wrong that so many women are in jail for non-payment of it.” Truss also vowed to keep the net zero pledge. Truss was asked a series of yes/no questions. On cutting foreign aid, she said: “I will keep it as it is.” Leave the ECHR: “If we need to, but I’d rather legislate through the British Bill of Rights.” Will she sack 91,000 civil servants: “I will certainly reduce the size of the civil service over time.” Truss was asked if she is the sort of politician who changes her position to suit her ambitions having been a Lib Dem and also supported Remain before becoming a Brexiteer. Truss replies she was “pretty equivocal at the time” on Brexit in the run up to the 2016 referendum and she “wasn’t sure”. She said she was “concerned about potential disruption” of leaving the EU. Truss insists she is “low tax, pro growth, pro opportunity” and she wants to ensure the UK is open for business. Asked if she is therefore “low tax and high borrowing” to pay for it, she said: “My tax cuts... will cost £30 billion. That is affordable within our current budget... I am afraid to say the plans of raising taxes are likely to lead to a recession...” Truss said there is a “real danger of us talking ourselves into a recession”. Asked if he she is for or against “handouts” to help with energy bills, she said “my first preference is always to reduce taxes” but stressed she cannot write or announce the contents of a budget now. We now move onto the questions. Truss is asked how she would lower people’s energy bills. She said her starting point would be helping people through tax cuts and that we “shouldn’t be taking money off people in taxes and then giving it back as benefits”. On tackling inflation, Sunak said: “We have seen this story before. Inflation is the enemy that makes everyone poorer.” On Liz Truss’s tax cutting pledges and plan for the economy, the former chancellor said: “What I will not do is pursue policies that risk making inflation far worse and last far longer...” Sunak said his three main goals as Tory leader would be to “restore trust”, “rebuild the economy” and “reunite our country”. Sunak begins with an anecdote that a woman had recently asked him about his “relationship with the prime minister” as she told him he was very different to Boris Johnson. Sunak said the lady had told him: “He [Johnson’] looks like he has lost his hairbrush but you look like your mum brushed your hair...” Alex Chalk, the former solicitor general and Tory MP for Cheltenham, is introducing Rishi Sunak on stage. Truss reiterates she would extend the government’s Rwanda asylum seeker plan to more countries. The foreign secretary added she will “make sure that British legislators cannot be overruled by the ECHR, I will legislate for that”. The foreign secretary tells the audience reversing a hike to National Insurance is the right thing to do. She said that “we should never have done it... we can still afford to pay for the NHS and social care out of general taxation...”. Truss added she decided to stop a planned increase to corporation tax because “fundamentally I am a Conservative” and she believes that people should be allowed to keep more of their own money. Truss begins by saying she has a “dark secret” which is she used to be a member of the Liberal Democrats, which she has disclosed before in hustings. She said she learnt that “they do not share my principles”. Pledging to not let the Lib Dems gain more councils across the country, Truss said she will “re-establish the Liberal Democrat unit at CCHQ to ensure a crackdown to stop that from happening”. Brandon Lewis, the former Northern Ireland secretary, introduces Liz Truss onto the stage. Peter Booth, the deputy chairman of the Conservative Party Board, said all Tory members should have received their ballot paper by today. The posting of the ballots had been delayed following security concerns last week. The hustings is now underway in Cheltenham with the introductory speeches. Away from the hustings, MPs received almost 70,000 worth of free tickets to concerts and sporting events this summer, including gigs by Ed Sheeran and Adele and the British Grand Prix. An update to the MPs’ Register of Interests revealed 10 MPs were treated to tickets worth thousands of pounds to the Grand Prix at Silverstone. MPs given tickets to the Grand Prix included defence secretary Ben Wallace, whose two tickets worth 1,516 were provided by Motorsport UK, and former minister Dame Andrea Leadsom, who received two tickets worth a total of 2,600 from Silverstone Circuits itself. Crawley MP Henry Smith recorded the single most valuable hospitality declaration, with Emirates Airlines paying 4,248 for two tickets to the Grand Prix. Other Cabinet ministers to receive hospitality included work and pensions secretaryTherese Coffey, who was given a ticket to an Ed Sheeran concert at Wembley by the Betting and Gaming Council, and Treasury chief secretary Simon Clarke, who received hospitality at Wimbledon worth 1,250 from the Lawn Tennis Association. Due to the number of people attending, the start of the hustings has been delayed until 7:15pm. Labour MPs have called for parliament to be recalled to address the cost-of-living crisis. MPs including John McDonnell, Diane Abbott, Richard Burgon and Dawn Butler have signed a letter demanding a recall, alongside Labour peers including Shami Chakrabarti and Bryn Davies. The letter, address to the prime minister, leader of the opposition and the Commons and Lords speakers said it would be “imperative” for the government to act in the wake of the coming Ofgem price cap announcement. Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss will go head-to-head in Cheltenham in around 15 minutes, you can follow all of the action here. Councils have called for clarity around the spending of money raised from the soft drinks sugar levy, saying it should be used to tackle physical inactivity and ensure a Commonwealth Games legacy. The levy, designed to reduce consumption of sugary drinks, has raised around £1.2bn since its introduction. The Local Government Association (LGA) is calling for the money to be invested in council-run initiatives to boost physical activity and “find the sporting champions of the future” as the country celebrates the success of the Lionesses’ Euro 2022 football victory and the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham. Only 45% of children are meeting the chief medical officer’s guidelines of one hour of physical activity a day, according to a government report, with data collected by councils also revealing rates of childhood obesity remain above their pre-pandemic levels. A government spokesperson said: “We have gone above and beyond by spending hundreds of millions more than the levy’s actual revenue directly on programmes to help children get active and eat healthy. “This funding has expanded the national school breakfast programme, the holiday activities and food programme, and the PE and sport premium for primary schools.” The shadow foreign secretary, David Lammy, has been found to have breached the MPs’ code of conduct by inadvertently failing to register a total of 16 interests on time. The parliamentary standards commissioner, Kathryn Stone, said she found “no intention to mislead”, and that Lammy made the breach “as a result of inattention to detail”. A referral to the standards committee was not necessary, Stone said. In a letter to the commissioner, the shadow foreign secretary offered his “sincere apologies” for the late submissions, saying he was “thoroughly embarrassed” by the accidental breaches, which were “genuine oversights resulting from administrative errors on my behalf”. He told Stone the register would now feature on the agenda at his weekly team meetings, with his head of office and executive assistant having separate regular catch-ups on the issue. Lammy also promised to set reminders in his team calendar to “check and submit standard returns”. Rishi Sunak frustrated government attempts to realise benefits of Brexit, Liz Truss allies claim. Number of patients waiting more than 12 hours in A&amp;E in England up 33% in July from previous month. A record 29,317 people had to wait more than 12 hours in A&amp;E departments in England in July from a decision to admit to actually being admitted.

The bosses of some of the UK’s biggest energy companies have started a meeting with the chancellor and the business secretary, who are expected to pressure them to invest in green energy rather than payouts for shareholders. Gordon Brown’s call for nationalisation as a possible solution to energy bills crisis receives mixed reception.

Boris Johnson tells energy bosses it will be up to his successor to decide any new announcements on energy bills. Downing Street has released its readout of what happened at the meeting with energy company bosses this morning. Boris Johnson joined the meeting, which was originally just meant to be hosted by Zahawi and Kwarteng. Alex Lawson has compiled a list of all the executives from Britain’s largest energy companies the prime minister met to discuss the soaring cost of energy bills for UK households. Boris Johnson met executives from some of Britain’s biggest energy companies on Thursday to discuss the cost of living crisis. Johnson was flanked by the chancellor, Nadhim Zahawi, and the business and energy secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng. Zahawi said afterwards that the energy firms agreed to “do more to help the people who most need it” – but did not specify what that would entail. The executives were from power-generation companies – which own assets including windfarms and nuclear power stations – rather than the oil and gas companies hit by the windfall tax, officially known as the energy profits levy, after raking in bumper profits caused in part by the war in Ukraine. However, there is a lingering threat that the levy may be extended to electricity generation companies amid accusations that they have also enjoyed a bonanza from high energy prices. You can read the full report here: Fleur Anderson, the shadow paymaster general, has said the Conservatives have shown “they can’t be trusted with civil contingencies”. Anderson added: This Conservative government’s abject failure to adequately prepare for wildfires is a dereliction of duty that is putting lives at risk. The threat of wildfires has been recognised on the national risk register for nearly a decade, yet the government’s resilience planning has been nothing short of woeful. Labour has accused the Tories of putting “the smoke alarm on snooze” and having been “asleep at the wheel”, in response to the intense droughts and extreme heat the UK has been facing. The opposition party has also said that the government has not yet published its national resilience strategy, set to cover “environmental hazards” including heatwaves, despite a consultation to shape the plan closing some 10 months ago. The party has now set out its own proposals for a “more resilient Britain”, including a “whole-system approach” to preparing for national emergencies. PA reports: This would involve creating a new Cabinet sub-committee on national resilience, Labour said. The party would also conduct an urgent review of the UK’s emergency Cobra committee, and appoint a minister for resilience within the Cabinet Office to coordinate department-wide responses. Separately, Labour would “overhaul” local resilience forums, introducing “clear accountability”, new training standards for officials, and formal inspections. And it would implement a “whole-of-society approach to resilience”, bringing on board businesses and volunteer groups for national planning. The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has said that Vladimir Putin is unlikely to succeed in occupying Ukraine. Speaking at a joint conference pledging more funds to Ukraine, Wallace said it was important to understand that fighting and loss of life was still taking place, but added Russia was “starting to fail in many areas”. They have failed so far and are unlikely to ever succeed in occupying Ukraine. “Their invasion has faltered and constantly been re-modified to the extent they are really only focusing in parts of the south and in the east, a long, long way away from their three-day so-called special operation. Three days are now over 150 days and nearly six months in, with huge significant losses of both equipment and indeed Russian personnel. The defence secretary had earlier said: President Putin will have gambled that come August, come a few months in we will have all got bored of the conflict and the international community would have gone off in different directions. Well, today is proof of the opposite. “We have come out of this meeting with more pledges of finance, more pledges of training and more pledges of military aid, all designed to help Ukraine win, to help Ukraine stand up for its sovereignty and indeed to ensure that President Putin’s ambitions fail in Ukraine as they rightly should. The Conservatives are under pressure to clarify whether they will hand back about £500,000 of donations from a company linked to a Venezuelan-Italian banker charged with conspiracy, bribery and wire fraud in the US. Rowena Mason reports: Labour questioned whether the party should give back cash donated since 2019 by Britannia Financial Services, which was founded by Julio Herrera Velutini. Herrera Velutini was charged by the US Department of Justice with conspiracy, federal programmes bribery and honest services wire fraud in relation to an election in Puerto Rico in 2020, according to a press release on 4 August. The charges relate to allegations that Herrera Velutini and another man, through intermediaries, offered campaign funding to a candidate to be Puerto Rico governor in exchange for her promising to appoint a new financial regulator. A bank owned by Herrera Velutini was at the time under examination by the Puerto Rico financial regulator. A new Ipsos poll has revealed that the public believe that a Labour government led by Keir Starmer is more likely to deliver in 12 out of 13 areas, which includes acting with integrity, improving public services, and growing the economy. The only area in which, according to the poll, the conservatives led by Truss are more likely to deliver is reducing taxes. Plaid Cymru’s restoration of the whip to an MP who was cautioned by police after assaulting his wife has caused anger, with a former leader joining in the criticism, Ben Quinn reports. Jonathan Edwards, who had been sitting as an independent since he was arrested on suspicion of assault, will again be able to represent the nationalist party at Westminster following his suspension in July 2020. Leanne Wood, who led Plaid Cymru until September 2018 and had called for Edwards to be banned from the party if it was serious about stamping out misogyny and domestic abuse, reacted by tweeting: “Disappointed, yes. Disillusioned, never. The fight against the scourge of misogyny in Welsh politics continues.” Edwards, the MP for Carmarthen East and Dinefwr, was allowed to rejoin Plaid Cymru last month as a regular member, a move that has already caused division among its members. The decision to readmit him to the Westminster group was taken despite a “significant majority” of the party’s ruling body recommending against it. You can read the full report below: Liz Truss has said that as foreign secretary she has taken a “strong stand in tackling antisemitism at the international level” as foreign secretary. In an interview with the Jewish Chronicle, she stressed her pro-Israeli stance, and suggested her views were not supported by all her officials at the Foreign Office. She said: Every organisation has its culture, but it’s not fixed, it can be changed. That’s what ministerial leadership is about: it’s about making sure that the policies we represent, the values we stand for, are reflected in what we do. I’ve been very clear with our officials about the positions we take on Israel, and that will continue if I become prime minister. Truss was referring in particular to her opposition to Britain backing pro-Palestinian resolutions at the UN human rights council which she saw as too critical of Israel. That is all from my for today. My colleague Tobi Thomas is taking over now. Rishi Sunak has been campaigning today in Westminister North and Kensington, Chelsea and Fulham, in London. This is from Tony Devenish, a Conservative member of the London assembly. Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, has criticised the government for failing to announce any extra help for people with energy bills following the meeting chaired by the PM today. (See 1.59pm.) Davey said: It is appalling that the Conservatives still haven’t announced any extra support for families and pensioners facing the hardest winter in decades. The cruellest element of this chaos is that those who could actually help, [Liz] Truss and [Rishi] Sunak, are more interested in speaking to their party than taking the action our country needs. That is why the Liberal Democrats are calling on the government to cancel the energy price hike to avoid a country-wide catastrophe. Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, has escalated his attack on the Tory leadership candidates for ignoring the problems facing the NHS. (See 11.08am.) In an interview on Radio 4’s World at One, he said they were living in a “fantasy world”. He said: These latest figures reflect the biggest crisis in the NHS’s history and what really concerns me is that within that 6.73 million backlog that the NHS now has will also be undiagnosed conditions like cancer that will often be detected during the diagnostic or screening or treatment process for other conditions. Given this is the biggest crisis in the NHS’s history, I find it extraordinary that the two candidates vying to be the next Conservative prime minister are living in a fantasy world where the NHS is barely getting a mention and when it does it is often through the prism of absurd gimmicks that fail to live up to the scale of the challenge. Boris Johnson has tweeted about his meeting with energy bosses. Downing Street has released its readout of what happened at the meeting with energy company bosses this morning. Boris Johnson joined the meeting, which was originally just meant to be hosted by Nadhim Zahawi, the chancellor, and Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary. All three cabinet ministers stressed the importance of energy companies “investing in North Sea oil and gas, renewables, biomass and nuclear to strengthen our domestic energy security”, according to No 10. Zahawi also told the meeting that the government was monitoring “the extraordinary profits seen in certain parts of the electricity generation sector and the appropriate and proportionate steps to take”, Downing Street said. But, as we reported this morning, the prospect of the windfall tax being beefed up seems to have faded, after the Liz Truss camp kiboshed the idea. At the meeting Johnson also told the energy bosses that it would be up to his successor to make any “significant fiscal decisions”. That means any big decisions about energy bills will have to wait until September. My colleague Jasper Jolly has more on the meeting on the business live blog. The UK will send more weapons to Ukraine to help it defend against Russia’s invasion, Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, has announced. Wallace said more multiple-launch rocket systems (MLRS) will be sent to the eastern European nation, as well as precision-guided M31A1 missiles which can strike targets up to 50 miles away, designed to defend against Russian heavy artillery. In a statement, Wallace said: This latest tranche of military support will enable the armed forces of Ukraine to continue to defend against Russian aggression and the indiscriminate use of long-range artillery. Our continued support sends a very clear message: Britain and the international community remain opposed to this illegal war and will stand shoulder-to-shoulder, providing defensive military aid to Ukraine to help them defend against Putin’s invasion. Suella Braverman received £10,000 from a company owned by a leading climate sceptic to support her campaign for the Conservative leadership, according to the most recent update to the register of MPs’ interests. As PA Media reports, the figures also show that Tom Tugendhat received more than £120,000 to fund his leadership bid. MPs have 28 days from accepting a donation to declare it to the parliamentary standards commissioner and so some of the candidates in the contest have revealed little or nothing yet about the funding they have received. But PA Media has summarised what declarations have been declared. Braverman, the attorney general, has declared a donation of £10,000 from First Corporate Consultants Ltd, which is owned by the Bristol Port owner Terence Mordaunt. Mordaunt chaired the Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF) between 2019 and 2021. The GWPF has been vocal in its opposition to climate crisis policies such as net zero and was sanctioned by the Charity Commission in 2014 for failing to adhere to rules on “balance and neutrality”. Tugendhat raised more than £120,000 for his leadership bid. Some £42,673 came from a company called Policy Focus Ltd, founded on 27 June, less than two weeks before the leadership campaign began. Companies House records show Policy Focus is owned by property developers Christian Sweeting and Robert Luck. Sweeting previously donated £10,000 to the Conservative Party in 2018, PA reports. Tugendhat also received £50,000 from the long-time Tory donor Ian Mukherjee and £25,000 from Beacon Rock Ltd, owned by former Conservative Party treasurer Sir Michael Davis. Another £6,000 came from business consultancy InvestUK Group. Rishi Sunak has declared the donation of office space, valued at £3,195. Kemi Badenoch raised £12,500 to support her leadership bid, the records show. The former equalities minister received £10,000 from Longrow Capital, owned by tech-focused investor Dave Maclean. She also received £2,500 from Joanne Black, for whom no further details are available Liz Truss, Penny Mordaunt, Sajid Javid, Jeremy Hunt and Nadhim Zahawi are yet to declare any financial support for their campaigns. Gordon Brown, the former Labour prime minister, has used an article in today’s Guardian to propose that the government should halt the increases in the energy price cap planned for later this year and next year and, if necessary, take energy companies into public ownership to ensure that they keep prices down. Alongside the Lib Dem plan, with which it has some similarities (they also want a price cap freeze, and more money raised through a windfall tax), it is the most radical and ambitious proposal on the table to tackle the energy bills crisis. Some commentators have reacted very positively. This is from Steve Richards, the writer and journalist, and author of a book on the Brown premiership. This is from the Scotsman’s Alexander Brown. Labour figures have been generally been enthusiastic about Brown’s proposal. These are from Andrew Fisher, who was head of policy for Jeremy Corbyn and is certainly no Brownite. This is from the Labour MP Chris Bryant. And this is from Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary. But Kevin Schofield at HuffPost says Brown is not pitch rolling on behalf of Keir Starmer. Schofield says Starmer is expected to start setting out Labour’s own plans for dealing with the energy bills crisis tomorrow. The Conservative MP John Redwood said the Brown plan would just waste government money. And on the Today programme this morning Paul Massara, the head of Pulse Clean Energy and the former head of Npower, said nationalisation was not the answer. He told the programme. I think [Brown is] very confused. And I think he’s taking a model from the financial crisis and trying to apply it to a different situation. We’ve got a world energy crisis now. I think there is a case actually for having a social tariff, and saying the poorest in society should have a lower tariff, but that gap between the market and the lowest tariff then needs to be made up by the government. Whether that’s funded through an increased windfall tax is a different question. But nationalisation and ownership is confusing that issue, ownership, with what do we need to do to help bills today. It’s not as though the companies are being poorly run. This is a global commodity issue. The bosses of some of the UK’s biggest energy companies have started a meeting with Nadhim Zahawi, the chancellor, and Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, who are expected to pressure them to invest in green energy rather than payouts for shareholders, my colleague Jasper Jolly reports. He has more on his business live blog. Today’s figures from NHS England show that ambulances in England took an average of 59min 7sec last month to respond to emergency calls such as burns, epilepsy and strokes. This is up from 51min 38sec in June, and is well above the target of 18 minutes. The Liberal Democrats have said the ambulance service is in crisis and they have urged the Tory leadership candidates to draw up a plan to fix it. Helen Morgan, the party’s communities spokesperson, said: Liz Truss herself has admitted that under the Conservatives people are facing appalling ambulance delays. Yet neither she nor Rishi Sunak have set out a credible plan to solve this crisis. We need emergency funding now to support overstretched ambulance services along with an official CQC inquiry into how to fix these appalling delays. Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, has accused Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak of ignoring what he calls “the biggest crisis in the NHS’s history”. He posted this in response to the latest performance figures from NHS England. Streeting is right to say the Conservative leadership contest has mostly ignored the NHS as an issue. As a journalist, I have received 41 press releases from the Truss campaign over the last month but not one of them mentions the NHS. And only one of them includes the word health; it was a press release about Truss’s plans to review the operation of the tax system, which she says could help people providing stay-at-home care. The Sunak campaign has got a slightly better record on this. It has sent me 36 press releases over the same period, and three of them mention the NHS. Ten of them include the word health. Early in the campaign Sunak did announce plans to tackle the NHS waiting list backlog, saying that this was “the biggest public service emergency” facing the country and that he would set up a vaccines-style task force to deal with it. But since then he has not said much more on this, and it is not a topic that has featured much in the official Conservative party hustings. Sunak’s only other NHS-related announcement has been a plan to charge patients £10 if they miss a GP appointment for the second time. The number of people in England waiting to start routine hospital treatment has risen to a record high, PA Media reports. A record 29,317 people had to wait more than 12 hours in A&amp;E departments in England in July from a decision to admit to actually being admitted, PA Media reports. PA says: The figure is up 33% from 22,034 the previous month and is the highest for any calendar month in records going back to August 2010, according to NHS England figures. The number waiting at least four hours from the decision to admit to admission stood at 136,221 in July, up from 130,109 the previous month but slightly below the record 136,298 in March. A total of 71.0% of patients in England were seen within four hours at A&amp;Es last month, down from 72.1% in May and the worst performance on record. The operational standard is that at least 95% of patients attending A&amp;E should be admitted, transferred or discharged within four hours, but this has not been met nationally since 2015. Police are failing victims of burglary and theft, missing chances to catch thieves leading to lack of confidence in forces, the official inspectorate has found. My colleague Vikram Dodd has the the full story. Labour claims this shows the Conservatives are soft on crime. Steve Reed, the shadow justice secretary, told Times Radio this morning: It’s the conservatives, they’ve gone absolutely soft on crime. And what we’re hearing today is the result of a government that, instead of focusing on making sure that our public services work in the interest of the British people, are continuing simply to have internal fights like we’re seeing now – Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak fighting each other like rats in a sack instead of focusing on the cost of living crisis or the criminal justice and crime crisis. They’ve effectively decriminalised crimes as serious as burglary, robbery, theft, shoplifting, car crime, fraud, all of those things. Michael O’Leary, the chief executive of Ryanair, told Radio 4’s Today programme this morning that the next prime minister should negotiate free movement of labour between the UK and the EU to help industry with labour shortages. He said: I think the first thing they should do to boost the British economy is prioritise a trade deal with the European Union – a good starting point for that would be to open up the free movement of labour between the UK and Europe once more. But he accepted there was no chance of Liz Truss or Rishi Sunak proposing this during the Tory leadership contest. He said: You have to accept that you’re not going to get elected by a very narrow 180,000 electorate of the Tory party membership if you advocate common-sense policies. But once you do become prime minister, you should have enough backbone to lead the UK economy forward and the starting point for that should be a free trade deal with the European Union. (There is also no chance at all of Truss or Sunak backing this if they do become PM. Even the Labour party is not advocating a restoration of free movement, and Brexiters view the UK gaining fuller control of its borders as one of the chief benefits of leaving the EU. It has coincided with public concern about high levels of immigration being a problem falling.) My colleague Kalyeena Makortoff has a full story on O’Leary’s comments here. Mark Spencer, the leader of the Commons, was doing an interview round this morning. He was asked on LBC if energy company bosses were paid too much, in the light of crisis caused by high energy bills, but he implied it was not an issue. When he was told one energy executive earned £11.5m, Spencer replied: That seems like a very large figure to me and certainly on my salary and to my constituents that feels like a large figure. In the context of things, actually, when there’s 65 million people in the country, it’s 30p, 20p, a person, so I think actually there are bigger fish to fry here, which we can try and solve the challenges than to have a pop at the chief exec’s salary. I think whilst it sometimes makes great politics, it actually doesn’t affect people’s bills, which we need to be focused on, in the autumn. Good morning. It may feel as if the Tory leadership contest has been going on forever but, in terms of official Conservative party hustings, we have not even reached half-way point. Tonight, at 7pm, the sixth hustings event will take place in Cheltenham. After that there will be another six to go. Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, remains the frontrunner and this morning her camp is launching a fresh line of attack against her rival Rishi Sunak, the former chancellor. In an article for the Daily Telegraph two leading Truss supporters, Simon Clarke, the chief secretary to the Treasury, and Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, accuse him of frustrating government attempts to realise the benefits of Brexit. They write: [Sunak] talks about cutting EU regulations, yet dug his heels in as chancellor against efforts to do exactly that and realise the benefits of Brexit. We both saw it in cabinet, including resisting reforms to the EU’s Solvency II regulation – making it harder for pension funds and investors to invest in British business and infrastructure – and being backward-leaning on moving ahead with legislation to fix issues with the Northern Ireland protocol. Sunak, of course, voted for Brexit in 2016, when Truss was supporting remain. But part of the reason why she appears to be so much more popular with Tory members (who are overwhelmingly pro-Brexit) is that she has managed to portray herself as a Brexit evangelist, while depicting Sunak as someone who has been captured by remainer, Treasury orthodoxy. In their article Clarke and Kwarteng talk about the importance of exploiting “the huge economic opportunities of Brexit”. There is not much evidence yet that these huge opportunities actually exist, but one common idea in the Brexitverse is that, if Brexit is not working yet, it is because it has been sabotaged, and the Clarke/Kwarteng article reflects this thinking. In this scenario Sunak plays the role of Snowball from Animal Farm. Sunak himself does believe that Brexit offers economic opportunities and, in response to the article, a campaign spokesperson said: Rishi was one of the few ministers who delivered real Brexit reforms as chancellor. From establishing eight freeports to ripping up the EU rulebook when it came to financial services, he delivered a proper plan for reform and change. Sunak campaign sources have also said it is “categorically wrong” to say Sunak opposed reforming the Solvency II rule, and that he supported standing up to Brussels over the Northern Ireland protocol. (Clarke and Kwarteng accuse Sunak of being “backward-leaning” on the Northern Ireland protocol bill, which may be a new piece of political terminology. It seems to mean that he pointed out some of the disadvantages. Sunak is know to have expressed worries that unilaterally abandoning the protocol could lead to a trade war with the EU.) Both candidates are meeting Conservative members before the hustings tonight. And this morning Kwarteng will be meeting energy firm bosses alongside Nadhim Zahawi, the chancellor. At one point there were suggestions they might use the meeting to propose expanding the scope of the windfall tax on energy companies. But that proposal has now been downgraded (Truss, the probable next PM, is not keen), and now it is not clear what outcome we should expect from the meeting. There will be no substantial change on energy policy until the new Tory leader is elected. But my colleagues Rowena Mason and Peter Walker have a preview here. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include “Andrew” in it somewhere and I’m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can’t promise to do this for everyone.

The French state-owned firm said inspections last month had uncovered problems with welding on pipes at the Flamanville plant in north-west France. Flamanville’s reactor design is the same as the one being used at a delayed plant in Finland and at Hinkley Point in Somerset, where EDF is building the UK’s first new nuclear power station in decades. The company said that it had discovered “quality deviations” on 150 welds in a system used to transport steam to turbines used for electricity generation. EDF said it was performing further checks to see what works would be needed to satisfy the safety requirements of the French nuclear regulator, ASN, and would report back in May. In a statement, the firm said: “Following the current checks and the licensing process by the ASN, EDF will be able to specify whether the project requires an adjustment to its timetable and its costs.” The plant is already three times over its original estimates and several years late. Nuclear industry experts said the announcement cast doubt over whether Flamanville unit three would be operational by the end of 2019, as planned. Stephen Thomas, professor of energy policy at the University of Greenwich said: “If remedial work is needed, this puts in further doubt whether Flamanville can be in commercial operation [as previously planned].” ASN warned earlier this year that the start-up schedule for Flamanville was tight. Paul Dorfman, of the Energy Institute at University College London, said the problems did not bode well for Hinkley Point C, which is due to come online in 2025. “If they can’t build their own reactor in France, where can they build it? This seems counter to their claims that they are learning from their mistakes and Hinkley won’t be a repeat.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/dec/27/military-secrets-of-our-nuclear-power-plants","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-27T18:04:36Z","webTitle":"Military secrets of our nuclear power plants | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/27/military-secrets-of-our-nuclear-power-plants","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/dec/27/military-secrets-of-our-nuclear-power-plants","fields":{"headline":"Military secrets of our nuclear power plants","bodyText":"In her excellent article on the Hinkley C nuclear plant financial fiasco (The long read, 21 December), Holly Watt mentions the innovative insight of Sussex University academics Prof Andy Stirling and Dr Phil Johnstone, who have identified the central importance of expansion of the skill base of the new nuclear build programme – headed by Hinkley C – for the Trident military nuclear renewal programme. Watt also mentions the first nuclear plant built on the same site, Hinkley A. What is barely acknowledged about this reactor is it was both built and operated to manufacture plutonium for British nuclear warheads, and probably some plutonium it created was sent to the US for use in its military stockpile too. I have dug up considerable evidence that demonstrates this beyond any doubt. The first public hint came with an announcement on 17 June 1958 by the Ministry of Defence, on “the production of plutonium suitable for weapons in the new [nuclear] power stations programme as an insurance against future defence needs”. The Conservative government’s paymaster general, Reginald Maudling, told parliament a week later: “At the request of the government, the Central Electricity Generating Board has agreed to a small modification in the design of Hinkley Point … so as to enable plutonium suitable for military purposes to be extracted should the need arise. The government made this request in order to provide the country, at comparatively small cost, with a most valuable insurance against possible future defence requirements.” And that is exactly what they did. The nuclear world has thus turned full circle, as the atomic conjoined twins that had been painfully separated for nearly 50 years are being rejoined in an insidious way by this new Conservative government.

However, those ambitions have yielded only one project under construction, Hinkley Point C in Somerset, south-west England. The past two months have dealt serious blows to hopes for more, with Toshiba abandoning its plans for Moorside in Cumbria and Hitachi scrapping its Wylfa plant on Anglesey. Wylfa’s death means a second Hitachi plant planned for Oldbury, Gloucestershire, is doomed, too. Together the three projects would have provided 15% of today’s electricity demand. That begs the question: is it time to rethink plans for new nuclear or redouble our nuclear efforts? With the cost of wind, solar and batteries dropping rapidly, have renewables and smart technologies matured enough to fill the gap? What is not in question is the UK’s need for more low-carbon power. Coal and old nuclear plants are shutting in the 2020s and tough climate targets are looming. The Green party and groups such as Greenpeace advocate ditching nuclear in favour of more renewables, energy efficiency and flexibility through imports, batteries and other technologies. However, most energy industry experts think the future involves some new nuclear. The government has already restated its commitment to new nuclear power. “It’s difficult to see a low-carbon energy system in the future which has no new nuclear,” says George Day, the head of policy and regulation at the government-funded Energy Systems Catapult. “If you try to rely on just renewables and storage, without carbon capture and storage or nuclear, you are looking at a very challenging transition and one that is more costly than a balanced mix [of supplies].” All of National Grid’s four future energy scenarios envisage some new nuclear, although the amounts differ considerably. Peter Atherton, an analyst at Cornwall Insight, said it was hard to imagine an energy system without the baseload power – or continuous electricity supply – provided by nuclear. “There is a school of thought that says baseload is a 20th century thing. They might be right – but it would be a big call by government to bet baseload won’t be a thing by 2025.” The government has already downgraded the amount of new nuclear it expects to be built in the future. It assumes 13 gigawatts of new nuclear capacity by 2035, implying three further nuclear power stations in addition to the 3.2GW plant at Hinkley. There are now only two firms in the running, which are both involved in plans for two new plants. French state-owned EDF Energy, which is behind Hinkley, wants to start building a carbon copy of that project at Sizewell, on the Suffolk coast, in 2021. Chinese state-owned CGN, meanwhile, is accelerating work on a Chinese-designed reactor for Bradwell in Essex, with the aim of being operational around 2030. Hitachi’s withdrawal suggests the financing model used for Hinkley, and proposed for Wylfa, is dead. The government will likely junk that approach – of offering a guaranteed price of power for 35 years – for an alternative known as the “regulated asset base” (RAB) model. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy has created a whole division to develop RAB, where a regulator would set a fixed sum for the power station’s costs and fixed returns for the developer, paid for by energy billpayers or taxpayers. Officials are assessing RAB’s viability, with a decision expected this year. But critics say the approach loads the risk of nuclear plant construction delays, such as those seen in France and Finland, on citizens. Returns would also be paid for years before any electricity was generated. EDF Energy backs the RAB model and the Chinese have said they would look at it. The influential government adviser Dieter Helm, professor of energy policy at Oxford University, has called it “plausible and preferable” to the Hinkley approach if the UK wants new nuclear. Day believes it could produce the power stations that ministers want. Labour, which is pro-nuclear, has branded the approach risky and reckless but has not put forward an alternative. Given the uncertainty over new nuclear, could the UK manage without it? Maybe. The obvious route is a lot more renewable power capacity than currently planned. The government’s climate change advisers last year hiked up the amount of renewables they expected four years ago, to 45-60% of electricity supplies by 2030, up from 40-55% previously. Both are a big increase from the 33% level today. The Committee on Climate Change said there is evidence the energy system could cope with as much as 60% of supplies coming from intermittent renewables. Filling the 9.2GW-sized hole left by Moorside, Wylfa and Oldbury would require 14GW of offshore wind power, according to the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit thinktank. That is equivalent to more than 20 of the world’s biggest offshore windfarm, which consists of 87 turbines. According to Atherton, the only way renewables and storage could plausibly fill the nuclear gap would be to “spend a vast amount of money on saturating the UK with offshore wind”. That could end up with enough turbines in enough different locations to replicate the “always-on” nature of nuclear. Large-scale batteries will help with the variable nature of renewables and are expanding fast. But they will not address the fact that electricity demand is much higher in winter than summer, or solve long windless spells. The other big techno fix in the arsenal of low-carbon energy options is carbon capture and storage (CCS). However, many years of government efforts to kickstart it failed and ministers have switched their focus away from CCS for power stations to CCS for industrial uses. Day said gas power stations with CCS still looked “pretty promising” but significant policy changes would be needed to enable firms to invest in it. Others, however, are more dismissive. Atherton said: “People have been working on CCS gas for 20 years and nobody has got within a mile of it yet. People will tell you the technology works … that doesn’t mean I can do it on a budget.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2020/nov/18/is-12bn-enough-to-get-uk-on-track-for-net-zero-carbon-emissions","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2020-11-18T16:18:33Z","webTitle":"Is £12bn enough to get UK on track for net zero carbon emissions?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/18/is-12bn-enough-to-get-uk-on-track-for-net-zero-carbon-emissions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2020/nov/18/is-12bn-enough-to-get-uk-on-track-for-net-zero-carbon-emissions","fields":{"headline":"Is £12bn enough to get UK on track for net zero carbon emissions?","bodyText":"The government’s 10-point plan for putting the UK on track to reach net zero carbon emissions has been welcomed by experts as a good start, but many fear that the £12bn of public investment proposed will be too little to achieve the sweeping changes to the UK’s economy that will be needed. Sir David King, a former government chief scientist and chair of the Centre for Climate Repair at Cambridge University, said: “[This] is nowhere near enough either to manage the commitment to net zero emissions by 2050 or to provide a safe future. As we emerge from the Covid-19 pandemic and its impact on our economy, there needs to be an understanding that this is the opportunity to grow our economy in a direction that is fit for purpose in this century.” He contrasted the £12bn with China’s commitment to investing 2.1% of GDP in the green economy. “We need clarity from the government on the transitional process over the coming decade that would include major investments into promising greenhouse gas removal technologies, and disinvestments from the fossil fuel industry,” King said. PwC has estimated that £400bn of investment in green infrastructure is required in the next decade to meet the net zero target. Steve Jennings, the head of energy and utilities at PwC, said: “Government is signalling an intent and an ambition which is really positive, but the £12bn investment is the significant point. This may not be enough. It will be the private sector that has to invest significantly and create and support these green jobs, and the private sector will look for a compelling investment case to invest the sums required.” Ed Davey, the leader of the Liberal Democrats and a former energy and climate secretary in the coalition government, said: “It’s shockingly unambitious – this is not the long-term strategy we need, and I don’t trust the Conservatives to deliver given what they have been doing in the last few years.” A government spokesman conceded that only £3bn of the funding announced was new. “Of the £12bn, £3bn of it is brand-new investment, which crosses over the different range of areas,” he said. “Just as important as the money, I’d point to the targets that are contained in the plan, not just in terms of petrol and diesel vehicles, but also the targets we have put in place around heat pumps, carbon capture, and restoring the natural environment and nature.” The solar industry pointed out that the government had missed out solar from its green plans, though there may be more detail in the energy white paper, which is expected later this year. Some in the electric vehicle industry were also nervous. Charley Grimston, the chief executive of Altelium, which makes software for electric vehicles, said: “£500m for mass-scale production of batteries does not compare to investment in countries such as Germany, where figures are in the billions for new battery manufacturing plants.” For some of the items on the 10-point list, public funding will play only a minor role. Offshore wind companies, for instance, are expected to invest tens of billions in building new windfarms. Offshore wind is mature technology, and companies need only the right system of energy regulation to reassure them they can turn a profit and spur them to invest. Car manufacturers are expected to take the lead on electric vehicles, investing in new plant and training the workforce, and North Sea oil and gas companies are regarded as well placed to move into hydrogen fuel and carbon capture and storage technology. This means the £12bn from taxpayers will be only a start, and would be quickly outweighed by private-sector investment. Chris Stark, the chief executive of the Committee on Climate Change, pointed out on Twitter: “Private offshore wind investment alone would dwarf the £12bn … Majority will be private investment, with some public investment alongside.” Keith Anderson, the chief executive of Scottish Power, which plans to invest £10bn in green projects in the UK, said the government did not need to spend more taxpayer money to reach its goals, if it set up the right investment frameworks to galvanise private capital. “I don’t think the government needs to spend huge amounts of taxpayer money,” he told the Guardian. “If we have proper policy framework and investment frameworks then money will flow into the system quite readily. Take the offshore wind sector, for example: the government stated an ambition, set up its [contracts for difference] mechanism, and this has created a self-perpetuating industrial success story. We are starting to see the same thing in electric vehicles where costs are beginning to come down.” There is a catch, however: currently, the cost of greening the power sector has been met by additions to electricity bills, which can be controversial and which hit the poorest hardest. The UK’s only new nuclear power plant under construction, Hinkley Point C, was agreed under a deal with the French company EDF that will require billpayers to pay more than £90 per megawatt hour for 35 years, estimated to put as much as £18 on each household’s bill per year. If the government is to avoid loading future costs on to bills, a more equitable way will need to be found. The prime minister has hinted at carbon pricing, but who would pay and how such a system would be managed has yet to be set out. Another problem is that for many of the projects, there is no clear way to encourage private-sector investment. For instance, redesigning towns and cities to encourage cycling and walking is likely to fall to local authorities, but the sums so far made available to them are not close to enough for the large-scale transformation required. Restoring nature and planting trees will also be costly, and is likely to have to come from the public purse, some of it in the form of subsidies to farmers. Hilary McGrady, the director general of the National Trust, welcomed the government’s promise of £80m for a nature recovery fund, but added: “We know that billions are needed to restore nature and make the sort of impact that’s required to tackle climate change. We will need long-term commitments of reliable funding, including through the new agricultural system, and further deeper commitments to achieve the goals set out in the government’s 25-year plan for the environment.” Public-sector investment is not just a cost. Using energy more efficiently will be a saving, and moving to renewable energy will cut fuel costs, while green jobs will be an economic boon. The benefits will also be felt in improved public health and wellbeing, as well as a safer climate. For instance, the Federation of Master Builders estimates that insulating the UK’s draughty homes will save the NHS at least £2bn a year in preventable illness, and switching to electric vehicles will prevent some of the 40,000 deaths each year from air pollution. The CBI has calculated that 3m working days are lost each year to air pollution at present. Some experts want the government to put in place longer-term mechanisms that will mean that new low-carbon technologies pay for themselves over time. Myles Allen, a professor of geosystem science at Oxford University, said: “The prime minister doesn’t say who is going to pay for carbon capture in the long term. It’s fine to use public money to get it going, but it’s not fair on taxpayers to spend all that without a clear business model for the private sector to take over. “There is a really simple solution – called a carbon takeback obligation – which would spread the cost over the entire fossil fuel industry and its customers, keeping it manageable and fair. Bring this in and net zero by 2050 really does start to look within reach.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2020/mar/04/coronavirus-latest-at-a-glance","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2020-03-04T06:00:08Z","webTitle":"Coronavirus 4 March: at a glance","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/04/coronavirus-latest-at-a-glance","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2020/mar/04/coronavirus-latest-at-a-glance","fields":{"headline":"Coronavirus 4 March: at a glance","bodyText":"Total number of cases so far The global death toll is 3,190 while more than 93,000 people have been infected in more than 80 countries.

It’ll be a mild recession, if it’s a recession, he says. [actually, he’s been using ‘banana’ for ‘recession’, echoing an advisor to President Carter who didn’t want to scare the electorate]. Onto the crypto crash, and David Rubenstein makes a salient point: And on the turmoil in stablecoins, Georgieva says that when a stablecoin is backed 1-to-1 with its underlying asset, then it’s stable. If not, then it’s a pyramid - and pyramids eventually collapse. Regulating the stablecoins, ensuring interoperability of CBDC’s (central bank digital currencies) is something we need to work on, she adds. Here’s a video clip of IMF chief Kristaline Georgieva warning a few minutes ago that 2022 will be a tough year (as it has been already!). She also points out that the oil price dipped in the last week on signs of economic slowdown, but food kept rising. That’s because you can shrink petrol use when growth slows, but people still have to eat every day. Billionaire businessman David Rubenstein tells the Global Economic Outlook panel that the markets have overreacted this year, with Wall Street tumbling to around bear market territory. And he denies that the slump in technology stocks this year is a repeat of the dot-com crash in 2000. Back then, companies with little more than a business plan, without revenues let alone profits, had floated in the dot-com boom. It’s not the same situation today. IMF managing director Kristaline Georgieva adds that two countries are already in recesssion -- Ukraine (which could contract by 35% this year), and Russia. Others, such as Sri Lanka, have been caught up in debt crisis due to the shocks from the war. A Davos panel on the global economic outlook is also underway. And it starts with a show of hands -- how many of the “brains trust at the World Economic Forum” are concerned that we are going into recession? About half the hands in the room go up. Q: So are we already in recession in some countries? International Monetary Fund chief Kristalina Georgieva says not, but warns that the economic outlook has darkened since the IMF’s last forecasts. She cites the food crisis, saying that anxiety over access to food at a reasonable price, globally, is hitting the roof. Plus, the climate crisis has gone nowhere and the digital money has hit a little rough spot (the slump in cryptocurrency assets). Looking ahead, Georgieva says we may see recessions in some countries which were weak, perhaps hadn’t recovered from the pandemic, or very dependent on Russian oil. But we have not seen that yet, she insists. However, Jane Fraser, CEO of Citigroup is also on the panel, and she warns that Russia, Recession and (interest) Rates are the key factors to watch. Asked if Europe will experience a recession, Fraser replies Yes, adding that she hopes she’s wrong. [On rates, European Central Bank Christine Lagarde said today the ECB is likely to start raising interest rates in July and exit sub-zero territory by the end of September. That made the ECN the latest central banker to turn more hawkish, in the face of high inflation]. More from the panel: With the World Cup in Qatar looming at the end of the year, the event had its own session in Davos. A feisty affair with over the top tackles it was not, as the panel dished out platitude after platitude. Gianni Infantino, the president of FIFA, said five billion people would tune in and it would be the “best World Cup ever”. Patrice Motsepe, president of the Confederation of African Football, said he couldn’t think of a better place to hold the World Cup. Ronaldo, the Brazilian striker, said it was marvelous he was a role model to today’s superstars. Former Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger spent a couple of minutes talking about how good coaching was about getting the best out of people. Nobody was going to get into trouble mentioning the circumstances under which Qatar was awarded the right to hold the tournament or the deaths of workers on the construction sites. The Amir of the State of Qatar, Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani, has hit out at criticism over its hosting of the World Cup late this year. In a keynote speech here in Davos, the Amir says the Middle East has suffered from discrimination for decades - from people “not knowing us, and in some cases refusing to get to know us”. He says: Even today there are still people who cannot accept the idea that an Arab Muslim country would host a tournament like the World Cup. He adds: These individuals, including many in positions of influence, have launched attacks at a pace not seen before when a mega sporting event was hosted by other countries on different continents, He doesn’t say any particular countries, but that “each had its own particular problems and challenges”. However.... concerns over human rights protections in Qatar are well documented, with Amnesty reporting that tens of thousands of migrant workers still face “forced labour”. Last year, the Guardian reported that more than 6,500 migrant workers from India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have died in Qatar since it won the right to host the World Cup 10 years ago. And last week, a group of non-government organisations said Fifa should pay reparations of at least $440m (£356m) to migrant workers whose human rights have been compromised by the Qatar World Cup. Plus, there are also concerns about the safety of LGBTQ+ people in Qatar, given same-sex relationships are directly criminalised under the laws of the Gulf state. The economic disruption caused by Covid-19 and the Ukraine war will drive up inflation, hit growth and create more food insecurity, a new survey just released show. The World Economic Forum’s Community of Chief Economists predicts further declines in real wages in both high- and low-income economies, as inflation rises faster than pay. The world faces the worst food insecurity in recent history – especially in the Middle East and North Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Developing economies face trade-offs between the risk of debt crisis and securing food and fuel, it adds, (as Sri Lanka showed by defaulting last week). Saadia Zahidi, managing director at the World Economic Forum, warns the world is on “the cusp of a vicious cycle” that could impact societies for years, and erase the progress since the end of the cold war. The pandemic and war in Ukraine have fragmented the global economy and created far-reaching consequences that risk wiping out the gains of the last 30 years. Leaders face difficult choices and trade-offs domestically when it comes to debt, inflation and investment. Yet business and government leaders must also recognise the absolute necessity of global cooperation to prevent economic misery and hunger for millions around the world. Gabriela Bucher, executive director of Oxfam, says developed economies are neglecting the Covid-19 crisis in emerging economies - with potentially deadly results. Bucher tells a Davos panel that vaccine injustice is a risk. The rich world moves on, thinking that Covid is no longer a problem as they are vaccinated. So they forget that global south still faces waves of the virus, and low vaccination rates (just 15% across Africa). She says: The focus moves away and that is not addressed. Bucher explains that the vaccine isn’t yet readily available globally at the scale needed. That means that... ...in six months, the complacency that is perhaps felt now could be really deadly. Moderna’s CEO, Stéphane Bancel, agrees that there are several reasons to worry, both in the south and the north. In the US, only half of vaccinated people got boosted with a third dose, so he worries about the next fall (autumn) and winter as their antibody levels falls. China’s outbreaks are a concern too; a more infectious virus is harder to control with the measures which were very successful in 2020. We always need to be humble with biology - and remember that a more virulent virus could emerge over time, says Bancel. It was good news that Omicron was less virulent than Delta, but “we are always a day away, a week away, a month away or a quarter away” from a new variant that’s more virulent. Michael McCaul, Republican congressman, has warned that the Ukraine conflict could lead to a new ‘hot war’ between Russia and the West. Speaking on a panel here in Davos, McCaul says Russia’s tactics have been almost World War Two-style, and that the US military have been astonished by how incompetent Russia’s military have been. Putin has totally miscalculated, he says, having lost a third of its invasion force. But warning that the conflict could escalate, McCaul (who represents Texas’ 10th Congressional District) says: It’s a cold war, but it’s on the verge of becoming a hot war. He points out that Putin has now brought in the “Butcher of Syria” (General Aleksandr Dvornikov) and put him in charge of the war. McCaul says the biggest concern is that the Butcher of Syria could use chemical weapons, or a tactical nuclear weapon. We need to think about how NATO, and the world, would respond if that happened, he adds. Ian Bremmer of Eurasia Group is also on the panel, which asks if a new Cold War is taking shape between major powers. Bremmer says we are in a new cold war, and closer to a new hot war than he’d like. But while there has been a ‘forced decoupling’, putting Russia into a lot of trouble and a pariah state with the West, it is not a pariah for countries such as India, China, and Brazil. Ukrainian MP Ivanna Klympush-Tsintsadze says the conflict is between ‘world and anti-world’, and that Ukraine needs more sanctions, more weapons, more backing. The head of the UN World Food Programme says failure to break open Ukraine’s blockaded ports is “a declaration of war on global food security”. He warned it would lead to rising hunger, and increased migration to Europe. David Beasley, executive director of the World Food Programme, told a panel here that: “Failure to open up Ukraine’s ports is a declaration of war on global food security.” Opening the ports would be one step in progress towards food stability. Beasley said, giving a stark warning to European countries about the implications of people going hungry. “You don’t need to worry just about what’s happening to the east of you, you also need to worry about what’s happening to the south of you. Every 1% increase in hunger leads to a 2% increase in migration.” The energy security crisis since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine must not lead to a deeper dependence on fossil fuels, International Energy (IEA) chief Fatih Birol has warned. Speaking here in Davos, Birol told a panel that: “We need fossil fuels in the short term, but let’s not lock in our future by using the current situation as an excuse to justify some of the investments being done, time-wise it doesn’t work and morally in my view it doesn’t work as well. Instead, he argues, correct investments, especially in renewable energy and nuclear power, mean the world need not choose between being short of energy, and higher fossil fuel emissions driving climate change. Elsewhere in Davos, the head of chipmaker Intel has said a shortage of advanced equipment to make semiconductors could hold up global expansion plans, Associated Press reports: CEO Pat Gelsinger said Monday that there have been “quite significant extensions” in delivery times for chipmaking gear for new chip factories, known as “fabs,” that the company plans to build in the U.S. and Europe. Gelsinger said at a press roundtable on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum that “to us, this is now the No. 1 issue, is in fact the delivery of equipment.” A handful of suppliers make high-tech semiconductor manufacturing gear, such as Dutch company ASML. A shortage of semiconductors that erupted last year hurt the availability of everything from autos to kitchen appliances and highlighted the industry’s vulnerability to manufacturing centered in Asia. Intel announced tens of billions of investment in new chipmaking facilities for Europe, including a new fab mega site in Germany and expansion in Ireland. In January, it announced a plan for a $20 billion plant in Ohio. Gelsinger said supply of chipmaking equipment is “the most important pinch point to the build-out of capacity today.” He added that he’s urging authorities in the U.S. and Europe, which have each launched their own “Chips Act” to promote national semiconductor manufacturing, to speed up the legislation. Winnie Byanyima, once the head of Oxfam International and now the executive director of UNAIDS has some tough words to say about the way the world has responded to the global pandemic. “The impact of Covid 19 was racist and sexist”, she said. “That’s how it is felt by people in the global south.” Byanyima said girls were removed from schools as a result of the pandemic and never returned, and gender-based violence increased.. Meanwhile, there was a massive disparity between the 75% vaccination rates of developed countries and the 15% vaccine rates in Africa. “Africa was at the back of the queue while rich countries helped themselves to stocks of personal protective equipment and treatments. If that’s not racist, what is?”. The Davos meeting, she added, was supposed to be about recovery from the health and economic crises of the past two years. “But you are not going to tackle those issues without tackling the inequality crisis” Byanyima called for a three-point programme to address global inequality: more generous debt relief; the re-cycling of special drawing rights (the global reserve assets issues by the IMF) to benefit poor nations; and changes to intellectual property rights to allow developing countries to manufacture their own Covid drugs. “We can’t pretend we are on a path of recovery until we address these global structural barriers that are driving racial and geographic inequality.” Stressing that another pandemic in the future was highly probable, Byanyima said: “We are learning nothing and it’s depressing”. Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko and brother Wladimir are addressing the World Economic Forum about the crisis. Vitali contrasts the peaceful, sunny atmosphere here in Davos with the conflict 2,000 kilometres from here, where he explains people are dying every day in a senseless war because of Putin’s vision to rebuild the Soviet Union. Ukraine is fighting for other countries as well as itself, and paying the biggest price in human lives, he says, explaining that “we are fighting, first of all, for values”. Echoing the message we heard from Ukrainian MPs last night, he says that support is needed, and that weapons are “very important”. Fellow former world boxing champion Wladimir explains that Ukranians are prepared to fight a long fight, and not give in -- at a time when some countries are looking for a negotiated peace agreement. He says it took two months for international community to recognise that weapons were needed, so.... The longer it goes, the more the world understands it must be stopped - the sooner the better. If we, the free world give in, it’s the beginning of the end. Unless the aggressor pays severe consequences, lessons won’t be learned, Wladimir argues. And he adds: Propaganda must be banned. State-owned media only must be banned. Sir Lawrence Freedman, emeritus professor of War Studies at King’s College London, is here in Davos. He tells me that Ukraine has a very uncompromising, understandable message to Davos: The Ukraine line is there’s no time to waste. Just hit hard, hit now, and we need all the support we can get. And don’t nod in the direction of the Russians, they’ve got nothing to give you. And on the blockage of Ukraine’s exports, Freedman says the Black Sea issue is “looming large” now. There’s an awful lot of economic discussion, political discussion, military discussion going on. It’s evident there are lots of conversations, as Zelenskiy said. Freedman explains that the key is to get international signup for a corridor to get Ukraine’s exports moving (as president Zelenskiy called for). And the starting point should be that this corridor is a humanitarian effort, rather than economic warfare against Russia. Freedman thinks it’s ‘not impossible’ that Russia would decide not to interfere, as if it blocked a corridor completely then its own ships could become more vulnerable. Incidentally, he covered the issue of the Black Sea blockade in this Substack post last week. Q: And finally, what is your personal message to each leader here? Each one? President Zelenskiy suggests it’s not possible. After all, there’s a thousand of them, and I’m really short of time, he points out. But he then makes a very serious point: Ukraine is short on time now. I’m pretty sure that no-one knows how much time Europe or the World has. Because of that, the world must not lose the unity which worries Russia the most. And as a finale, he produces some sage advice for the Davos audience. They should wake up each morning with the feeling “What have I done for Ukraine today?” And that’s the end of the session. Q: Given Ukraine’s crucial role in the global food system, how can the global community help you to export more of your products, given the blockade at present? Zelenskiy says Russia is stealing Ukraine’s grain, having blockaged its Black Sea ports. He’s been talking to many leaders such as Boris Johnson, the leaders of Poland, Turkey, and Switzerland, and the UN, to find solutions. He says a corridor must be established to allow exports, such as wheat and sunflower oil. Otherwise there will be shortages of these food products - including Asia and Africa, everywhere. By blockaging ports to stop food being exported, Russia is continuing the energy crisis last year. We need to agree a corridor, and Russia will not be able to stand against the leading countries of the world This could use railways, or seaports on the Baltic coast, but there is no simple solution. Onto questions: Q: What is your vision for the future of Ukraine? Zelenskiy sticks to the present first - saying there are 87 dead bodies, victims of the conflict, today. The future of Ukraine will be there, but without them. Ukraine is losing a lot, every day, but it makes us stronger, Zelenskiy insist. And the future of the country will include strong new security priorities, as with a neighbour like Russia on the doorstep, anything can happen. Ukraine must create conditions where people and businesses aren’t afraid to exist and thrive there. And that will include up-to-date defence system, most modern, multi-modal defence and security system, and cooperative defence agreements with countries we respect, he adds. Zelenskiy then quote George Marshall (of the post-WW2 rebuilding plan for Europe), who said that he didn’t oppose any country, but opposed “hunger, poverty, dispair, chaos”. That is Zelenskiy’s hope for the future, as he ends his speech. He then gets a standing ovation from the audience here - a rare event for Davos (I think Nelson Mandela, for example, would have got one!). Zelenskiy then turns to the business leaders here at Davos, urging those who have not yet quit Russia to do so - and welcomes them to Ukraine instead. It is necessary to set a precedent for full withdrawal of all foreign companies from Russia, so they aren’t used for the “bloody interests” of Russia. Any company which leaves Russia is welcome to move to the Ukraine market, says Zelenskiy, saying companies would benefit by truly supporting freedom. And turning to the massive challenge of rebuilding Ukraine , he says: We offer the world the chance to set a precedent for what happens if you try to destroy a neighbour. I invite you to take part in this rebuilding. And this rebuilding could be partly funded by finding Russian assets hidden overseas, freezing them, and allocating them to a special fund to help those hurt by the war. Zelenskiy calls for “Maximum sanctions” against Russia , so that Russia and any other country that wants to launch a brutal invasion against its neighbour is deterred. I think there are no such sanctions at present, he insists, and calls for Full oil embargo All Russian banks barred from global systems - no exampcions abandon Rusia IT sector No trade with Russia Zelenskiy says Ukraine has fought longer than expected, but says it wouldn’t have needed to have endured the war, with so many casualties, if tough sanctions had been imposed last autumn. If there had been full unity back in 2014 when Russia annexed Crimea, would they have launched February’s invasion? Again, Zelenskiy thinks not. Zelenskiy cites the creation of the Russian War Crimes House in Davos this year, as evidence of Russia’s conduct in the war. History remembers how institutions and countries respond to these events, Zelenskiy says -- citing 1938 in Munich as an example of how history remembers these decisions. Zelenskiy begins by saying it is a great honour to take part in this year’s Davos - whose theme is history at a turning point. This year, the phrase word ‘turning point’ is more than rhetoric - this is the moment when it is decided whether brute force will rule the world, says Zelenskiy. If it does, then there is no point in gatherings such as Davos. There’s a small pause.... and then Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, appears on the video link, receiving a round of applause from the assembled audience here. WEF founder Klaus Schwab introduces Zelenskiy, saying we have all seen his couragous leadership, and want to hear what lies ahead for Ukraine, and how we can assist. President of the Swiss Confederation, Ignazio Cassis, is speaking first, telling WEF that Switzerland could not remain neutral in the Russia-Ukraine war: Switzerland could play a mediation role once the war has ended, he suggests. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy will soon address the World Economic Forum by videolink. The large, main Congress Hall here at Davos is packed out in readiness. An exhibition tracking atrocities committed by Russia in the Ukraine war is formally opening this morning. The “Russian War Crimes House” has been set up in a space on the Davos Promenade, which in prior years had been taken over by the Russian delegation for meetings, parties, vodka and canapes. But with Russian entities now frozen out, the space now includes a map showing where over 4,177 civilians have died in the conflict, including 226 children. It also shows a video of 4,600 photos showing evidence of war crimes, including photos of bombed streeets and houses. The exhibition is supported by Ukrainian oligarch and businessman Victor Pinchuk, through his Foundation and PinchukArtCentre. Outside, a sign reads: “This used to be the Russian House in Davos. Now it’s the Russian War Crimes House in Davos.” Opening the exhibition, Pinchuk explains how he has supported building a memorial victims of the Babi Yar massacre of nearly 34,000 Ukrainian jews during the Nazi occupation in the second world war, with a dream of ‘never again’. But that hope has been extinguished since February 24th. Since the Russian invasion, we see that genocide against Ukrainians by Russians happen now. Unfortunately, never again didn’t work. Pinchuk explains that today, we can see the genocide ‘almost online’, and the killers know we see. He hopes that the exhibition will encourage Russian soldiers to stop atrocities. Maybe if we tell the story of this tragedy loudly it will stop them, and save some lives. Iryna Venediktova, Prosecutor General of Ukraine, spoke by videolink, and said there was evidence of summary executions, torture, rape, the rape of minors, and the forced transfer of Ukrainian children to Russian familes. Björn Geldhof, artistic director of the PinchukArtCentre, explains that the exhibition shows the most horrific moments of the war, shows the victims, and gives back a name and a face to those who suffered from those Russian war crimes. Geldhof explains the need to maintain awareness about what is happening in Ukraine. The war is not just about Ukraine’s survival, it is about values. Ukraine has chosen European values of freedom time and time again. In 2004, in 2014 and now. that’s what they’re dying for, and fighting for. This war of values is exactly why it is so important to keep standing with Ukraine. To keep giving Ukraine the tools it needs to keep defending itself. This is a long-term war, which won’t end quickly, so the support must be sustainable and long-term, Geldhof adds. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Yuliia Svyrydenko had a stark message in Davos for those countries and companies starting to have second thoughts about sanctions against Russia. Calling for Russia to be completely isolated, Svyrydenko said: “Armies win battles but the economy wins wars”. Many companies, she told a panel on economic warfare, had announced they were pulling out of the Russian market but were still operating. “Now is not the time for a cost benefit analysis. We have to cut Russia off from the global economy completely.” Svyrydenko said there should be secondary sanctions against companies that circumvented the economic measures brought in following Russia’s invasion and called for frozen Russian assets to be used to help rebuild Ukraine’s economy, set to contract by at least 30% this year. Ann Wagner, a republican member of the US house of representatives, said Vladimir Putin needed to get a “very clear and consistent message that there will be an ironclad commitment to implementation” of sanctions. Europe, she added, had to end its reliance on Russian energy. Moscow should be kicked out of the G20 and other multi-lateral institutions such as the Bank for International Settlements. The fortunes of food and energy billionaires have grown by $453bn over the past two years owing to soaring energy and commodity prices during the pandemic and Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine, a report by Oxfam has revealed. As the world’s business and political elite meet for the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the development charity said spiralling global food prices had helped create “62 new food billionaires” in just 24 months. IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva has warned that the global economy could be facing its biggest test since the Second World War. At the start of Davos, Georgieva called for a fight against geoeconomic defragmentation, and identifies four ‘urgent issues’. One is the possible creation of a ‘public digital platform’ to make it cheaper to transfer money between borders, along with cutting trade barriers, progress on debt relief, and accelerating climate change work. Georgieva writes: First, strengthen trade to increase resilience. We can start now by lowering trade barriers to alleviate shortages and lower the prices of food and other products. Not only countries but also companies need to diversify imports—to secure supply chains and preserve the tremendous benefits to business of global integration. While geostrategic considerations will drive some sourcing decisions, this need not lead to disintegration. Business leaders have an important role to play in this regard. New IMF research shows that diversification can cut potential GDP losses from supply disruptions in half. Auto manufacturers and others have found that designing products that can use substitutable or more widely available parts can reduce losses by 80 percent. Diversifying exports can also increase economic resilience. Policies that help include: enhancing infrastructure to help businesses shorten supply chains, increasing broadband access, and improving the business environment. The WTO can also help with its overall support for more predictable, transparent trade policies. Second, step up joint efforts to deal with debt. With roughly 60 percent of low-income countries with significant debt vulnerabilities, some will need debt restructuring. Without decisive cooperation to ease their burdens, both they and their creditors will be worse off. But a return to debt sustainability will draw new investment and spur inclusive growth. That is why the Group of Twenty’s Common Framework for Debt Treatment must be improved without delay. This means putting in place clear procedures and timelines for debtors and creditors—and making the framework available to other highly-indebted vulnerable countries. Third, modernize cross-border payments . Inefficient payment systems are another barrier to inclusive growth. Take remittances: the average cost of an international transfer is 6.3 percent. This means some $45 billion per year are diverted into the hands of intermediaries—and away from millions of lower-income households. A possible solution? Countries could work together to develop a global public digital platform—a new piece of payment infrastructure with clear rules—so that everyone can send money at minimal cost and maximum speed and safety. It could also connect various forms of money, including central bank digital currencies. Fourth, confront climate change: the existential challenge that looms above everything . During the COP26 climate conference, 130 countries, representing over 80 percent of global emissions, committed to achieve net-zero carbon by around mid-century. But we urgently need to close the gap between ambition and policy. To accelerate the green transition, the IMF has argued for a comprehensive approach that combines carbon pricing and investment in renewables, and compensation for those adversely affected. Ivana Kylmpush-Tsintsadze MP has also said she will be urging states, including Germany, to boycott Russian gas and oil. She told Sky News: “If you are paying Russian companies for their oil and gas you are giving them resources to continue destroying our towns, our villages, killing our children, raping our women, elderly, babies, toddlers and destroying our country.” The Ukrainian MPs in Davos also explained that winning the war means restoring all the territory lost to Russia. Ivanna Klympush-Tsintsadze MP explained she doesn’t understand why Crimea should be seen differently than any other part of Ukrainian territory. She said the world reacted with “pitiful sanctions” in 2014, warning that if any Ukrainian land is left under Russian control, it will be used by Russia as a platform for future attacks. International law, respect of borders, means victory means full restoration of our territorial integrity, sovereigny and independence. It also sends an important signal to other dictatorial systems across the globe, she says. Yevheniya Kravchuk MP gave a pithy response to this question too: Just imagine from your perspective, someone tells you that you have to give part of London to Russia because there are so many Russians in London. There is a bully in the room, they have to be punished, she added. Yesterday Ukraine’s presidential chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, also said Ukraine will not agree to any ceasefire deal that would involve handing over territory to Russia. Yermak said in a Twitter post: The war must end with the complete restoration of Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty. Good morning from Davos, where the Annual Meeting of the World Economic Forum gets underway today. The Ukraine war takes centre stage at Davos this year, along with the global food crisis and the Covid-19 pandemic. And five Ukrainian MPs are calling for more humanitarian, financial and weaponry support to win the conflict. Yevheniya Kravchuk MP explained why Ukraine needs military and financial suport, and tougher sanctions on Russia, if it is to prevail: That is the only way to stop the atrocities, that happened in Bucha, that happened in Borodyanka, in other small villages in Keiv region. But the same atrocities are happening right now in the occupied territories. Ukraine will win if it gets enough weapons, enough financial support, and sanctions on Russia that will be really, really harmful, so that Putin will not continue this war or starting any other wars in this world. Ivanna Klympush-Tsintsadze MP said Vladimir Putin had underestimated spirit of Ukrainian people, its armed forces and whole society - and also the reaction of the West. Our major request to the whole world is do not stop backing Ukraine. Only by stopping Russian forces on the “painful, bleeding battlefield” today will mean this war will not spill over to other regions, she explained. “Otherwise we will see the unfortunate consequence, and we have to be aware of those.” Klympush-Tsintsadze added the Russian Federation has to be defeated, isolated and punished through international tribunals such as the ICC, and brought to a point where it cannot wage war on anybody else in the future. Anastasia Radina MP, who heads the Ukraine parliament’s anti-corruption committee, also spoke, said Ukraine needs “NATO-style heavy weaponry”. Ensuring that Ukraine receives a proper supply of counter-offensive heavy weapons is the only way to ensure Ukraine exists, wins, and have a meaningful discussion of other issues such as other issues such as anti-corruption work, or the economy. A total oil and gas embargo was also on the table, Radina added, saying it was “totally unacceptable” that over 70% of Russia’s energy revenues since the war started came from the European Union. Alyona Shkrum MP explained everything Davos was trying to build over decades, such as democracy, values, green economy, more involvment of people around world, was under attack by Putin. And finally, Yulia Klymenko MP said the war was about values, about food security, and about the global order, and that some European politicians had allowed thenselves to become ‘economic slaves of Russia’, unable to turn off its oil and gas. They’ll be taking this message to leaders and business chiefs here in Davos this week. Later this morning, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy will address Davos by videolink, at 11.15am Davos time (10.15am BST). Throughout the week, more than 50 heads of state or government will be among the 2,500 delegates. Major names speaking over the next few days include Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, IMF managaging director Kristalina Georgieva, European Union chief Ursula von der Leyen, NATO head Jens Stoltenberg and US climate envoy John Kerry. Yesterday, a group of millionaires have joined protests against the World Economic Forum gathering of the business and political elite in Davos, Switzerland, demanding that governments “tax us now” to tackle the burgeoning gulf between rich and poor. The unlikely protesters, who describe themselves as “patriotic millionaires”, called on world leaders attending the annual conference on Sunday to immediately introduce fresh taxes on the wealthy in order to tackle the “cost of living scandal playing out in multiple nations around the world”.

The AWU national secretary, Dan Walton, said the union would tell the roundtable that it was “ludicrous” for Australia to be exporting uranium to the rest of the world while failing to capture the value of the emission-free energy source at home. “Given around the world and particularly in Australia and particularly on the left of politics we are trying to drive down our emissions, it doesn’t make a great deal of sense to me that we wouldn’t be looking to our own backyard to find a solution,” Walton told Guardian Australia. “Most of our energy crisis is due to partisan pigheadedness – on both sides, so those of us on the progressive side of politics can’t continue to reflexively reject zero-emission compromise options.” He said that while he accepted that the Labor party had already expressed opposition to nuclear, there were people on both sides of politics who were stuck in old ideological debates over the issue. “There are a number of people from both sides of politics who are holding on to views where clearly they should be reconsidered and discussed and debated in a factual scientific sense,” Walton said. “I think the ALP has put their views forward and in fairness they are completely able to do so, but my interest is for the members of the AWU who right now are being crippled by soaring energy prices.” The potential for Australia’s nuclear ban to be lifted has been revived since the May election after a group of Nationals lobbied for the issue to be revisited by a parliamentary inquiry. Following a referral from the energy minister, Angus Taylor, in August, the environment and energy committee is conducting an inquiry into the “prerequisites for nuclear energy in Australia”. At the same time, Joyce has tasked his lower house committee to also look at the issue through a series of roundtable events. Taylor has said that while there are no plans to drop the existing moratorium on nuclear energy, the government’s role was to plan for the decades ahead. The resources minister, Matt Canavan, a senior Nationals senator from Queensland, said the AWU’s view was welcome as the debate over nuclear continued. “I welcome the AWU’s contribution,” he told Guardian Australia. “It will, of course, need support from a broad range of organisations, including the Labor party, to progress nuclear power. “There also remains the need to ensure that any source of power is competitive on price – the biggest priority we have is to get prices down to keep our manufacturing jobs in Australia.” The Nationals MP for Hinkler, Keith Pitt, said that there could be no change to Australia’s current position on nuclear without bipartisan support. “So I welcome the fact that the AWU has entered the debate with an open mind and I look forward to seeing their further contributions,” Pitt told Guardian Australia. Support for a domestic nuclear industry also appears to be gathering pace within the Coalition, with two new government senators, South Australian Alex Antic and NT National Sam McMahon, both using their first speeches to parliament this week to back the technology. Walton said that his workers would benefit from an Australian nuclear industry through jobs in exploration, mining, power generation, and storage, while the manufacturing sector would benefit from reliable baseload power to energy-intensive facilities like aluminium and steel production. “Continuing to adopt a position of ideological extremism on nuclear technology is an economic own-goal we can’t afford to keep kicking,” Walton said. The union’s support will likely buoy conservative supporters of nuclear who are hoping the twin inquiries into the issue will be sufficient to win a change to government policy. Ziggy Switkowski, who headed a 2006 review of nuclear power for the Howard government, told the environment committee that the technology had no chance of being introduced unless Australia had a coherent energy policy. He also said that it would take about a decade before it was clear whether small nuclear reactors were suitable for Australia, and about 15 years to bring a plant online if a decision was made to build one. The Australian Nuclear Association, which advocates for nuclear science and technology, has said nuclear power could provide cheap, reliable, carbon-free energy in Australia, but would only be financially competitive with a carbon price. In a group submission released this week environmental and civil society groups warned the government that nuclear power has “no role” in Australia, saying the issue was a distraction from “real movement on the pressing energy decisions and climate actions we need”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2020/may/28/uk-infrastructure-under-threat-from-climate-breakdown","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2020-05-28T07:00:24Z","webTitle":"UK infrastructure 'under threat from climate breakdown'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/28/uk-infrastructure-under-threat-from-climate-breakdown","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2020/may/28/uk-infrastructure-under-threat-from-climate-breakdown","fields":{"headline":"UK infrastructure 'under threat from climate breakdown'","bodyText":"Britain’s vital infrastructure is under threat from the ravages of extreme weather and climate breakdown, unless ministers take swift action to protect against flooding, heatwaves and drought, government advisers have warned. Energy networks and water utilities, communications, transport and other essential services are all at risk, said Sir John Armitt, chair of the National Infrastructure Commission, which has published a new report on resilience. But restoring the UK’s crumbling infrastructure could create new jobs as ministers seek to kickstart the economy after the lockdown. “It’s the nature of this sort of area that it should be possible to build up a head of steam quickly [to create jobs],” said Armitt. “Road maintenance, for example, is easier at the moment as fewer people are using the roads. Active maintenance reduces the need for capital expenditure. And you don’t need years of planning to get shovels on the ground.” Flood protection projects were another key area, alongside rail improvements and building broadband capacity, he said. The coronavirus crisis showed the importance of preparedness, according to Armitt, but after the pandemic eases the existing threat of extreme weather, leading to flooding, storm damage, water shortages and other events, will continue to wreak billions of pounds of damage if ministers fail to act. “Climate change remains the fundamental challenge,” said Armitt, in an interview. “That has not gone away.” Ministers must set out clear regulations with higher standards for construction as a matter of urgency, he said. They must also be prepared to invest in infrastructure or allow operators to charge the public more for their services to pay for the upgrades needed around the country. “Suppliers say, if you want more resilience, you have to charge more,” he told the Guardian. “Ministers have been loth to pick that up.” Disasters such as floods were treated as localised problems when they occurred rather than nationwide threats, he said. A fully formed national response to climate breakdown was needed. There should also be more discussion of the costs of nuclear power – which he said would still be needed to ensure the UK’s energy supply while phasing out fossil fuels – and of the benefits of the HS2 rail project, of which he is a supporter, he said. The government was supposed to publish a National Infrastructure Strategy alongside the Budget in March, but that was delayed as the new chancellor of the exchequer, Rishi Sunak, decided it needed more time. The impact of coronavirus is likely to mean a further delay. Thursday’s report urged ministers to set out full resilience standards every five years. Infrastructure operators – including energy, water and transport utilities – should carry out regular stress tests to ensure their systems and services can meet those standards, it said. By 2023, according to the NIC’s recommendations, regulators should introduce new obligations on infrastructure operators to meet new standards on resilience, undertake regular stress tests, and develop and maintain long-term resilience strategies. Last year, the UK’s worst power cut for a decade “offered a glimpse of the disruption that can happen when something goes wrong”, according to the report. “The coronavirus outbreak has shown that significant high-impact disruptions can and do happen.” It was too early to say what the effect of the coronavirus crisis would be, said Armitt. However, it showed government and the public how important it was to have clear plans in place for foreseeable crises, he said. Some infrastructure had performed well during the lockdown. “Everyone was pleasantly surprised by the way our digital systems have stood up to a massive increase in demand from Zoom calls and so on,” he said. “But everywhere is going to face challenges from the behavioural changes [that might stick after the pandemic] and climate change. I can’t say we’ve done enough.” Ministers should have a clear discussion with the public about the challenges faced by the UK, to develop a consensus on how they should be tackled, he said. “The government has been reluctant to get out all these issues, the pros and cons, and debate them. But without policy being thought through clearly, we’ve seen targets not met and ministers having to eat their words when it proves difficult to deliver. Understanding fully the delivery challenge enables you to be more effective in delivery, and satisfy public expectations.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2020/feb/29/why-derek-jarmans-garden-must-be-saved-alys-fowler","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2020-02-29T11:00:44Z","webTitle":"Why Derek Jarman’s garden must be saved | Alys Fowler","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/feb/29/why-derek-jarmans-garden-must-be-saved-alys-fowler","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2020/feb/29/why-derek-jarmans-garden-must-be-saved-alys-fowler","fields":{"headline":"Why Derek Jarman’s garden must be saved","bodyText":"Prospect Cottage and its garden sit on the shingle of Dungeness, on the Kent coast, not nestled but parked among the wild and washed-up things: sea crambe, horned poppies, driftwood, flint stone, sea worn metal and flotsam. It was with these materials that Derek Jarman, the film-maker, artist and activist, started his garden in the 80s. By the time I became aware of it as a teenager in the 90s, it had gained legendary status. It was a radical and queer act of garden-making at a time when clipped shrubs and clean lawns still ruled. Today, it is still a wild garden without boundaries: its borders just slip into the wild flora of the headland with the nuclear power station looming in the background. It had a wild planting plan, too. Long before the new naturalists were exalting ecological planting, Jarman was mixing the local flora into his flowerbeds. The salty conditions mean only the most tenacious of plants survive here, but he improved the ground with manure, so that wildflowers such as anchusa, foxgloves, buttercups and wild peas grew alongside mixed herbs, such as lovage, broad-leaf parsley and fennel. There are cottage garden favourites, too, such as Mrs Sinkins pinks, perfumed sweet peas, Californian poppies and geraniums. Yet this was far from being a picture-postcard cottage garden. Between all this froth of plant life were talismanic stone circles, huge standing stone flints, rusted metal sculptures, old boat hooks, a crucifix, a verdigris trumpet and pieces of maritime wood – testament to the fact that a beautiful garden need not be expensive. When Jarman first began to create his garden, he joked that local people thought he was a “white witch out to get the power station” with his magic stones. I thought, here is my hero. I pored over his book, Derek Jarman’s Garden, with its evocative, beautiful pictures by Howard Sooley, till every page was thumbed and I knew it by heart. I visited at sunrise and sunset – and even got to work in it once. More than 25 years after Jarman’s death in 1994, the garden still delights. It has changed – nothing stays still on the ’ness with its wild winds – but is still a pilgrimage for visitors, who are free to wander as they wish. But now Prospect Cottage needs to be saved from being sold. Art Fund wants to raise £3.5m by the end of March to buy it. There are wonderful rewards in exchange for donations – pictures by Sooley and artist Tacita Dean to name a few – but the best of them is saving Prospect Cottage for future generations."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"film/2020/oct/16/the-perfect-weapon-cyber-warfare-documentary-hbo","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2020-10-16T07:02:04Z","webTitle":"'There's a whole war going on': the film tracing a decade of cyber-attacks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/oct/16/the-perfect-weapon-cyber-warfare-documentary-hbo","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2020/oct/16/the-perfect-weapon-cyber-warfare-documentary-hbo","fields":{"headline":"'There's a whole war going on': the film tracing a decade of cyber-attacks","bodyText":"In early 2010, scientists at a uranium enrichment plant in Natanz, Iran, watched their infrastructure malfunction at an unprecedented, inexplicable rate. Technicians inspected their equipment, but could find no explanation for why the plant’s centrifuges – machines to isolate the uranium isotopes needed for nuclear power – were spinning at irregular rates, and then failing. Five months later, cybersecurity responding to a seemingly separate network malfunction in Iran inadvertently discovered the culprit: a malicious string of code which instructed computers, and the centrifuges they controlled, to vary in speed until their parts broke down, while simultaneously mimicking normal operator instructions, as if playing security footage on a loop in a heist movie. It was computer malware capable of physical, real-world destruction – the world’s first digital weapon, originating from US national intelligence. Stuxnet, as the worm came to be known, marked a sea change in international relations – the first known time a country deployed an offensive cyber weapon to inflict damage rather than collect surveillance, and the precipitating event of The Perfect Weapon, a new HBO documentary on the past decade of insidious, troubling escalation of international cyberwarfare. With Stuxnet, which is thought to have been developed by America’s National Security Agency as early as 2005, the United States “crossed the Rubicon”, David E Sanger, a longtime national security correspondent for the New York Times, says in the film. “The United States has basically legitimized the use of cyber as a weapon against another country against whom you had not declared war. It pushes the world into an entirely new territory.” The Perfect Weapon, like Sanger’s book of the same name, traces in succinct, clinical style the Pandora’s box of chaos-sowing, digital tits for tats in the wake of the Stuxnet reveal, from hacks that garnered enormous and arguably outsized media attention – the leak of Democratic National Committee emails in the run-up to the 2016 election by Russian hackers, the 2014 Sony hack and its flurry of gossipy work emails – and lesser-known but still critical developments in what is essentially a multinational, virtual cold war. “There’s a whole war going on right underneath our noses that is state-sponsored,” John Maggio, the film’s director, told the Guardian. “The actual act may be carried out by ‘criminals’, but they’re sponsored by states – by Iran, by North Korea, by China, by Russia, and by America against their adversaries.” In under an hour and a half, The Perfect Weapon blisters through the proliferation of cyberwarfare in the last decade-plus: how offensive ransomware and disinformation campaigns have morphed from a undercover sideshow – as late as 2007, cyberwarfare was not even listed as a pressing concern on the US military’s threat assessment – into a relatively cheap, accessible and potentially devastating staple of international relations. “The asymmetry of this kind of warfare is very cost-efficient for countries that are under economic restrictions by the United States or otherwise,” said Maggio. Actors of middling economic power, such as Iran and North Korea, can strike debilitating and costly blows on American businesses, for example, at relatively little cost. Bugs like Stuxnet could disrupt electrical grids, shut down airports or derail vulnerable election infrastructure. The future of warfare, as Maggio sees it, is “no longer going to be boots on the ground, it’s going to be fingers on keyboards”. The Perfect Weapon re-contextualizes widely covered hacks and cyber-attacks as part of a broader sweep of cyber weaponry designed for destabilization, revenge and theft. With interviews from cybersecurity experts, former national intelligence officials and recollections from those targeted by hackings, including John Podesta, Hillary Clinton, Seth Rogen and anonymous staffers at the Sands casinos, The Perfect Weapon puts a human face on an often baffling field little understood by the general public. From Stuxnet, Maggio revisits the Iranian ransomware attack on Sands casinos in 2013, which cost the conglomerate owned by the outspoken Republican donor Sheldon Adelson three-quarters of its servers and $40m. A year later, the hacking of Sony emails by a North Korean-backed team in China – a bizarre response to the studio’s planned release of a movie co-written by Rogen, The Interview, which depicted the fictional assassination of Kim Jong-un – marked a shift in the public understanding of corporate vulnerability to cyber-attack. But the concerns over security and kowtowing to the hackers’ will (the studio ultimately pulled the movie from most theaters) was frequently overshadowed by the gossipy contents of the hack itself, a media pattern repeated and refracted to more insidious effect in 2016, with the Russian hack and WikiLeaks release of Democratic National Committee emails. The Perfect Weapon argues, as numerous cyber and media experts have pointed out, that zeroing in on the content of the emails, and in particular on the narrative of a Democratic party “rigged” against Senator Bernie Sanders, played into the Kremlin’s intention to roil the election with destabilizing noise. Even the specter of Russian meddling created an environment where “nothing is real and everything is possible”, says Podesta in the film. “That really destroys the credibility of democracy, and that’s what Putin wants.” “America is uniquely susceptible to these kinds of attacks because of our openness, because we have a public square,” said Maggio. “Disinformation, the hack-and-dump kind of attacks, are very effective at sowing a lot of chaos.” Cyber weapons do not need to strike to be effective, due to what Sanger called the “perception hack” – the recognition of foreign meddling as a possibility in any unclear scenario, a caustic understanding which erodes trust in American democratic processes and opens the door for muddled disputes of illegitimacy. The final third of The Perfect Weapon covers the worryingly profuse cyber-attacks in the years since the 2016 election, when Russia hacked a US voting systems manufacturer: the devastating NotPetya cyber-attack, a Russian operation on Ukraine that infected corporate networks across the world, from Maersk to FedEx. And of course, concerns over foreign interference in America’s current election. The clear timeline of cyberwarfare, a once-shadowy arena ever-crystallizing in hindsight as more information comes to light, indicates, said Maggio, a need for greater transparency and accountability – in effect, guardrails – from the international community. “We have Geneva conventions, we have conventions around war that the use of certain weaponry, chemical weapons, nuclear weapons, things like that – but there is nothing like that with cyber,” said Maggio. “An outgrowth of what’s been going on over the last decade or so is going to have to be some sort of meeting of the minds on the use of these kinds of weapons.” The goal of the film, Maggio said, was to “set the table” – present a seemingly opaque, sprawling phenomenon as accessibly and humanly as possible. And for audiences to recognize that cyberwarfare on infrastructure, and its corrosive effect on institutions, is “the world that we live in now”, says Brandon Scott, president of the Baltimore city council, in reference to a 2019 ransomware attack which cost the city 12 years of files and $15m. “This is the new normal.” The Perfect Weapon premieres on HBO on 16 October with a UK date to be announced"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2020/may/24/the-climate-crisis-looms-as-the-coalition-fiddles-with-fossil-fuels","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2020-05-23T20:00:03Z","webTitle":"The climate crisis looms as the Coalition fiddles with fossil fuels | Greg Jericho","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/24/the-climate-crisis-looms-as-the-coalition-fiddles-with-fossil-fuels","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2020/may/24/the-climate-crisis-looms-as-the-coalition-fiddles-with-fossil-fuels","fields":{"headline":"The climate crisis looms as the Coalition fiddles with fossil fuels","bodyText":"We may be dealing with a health crisis, but the climate change crisis has not gone away, nor become any less urgent. In fact, the opposite. A few conservative commentators have suggested Covid-19 shows what a real crisis looks like compared with, in their opinion, the hyperventilating over climate change. What bollocks. Nasa estimates that last month was the hottest April on record and the first four months of this year are the second hottest start to a year. The past seven months have all been 1C or higher than the 1951-1980 average (roughly around 1.3C above the pre-industrial average) – tied with the longest streak set from October 2015 to April 2016. But unlike in 2015 and 2016 the Bureau of Meteorology records we are currently not in El Niño. That very much suggests the pace of warming is speeding up. The linear trend of temperatures over the past 60 years suggests we will hit 2C above pre-industrial levels in 50 years; the trend of the past 20 years has it happening in around 30 years, but the trend of the past decade would see us hit that level in 2038 –just 18 years’ time. In 2018, the IPCC warned we had little time to keep temperatures below 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. If the trend of the past decade continues, we’ll hit that temperature in 2025. And no, the virus has not bought us more time. A study published this week in Nature Climate Change estimates the annual global drop in emissions due to virus shutdowns will be “comparable to the rates of decrease needed year-on-year over the next decades to limit climate change to a 1.5°C warming”. That it took forcing people to stop their lives to achieve such cuts highlights just how big the job ahead of us is and how it cannot be done through individual action alone. Cutting emissions without crippling the economy requires not everyone self-isolating, but changing industries and the very foundations of our economy. We need to move away from oil, coal and gas to renewable energy. And so it should be of great concern that the government is using the coronavirus as cover to push fossil fuels. This week Adam Morton revealed that a manufacturing taskforce, headed by Dow Chemical executive and Saudi Aramco board member Andrew Liveris, is recommending to the National Covid-19 Coordination Commission (itself headed by the current deputy chairman of Strike Energy, Neville Power) that “the Morrison government make sweeping changes to ‘create the market’ for gas and build fossil fuel infrastructure that would operate for decades”. It comes off the back of Angus Taylor suggesting it is not government policy to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, and the government giving in-principle support to recommendations made by a panel headed by a former CEO of Origin Energy, Grant King, to allow the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation fund projects involving carbon capture and storage. Taylor also this week released a discussion paper for a “framework to accelerate low emissions technologies”. While suggesting renewables are vital, it essentially pushes for the same energy mixes that were being advocated a decade ago – more gas, the discredited carbon capture, as well as nuclear power. The government is like a smoker who still thinks switching to low-tar cigarettes is a healthy approach. It’s the wrong policy at precisely the wrong time. As Morton has reported, organisations and governments around the world are advocating using economic stimulus measures to push towards a greener economy. A report released this week by the Australian Conservation Foundation echoed the Grattan Institute’s recent “Start with steel: A practical plan to support carbon workers and cut emissions” report, arguing that we should see the virus as an opportunity to transform our economy and invest in renewable energy. But no. It is clear the government remains wedded to a fossil-fuel based economy in which its climate change policy is merely a sop rather being designed to deal with a major crisis that is only becoming more urgent.

Announcing the measures to the Commons, Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, stressed the desire for continued cooperation with China, but said the actions were “a reasonable and proportionate response” to the law, which effectively criminalises most political dissent. The move, a week after the British government stripped the Chinese telecoms firm Huawei of any future role in the UK’s 5G network, seems certain to further enrage Beijing. Speaking before Raab’s announcement, China’s foreign ministry said it would be a mistake to suspend the extradition treaty and urged the UK “to take no more steps down the wrong path”. While Raab’s decisions were welcomed by both Labour and Conservative MPs, the foreign secretary faced calls to take more robust action, particularly over the mass repression of the Uighur population in China’s Xinjiang province which rights groups warn amounts to cultural genocide. A series of Tories who had long called for action over Huawei said the government must begin what Tobias Ellwood, a former Foreign Office and defence minister, called “a strategic overhaul of our foreign policy in relation to China”. “For decades we’ve turned a blind eye to China’s democratic deficit and human rights violations, in the hope that it would mature into a global, responsible citizen,” he told Raab. “That clearly hasn’t happened. Is this now the turning point where we drop the pretence that China shares our values?” In his statement, Raab said he was particularly worried about sections of the national security law that allowed mainland Chinese authorities to take control of cases and target actions outside of Hong Kong. Saying this was a serious violation of the agreement that set out Hong Kong’s semi-autonomous status after the handover to China in 1997, Raab said extradition would be stopped unless Beijing gave “clear and robust safeguards” about how the law would be used. The UK does not have an extradition agreement with mainland China. The UK is also extending to Hong Kong an arms embargo that has covered mainland China since the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, including a bar on equipment that could be used for crowd control, such as shackles and smoke grenades. Raab said: “We want to work with China. There is enormous scope for positive, constructive, engagement. But, as we strive for that positive relationship, we are also clear-sighted about the challenges that lie ahead.” Britain has already promised that up to 3 million Hong Kong residents will be offered the chance to settle in the UK and a path to permanent citizenship.Lisa Nandy, the shadow foreign secretary, said she supported the measures, but called for action in areas such as Chinese investment in UK nuclear power stations, and a more generous approach in allowing entry to Hong Kong nationals, particularly younger people who were less likely to hold British National (Overseas) passports. “This must mark the start of a more strategic approach to China based on an ethical approach to foreign policy, and an end to the naivety of the golden era years,” she said, referring to the close links forged under David Cameron. “And if it does, he can be assured he will have our full support on this side of the house.” Tom Tugendhat, the Conservative MP who chairs the Commons foreign affairs committee and has been a leading advocate for tougher action against China, told Raab he welcomed the statement, but added: “Given his time before even entering here as a human rights lawyer, can I just ask why he hasn’t yet made an announcement on the abuse of the Uighur Muslim population in western China?” Bob Seely, the Tory MP who was a leading critic of Huawei’s role in the UK, told Raab he welcomed the actions over Hong Kong, but said: “The signal truth is the China we hoped for is not the China we are getting.” He added that a “much more significant reset in our relations” was needed. The government is expected to face continued pressure over the issue, particularly with decisions looming over Chinese involvement in nuclear reactors at Bradwell in Essex and Sizewell in Suffolk. As well as Hong Kong, there has been an upsurge in condemnation of Chinese actions in Xinjiang, where there is evidence of the use of mass internment camps, and there are claims Uighur women are undergoing forced sterilisation to reduce their population. Speaking during a visit to a school on Monday, Boris Johnson said such issues were deeply worrying but that he was “not going to be pushed into a position of becoming a knee-jerk sinophobe on every issue”. The president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews has written to China’s ambassador to the UK, Liu Xiaoming, citing “similarities” between Chinese treatment of Uighurs and Nazi atrocities. Marie van der Zyl wrote: “Nobody could ... fail to notice the similarities between what is alleged to be happening in China today and what happened in Nazi Germany 75 years ago. ... The world will neither forgive nor forget a genocide against the Uighur people.” The UK government is considering whether to take action under so-called Magnitsky laws against individual Chinese officials over the situation in Xinjiang."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2020/jun/29/britains-spending-not-building-reboot-economy","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2020-06-29T16:18:45Z","webTitle":"Britain doesn't need buildings tomorrow, it needs jobs today | Simon Jenkins","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/29/britains-spending-not-building-reboot-economy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/29/britains-spending-not-building-reboot-economy","fields":{"headline":"Britain doesn't need buildings tomorrow, it needs jobs today","bodyText":"Build, build, build, says Boris Johnson. Building has been the vanity of the populist politician down the ages from Nero to Napoleon. Johnson is no exception. The hardest-hearted Tory may treat ordinary public spending as wasteful, but spending on capital projects is glorious. This week history is to repeat itself. David Cameron and George Osborne answered the 2008-09 crisis by slashing spending on public and local services by a third in a decade of austerity. Yet they sailed ahead with nuclear power stations, aircraft carriers, high-speed trains, airport runways and garden cities. Billions were promised, though little or nothing was seen in short-term benefit. In a speech tomorrow, trailed in the newspapers over the weekend, Johnson is set to announce “Project Speed”. The proposals are similarly worthy: schools, hospitals, roads, railways, airports, housing. Add a few power stations and his might be a postwar Labour government. Britain certainly needs some of them one day – though surely not trains and airports – but none qualifies as “speedy”. Central government is the worst contractor. Since Tony Blair took over school building from local councils, we have seen a renewal programme launched in 2004, scrapped in 2010 and resumed in 2014. What now? London’s Royal Docks is the graveyard of these Johnson projects. A ghostly cable car drifts empty across the Thames, while a giant “Nightingale hospital” lies equally empty nearby. Towering in the background is Johnson’s idea of house-building, rows of luxury apartments initiated by him as mayor and aimed at foreign buyers. The proposed new cluster now haunting his colleague Robert Jenrick was first approved by Johnson as mayor. This is not the moment for Roosevelt’s dams or Stalin’s power stations. What the economy needs is not buildings tomorrow but jobs today. And jobs mean cash, not bulldozers. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has rightly taken 9 million people on to the public payroll under furlough, the most sensational act of de facto conscription in peacetime and costing £14bn a month. In four months’ time, this army is to be demobilised. The Office for National Statistics suggests a million workers will be thrown on to benefits, sending the jobless figure to 3.8 million people. A few building sites will do nothing for them. Ask any teacher, doctor or social worker what they most need and they will say cash: for staff, for equipment, for repairs, for transport. They want to use efficiently the buildings that they already have. So chaotic has been the NHS response to Covid-19 that many hospitals are reportedly operating at just half capacity. Schools are craving auxiliaries. Local councils are desperate for care workers. The labour is there, but not the money to pay them. Johnson’s fast train from London to Birmingham in 2030 is no use. The catastrophe that has struck the British economy has hit the private sector hardest, and the smallest firms and poorest employees hardest of all. High-street stores are reporting sales down by between 20% and 60%. These are businesses that have had their trade declared illegal for three months by the government and which, in all fairness, deserve compensation. The Institute of Directors reports that more than half of directors it polled have a crippling debt mountain. For Sunak this should mean not just fiddling with VAT or national insurance. It means extending furloughs, freezing rents and loan write-offs on a massive scale. The grim reality is that a Tory government has devastated a swathe of lower-order capitalism. It took Gordon Brown at the weekend to call on Johnson to stage a “recapitalisation of small business”. That means doling out far more than the £55bn or so of furlough money. Beyond this, what small businesses need most of all is customers. They need people with cash to pass from pockets to tills. They need to see order books filling, vans moving, warehouses emptying and manufacturers back at work. The strangely harsh treatment of pubs, restaurants and gyms compared with the rest of Europe is going to decimate the casual and “gig” economy. This is where unemployment will really bite, and high-end construction is no remedy at all. Worse is to come. Coming off furlough will be bad enough, with the OECD promising Britain the deepest economic shock in Europe. But Johnson is determined to exacerbate it with his continued threat of a “no-deal Brexit” in the new year. This, not Covid-19, is the real “second spike” facing the economy, and it is one against which as yet it has no protection. There must be some government assurance that it will maintain private spending power over the next year, by any means from tax cuts or pay rises to handouts to the needy. The risk of inflation by the short-term “printing of money” must be accepted as necessary in this crisis. Just now, the British economy does not need to build, build, build. It needs to spend, spend, spend.

He said on Monday that the country had managed to get the spread of the virus under control in under two months. Social distancing curbs were loosened for most of the country on 14 May as new infections fell, but the government has kept Tokyo and four other prefectures under watch. Restrictions ease in Madrid and Barcelona Major parks and cafe terraces reopened in Madrid for the first time in more than two months as the capital and the surrounding region moved into the second phase of the loosening of lockdown restrictions. The Barcelona metropolitan area and parts of Castilla y León also joined Madrid in the same phase, which allows groups of up to 10 people to meet as long as they maintain physical distancing. Small shops can also open without prior appointments and places of worship can reopen at 30% capacity. Germany enters recession in first quarter Falling consumer spending, capital investments and exports pushed the German economy into a recession in the first three months of the year, the national statistics office said this morning, as the virus continued to hurt the major economies. Capital investments slumped by 6.9%, private consumption by 3.2% and exports by 3.1% between January and March compared with the last three months of 2019. Global cases pass 5.4m There are currently 5,424,718 confirmed coronavirus cases worldwide, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. The death toll stands at 345,296. Both figures are likely to be higher, due to differing test rates, definitions and deliberate underreporting. China says virus pushing US ties to brink of ‘Cold War’ Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has said that Washington seemed infected by a “political virus” but that Beijing would nevertheless be open to an international effort to find the coronavirus source. “Some political forces in the US are taking China-US relations hostage and pushing our two countries to the brink of a new Cold War,” Wang said. Speaking on Sunday, Robert O’Brien, Donald Trump’s national security adviser, likened China’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak to the Soviet Union’s cover-up of the meltdown at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in 1986. US bars travellers who have been in Brazil in last two weeks The White House has announced it is prohibiting foreigners from travelling to the US if they have been in Brazil in the last two weeks, two days after the South American nation became the world’s second-worst affected country in terms of coronavirus cases. Brazil meanwhile registered 15,813 new cases and 653 new deaths in 24 hours, taking the total number of fatalities to 22,666, and cases to 363,211 confirmed cases, the Health Ministry said. Boris Johnson under pressure to sack senior aide Pressure on Boris Johnson to sack Dominic Cummings has intensified, as at least 19 Conservative MPs publicly called on the adviser to face the consequences of breaking lockdown rules. The UK prime minister backed his senior aide at a defiant press conference on Sunday, saying it had been within the rules for Cummings to drive his family 264 miles to his parents’ estate in Durham while his wife was suffering coronavirus symptoms. Chile’s healthcare system ‘very close to the limit’ The Chilean president,Sebastián Piñera, said on Sunday that the country’s healthcare system is under strain and “very close to the limit”, as the number of confirmed novel coronavirus infections approached 70,000, after a rapid increase in recent days. The Ministry of Health reported 3,709 new cases in the last day, bringing the total to 69,102. The death toll is at 718. South Africa announces further easing of lockdown South Africa will further relax coronavirus lockdown restrictions from 1 June, the president, Cyril Ramaphosa, has announced, allowing large areas of the economy to fully reopen. “Cabinet has determined that the alert level for the whole country should be lowered from level four to level three,” he said in an address broadcast on television, describing the move as a significant shift in approach to the pandemic."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2020/jul/20/revealed-nhs-denied-ppe-at-height-of-covid-19-as-supplies-sent-to-china-coronavirus","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2020-07-20T11:01:45Z","webTitle":"Revealed: NHS denied PPE at height of Covid-19 as supplier prioritised China","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/20/revealed-nhs-denied-ppe-at-height-of-covid-19-as-supplies-sent-to-china-coronavirus","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2020/jul/20/revealed-nhs-denied-ppe-at-height-of-covid-19-as-supplies-sent-to-china-coronavirus","fields":{"headline":"Revealed: NHS denied PPE at height of Covid-19 as supplier prioritised China","bodyText":"The NHS was deprived of large amounts of protective gear at the height of the coronavirus outbreak after a French company contracted to supply millions of masks allegedly prioritised more lucrative deals with deep-pocketed clients including a Chinese state-owned energy company. A joint investigation by the Guardian and the French news website Mediapart has uncovered evidence suggesting the mask manufacturer Valmy failed to fulfil the terms of a £1.2m contract with the NHS to supply about 7m masks in the event of a pandemic. According to the contract, Valmy was required to respond rapidly to the NHS order and begin deliveries within weeks. However, documents seen by the Guardian and Mediapart suggest that rather than prioritising the NHS the company increased production for other customers as mask prices soared. A person familiar with Valmy’s negotiations with the NHS said it waited “quite a long time before responding to the NHS’s request because they could sell at far better prices on other markets”. The disclosures raise questions about the UK government’s reliance on “just in time” logistics to supply personal protective equipment (PPE) in a pandemic situation. The arrangements, common in the manufacturing and retail sectors, were introduced in 2017 to reduce the cost of maintaining a large PPE stockpile. According to two senior NHS procurement officials, “just in time” PPE contracts encountered significant difficulties in the early days of the Covid-19 outbreak. Amid a surge in global demand for PPE, the guarantees to supply the NHS were at the mercy of chaotic international supply chains, ruthless market practices and protectionism. “All of the comfort blankets we thought we had basically went up in flames,” one of the officials said. Valmy’s contract with the NHS was dealt a further blow in early March when the French government issued a decree requisitioning stocks of respirator masks. Valmy is understood to be under investigation in France in connection with alleged violations of the decree. Laurent Suissa, the managing director of Valmy’s Paris-based parent company, Segetex, said he had “no comment to make” in response to the Guardian and Mediapart’s detailed questions about Valmy’s operations and its dealings with the NHS. He said the company was cooperating with French investigators and was “in no way worried about the outcome of the investigation”. A spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) insisted “just in time” contracts had been used successfully in the pandemic. “We have taken every possible step to secure PPE so that those working on the frontline of this global pandemic are properly protected.” Under the terms of its NHS contract, signed in January 2017, Valmy was required to deliver almost 7m FFP3 respirator masks to the UK at 17p per mask in a pandemic situation as soon as the order was activated. “Time shall be of the essence,” the contract stated. On 3 February, three days after the World Health Organization declared a global public emergency, the NHS formally activated the contract. At this point, documents suggest, Valmy was ordered to begin making deliveries to the UK within three weeks. Deliveries were scheduled across nine weeks to distribute masks across the UK’s PPE stockpiles. Almost three weeks after activation, Valmy informed the NHS that its factory in France was experiencing “significant delays” due to labour shortages and machinery issues, emails show. “It’s frustrating we can’t keep up with global demand,” the company said, “but rest assured we are prioritising the NHS and other national health providers.” However, documents suggest that around the same time Valmy’s factory was prioritising the production of millions of masks for other clients. According to the documents, Valmy and Segetex agreed an order of 2.1m N95 masks with CGN Energy, a subsidiary of the large Chinese state-owned nuclear power company CGN. Emails suggest CGN made a number of visits to Valmy’s factory in February to collect its orders, which it said were delivered to Wuhan. The involvement of the Chinese government in the deal remains unclear, but in March vehicles with diplomatic registration plates are believed to have arrived at Valmy’s factory near Lyon. It is understood one of the vehicles was registered to the Chinese diplomatic service, while another was registered to a nuclear fusion facility where CGN operates. Neither CGN nor the Chinese embassy in Paris responded to requests for comment. Data suggests Valmy did not begin manufacturing the kind of FFP3 masks it promised the NHS until late February, and in the four weeks after the contract’s activation the majority of Valmy’s operations were focused on producing N95 masks, made to meet Chinese safety standards, rather than FFP3s for the NHS. Valmy’s UK head of sales, Graham Rix, defended the company’s handling of the NHS contract. “Like any situation when you are faced with demand from a number of different customers – because remember, the NHS isn’t the only customer Valmy has – you have to prioritise the orders,” he said. “Any capacity that we had, as far as I was aware, was going to the French government.” However, official documents suggest the French government did not confirm any orders with Valmy’s parent company until 11 March, shortly after a sweeping requisition decree seized respirator mask stocks across the country. Rix accepted there had been issues with the NHS contract, but said Valmy had delivered 1.3m masks to the NHS in the past four weeks. “We will be delivering significant volumes going forward now that we have increased our capacity with the factory,” he added."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/ng-interactive/2019/may/03/sam-and-the-plant-next-door-growing-up-with-hinkley-point-video","type":"interactive","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2019-05-03T11:00:46Z","webTitle":"Sam and the Plant Next Door: growing up with Hinkley Point - Guardian documentary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/ng-interactive/2019/may/03/sam-and-the-plant-next-door-growing-up-with-hinkley-point-video","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/ng-interactive/2019/may/03/sam-and-the-plant-next-door-growing-up-with-hinkley-point-video","fields":{"headline":"Sam and the Plant Next Door: growing up with Hinkley Point - video","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2019/jun/17/scotland-urged-to-invest-in-nuclear-to-hit-climate-goals","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2019-06-17T15:02:46Z","webTitle":"Scotland urged to invest in nuclear to hit climate goals","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jun/17/scotland-urged-to-invest-in-nuclear-to-hit-climate-goals","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2019/jun/17/scotland-urged-to-invest-in-nuclear-to-hit-climate-goals","fields":{"headline":"Scotland urged to invest in nuclear to hit climate goals","bodyText":"Scotland should consider new nuclear power stations, investing in hydrogen and installing many more windfarms to meet its climate goals, an expert inquiry has concluded. The inquiry by the Royal Society of Edinburgh, Scotland’s national academy, said a massive increase in low-carbon electricity production would be needed in order to reach the country’s new goal of net zero emissions by 2045. Prof Becky Lunn, a civil engineer who is deputy chair of the inquiry, said electricity production may need to increase fourfold to decarbonise the transport system and heating, with major implications for ministers and the public. “We have got difficult decisions to make and if we delay we will end up importing by default, which is not a place where in future I think we would wish to be,” she said. “We need to change. At the moment we have a totally unsustainable system.” Alongside a substantial increase in electricity production, Scotland would need: • A statutory commission to provide independent expert direction on energy policy and governance. • Much tougher energy efficiency regulations for homes and buildings. • Substantial investment in carbon capture and storage, so CO2 created during the production of hydrogen could be buried offshore. • Subsidies to ensure higher energy prices and upgrading costs did not increase fuel poverty. Lunn said this was increasingly urgent. Scotland’s two nuclear power stations at Hunterston and Torness, which provided 37% of the country’s electricity in 2017, are due to close by 2030, just as electricity demand is forecast to soar. The RSE report, Scotland’s Energy Future, was published as climate activists with the Extinction Rebellion protest group marched on the Scottish parliament to set up a week-long camp to put pressure on Holyrood to agree more ambitious CO2 reduction targets. Meanwhile Greenpeace continued its campaign against BP’s increased oil drilling by pursuing an oil rig its activists had occupied in the Cromarty Firth last week into the North Sea, using its protest ship, Arctic Sunrise. Greenpeace said its continued pursuit of the rig, the Paul B Loyd Jr, had prevented it from arriving in the Vorlich oilfield, where BP hopes to extract 30m barrels of oil. Extinction Rebellion is planning to block roads in Edinburgh this week, mirroring similar protests in London and other cities. The Scottish government has accepted a challenging target of achieving net zero emissions by 2045, five years earlier than the 2050 UK target agreed last week by Theresa May, the prime minister. In 2017, Scotland emitted 40.5 megatonnes of CO2 equivalent. Greenpeace and Extinction Rebellion argue that continued drilling undermine those goals – a stance rejected by the UK and Scottish governments and the RSE. The net zero concept means continued use of oil, gas and potentially coal. But extra forests, carbon storage and other measures would be needed to soak up the CO2 that those released. The RSE inquiry was funded by four major energy firms, the oil company BP, the French nuclear and renewables firm EDF, the gas company Centrica and the renewables firm SSE. The RSE said they had no bearing or influence over the report’s conclusions but the report mirrored those companies’ arguments that nuclear energy, oil and gas would still be needed – conclusions many climate and environment activists reject. Lunn said ministers should eventually consider small modular nuclear reactors, an experimental technology which, its supporters argue, is safer and much easier to build than large-scale nuclear power stations. Methane would still be needed in large amounts to produce hydrogen: large-scale hydrogen plants would be connected to carbon storage sites in the bedrock offshore. Oil would still be needed to provide fuel for aviation and shipping, for medicines and materials such as plastics. It would be impossible, the RSE said, to equally meet the four key tests of tackling climate change, guaranteeing energy security, making it affordable and at the same time maximising the social acceptability and economic wellbeing of those energy choices. Lunn said the RSE’s conclusions were that meeting the country’s low-carbon energy challenges would require compromises."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2020/dec/03/valery-giscard-destaing-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2020-12-03T16:45:33Z","webTitle":"Valéry Giscard d’Estaing obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/03/valery-giscard-destaing-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2020/dec/03/valery-giscard-destaing-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Valéry Giscard d’Estaing obituary","bodyText":"As Valéry Giscard d’Estaing became the Grand Old Man of French politics – a position he held for at least two decades – it became harder to recall the intellectually brilliant and reforming politician who in 1974 became the Fifth Republic’s youngest president. Giscard, who has died aged 94, was 48 when he became president and only 55 when he stopped, after one seven-year term, meaning he experienced his political career go into decline at an age when most of his contemporaries were only just making a bid for high office. Thereafter Giscard fought to remain relevant, particularly in European politics, as he saw off his bitter rivals – François Mitterrand and Jacques Chirac – to become the longest lived former French president in history. It would be a mistake, however, to remember Giscard, or VGE as he was often known, solely for his longevity. His presidential victory brought a fresher, more socially liberal and modernising figure to the Élysée Palace after the stuffy postwar authoritarianism of General Charles de Gaulle and Georges Pompidou. Giscard arrived at the tail end of the “Trente Glorieuses” – the 30 golden years of postwar economic prosperity in France – and swept out some of the dust: reducing the voting age to 18; introducing divorce by common consent and the legalisation of abortion; overseeing the creation of France’s high-speed TGV rail network and promoting nuclear power as a pillar of French independence. Giscard called himself the “conservative who likes change” and a “normal president”; he shunned the ceremonial dress of his predecessors, preferring navy blue suits and ties, albeit bespoke from Savile Row, for his official portrait. To boost the idea that he had the common touch, he was photographed playing football and the accordion, while his wife, Anne-Aymone de Brantes – who had a genuine aristocratic background – was pictured by Paris Match magazine in the Élysée kitchen, brandishing a shiny pan that had clearly never been anywhere near a stove, held in the tips of fingers that had perfectly manicured nails. Despite attempts to paint himself as a people’s president, a JFK à la Française, Giscard was always grand, claiming to be descended from Louis XV and suffusing the presidential office with the regal mien of a republican monarch. His PR forays into popular style, including inviting refuse collectors to breakfast at the Élysée and turning up unannounced to dine with French families, were considered condescending by the country’s press and he was sometimes accused of haughtiness and snobbery. Margaret Thatcher as British prime minister is said to have found him patronising and there was not a great deal of warmth in their relationship. “She was not very pro-European,” he said. “She was ardently pro-British, and she saw Europe as a large free-trade zone.” Giscard was born in Koblenz, Germany, during the French occupation of the Rhineland in the aftermath of the first world war. He was the second of five children, and the elder son, of a high-ranking civil servant, Edmond Giscard d’Estaing, and his wife, May (nee Bardoux). Edmond Giscard had adopted the noble-sounding d’Estaing to the family name in 1922, linking it to a lineage officially extinct in the late 18th century. The family was well off and set out to offer the young Valéry as many advantages as possible for a high-flying career that was mapped out from the cradle. He was educated at the prestigious Louis-le-Grand lycée in Paris but interrupted his studies to join the army after the outbreak of the second world war. Although Giscard’s father was a strong supporter of the Nazi collaborationist Vichy government and was decorated by its leader, Marshal Philippe Pétain, Giscard declared his support of the exiled De Gaulle and was drafted into the French Second Armoured Division as a brigadier after it landed in Normandy in 1944. He was later awarded the Croix de Guerre for bravery under fire. After the war, he was admitted into France’s top grande école, the Polytéchnique, in Paris, and went on to attend the newly founded Ecole Normale d’Administration, the hothouse for France’s civil service and political elite. His family connections with big business and his aristocratic marriage to Anne-Aymone in 1952 were important advantages in his rapid political advancement. He became a member of the Assemblée Nationale at 30 after winning a traditional family constituency in the Auvergne and was a junior minister at 33. Five years later, in 1962, he was made minister of finance under De Gaulle, who predicted the young, ambitious politician would one day betray him, but that Giscard would do it “elegantly”. As foretold, in 1969 Giscard led internal rightwing opposition to De Gaulle’s referendum on abolishing the senate – the French parliament’s upper house – and was largely instrumental in De Gaulle’s humiliating defeat and resignation. When De Gaulle’s successor, Pompidou, died in April 1974, five years into his seven-year mandate, Giscard stood and narrowly beat Mitterrand. He was the first French presidential candidate to appreciate and use television appearances to boost his election campaign. While responsible for many modernising reforms, including loosening government control over state-financed radio and television, Giscard refused to abolish the death penalty, and three people were executed by guillotine during his term in office. He told journalists 10 years ago that he would probably have maintained the death penalty if re-elected. It was finally abolished in 1981 under Mitterrand. The second global oil crisis, in 1979, brought the Trente Glorieuses to an abrupt end, throwing Giscard’s economic programme off track and leading to record inflation in France. Partly as a result of the crisis, he accelerated a campaign for European unity, mainly through a close friendship with the West German chancellor Helmut Schmidt. Between them, they persuaded Europe’s partners to hold regular summit meetings and set up the European monetary system. On the wider international field, Giscard was the first western leader to support the Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev in establishing the Helsinki agreement. But in Africa, where he oversaw French military intervention in Chad, Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo) and Mauritania, Giscard risked his reputation through his friendship with the Central African emperor and tyrant Jean-Bédel Bokassa. The French president was ridiculed by the press for receiving gifts of diamonds and a hunting lodge from the dictator, who accompanied Giscard on safaris. Press attacks over this issue led to Giscard abandoning the relaxed approachable style he had adopted in the early months of his presidency and eventually he seemed isolated from the electorate. His acceptance of the gems from Bokassa, later reported as the “diamond affair” by the satirical newspaper Le Canard enchaîné, would return to damage his re-election campaign. Giscard had appointed Chirac his prime minister but relations between the two men quickly soured and in the 1981 presidential campaign, Chirac, a rightwing Gaullist, supported the socialist Mitterrand. When Giscard finally left the Élysée after handing over power to Mitterrand, he was booed and spat on by the crowd. Chirac’s betrayal caused a rift that lasted until his death last year. Giscard did not accept defeat gracefully and sought to remain in the political limelight, never missing an opportunity to snipe at Chirac from the backbenches of the Assemblée Nationale. His attempts to maintain a high political profile were continually frustrated, although he won elections as a deputy and an MEP, and as president of the regional council of Auvergne, based in Clermont-Ferrand. He never fully recovered from the ridicule and suspicion aroused by his friendship with Bokassa and his attempt to introduce a European constitution, which he himself drafted, was killed off after French voters rejected it in a 2005 referendum. Like many French presidents, Giscard was notoriously unfaithful to his wife. After it was reported that he had crashed a Ferrari borrowed from the film director Roger Vadim into a milk float in the early hours of a September morning in 1974, with a celebrated actress in the passenger seat – an incident he later denied – he was nicknamed Valéry Folamour (Crazy Lover). In 2009 he wrote a novel called The Princess and the President, about an affair between an elder French statesman and a certain Patricia, Princess of Cardiff, a barely disguised Diana, Princess of Wales, whom he had met and admired. Afterwards, Giscard insisted the affair was “fiction” and a figment of his writer’s imagination. In May this year, a German journalist filed a legal complaint against Giscard, alleging he had repeatedly grabbed her after an interview in 2018. Giscard was the first sponsor of the Musée d’Orsay, the Paris museum dedicated to 19th-century art and architecture, but perhaps the French should remember – and thank – him as much for what he stopped than what he allowed. One of his first actions as president was to halt development schemes to build skyscrapers and office towers in Paris, insisting that its monumental treasures and unencumbered skyline should be preserved. He is survived by Anne-Aymone and three of their four children, Valérie-Anne, Henri and Louis.

But Shinjiro Koizumi, the son of the former prime minister Junichiro Koizumi, faces an early test of his abilities after he was appointed environment minister on Wednesday. Koizumi, 38, will be instrumental in deciding the fate of more than 1m tonnes of contaminated water stored at the wrecked Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. His appointment comes one day after his predecessor, Yoshiaki Harada, said the plant’s operator had no choice but to dump the water into the Pacific Ocean. Koizumi has been widely tipped as a future prime minister. In a Kyodo news agency survey in May, he ranked second after Abe on who should be prime minister, with 19.9% support compared with 20.1% for Abe. But, according to some observers, he may lack the experience and support inside the ruling Liberal Democratic party to immediately succeed Abe. Despite his inexperience, Koizumi’s family background has guaranteed him widespread media coverage throughout his four terms as an MP. On Wednesday, he became the third-youngest cabinet minister in Japan since the end of the second world war. He made the news again recently with the announcement, made outside the prime minister’s office, that he will marry Christel Takigawa, a well-known TV personality with whom he is expecting a child. Little is known, however, about Koizumi’s views on specific issues, including nuclear power. Under Abe, Japan has committed to restarting some of the nuclear reactors closed down in the aftermath of the March 2011 meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi – a crisis that turned his father into a prominent opponent of nuclear power. “Until now, Shinjiro has been mostly performance and it is not clear how much policy knowhow he has,” said Yu Uchiyama, a professor at Tokyo University. “Now that will become clear.” Abe turned to more experienced colleagues for senior ministerial posts, moving Taro Kono from the foreign ministry to defence and replacing him with the economic revitalisation minister, Toshimitsu Motegi, whose promotion was seen as a reward for his work in negotiating a trade deal with the US. Taro Aso, the gaffe-prone deputy prime minister, will stay on as finance minister. The number of women in Abe’s 19-member cabinet stands at just two after he appointed Seiko Hashimoto, a former Olympic speed skater, as Olympics minister a year before the summer Games open in Tokyo. Sanae Takaichi, a rightwinger who regularly visits Yasukuni, a controversial war shrine in Tokyo, was made interior minister. Some analysts interpreted Abe’s reshuffle as the start of a process to pick his successor. “Abe intends to start an open race to pick the next prime minister or even the one after that,” said the SMBC Nikko Securities chief market economist, Yoshimasa Maruyama. Abe, who began his second stint as prime minister in December 2012, will become Japan’s longest-serving leader in November. His tenure as LDP leader ends in September 2021, so party rules would have to change if he decided to serve another term. Koizumi, often referred to by his first name, graduated from a private Japanese university in Japan and has a master’s degree from Columbia University in New York. He became an MP in 2009, winning the lower house seat vacated by his father.

In a letter to the national cabinet, federal and state energy ministers and Nev Power, Scott Morrison’s handpicked Covid-19 recovery chairman, the 14 organisations have called for government support in the wake of the pandemic to urgently stimulate job growth and rebuild a “sustainable and strong economy”. They say it should include measures to cut emissions and accelerate a transition to clean energy across all regions and economic sectors, and recommend a focus on fixing inefficient homes and buildings. Signatories to the letter, sent on 15 May, include the heads of the Business Council, the Property Council, the Australian Energy Council, the Australian Industry Group, the ACTU, the Australian Council of Social Service, the Brotherhood of St Laurence and the Australian Conservation Foundation. “Australia faces a public health emergency with immediate economic impacts as well as longer-lasting global economic pain. Beyond the pandemic, Australian prosperity also depends on dealing with other long-term challenges, including the transition to net zero emissions,” the letter says. It can bee seen as part of a growing global call for governments to respond to the economic shock of the pandemic with policies that also help tackle the climate crisis. The federal government continues to reject a 2050 target of net zero emissions and is developing a roadmap for emissions reduction that suggests a major role for gas, a fossil fuel, alongside hydrogen, renewable energy and, potentially, nuclear power. The National Covid-19 Coordination Commission is heavily backing gas to drive the economic recovery. The groups say there are many opportunities to cut emissions, but single out energy efficiency and management. They call for government support for upgrades across private and public housing, commercial, community and government buildings and industrial facilities. Suggested improvements include more efficient and controllable appliances and equipment, improved “thermal envelopes” – walls, roofs, floors and windows – and shading, introducing smart meters to better manage electricity use across the day and an expanded roll-out of solar panels and home batteries. The letter cites the International Energy Agency as highlighting that energy efficiency upgrades are “job-intensive and strongly support economic stimulus goals”. “In Australia, a major drive to improve the energy efficiency of buildings and industry could deliver over 120,000 job-years of employment,” it says. “If done well, these investments would durably lower energy bills; ease strains on a rapidly changing energy system; improve health and safety during increasingly hot summers; boost the competitiveness of local manufacturers, whose value to Australia is clearer than ever; enable deeper emissions cuts – and sustain activity across a broad range of trades and industries.” A report released last month by ClimateWorks Australia on how to decarbonise the country found the technology for zero-emissions buildings already existed, and much of it was simple. Steps would or could involve improving insulation and draught sealing, installing LED lighting, solar hot water and better appliances and introducing passive house design standards. It would require shifting from gas-fired heating and cooking to running on clean energy. A separate study by Beyond Zero Emissions, another not-for-profit group, has estimated there could be more than 300,000 jobs in a national “deep energy retrofit” drive to improve the efficiency of 3m buildings across the country, starting with social housing, low-income homes, schools and hospitals, to a point where they no longer face quarterly electricity or gas bills. The letter to governments says potential templates for publicly funded efficiency drives include the Clean Energy Finance Corporation’s support for the construction of hundreds of 7-star affordable housing units in Sydney, and a 2017 energy upgrade that cut energy use at the MCG by 24%, saving enough power to run more than 1,800 homes. It says governments should look for other climate-friendly options that can support economic recovery and energy transition, including integrating recovery plans with long-term emissions reduction strategies and plans for modernising power grids, carbon farming and bushfire recovery. Other signatories are the heads of WWF, the Energy Users Association, the St Vincent de Paul Society, the Investor Group on Climate Change, the Carbon Market Institute and the Energy Efficiency Council."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2022/feb/18/retail-sales-rebound-omicron-rbs-profits-bonus-stock-markets-ukraine-oil-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-02-18T18:05:40Z","webTitle":"Retailers face tough 2022 despite sales rebound; FTSE 100’s worst week since November; NatWest back in profit – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2022/feb/18/retail-sales-rebound-omicron-rbs-profits-bonus-stock-markets-ukraine-oil-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2022/feb/18/retail-sales-rebound-omicron-rbs-profits-bonus-stock-markets-ukraine-oil-business-live","fields":{"headline":"Retailers face tough 2022 despite sales rebound; FTSE 100’s worst week since November; NatWest back in profit – as it happened","bodyText":"Time to wrap up - here’s some of today’s main stories. Goodnight, and stay safe. GW Shares in streaming company Roku have tumbled by a quarter today, after it missed revenue forecasts last night and issued underwhelming guidance. Roku is one of the ‘pandemic winners’ that have found conditions more challenging of late (see also Peloton, Shopify, Zoom...). Last night it reported that revenue growth slowed in the last quarter, to 33% year-on-year, from 51% in Q3. For the current quarter, it forecast revenue of $720m, which implies 25% revenue growth, below expectations of $748.5m. Shares have slid over 25% today to $108 - last July, they hit a record high of $490, before the boom in fast-growing tech firms faded. As Bloombert puts it: It’s a sharp reversal for Roku, which was among the stay-at-home winners amid the Covid-19 pandemic that shuttered cities for months on end. The stock gained nearly 150% in 2020 as the coronavirus accelerated a shift toward streaming video among consumers. Investors are now reassessing the valuation it had received, as they rotate out of high-growth tech names. “At a time when interest rates were near zero and retail money poured into the equity markets, Roku was a perfect stock to own,” wrote Michael Nathanson, an analyst at MoffettNathanson, who has a sell rating on the stock. He noted that Roku had some blockbuster quarterly reports in the pandemic era, helped by growth in streaming video. “As the enterprise value pushed higher and higher, it just became harder and harder to justify that valuation.” Pret a Manger’s owners have warned of doubts over its ability to continue as a going concern as the coffee shop chain faces uncertainty over future Covid restrictions and a shift to hybrid working. Accounts for Pret’s UK holding company filed this week show that last month it doubled its “standby facility” reserved to support the business in case of difficulty to £200m, up from the £100m set aside in March last year. The latest cash call on shareholders comes on top of £100m pumped into the business in the autumn and £185m in 2020 when the company first warned of “material uncertainties” as sales were crushed by the pandemic. In the holding company accounts, which were signed off on 10 February, directors said there were still “material uncertainties which may cast significant doubt over the group’s ability to continue as a going concern”. They said that the possibility of further trading restrictions linked to Covid-19 and the associated unpredictability of consumer behaviour as well as uncertainty about the group’s ability to refinance a debt facility that expires in July next year were potential clouds over its financial position. The group, which had debts of almost £400m at the end of 2020, has been dramatically affected by the pandemic, during which it was forced to close some outlets for several months. The London-focused business has also been hit by the shift to working from home and a decline in tourist numbers in the capital. Ukraine worries pulled all the main European indices down by the close of trading. Germany’s DAX fell almost 1.5%, Spain’s IBEX lost almost 1%, Italy’s FTSE Mib shed 0.6%, while France’s CAC only lost 0.25%, as the early rally fizzled out. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets European markets initially had a more positive tone today, ahead of the weekend as the negativity from yesterday started to be replaced by cautious optimism that there will be no further negative developments ahead of next week’s meeting between US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. Unfortunately, the early gains soon disappeared on reports that separatist leaders in Eastern Ukraine were evacuating their citizens in the region into Russia for their own safety. In the City, the FTSE 100 has closed 24 points lower at 7514 points, down 0.3% today. That takes the blue-chip index’s losses this week to 1.9%, after a big fall on Monday. It’s the worst week since late November when the discovery of the Omicron variant rocked markets. Russian steel manufacturing business Evraz was the top faller today, for the second day running, down 7.2%. Technology-focused firms also lost ground, with industrial software company Aveva losing 6.3% and online grocery operation Ocado off 4.4%. Travel companies were also pulled lower by the Ukraine crisis, with IAG (which owns British Airways) losing 2.9%. The smaller FTSE 250 index lost 0.9%, with holiday firm TUI dropping 5.3%. Stocks turned lower after the head of the Russia-backed separatist states in Ukraine announced a mass evacuation of citizens. The move could be part of a plan to trigger a Russian intervention in Ukraine. Here’s the situation across UK travel, with rail, road and ferry operators urging people to avoid journeys due to disruption caused by Storm Eunice: Hermès, the French luxury goods maker, is opening three new factories as it struggles to keep up with demand for its £5,000-plus Birkin and Kelly handbags. The company said on Friday it planned to open new leather goods factories in the French towns of Louviers, Sormonne and Riom before 2024 in order to increase and speed up its production of the expensive bags. It has also recently opened its first leather-working school to train more craftspeople in the art of handbag making. The company, which already has more than 4,300 leather workers on its staff, said it was hiring more than 400 artisans each year. However, Hermès said it needed far more to keep up with demand for its handbags, which has jumped during the Covid pandemic as soaring stock markets have left the world’s richest people with a lot more disposable income. Shares in Hermès have dropped 5% today, after it reported that production bottlenecks had hit sales at its leather goods and saddlery division. European consumers have grown a little less optimistic this month, indicating that inflation, and the Ukraine crisis, may be hitting morale. The Europen Commission’s monthly gauge of consuer confidence in the European Union dropped by 0.2 points to -10.2 this month. In the euroarea it dipped to -8.8, from -8.5. At these levels, the indicator is converging towards its long-term average, the EC says. It slumped early in the pandemic, but then recovered after the first lockdowns were lifted. US home sales have jumped in January, with cash buyers squeezing out prospective first-time house owners. Sales of existing homes (ie, not new builds) jumped 6.7% last month, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.50 million units. The average price hit $350,300, up 15.4% from January 2021, lifted by record low inventories, pressure to secure deal before interest rates rise, and cash-rich buyers. Lawrence Yun, NAR’s chief economist, explains: “Buyers were likely anticipating further rate increases and locking-in at the low rates, and investors added to overall demand with all-cash offers. Consequently, housing prices continue to move solidly higher.” First-time buyers were squeezed out of the market - responsible for 27% of sales in January, down from 30% in December and down from 33% in January 2021. Each of the four major U.S. regions experienced an increase in sales in January. However, year-over-year, activity was mixed - down 2.3% overall, with sales lower in the Northeast and West, flat in the Midwest and up year-on-year in the South. Back in the UK, John Lewis shops in Cardiff, Exeter and Bristol’s Cribbs Causeway shopping centre did not open because of Storm Eunice today while Waitrose outlets in Saltash, on the Cornish border, Farnham in Surrey, and Hawkhurst in Kent also temporarily closed. Waitrose said that local branches were deciding whether to go ahead with home deliveries depending on weather conditions in the area. On Wall Street, stocks have dipped in early trading, as uncertainty about inflation, rising interest rates and fears of conflict in Ukraine all weigh on markets The Dow Jones industrial average has dropped by 53 points, or 0.16%, a day after sliding 1.8% in its worst fall of 2022. The tech-focused Nasdaq is 0.25% lower. Craig Erlam of OANDA says news that US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is ready to meet with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov next week has calmed markets. Risk aversion swept through the markets on Thursday as the perceived risk of a Russian invasion of Ukraine rose. Much like the weather here in London, Friday was shaping up to be rather treacherous in the markets, that is until US Secretary of State Antony Blinken accepted an invitation to meet Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Europe next week. While we’re still being warned that a Russian invasion is highly likely, the meeting does offer hope that nothing will happen before then which is bringing some stability in the markets. In the absence of the meeting, it could have been another turbulent day in the markets and we could still see some risk aversion creeping in as we near the close, given how quickly these situations can change. Two more UK energy suppliers, Whoop Energy and Xcel Power Ltd, have ceased trading today. Whoop Energy supplies 212 business customers, and 50 domestic accounts, while Xcel Power supplied gas to 274 businesses. Regulator Ofgem says that under its safety net, customers’ energy supply will continue and funds that domestic customers have paid into their accounts will be protected, where they are in credit. Domestic customers will also be protected by the energy price cap when being switched to a new supplier, which will be chosen by Ofgem. A burning ship carrying almost 4,000 cars – including 1,100 Porsches – has been drifting in the mid-Atlantic after the vessel’s 22 crew members were evacuated, the Portuguese navy has said. The ship Felicity Ace, which was carrying a number of Volkswagen Group vehicles from Germany to the US, caught fire near the Azores on Wednesday evening, a VW spokesperson said on Friday. None of the crew members evacuated on Wednesday were hurt, Portugal’s navy said. UberEats have also paused deliveries where there is a Red weather warning, meaning winds are most severe and dangerous today: “Due to the severe weather conditions we have temporarily paused the Uber Eats app in locations where a Red weather warning is in place. Our local teams are closely monitoring the situation and we hope to resume services as soon as it is safe to do so.” Supermarket chain Morrisons says it had paused using larger lorries for deliveries in “red” areas of the UK, where wind speeds are highest in today’s storm. Its home delivery vans are driving more slowly in those areas for safety reasons, so the number of drops will reduce, potentially causing some delays. Eurozone builders had a poor end to 2021, as the surge in Covid-19 cases hit the economy. Production across the construction sector fell by 4.0% month-on-month in the euro area, and by 3.1% in the wider EU. Construction work in Austria, which imposed a full lockdown in November, shrank by 8.1%. Production was down 7.3% in Germany, which brought in restrictions on unvaccinated citizens. Deliveroo has also temporarily halted some deliveries due to storm Eunice. The delivery firm says it has paused deliveries in London, Wales, the south west and parts of the south east in the interests of rider safety. Household spending on holidays and travel jumped in January compared with a year earlier, according to analysis by Britain’s biggest building society, via PA Media. Spending on holidays increased by 379% annually in January, while spending on airline travel was up by 408% and spending on cruises surged by 899%, Nationwide Building Society said. The report was based on an analysis of nearly 200 million debit and credit card and direct debit transactions made by Nationwide’s members in January It shows the difference compared to a year ago, when the UK was in a strict lockdown and Covid vaccines were just being rolled out. Mark Nalder, Nationwide’s head of payments, said spending on holidays, airline travel and cruises is playing a big role in rising spending levels “as consumers start 2022 in a positive frame of mind about the outlook for Covid-19 and about their travel plans for the coming year”. He added: “The rising cost of living also continues to slowly bite into consumers’ pockets with spending on utilities and bills, including energy, water and tax bills, up more than a quarter compared to December but, perhaps more importantly, up nearly 10% on the same month last year. “Spending on paying off existing debts, such as credit card bills, also increased in January as people look to try and pay down debt racked up in the run-up to Christmas.” Mr Nalder said spending is expected to grow in February as “the return to offices boosts spending in areas such as travel, eating and drinking and leisure and recreation”. Holiday firm TUI reported a jump in bookings earlier this month: The storms hitting the UK and Europe are also pushing down power prices, as wind turbine output jumps. Electricity prices for the next few days in Europe have plunged, Bloomberg reports, as the region’s wind turbines are poised to generate some of the highest levels ever seen. They say: Day-ahead power in Germany, Europe’s biggest market, plunged as much as 66% to its lowest level this year. Output from Germany’s wind parks will double by early Saturday compared with actual output on Friday morning, according to a forecast by Bloomberg. The cost of electricity has dropped from records in December, but Europe’s many millions of homes and factories are still facing record bills for this winter. The absence of any real cold spells this year also helped depress prices. In the UK, wind is currently generating 33% of electricity, pushing the overall renewables contribution over 40%: Takeway courier group JustEat and fast track grocery firm Getir have both suspended deliveries in parts of the UK most affected by Storm Eunice. JustEat said it had temporarily ceased operations in London, Cambridge, Brighton, Wales, and the South West, as one of the worst storms in decades hits the UK. A JustEat spokesperson said: “Courier safety is our number one priority and we have immediately suspended deliveries in all affected areas today. We will not reopen until it is safe to do so.” Getir said it was pausing deliveries in London and “affected areas across the south of England” because of the danger posed to its workers. Turancan Salur, general manager for the UK said “At Getir, the safety and wellbeing of our employees come first, and we will continue to assess the situation and follow the latest guidance before resuming operations. We apologise to customers for any inconvenience caused by this momentary pause and look forward to resuming operations once it is safe to do so. All couriers, and other employees affected by closing for the storm, will continue to receive their full pay.” Here’s our liveblog on Storm Eunice: Back in the markets, the oil price has dropped to its lowest level in a week. Brent crude is down 2.5% at $90.60 per barrel, on hopes of a breakthrough in the Iran nuclear deal negotiations. US crude has dropped back through $90/barrel. Yesterday, a US State Department spokesperson told AFP that “substantial progress has been made in the last week,” in the talks in Vienna. If Iran’s 2015 nuclear agreement can be revived, then the eventual lifting of sanctions could see Iranian oil return to the markets again. Oil hit seven year highs on Monday, on worries that conflict in Ukraine was imminent, but has slipped back since. Stephen Brennock at brokerage PVM Oil says (via Reuters): “For all the talk of war and conflict, market players remain unconvinced. This is perhaps why the geopolitical risk premium is starting to wane,” Elsewhere in retail, the boom in rapid delivery services and online shopping has pushed up profits at British warehousing firm Segro. Segro, whose warehouses are scattered across the UK and continental Europe, reported a 20% jump in adjusted profits for 2021, while an earnings measure that tracks the value of its buildings surged by 40%. Segro says it saw record levels of rental growth last year, and a £4.1bn increase in the value of its portfolio. Demand to rent Segro’s properties jumped in the lockdown, as more customers shopped over the internet. As chief executive David Sleath told us late last year: “We get everyday things. That could be a coffee cup, or it could be something you’ve downloaded on your phone that’s gone through a data centre... We create the space to enable extraordinary things to happen.” Segro says that ‘quick-commerce’ (where customers can order goods to arrive almost immediately) is driving growth too. E-commerce is still an important source of occupier demand across Europe and continues to contribute significantly to our lettings performance, but we are seeing new names emerge in the space (for example rapid grocery delivery services and other ‘q-commerce’ businesses) and its impact is now being felt more widely across the portfolio, for example in our urban estates in Germany, France and Spain. In France, power company EDF raising €2.5bn to strengthen its finances, after being forced to sell power below market prices to protect consumers from the energy crunch. EDF will hold a €2.5bn rights issue, through which France’s government will pump €2.1bn into the company. EDF announced the cash call after an estimated €8bn were wiped out by the French state’s move to cap energy bill hikes at 4% this year. Under that plan, EDF was forced to sell electricity generated by its fleet of nuclear reactors to rival home suppliers at well below the current record high market prices, to protect customers in the cost of living crisis. On top of that, EDF says it faces an €11bn hit to core profits from outages at several French nuclear power plants, due to maintance work. France’s finance Mmnister Bruno Le Maire, told RTL radio station that the state’s participation in the EDF rights issue senta signal to investors. “You can have confidence in EDF.” EDF expects that higher global energy prices will add around €6bn to this year’s core profits. Many economists are warning that UK retailers face a tough 2022, despite the bounceback in spending in January. Adam Hoyes, assistant economist at Capital Economics, says the strong 1.9% jump in retail sales volumes last month masks some underlying weakness. Food sales declined for the third consecutive month, by a chunky 2.3% m/m, although this may be partly due to people eating out more and ordering takeaways, which boosts non-retail spending. Clothing sales fell 5.0% m/m (the second decline in a row), perhaps due to the less generous deals on offer in the January sales as confirmed by the consumer price data released earlier this week. This may suggest that the cost of living crisis is already forcing some households to cut back on spending. Consumer spending will be squeezed as wages are eroded by inflation, as Sam Miley, senior economist at the CEBR thinktank, explains: “Sales volumes returned to growth in January as the partial reversal of Omicron effects put upward pressure on consumer activity. Despite this monthly uptick, downside risks remain for the retail sector, notably the emerging cost of living crisis. Other data released this week showed that real earnings are now falling. This trend is expected to continue over the coming months, leading to an erosion of consumer spending power and subsequent changes in the scale and structure of spending. Retail activity is likely to fall as a result.” Jacqui Baker, partner and head of retail at RSM UK, says the cost of living crisis means January’s uplift in sales might not last. ‘Consumer confidence is at its lowest level in 12 months, footfall is down, and mounting price inflation may curb future spending as fear of soaring energy costs, higher mortgage repayments and increased petrol prices eat into household budgets. This all lands ahead of a pinch point as retailers will face increased costs from 1 April with average hourly rates and national insurance both increasing, at a time when the remaining Covid support measures come to an end. ‘The next few months will undoubtably be tough for UK retailers, so it will be interesting to see if the Government will step in and announce new measures to ease the cost of living crisis for consumers and introduce urgent business rates reform in next month’s Spring Budget. This would allow confidence to return; give retailers the chance to recover; and prevent further distress across the sector after a slow start to the year post-Omicron. European stock markets are rather mixed this morning, after Wall Street took a tumble last night. In London, the FTSE 100 is up just 6 points. Utility companies are leading the risers, along with consumer goods maker Reckitt (+1.8%) , discount retailer B&amp;M (+1.4%) and fashion group Burberry (+1.2%) also higher. But NatWest is dragging the market down, now down 3%. Ocado (-2%) and technology-focused investor Scottish Mortgage (-2.3%) are also down, after the US Nasdaq Composite fell 2.9% on worries about Ukraine conflict, and likely US interest rate rises. Across Europe, the German DAX is down 0.1%, the Italian FTSE Mib is flat, while France’s CAC has gained 0.35%. NatWest is giving its bankers bigger bonuses this year after the group, still majority-owned by taxpayers, bounced back to a £4bn profit in 2021 as the economy recovered from the coronavirus pandemic. The lender said it had increased its bonus pool to £298m, a 44% increase on a year earlier. Alison Rose, the chief executive of NatWest, said it was a “restrained bonus pool” and added that the bank was “very mindful of the challenges that our customers are facing with inflation and cost of living”. She told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “We need to make sure we are rewarding fairly.” Rose’s total pay for 2021 was £3.6m, up from £2.6m a year earlier. NatWest also benefitted from a booming mortgage market last year. Net mortgage lending across the business jumped by £10.8bn in 2021, with NatWest reporting “strong gross new mortgage lending and improved retention”. UK house prices jumped 10.8% during 2021, meaning borrowers had to take out larger loans to buy properties. Customer deposits also rose during the year, up by £17.1bn or 10% across its retail banking. NatWest says this was due to UK Government support schemes, and the Covid lockdowns which hit consumer spending and led to increased savings in the first half of last year. NatWest’s shares have dropped 2.8% in early trading, despite its return to profit, the top faller on the FTSE 100. The City may be disappointed that NatWest has lowered its cost reduction target (see earlier post), as it reacted to the surge in prices. Zoe Gillespie, investment manager at Brewin Dolphin, says NatWest appears to be in good health, following its return to profits. “NatWest has beaten expectations again and looks set to continue on its positive trajectory. The net impairment release of nearly £1.3 billion, bumper profits, and strong capital reserves point to a bank in good health. The increased dividend and share buyback programme suggest NatWest’s management team are optimistic about the year ahead, while rising interest rates should only benefit its core business. NatWest is now much more attractive as an investment prospect, notwithstanding the likelihood of the government winding down its substantial stake in the bank.” Freetrade analyst Gemma Boothroyd says NatWest will benefit from the likely increases in interest rates this year: For a bank like NatWest, an interest rate rise is warmly welcomed news. It means the spread increases between the rate it’s borrowing at and what it’s charging for interest on customers’ loans. Although rates have risen, NatWest customers probably aren’t about to see more interest in their current accounts. They’re not going to benefit here, but NatWest is. That’s because the bank’s not worried about luring in more customers eager to make deposits. NatWest doesn’t need to entice them with higher deposit rates - it’s already got enough cash on hand. It’s all about raising the rates it charges on loans. NatWest’s Q4 net interest margin reached 2.38% - 3 basis points higher than the previous quarter. That’s NatWest’s profit engine, and so long as it can keep widening that as rates rise, it’ll keep strutting through 2022. So slowly but surely, NatWest’s getting back up on its feet. Its share price is finally returning to pre-pandemic levels, and investors will be welcoming today’s 7.5p dividend - well over double last August’s payout. Richard Hunter, Head of Markets at interactive investor, says NatWest’s capital reserves look strong (allowing it to raise its dividend and launch the £750m share buyback programme). “Another period of growth in the final quarter has sealed a successful year for NatWest, with the release of provisions for bad debts being a major driver. Operating profit for the year of £4 billion compares to a loss of £481 million the previous year, and much of this significant swing was enabled by a net impairment release for the period of £1.3 billion. The CET1 ratio, or capital cushion, stood at an extraordinary 18.2% at the end of the period, with a liquidity coverage ratio of 172% not only underlining the strength of the bank’s capital position, but also that there is something of an embarrassment of riches to be considered. NatWest has cut its cost-cutting target for the next two years - due to the inflation squeeze hitting the UK. The bank is lowering its cost reduction target to around 3% per annum for 2022 and 2023), reflecting “higher inflation and our ongoing investment in the business”. Government-backed bank NatWest has returned to profit, as it benefitted from the economic recovery last year. NatWest has kicked off the bank reporting season by posting an operating pre-tax profit of £4bn in 2021, recovering from the £481m loss in 2020. Profits were boosted by impairment releases of £1.3bn -- money set aside to cover potential losses due to the pandemic, which NatWest now doesn’t expect to incur. Shareholders will benefit, with NatWest proposing a final dividend for 2021 of 7.5p, more than double last year’s 3p. It has also announced a share buyback of £750m - another way of returning cash to shareholders. This means NatWest will distribute more than £3.8bn of capital to shareholders for 2021, including £1.7bn to the taxpayer (who own a majority stake, dating back to the bailout of Royal Bank of Scotland in 2008). Here’s the details: £1.2bn dividends - £846m final (7.5p/share), £347m interim (3p/share). £1.5bn on market buy-backs - £750m executed + additional £750m announced today. £1.1bn directed buy back in March ‘21. Total of ~£1.7bn back to UK government in dividends and buybacks for ‘21. CEO Alison Rose says: We are acutely aware of the challenges that many people, families and businesses continue to face up and down the country and are working alongside our customers to provide the support they need - whether that is managing their money better, saving for a house or retirement or starting or growing a new business - as well as playing a leading role in the transition to net zero. Darren Morgan, ONS Director of Economic Statistics, says British retailers saw the biggest increase in sales since last spring: There was also a jump in spending on fuel last month, as more people returned to the office after the move to home working. Automotive fuel sales volumes rose by 4.1% in January 2022, following a fall of 5.0% in December. But, sales volumes in January 2022 were still 3.3% below their February 2020 levels Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Retail sales have bounced back as shoppers returned to high streets after the Omicron variant hit the UK economy.... despite the squeeze from inflation. Retail sales volumes across Great Britain rose by 1.9% in January, faster than expected, and the biggest monthly increase since the lockdown was lifted last spring. That recovers about half of the 4.0% drop in December when the surge in Covid-19 cases and pandemic restrictions hit spending, and lifts retail spending to 3.6% above its pre-pandemic levels. The recovery was driven by an increase in spending at non-food stores such as household goods and garden centres. The ONS explains: Household goods stores sales volumes rose by 7.5% in January 2022 because of strong growth in furniture and lighting stores (16.6%) and electrical goods stores (16.0%). Sales volumes were 3.8% above their February 2020 levels. Department stores reported a monthly increase of 7.1% in sales volumes but remained 8.0% below their February 2020 levels. But, clothing stores reported a fall of 5.0% over the month -- possibly because the January sales were less generous (which also pushed up inflation to a 30-year high). On an annual basis, people bought 9.1% more items than a year ago, when non-essential shops were closed in the 2021 lockdown. However, spending at food stores such as supermarkets fell below pre-coronavirus levels for the first time. Retail volumes at food stores were 0.8% below where they were in February 2020, having surged once the first lockdown began. In another sign that the economy was returning to more normal, online shopping’s share of spending fell to 25.3% in January 2022, its lowest proportion since March 2020. The retail sales report also shows the impact of inflation over the last year, with the amount spent at retailers up 16.5% -- although volumes were only 9.1% higher.... Elsewhere, European stock markets are on track to open slightly higher, after US secretary of state Antony Blinken agreed to a meeting with Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, next week. Wall Street and European stocks fell on Thursday as the US said Russia was on the brink of invading Ukraine within several days.

The national ceremony was due to be held in Tokyo on 11 March, exactly nine years after a powerful earthquake and tsunami killed more than 18,000 people and triggered a triple meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The government had considered scaling down the ceremony or asking participants to take precautions against the virus, but is making plans to cancel it, according to public broadcaster NHK. Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, last week recommended the cancellation of large-scale sports and cultural events after the government drew criticism for its handling of the outbreak. Japan recorded its 1,000th Covid-19 infection on Wednesday, in the western prefecture of Yamaguchi. The total includes 706 passengers and crew from the quarantined Diamond Princess cruise liner. Twelve people have died from the virus in Japan, including six linked to the ship. This week the organisers of two of Tokyo’s biggest cherry blossom festivals said they were scaling back the events to discourage large numbers of people from viewing the flowers when they come into bloom in the capital later this month. While people will still be able to view the famous blossoms along the Meguro river during the day, organisers said the area would not be lit at night. Visitors will also be able to arrange private hanami gatherings in Ueno park, but there will be no mobile food trucks or rubbish bins provided. Many of the most popular attractions in Tokyo have announced closures until at least the middle of the month. The long list of leisure and cultural attractions to have temporarily closed their doors include Tokyo Disneyland and DisneySea, the Ghibli Museum, Tokyo Skytree and the Kabukiza theatre. A travelling exhibition of 60 paintings – including Vincent van Gogh’s Sunflowers –from the National Gallery in London has been postponed until at least 17 March after its Japanese host, the National Museum of Western Art, said it would close. The exhibition is due to move to Osaka in early July. The Robot Restaurant in Tokyo’s Shinjuku district – a popular destination for overseas tourists – will not reopen until 9 March, while the Toyosu fish market, known for its dawn tuna auctions, will be off-limits to visitors until the middle of the month. The outbreak has also hit the capital’s culinary scene, with the conveyer-belt sushi chain Hamazushi saying that diners will now have to order dishes via a touch-screen panel rather than selecting plates as they pass in front of them, NHK said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2020/jul/30/climate-denier-shill-global-debate","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2020-07-30T11:10:34Z","webTitle":"The four types of climate denier, and why you should ignore them all | Damian Carrington","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/30/climate-denier-shill-global-debate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/30/climate-denier-shill-global-debate","fields":{"headline":"The four types of climate denier, and why you should ignore them all","bodyText":"A new book, described as “deeply and fatally flawed” by an expert reviewer, recently reached the top of Amazon’s bestseller list for environmental science and made it into a weekly top 10 list for all nonfiction titles. How did this happen? Because, as Brendan Behan put it, “there’s no such thing as bad publicity”. In an article promoting his book, Michael Shellenberger – with jaw-dropping hubris – apologises on behalf of all environmentalists for the “climate scare we created over the last 30 years”. Shellenberger was named a hero of the environment by Time magazine in 2008 and is a loud advocate of nuclear power, but the article was described by six leading scientists as “cherry-picking”, “misleading” and containing “outright falsehoods”. The article was widely republished, even after being removed from its first home, Forbes, for violating the title’s editorial guidelines on self-promotion, adding further heat to the storm. And this is why all those who deny the reality or danger of the climate emergency should be ignored. Obviously, I have broken my own rule here, but only to make this vital point once and for all. The science is clear, the severity understood at the highest levels everywhere, and serious debates about what to do are turning into action. The deniers have nothing to contribute to this. However infuriating they are, arguing with them or debunking their theories is likely only to generate publicity or money for them. It also helps to generate a fake air of controversy over climate action that provides cover for the vested interests seeking to delay the end of the fossil fuel age. But the deniers are not all the same. They tend to fit into one of four different categories: the shill, the grifter, the egomaniac and the ideological fool. The shill is the easiest to understand. He, and it almost always is he, is paid by vested interests to emit clouds of confusion about the science or economics of climate action. This uncertainty creates a smokescreen behind which polluters can lobby against measures that cut their profits. A sadder case is that of the grifters. They have found themselves earning a living by grinding out contrarian articles for rightwing media outlets. Do they actually believe the guff they write? It doesn’t matter: they just warm their hands on the outrage, count the clicks and wait for the pay cheque. The egomaniacs are also tragic figures. They are disappointed, frustrated people whose careers have stalled and who can’t understand why the world refuses to give full reverence to their brilliance. They are desperate for recognition, and, when it stubbornly refuses to arrive, they are drawn to make increasingly extreme pronouncements, in the hope of finally being proved a dogma-busting, 21st-century Galileo. The ideological fool is the fourth type of climate denier, and they can be intelligent. But they are utterly blinded by their inane, no-limits version of the free-market creed. The climate emergency requires coordinated global action, they observe, and that looks horribly like communism in disguise. They could explore the many credible climate action plans being pursued, including by those on the political right. But their cognitive dissonance forces them to the conclusion that because state intervention is wrong, acting to avert climate danger cannot be right. Intellectual gymnastics to “expose” climate alarmism then follow naturally. But why do I say ignore them all? The climate crisis is urgent, and we need debate to drive action. However, vigorous debates over action are already taking place in good faith all over the world, from the tops of governments to the smallest local action groups. Every nation in the world signed up to the 2015 Paris climate deal, pledging to keep global heating below 2C and ideally to 1.5C. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change involves thousands of international scientists and is arguably the greatest scientific endeavour in history. It has spent three decades spelling out in painstaking detail how humanity is causing global heating, how catastrophic that threatens to be – and how drastic action is required to avert the worst. The world of finance and business is catching up fast with the science, and almost all the technology needed already exists. In short, no sane or serious actor can countenance denial of climate danger. Bad-faith arguments motivated by greed, egomania or ideology have nothing to add. Which brings me to the US president, Donald Trump. Political leaders are the exception to the rule. Their climate idiocy should be challenged, as they hold actual power. But even in this case, reality is fast debunking their proclamations. In the US, coal is dying, because green energy is cheaper and cleaner, however great Trump claims he will make the miners. Even if Trump, and Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, persist, other nations will begin to ostracise them via trade sanctions and border taxes. As for the shill, grifter, egomaniac and ideological fool, the reality of increasing climate impacts and successful action is fast exposing them as well. Those willing to employ the shills and the grifters are dwindling. The book I started with has now been knocked off the environmental bestsellers list, fittingly enough by one published by the environmental hero Rachel Carson, in 1951. I can’t profess to know what Shellenberger’s motivation was, but one thing is clear: the egomaniacs and ideological fools will get the place in history they so lust for. It will be a small footnote marking the useful idiots of the climate war. • Damian Carrington is the Guardian’s Environment editor"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"music/2019/dec/13/joker-and-chernobyl-composer-hildur-gunadottir-im-treasure-hunting","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2019-12-13T08:00:38Z","webTitle":"Joker and Chernobyl composer Hildur Guðnadóttir: 'I'm treasure hunting'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/dec/13/joker-and-chernobyl-composer-hildur-gunadottir-im-treasure-hunting","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2019/dec/13/joker-and-chernobyl-composer-hildur-gunadottir-im-treasure-hunting","fields":{"headline":"Joker and Chernobyl composer Hildur Guðnadóttir: 'I'm treasure hunting'","bodyText":"You can see why Todd Phillips, the director of Joker, was drawn to Hildur Guðnadóttir’s music. Elegiac and ghostly, with a dark, yearning heart, the score by the 37-year-old Icelandic composer suits Phillips’s character study of a troubled, broken man perfectly. By contrast, Guðnadóttir is chirpy and prone to giggling. We speak via Skype: she is at home in Berlin, sat next to an acoustic guitar. In her young son’s bedroom – “next to his Lego and comics” – is Guðnadóttir’s Emmy, which she won in September for HBO’s series Chernobyl. Her remarkable score was constructed almost entirely from her samples of a nuclear power plant. It has since been nominated for a Grammy; the Joker score has been nominated for a Golden Globe and is being talked about as a favourite for this year’s Oscar. She worked on the scores simultaneously, but the two couldn’t be more different. The Joker screenplay hit her hard. “I’ve never been as struck as I was with this,” she says. “I just really felt strongly for Arthur.” Phillips had asked her to start composing purely from the script, months before the cameras started rolling. She sat with her cello for a while, finally landing on a note that felt right for Arthur. “It was almost like it punched me in the chest,” she says. “And then this physical reaction, this movement happened, because I had found his voice, found what he wanted to say.” She recorded some music and sent it to Phillips, who listened to it while rewriting his screenplay. When shooting began, he played her pieces on the set. When filming a scene in which Arthur retreats to a bathroom after his first murder spree, Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix decided to scrap the beats they had planned and, stuck for inspiration, Phillips played the piece of music Guðnadóttir had written. Phoenix reacted to it, improvising some interpretive dance. He had been struggling to find a way to have Arthur began to transform into the Joker; this was it. When Phillips sent footage to Guðnadóttir, she was amazed. “It was magical,” she says. “It was completely unreal to see the physical embodiment of that music. His hand gestures were the same types of movements that I felt when I wrote the music. It was one of the strongest collaborative moments I’ve ever experienced.” If Guðnadóttir’s Joker score speaks to Arthur’s mental state, her Chernobyl score conveys radiation. Just before the series was filmed in August 2018, at the Ignalina nuclear power plant in Lithuania, she went to Chernobyl with her score producer. Slipping into hazmat suits, they recorded for hours to pick up the ambient noise. She wanted the power plant – and the radiation – “to be a voice in itself. I wanted to understand the feeling of what must have gone through people’s heads as they were trying to navigate through that disaster.” It was incredibly effective: the result is like a sort of creeping death. “I didn’t know what it was going to sound like,” she says. “It was like treasure hunting. You go in there with completely open ears and you just listen.” Guðnadóttir has long eschewed orthodox approaches to music; although she trained at classical music schools, she rejects the “right” way of doing things. Her mother sold her car to pay for five-year-old Guðnadóttir’s first cello; at 15, she began working with Icelandic band Múm, and since then has played with the likes of Throbbing Gristle, Sunn O))) and the Knife. “There are just so many dos and don’ts in classical upbringing,” she says. “But when I started to play with bands, none of those rules applied, and I just felt such a sense of freedom. It really changed the way I saw music.” She has been a fixture on the underground music scene for years, but her scoring work is bringing her to wider audiences. “And that’s great. As a musician, you’re always hoping to bring new experiences, new ways of hearing sound and music to people. Experiencing music should be completely outside any boxes. Because it is such a nonjudgmental, instinctual art form. It goes straight to your heart.” Film and television work certainly helps to pay the rent, and more doors are opening for her, but it doesn’t sound like she will be throwing herself into scoring. Her success means she is able to take some time out, to commit only to work that excites her. “I’m not going to focus solely on films; I’d get really tired of that. I’m getting a lot of offers right now. But it’s important for me to have space, because the work affects me so much. I just follow the curiosity carrot.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/live/2022/mar/25/uk-consumer-confidence-retail-sales-fall-cost-of-living-crisis-deepens-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-25T19:27:48Z","webTitle":"Inflation pressures hit consumer confidence; Moscow stock market falls back – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2022/mar/25/uk-consumer-confidence-retail-sales-fall-cost-of-living-crisis-deepens-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2022/mar/25/uk-consumer-confidence-retail-sales-fall-cost-of-living-crisis-deepens-business-live","fields":{"headline":"Inflation pressures hit consumer confidence; Moscow stock market falls back – as it happened","bodyText":"Time to wrap up - here are today’s main stories: Goodnight. GW Back on the cost of living crisis, UK farmers are warning that milk production is starting to fall as sharp rises in cost of fuel, feed, and fertiliser outstrip increases in farm-gate prices. My colleague Zoe Wood reports: “Something has to give and if the milk price doesn’t give, then the producers will,” says Oxfordshire dairy farmer David Christensen in a stark assessment of the peril his industry is facing as soaring costs push farm finances into the red. Christensen, whose family business manages a herd of about 1,000 cows, says costs were already going up as a result of the upheaval caused by the pandemic and Brexit, but the war in Ukraine has “turbocharged inflation to levels the like of which I’ve never seen in 30 years of farming”. He is a member of Arla, Britain’s largest dairy co-operative, which has sounded the alarm as the financial squeeze forces UK milk production to fall – a trend that could threaten future milk supplies. Ash Amirahmadi, the managing director of Arla Foods UK, said producing fresh milk had for some time been delivering “little to no profitability for farmers” but the situation was now acute as the Ukraine crisis stoked farm cost inflation. Shares in UK engineeering group Rolls-Royce surged in late trading in London, finishing 19% higher as the top FTSE 100 riser. The late rally in Rolls-Royce shares came after the Betaville website, which covers deals news and gossip, reported speculation that the aerospace and defence group could soon be involved in a significant corporate transaction - such as a merger or even a takeover offer. As Seeking Alpha explains: Rolls-Royce spikes after a Betaville “uncooked alert” says the company may be involved in a “significant corporate transaction” that could include a merger or takeover deal. According to the Betaville blog post, an unidentified suitor may be in the early stages of considering a combination with Rolls-Royce. The post is billed as an ‘uncooked alert’, which is defined as “Market gossip as Betaville receives it”. It seems to have been the catalyst for the share price jump into the close of trading. A Rolls-Royce spokesperson tells us: “we do not comment on rumour and speculation”. The FTSE 100 ended 16 points higher, up 0.2% at 7483 points. European stock markets have ended a choppy week with some modest gains. The pan-European Stoxx 600 closed 0.1% higher, but was 0.2% lower for the week. Germany’s DAX gained 0.2%, and Italy’s FISE MIB rose 0.6%, with the US-EU deal to cut dependency on Russian gas providing some relief. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA, says the markets are “broadly in consolidation” at present. We appear to have hit a point in which the initial shock of the Ukraine invasion has passed and markets have corrected back to a point where the economic risks are deemed to be priced in. In the absence of any significant developments, equity markets have come to a relative standstill and could remain that way until we see some progress. Volatility remains in the commodity space which is contributing to the day-to-day fluctuations in equity markets. Higher commodity prices mean a further squeeze on the global economy this year and more inflation at a time when central banks are already accelerating tightening plans after falling behind the curve. Oil has reversed its earlier losses after an attack on one of Saudi Arabia’s state-run oil company Aramco’s storage facilities. AP explains: A raging fire erupted Friday at an oil depot in Jiddah ahead of a Formula One race in the Saudi city. Yemen’s Houthi rebels claimed it was an attack by the group among a barrage of others. While Saudi Arabia and its state-run oil behemoth Saudi Aramco did not immediately acknowledge the blaze, it was centered on the same fuel depot that the Houthis had attacked in recent days. Brent crude is now up 1% at $120 per barrel, having dipped towards $115 earlier. Jewellery group Tiffany’s has said it will stop buying new diamonds mined in Russia. The move follows pressure on the jewellery industry to cut ties with Russia following the Ukraine war. But, as Bloomberg’s Jeannette Neumann, explains here, there are some caveats. The Russian stock market fell back today, wiping out much of Thursday’s rally when the exchange reopened for the first time in almost a month. The Moex share index slid by 3.66% today, with every sector in the red, having gained 4.4% yesterday. Limited stock trading resumed yesterday with several restrictions to prop up shares, including a ban on short-selling, and on foreign investors selling stocks. That helped to spark a rally yesterday, when oil and commodity stocks jumped. Analysts have pointed out that these curbs meant Moscow’s market wasn’t operating properly, while the US dubbed it a “Potemkin market opening”. But despite these measures, airline Aeroflot shed another 18% today, on top of Thursday’s 16% drop. Sanctions have barred its jets from EU and UK airspace. Gas giant Gazprom fell 12%, after the US and EC agreed a deal to cut Europe’s dependency on Russian gas. Steel giant Severstal fell 9%, with reports that sanctions were holding up a loan payment to ite creditors, putting it on the verge of default. Before Thursday, stocks had not traded on Moscow’s exchange since February 25, the day after Putin sent thousands of troops into Ukraine. The move prompted Western sanctions aimed at isolating Russia economically, which are driving the country into a deep recession. The rouble-denominated Moex is now down 34% so far this year, having plunged when the invasion began in February before trading was suspended. In dollar terms, it’s almost halved. Dmitry Polevoy, an analyst at Locko-Invest in Moscow, told Bloomberg: “Yesterday, the main theme was hot money searching for tactical buying. Today, we see some selling plus more activity from people who stayed aside yesterday seem to be driving the move.” “Price-discovery will take time as it is hard to correctly assess new fair prices. The sanctions story is still open-ended.” With the slump in the rouble driving up prices, some investors may be looking to stocks as a hedge against inflation. US consumer confidence has fallen to its lowest level in 11 years, as worries about inflation and the Ukraine war mount. The University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment report found that confidence declined in March due to falling real incomes, which recently accelerated as fuel prices rose sharply. The index fell to 59.4 this month, down from 62.8 in February and 84.9 last March. That’s slightly worse than the preliminary estimate of 59.7 earlier this month. The year-ahead expected inflation rate rose to its highest level since 1981 and expected gasoline prices posted their largest monthly upward surge in decades. Personal finances were expected to worsen in the year ahead by the largest proportion since the surveys started in the mid-1940s. University of Michigan economist Richard Curtin, director of the surveys, says: Just when difficult decisions need to be made about monetary and fiscal policies, consumers have expressed loss in confidence in government economic policies. Moreover, most consumers are uncertain about the ultimate impact Putin’s war will have on their personal economic situation. US home sales fell last month, as rising mortgage rates and low availability of properties hit the sector. Pending home sales (signed contracts to buy existing homes), fell 4.1% in February, the fourth monthly drop in a row. That suggests the market has cooled ahead of the spring sellin season, with mortgage rates have risen as the markets anticipated a flurry of interest rate rises this year. In New York, stocks have opened a little higher with the benchmark S&amp;P 500 gaining 0.2%, or 9 points, to 4,529. There’s more action in the bond market, where the yield (or interest rate) on 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds have hit a fresh two-year high. That shows investors are anticipating a more aggressive path of interest rate rises from the Federal Reserve, to try to curb inflation. The 10-year yield has hit 2.475%, its highest level since May 2019, as traders sell the bond (yields rise when bond prices fall). German bank Berenberg has predicted that the UK economy will stagnate over the next quarter, or worse, as the shock of the Ukraine invasion hits growth. Berenberg have also cut their forecast for eurozone growth, pointing to the tumble in UK consumer confidence and business expectations. Although initial measures of activity for March, such as the PMI reports, have been stronger than expected, forward-looking confidence indicators point to trouble ahead, Berenberg says: Due to the shock of a major European war and a surge in inflation, consumer confidence and business expectations are flashing red, having plunged to levels only witnessed during the great financial and euro crises, and the early phase of the pandemic. Amid unusually high uncertainty, we now expect UK real GDP to flatline in Q2, instead of growing by 0.1% qoq, and Eurozone GDP to expand by just 0.2% qoq, instead of 0.6%. The risks to our new Q2 calls remain tilted to the downside. Berenberg predict that the shock to confidence will lessen from May, when we may have more clarity about the outcome of the Ukraine war and any further sanctions on Russia. But inflation is expected to stay very elevated until late-2022 as rising food prices initially offset a gradual fall in oil prices – from $120 per barrel, towards $90 by early 2023. And there is also a danger that Europe’s economy could suffer stagnation, or even a modest contraction, that lasts beyond the initial shock in Q2. Berenberg say this scenario is unlikely, but clearly not impossible. As any EU embargo on imports of Russian oil and gas would probably hurt more in winter when energy demand peaks, any rebound in economic activity during Q3 could be short-lived. In a worst-case scenario (15% risk), Europe could face a period of de facto stagflation during 2022, where real GDP stagnates, or even falls modestly, and inflation surges by even more than expected. That could delay any robust rebound until early 2023 when energy demand starts to moderate and Europe manages to secure sufficient energy supplies from non-Russian producers Joe Biden has agreed a landmark energy supply deal with the EU under which the US will increase transatlantic gas deliveries, in the hope of weakening the power the Kremlin wields thanks to its natural resources. Speaking in Brussels after the deal was agreed on Friday, the US president said Vladimir Putin exploited Russia’s status as Europe’s main supplier of gas to “coerce and manipulate his neighbours” and that the proceeds of gas and oil sales “drive his war machine”. He said the partnership with the EU (see earlier post) would strip Putin of that weapon by reducing Europe’s dependence on Russian energy, as well as the continent’s overall gas demand. Under the plan, the US and other nations will increase exports of seaborne liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Europe by 15bn cubic metres this year. Even larger shipment volumes would be delivered in the future, he promised. Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered Gazprom to accept payment in roubles for its natural gas exports to Europe, Reuters reports. The gas behemoth has four days left to work out how to move over billions of dollars in sales, the Kremlin said. After the West imposed sanctions on Russia over the conflict in Ukraine, Putin on Wednesday fired the first major salvo of Moscow’s response to what the Kremlin casts as a declaration of economic war against the world’s biggest nuclear power. Putin said that Russia, which supplies 40% of Europe’s gas, would expect payment for natural gas in roubles, one of the sharpest turns in Russian energy politics since the Soviets built gas pipelines to Europe from Siberia in the early 1970s. It is also a potential headache for Gazprom, the world’s biggest natural gas company by reserves. “There is an instruction to Gazprom from the president of the Russian Federation to accept payments in roubles,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters. Peskov said that Gazprom, a company so powerful in Russia that it is considered to be “a state within a state”, had four days left to work out a system for rouble payment. “This information will be brought to the purchasers of Gazprom products,” Peskov said. Here’s the full story: Gazprom has 4 days to work out rouble payments for gas exports - Kremlin says Yesterday, the leaders of Germany and Italy said that Russia’s demand that “unfriendly” countries use roubles to buy its oil and gas could breach supply contracts. The executive director of the IEA, Fatih Birol, called a “security threat”. The UK car sector had a tough February, with shortages of semiconductors continuing to limit production of cars and engines. UK engine production fell by over 30% year-on-year last month, to 117,551 units, trade body SMMT reports, taking engine output so far this year down almost a quarter. Mike Hawes, SMMT Chief Executive, said, “February’s engine production figures further highlight the challenging start to the year for manufacturers. With new pressures arising from soaring energy costs, as well as the continued impact of the global semiconductor shortage, the UK’s competitiveness is at risk. We need urgent action to alleviate business costs for manufacturers and encourage the investment needed to futureproof the sector and the skilled jobs it creates as the industry transitions to new technologies.” Overall UK car production was down 41% year-on-year, the eighth monthly fall in a row. Output of commercial vehicles jumped 92%, but that was compared to the worst February on record last year, when supply chain shortages, new customs processes and prolonged lockdown measures all hit the sector. Here’s a round-up of reaction to the unexpected 0.3% drop in UK retail sales last month: Karl Thompson, Economist at CEBR: Retail sales volumes unexpectedly fell in February, despite the easing of the Omicron wave and the lifting of all remaining restrictions at the end of the month. Non-store retailing saw the sharpest monthly fall, with a contraction also seen in food store sales volumes. Despite some evidence of consumer activity shifting away from online shopping and toward in-person retail and non-retail environments, price rises in excess of earnings growth are now eroding consumer spending power overall. The squeeze on household budgets is set to worsen over the coming months, exerting further downward pressure on retail sales.” Bethany Beckett of Capital Economics: The small fall in retail sales in February probably had more to do with the shift back towards non-retail spending and the impact of Storm Eunice than it did the cost of living crisis. But, with further rises in inflation and interest rates looking likely, we are downbeat on the outlook for overall spending this year. Karen Johnson, Head of Retail &amp; Wholesale at Barclays Corporate Banking: “February saw Covid restrictions lifted and the mass return of workers to their offices. This led to notable increases in spending on clothing (as people kitted out their new wardrobes), and furniture (as customers returned to showrooms with the confidence to both try products and make purchases). It also led to a reduction in the proportion of sales being made online versus last year, and suggests the industry has now come to the other side of its pandemic-driven ‘bounce’ in online spend.” In the markets, European stock are ending the week with gains. In London, the FTSE 100 is up 0.3% at 7491 points, around its levels before the Ukraine invasion began. The blue-chip index is on track for its third weekly rise in a row, as it continued to recover from its plunge early in the war. But housebuilders are down around 3%, after JP Morgan lowered its price targets. Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC are both up around 0.8%. Oil prices have dropped around 2%, after the EU didn’t agree any new sanctions on Russian oil this week. Raffi Boyadjian, lead investment analyst at XM, explains: With inflation rates around the world skyrocketing amid the surge in most key commodity and raw material prices, the EU’s decision not to add to its long list of sanctions against Moscow has offered some respite to the markets. There is a growing fear of recession, not just in the euro area but globally too, the longer these price spikes last and the more amplified they become. NATO is doing everything it can to support Ukraine without getting itself entangled in a direct military confrontation with Russia. But the downside of that is a potentially long drawn-out war and subsequently, a prolonged market fallout. Oil prices pulled back yesterday after hitting two-week highs as no new significant economic measures were announced by the US or the EU. WTI and Brent futures were extending their declines today, sliding by more than 2%. Billionaire Sir Christopher Hohn has urged shareholders to vote against bank directors who lobby against climate action while making net-zero promises, saying this was greenwashing” Our environment reporter Helena Horton explains: The hedge fund manager, who once had Britain’s highest salary at £1m a day, made headlines when he donated £50,000 to climate activist group Extinction Rebellion. Hohn, who was once Rishi Sunak’s boss at hedge fund TCI, is also one of the nation’s biggest philanthropists, and has pumped billions into his own charity, The Children’s Investment Fund Foundation. He said: “Any bank making a net zero promise while actively lobbying against necessary climate regulation – such as mandatory disclosure of borrowers’ emissions and climate action plans – is greenwashing. Shareholders should vote against the directors of banks who are hiding their exposure to climate risk.” Less than half of the 5p per litre cut to fuel duty announced in Wednesday’s spring statement had been passed onto motorists yesterday. The AA reports that petrol prices at the pumps were down just 2.71p per litre on average on Thursday, with diesel only 1.59p cheaper. On Tuesday, petrol and diesel pump prices had jumped to new records yet again, at 167.30p and 179.72p a litre respectively. Yesterday, petrol averaged 164.59p a litre and diesel 178.13p. The fuel duty cut (which is worth 6p/litre once you include VAT) began at 6pm on Wednesday night, just a few hours after Rishi Sunak’s statement [the chancellor then visited a Sainsbury’s petrol forecourt to fuel someone else’s car] Luke Bosdet, the AA’s fuel price spokesman, says it’s ‘very disappointing’ that prices didn’t drop faster. “The Chancellor rode to the rescue of drivers on Wednesday and even before the 6pm start of the fuel duty cut drivers were reporting the price cut at some Asda forecourts. “Although we have to accept that, for many forecourts, the duty cut comes through with the next delivery of fuel, the size of the fall is very disappointing. I expect the Government will be watching very closely to see if pump prices reflect more of the fuel duty cut over the weekend.” “The truth is that, while diesel wholesale costs have been climbing, petrol’s have fallen substantially since the peaks of 7/8 March. That should have brought a further 6p-a-litre cut in pump prices, effectively doubling the saving from the fuel duty cut. “For now, the message to drivers is clear: head to the cheaper forecourts – you can’t miss them.” The Petrol Retailers Association warned on Wednesday that retailers’ current petrol and diesel stocks had been purchased before the duty cut came in. Gordon Balmer, Executive Director of the PRA, explained: Retailers are holding duty-paid stock which will be sold before the fuel duty cuts come in. To give the motorist an immediate discount at the pumps, the Chancellor would have to backdate the fuel duty cut to 1 March,” Business confidence in Germany has tumbled this month, as the Ukraine war hammers the economic outlook for Europe’s largest economy. The Ifo research institute reports that “sentiment in the German economy has collapsed” since the war in Ukraine began. Its Business Climate Index has fallen to 90.8 points in March, down from 98.5 points in February. Ther was a record collapse in expectations of 13.3 points (even worse than the 11.8 drop in March 2020, when the pandemic hit), as companies face the economic implications of the conflict, such as high energy prices and supply chain problems. Here’s the details: In manufacturing, the index fell faster than ever before. Companies’ expectations also saw a record drop, flipping from optimism to pronounced pessimism. Moreover, companies now rated their business outlook as extremely uncertain. Assessments of the current situation were also lower. In the service sector, too, the business climate worsened notably. This was due to a conspicuous drop in expectations. The outlook for the coming months is particularly bleak in the logistics industry. In contrast, service providers left their assessments of the current situation practically unchanged. In trade, the Business Climate Index crashed. The expectations indicator saw a record collapse. Assessments of the current situation, however, were almost unchanged and remain positive. In construction, the business climate deteriorated significantly. This, too, was driven by considerably more pessimistic expectations. Assessments of the current situation also worsened, but a majority of construction companies are still satisfied with their current business. Carsten Brzeski of ING says: The risk is high that the economic implications of the war are much more of a structural game-changer for the European and particularly the German economy than the pandemic has ever been. With high energy and commodity prices for a protracted period, possibly even energy supply interruptions, and an acceleration of deglobalisation, possibly Cold War 2.0, an export-oriented economy highly dependent on energy imports will suffer. The risk of another contraction in the first quarter of the year and hence a technical recession is high, Brzeski adds. IFO, though, suggest Germany could avoid recession this quarter (the economy shrank in Q4 2021). The United States and European Commission have agreed a new partnership to cut Europe’s reliance on Russian energy. Under the plan, the US and partners will “strive” to deliver at least 15 billion cubic metres (bcm) of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Europe this year, the White House says. Even larger shipments would be delivered in the future, with both sides aiming to boost deliveries from the US to 50 bcm per year over time. The pledge is part of a new Task Force agreed by President Joe Biden and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, to reduce Europe’s dependence on Russian fossil fuels and strengthen European energy security. The White House says: It will work to ensure energy security for Ukraine and the EU in preparation for next winter and the following one while supporting the EU’s goal to end its dependence on Russian fossil fuels. The EC is aiming to cut EU dependency on Russian gas by two-thirds this year and end its reliance on Russian supplies of the fuel “well before 2030”, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. At a joint press conference in Brussels, Von der Leyen said: “We aim to reduce this dependency on Russian fossil fuels and get rid of it. This can only be achieved through... additional gas supplies, including LNG deliveries. “We as Europeans want to diversify away from Russia towards suppliers that we trust, that are our friends, that are reliable. In an attempt to keep climate goals on track, the new Task Force will try to reduce the greenhouse gas intensity of all new LNG infrastructure. That will include using clean energy to power onsite operations, reducing methane leakage, and building “clean and renewable hydrogen-ready infrastructure”. The EC will also try to ensure demand for approximately 50 bcm/year of additional U.S. LNG until 2030. The Commission says this will happen: ...on the understanding that the price formula of LNG supplies to the EU should reflect long-term market fundamentals, and stability of the cooperation of the demand and supply side, and that this growth be consistent with our shared net zero goals. In particular, price formula should include consideration of Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Price and other stabilising factors. At the same time, the partnership will also attempt to cut demand for fossil fuels and greenhouse gas emissions. The White House says: Immediate reductions in gas demand can be achieved through energy efficiency solutions such as ramping up demand response devices, including smart thermostats, and deployment of heat pumps. The US and EC will also work to speed up planning and approval for renewable energy projects and strategic energy cooperation on technologies such as offshore wind. The EC says the Task Force will also: Developing a strategy to accelerate workforce development to support the rapidly deployment of clean energy technologies, including an expansion of solar and wind. Collaborating to advance the production and use of clean and renewable hydrogen to displace unabated fossil fuels and cut greenhouse gas emissions, including by investing in technology development and supporting infrastructure. London-listed Russian gold miner Petropavlovsk has warned that it cannot sell gold to its main lender, Gazprombank, after the bank was sanctioned in the UK on Thursday. Petropavlovsk is also blocked from making an interest payment to Gazprombank today due to sanctions, putting the company in turmoil. Petropavlovsk told shareholders that it has a $200m loan with Gazprombank (GPB) -- under which it agrees to sells all its gold production to GPB. Howwever, sanctions now prohibit it from selling any more gold to GPB at present. Petropavlovsk adds that: ...restrictions on purchasing and selling gold in Russia may make it challenging to find an alternative purchaser for the Group’s gold output. The company operates three gold mines in the far east of Russia, at Pioneer, Malomir and Albyn. Petropavlovsk is due to make an interest payment of $560,000 today to GPB, but warns “the Company is currently prohibited from making such payment under the Regulations.” The company is now “urgently considering” the implications for its activities and financing arrangements with its advisers. Shares in Petropavlovsk have tumbled 21% this morning to 1.4p, and have slumped 90% since the Ukraine invasion began. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, has called for the chief executive of P&amp;O Ferries to resign over the sacking of 800 workers and pledged to force the ferry company to reverse the move and pay its crew the minimum wage. Peter Hebblethwaite admitted to MPs on Thursday that his company broke the law by sacking the 800 workers without consultation. Shapps said Hebblethwaite performance in front of the transport and business committee was “brazen, breathtaking, and showed incredible arrogance”. Speaking to Sky News, Shapps said: “I cannot believe that he can stay in that role having admitted to deliberately going out and using a loophole – well break the law – but also use a loophole. “They flagged their ships through Cyprus avoided having to tell anybody about this, or they felt they did. And even though they know they’ve broken the law, what they’ve done is to pay people off in such a way to try and buy their silence. It’s unacceptable.” February’s drop in retail sales is a sign of things to come for retailers, warns Martin Beck, chief economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club: “2022 has got off to a mixed start for retailers, and things will soon get tougher. Though covid cases have been on the rise again of late, this doesn’t appear to be discouraging consumers from engaging in social consumption activities. A normalisation of spending patterns back towards activities such as eating out and going to the cinema is likely to mean less spending in the retail sector. “This headwind will be compounded by the intensifying cost of living squeeze. The EY ITEM Club now expects inflation to average well over 6% this year and, with this week’s Spring Statement offering limited support, there is still likely to be the biggest squeeze on household finances for more than a decade. Some households may be able to dip into savings accumulated during the pandemic, but many won’t have that luxury. So, retail demand is likely to come under increasing pressure as we move through 2022.” “After a buoyant January, retail sales fell back a little last month,” said Heather Bovill, ONS deputy director for surveys and economic indicators. “There was a notable decline for companies that predominantly trade online, following a strong performance over the festive and new year period.” If you strip out fuel sales, retail sales volumes fell by 0.7% last month. With petrol prices at record levels, the increased demand for petrol and diesel would have left less for other spending. The retail sales report also shows the impact of inflation. Although retail sales volumes were down 0.3% month-on-month in February, the amount spent rose by 0.7%. Customers spent more, to get less. Petrol sales rose in February, as the lifting of Plan B restrictions in England at the end of January 2022 increased travel. Automotive fuel sales volumes rose by 3.6% during the month, and were above their pre-coronavirus February 2020 levels for the first time, the ONS says. Just in: British retail sales fell unexpectedly in February. Online shopping dropped back towards pre-pandemic levels, winter storms kept people away from the high street, and spending at food and drink retailers dropped as customers returned to pubs and restaurants. The Office for National Statistics reports that sales volumes were down by 0.3% month-on-month, below the 0.6% rise expected by economists. Internet sales fell sharply -- non-store retailing sales volumes were down 4.8% over the month. Sales volumes at food stores fell by 0.2% in February 2022, with large falls in alcohol and tobacco stores. This “may be linked to higher spending in pubs and restaurants as confidence increased in going out”, the ONS says. Non-food stores sales volumes rose by 0.6% in February, though, with growth at clothing (13.2%) and department stores (1.3%). That may be due to “wider socialising and the return to the office following the lifting of Plan B restrictions at the end of January” But sales volumes at household goods stores dropped 2.5%, and “other non-food stores” dropped by 7%, with “some retailers suggesting the stormy weather during the month had impacted footfall”, the ONS says. The UK was buffetted by three storms in February - Dudley, Eunice and Franklin. February’s fall follows a 1.9% rise in retail sales volumes in January. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. UK consumer confidence has plummeted for a fourth month in a row as the Ukraine war, the surging cost of living, and the pandemic leave people facing a ‘wall of worry’. GfK’s consumer sentiment index dropped by five points to minus 31 in March, levels last seen in October and November 2020. With inflation at a 30-year high, and heading to 8% next month, people are much gloomier about their personal finances, and the general economic situation as the war in Ukraine continues. Joe Staton, client strategy director at GfK, warns there is an “unmistakable sense of crisis in our numbers”. Consumers across the UK are experiencing the impact of soaring living costs with 30-year-high levels of inflation, record-high fuel and food prices, a recent interest-rate hike and the prospect of more increases to come, and higher taxation too – all against a background of stagnant pay rises that cannot compensate for the financial duress. This is the fourth month in a row that UK consumer confidence has dropped. “With a headline score of -31, we are at a level last seen in October and November 2020 when Covid numbers were rising. Confidence in our personal financial situation and in the wider economy are severely depressed while the daily news of unimaginable suffering from a horrifying war in Europe and rising COVID numbers at home is adding to the bleak mood. The outlook for consumer confidence is not good; it’s certain there’s more bad news to come.” The forecast for personal finances over the next 12 months fell four points to -18 -- 28 points lower than this time last year. Expectations for the general economic situation over the next year dropped by six points to -49; 32 points lower than March 2021. Wednesday’s spring statement brought little help for those facing the toughest squeeze, with economists at the Resolution Foundation warning 1.3 million people will fall into absolute poverty next year.

He told The Times: “I do not expect to be in government again. But it was the privilege of my life to spend 11 years in the cabinet under three prime ministers. I know what the job requires. And Rishi has it.” Gove, who was sacked as the levelling up secretary by Boris Johnson, added: “And here I am deeply concerned that the framing of the leadership debate by many has been a holiday from reality. “The answer to the cost-of-living crisis cannot be simply to reject further ‘handouts’ and cut tax.” Labour has urged Boris Johnson to recall parliament next week so the government can offer more help to struggling households before the announcement of the new energy price cap. The opposition has written to the prime minister and both Tory leadership candidates warning that it is a “crucial deadline” for government action to tackle soaring energy bills, after inflation topped 10% for the first time in 40 years. At the latest hustings in Manchester, Liz Truss sidestepped a question about a 2009 report which she co-authored emerging today which called for doctors pay to be cut by 10%. She said doctors and nurses “feel like they are being told what to do from Whitehall rather than understanding the situation in their local area and being able to respond to their patients’ needs”. The foreign secretary also called for more transparency about the police’s record on fighting crime and having league tables for forces. At the hustings, Rishi Sunak was asked how he will deal with trade unions and said: “We need to crack on and pass a piece of legislation,” he says, referring to the minimum service bill which means they will not be able to hold the country “to ransom”. On crime, Sunak said he wants a new unit in the National Crime Agency to deal with grooming gangs and says we need to record the ethnicity of perpetrators. A former executive at the oil company BP has called for increases to the energy price cap to be scrapped and for suppliers that fail to help households struggling with bills to be nationalised. Nick Butler, who worked for BP for almost 30 years and was group vice-president for strategy and development, said that expected rises in the cap should be abandoned by the industry regulator, Ofgem, which he said had been “overwhelmed by events” after turmoil in the global energy markets sent 29 British energy retailers to the wall. Conservative leadership frontrunner Liz Truss has been accused of showing “her true colours” in an 2009 paper promoting government spending cuts including slashing doctors’ pay. Truss called for patients to be charged to see their GP and for doctors’ pay to be slashed by 10% in a controversial report she co-authored when she was deputy director of the Reform thinktank, TalkTV discovered. Railway changes will be imposed if workers do not agree to new deals, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, has said. The Conservative party has repeatedly targeted unions with criticism, in a move that the Trades Union Congress has argued is deliberately “picking a fight” for electoral purposes. The frontrunner to be the UK’s next prime minister has made her views on unions clear: she has approvingly tweeted a report that she intends to make striking more difficult. “New laws will make it harder to call strikes and also guarantee minimum levels of service are maintained on public transport”, according to a report by the Daily Express, a newspaper which is strongly pro-government and is supporting Truss in the Conservative leadership race. The under-fire rail operator Avanti West Coast has been “rewarded for failure”, Labour said, after the company was paid more than £17m in taxpayers’ money by ministers for performance and management fees in just two years, despite being the worst-performing operator on the rail network. The figures from 2019-20 and 2020-21 include almost £4m in bonuses to Avanti for “operational performance”, “customer experience” and “acting as a good and efficient operator”. The UK’s transport department has announced £130m of funding for England’s bus network to make up for shortfalls in revenues caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The cash would help to cover six months of operations by the private companies who run England’s buses from October 2022 to March 2023, the government said. A green thinktank has criticised Rishi Sunak’s promise to protect farmland from solar farms, saying biofuels use 77 times the amount of arable land. Dustin Benton, policy director at Green Alliance, said: “Solar energy isn’t standing in the way of food production in the UK. Instead, solar panels generate cheap, clean energy that doesn’t depend on Russia, and provide income to farmers too.” Rishi Sunak’s campaign has hit out at frontrunner Liz Truss after she declined to attend a hustings organised by the National Farmers’ Union. Farmers now expect Truss to take part in a hustings with the NFU in September, after she was initially accused of snubbing the organisation by deciding not to attend the event on Friday. Constituents of the Covid rule-breaking MP Margaret Ferrier are said to be “aghast” that she remains in post, as calls for her to resign gathered pace after she pleaded guilty on Thursday to “culpably and recklessly” exposing the public to the virus. The former Scottish National party politician, who now sits as an independent MP for Rutherglen and Hamilton West, faced immediate calls to stand down. And that brings the hustings to an end. The remaining hustings are Birmingham on August 23, Norwich on August 25 and London on August 31. Truss was criticised by an audience member for “sounding like Labour” in wanting to “borrow £50 billion”. The foreign secretary did not address the criticism but said her fundamental view is that high taxes fail to bring money in to the Exchequer. Asked by an audience member whether she would build more houses to solve the housing crisis, Truss instead cites her plans to help people secure mortgages and criticised the planning system. Truss declares she does “support fracking in areas where there is local support”, adding that the local communities should stand to benefit. The foreign secretary also backs nuclear power and with drilling in the North Sea. Asked whether local objections from “Nimbys” should be overruled, Truss says local communities need to be shown the benefits and this involves “encouraging” rather than overruling. Sunak earlier spoke about wanting his football team Southampton to beat Manchester United this weekend, despite them in fact being scheduled to face Leicester City. He was asked at the Manchester hustings how as a Southampton FC fan how he would get back to winning ways. “I’m going to be unpopular for saying it here, starting by beating United this weekend,” he said. Southampton are not due to play Manchester United until August 27. Truss suggested that retired doctors could be asked to help clear the Covid backlog after many returned to work to help at the start of the pandemic. Truss said doctors and nurses “feel like they are being told what to do from Whitehall rather than understanding the situation in their local area and being able to respond to their patients’ needs”. Earlier today, a 2009 report Ms Truss co-authored came to light, which called for doctors pay to be cut by 10%. Truss also suggested senior police staff could be removed from their posts if their force performs poorly in her league table. It is now Truss’s turn for some questions. The foreign secretary calls for more transparency about the police’s record on fighting crime and having league tables for forces. “It does help the police be held to account,” she added. Sunak is asked about levelling up, weeks after video footage showed him telling Tory members of his work diverting public funds from ‘deprived urban areas’. He responds: “If we define levelling up as something that is only for the north we will pay a political price for it because it’s wrong. “I am proud of my record delivering for the north and I will continue delivering for the north.” On how he will help low and middle earning families, Sunak replies: “The best way to help those people is to make sure it’s only tough for one winter”. He added it will not help families to do things that might make us feel better for “five minutes” and if inflation persists “we are all stuffed”. On how he will deal with trade unions, Sunak says “We need to crack on and pass a piece of legislation,” he says, referring to the minimum service bill which means they will not be able to hold the country “to ransom”. He added that the government must not put “fuel on the fire” of inflation and repeat mistakes that were made in the 1970s. The Guardian’s Peter Walker gives his reaction to the questions posed by host Alastair Stewart. The former chancellor believes countries that the UK agrees trade deals with must agree to take back their “failed asylum-seekers”. Sunak is proposing a £10 fine for missed appointments and replicating the private health sector’s elective surgeries which he said allowed doctors to perform more operations. Sunak said there were 50 million missed appointments in the NHS in 2021 which “deprives people of the care they need” and he calls for the need to be “bold and radical” to reform the NHS and learn from private healthcare. Sunak adds he wants a new unit in the National Crime Agency to deal with grooming gangs. It is now the part where the candidates get the proverbial grilling. Sunak is asked about how he would keep Britain’s streets safe. He claims “we do not talk enough” about grooming gangs and says we need to record the ethnicity of perpetrators. Sunak added we should not let political correctness stand in the way and that we need to toughen up sentencing as people should be given a second or third chance “but not a nineteenth chance”. Truss says before she became an MP in 2010 she was a local councillor and sat on the planning committee. Repeating one of her favourite one-liners, she adds: “Those are hours of my life I will never get back.” Truss reiterates her plan to make the most of the post-Brexit opportunities and get all the EU laws off the statute books by the end of 2023. Truss pledges to build Northern Powerhouse Rail and wants to make the M62 the “super highway to success”. Liz Truss enters the arena after a fairly bland campaign video in comparison. Sunak insists he will not pursue policies that risk making inflation far worse, inadvertently criticising the economic plan of his rival Liz Truss for wanting to pass £50bn of debt to future generations, adding: “That is not right.” Sunak opens with that regularly repeated rhetoric in the hustings about Britain doing something “extraordinary” for his family by allowing them to make a life. He also vows to take on “lefty, woke culture” that seeks to cancel this country’s values and women. Sunak said: “I will never let political correctness stand in the way of keeping us safe.” Protesters gathered outside the Manchester Central Convention Complex chanting “Tories Out” with placards reading “no to Rwanda” referencing the government’s immigration policy. Rishi Sunak is first on stage after his campaign video where the narrator, who sounded similar to actor Ray Winstone, talking about “everyone loves an underdog”. Alastair Stewart, who hosted the first ever televised leaders’ debate between David Cameron, Nick Clegg, and Gordon Brown in 2010, will be hosting tonight’s hustings. The latest hustings is taking place in Manchester from 7pm. You can follow all the action here. Here’s a round up of the key developments of the day so far: Labour has urged Boris Johnson to recall parliament next week so the government can offer more help to struggling households before the announcement of the new energy price cap. The opposition has written to the prime minister and both Tory leadership candidates warning that it is a “crucial deadline” for government action to tackle soaring energy bills, after inflation topped 10% for the first time in 40 years.

A green thinktank has criticised Rishi Sunak’s promise to protect farmland from solar farms, saying biofuels use 77 times the amount of arable land. Dustin Benton, policy director at Green Alliance, said: “Solar energy isn’t standing in the way of food production in the UK. Instead, solar panels generate cheap, clean energy that doesn’t depend on Russia, and provide income to farmers too.” Rishi Sunak’s campaign has hit out at frontrunner Liz Truss after she declined to attend a hustings organised by the National Farmers’ Union. Farmers now expect Truss to take part in a hustings with the NFU in September, after she was initially accused of snubbing the organisation by deciding not to attend the event on Friday. Constituents of the Covid rule-breaking MP Margaret Ferrier are said to be “aghast” that she remains in post, as calls for her to resign gathered pace after she pleaded guilty on Thursday to “culpably and recklessly” exposing the public to the virus. The former Scottish National party politician, who now sits as an independent MP for Rutherglen and Hamilton West, faced immediate calls to stand down. Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak face another hustings tonight in Manchester. The event is hosted by GB News presenter Alastair Stewart, who will interview both Tory leadership candidates separately from 7pm before they answer members’ questions. Regional bus services in England that were facing the axe have been given a reprieve after the government announced £130m of funding to keep them going for at least six months. Services in the north-east and South Yorkshire were at risk amid concern that many more routes could be cut back when Covid grants, which propped up routes during the pandemic, expire at the start of October. The Department for Transport said on Friday it would provide further support to ensure that services keep running until March 2023. The further £130m of support takes the total degree of pandemic funding to £2bn as bus companies wrestle with rising costs and continued low patronage of their services. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said: At a time when people are worried about rising costs, it’s more important than ever we save these bus routes for the millions who rely on them for work, school and shopping. Covid grants for bus companies were introduced to help sustain routes that had lost passengers during the pandemic. They were extended in the spring for a further six months with £150m to stave off feared widespread cuts to services, but the government had previously warned that no further funding would be available.

Farmers now expect Truss to take part in a hustings with the NFU in September, after she was initially accused of snubbing the organisation by deciding not to attend the event on Friday. Sunak, her rival for the Tory leadership, did attend the event in Warwickshire, where he promised to lead the “most pro-farming and pro-countryside government this country has seen in decades”. Sunak’s team said Truss’s absence “raises questions about her willingness to listen to the needs of farmers and the wider food industry”. The NFU president, Minette Batters, told the Guardian on Thursday that it was a “shame” Truss did not want to attend the hustings. Farmers have been among the groups angered by some of the post-Brexit trade deals championed by the foreign secretary, which they see as undercutting their livelihoods. Truss was also expected to be quizzed about claims from the environment secretary, George Eustice, who supports Sunak, that she had been resistant to putting animal welfare standards in UK trade deals. On Friday, an NFU spokesperson said Truss would attend a hustings with the farming body on 1 September. If it goes ahead, it will be one of the final husting events of the leadership campaign. The Sunak campaign said the former chancellor had “announced that he will set a new food security target, aggressively champion local produce, ensure the sector has the labour it needs, and take time to negotiate trade deals in the best interests of British farmers”. A spokesperson added: He will support farmers to boost their productivity and profitability and protect our best farmland. Farmers are the lifeblood of our nation. A Rishi Sunak-led government will make sure there is a bright future ahead for British agriculture, and he will always engage positively with the industry. More than 53,510 UK-based students were scrambling for places on university courses on Friday, the day after receiving lower grades in their A-level results, with many missing out on their offers in the most competitive year for university places in a decade. This year’s number of applicants marked as “free to be placed in clearing” on the Ucas website is the highest in more than a decade, and compares with 39,230 in clearing at the same point last year. Some of these students missed their grades while others declined their offers, and some may decide not to go to university. By Friday, 6,640 UK school-leavers had found places through clearing, a 33% increase on last year. A third more students – 23,640 – accepted their insurance choices after missing the grades for their top choice. University admissions directors reported that they had seen unprecedented levels of demand in clearing, with phone lines busier than ever, including from students with top grades. The UK’s transport department has announced £130m of funding for England’s bus network to make up for shortfalls in revenues caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The cash would help to cover six months of operations by the private companies who run England’s buses from October 2022 to March 2023, the government said. Bus companies – like other parts of the UK’s struggling public transport industry – have been fighting to attract customers back to their routes after passenger numbers slumped during the coronavirus lockdowns. The government gave bus providers their first bailout (worth £400m) in April 2020 to protect routes while passenger numbers were down. Since then the value of funding made available to 160 companies had reached £2bn, the government said on Friday. Grant Shapps, the transport secretary who has had a busy day, said: At a time when people are worried about rising costs, it’s more important than ever we save these bus routes for the millions who rely on them for work, school and shopping. The Confederation of Passenger Transport, a lobby group for the bus and coach industry, perhaps unsurprisingly welcomed the money. A spokesperson said: Today’s announcement will help bus operators and local authority partners to balance a network of reliable and affordable services in the short-term as bus networks adapt to new travel patterns. For the longer-term, we will continue to work closely with central government and local authorities to encourage existing and new passengers to get on board the country’s buses, ensuring they are provided the best possible services. Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak face another hustings tonight, this time with Conservative members living in the north of England. The event is hosted by GB News presenter Alastair Stewart, who will interview both Tory leadership candidates separately from 7pm before they answer members’ questions. The frontrunner to be the UK’s next prime minister has made her views on unions clear: she has approvingly tweeted a report that she intends to make striking more difficult. “New laws will make it harder to call strikes and also guarantee minimum levels of service are maintained on public transport”, according to a report by the Daily Express, a newspaper which is strongly pro-government and is supporting Truss in the Conservative leadership race. The rule changes could include raising the threshold for strike action – already fairly stringent in the UK – and limit the number of strikes unions can carry out once they have received the backing of votes. She will push through changes “within a month of becoming prime minister”, the Express reported. The European Federation of Public Service Unions (EPSU) describes UK strike laws as “complex and multilayered with detailed regulations introduced by Conservative governments over years”. This already includes a requirement for 40% of the total workforce (including those who do not vote) to vote in favour of action. Follow our business liveblog here for more on the strikes: Constituents of the Covid rule-breaking MP Margaret Ferrier are said to be “aghast” that she remains in post, as calls for her to resign gathered pace after she pleaded guilty on Thursday to “culpably and recklessly” exposing the public to the virus. The former Scottish National party politician, who now sits as an independent MP for Rutherglen and Hamilton West, faced immediate calls to stand down, including from the leader of her former party, Nicola Sturgeon, in October 2020 when it emerged she had visited a number of venues in her constituency and spoken in the Commons while awaiting the result of a Covid test. After Ferrier, 61, admitted she had failed to self-isolate and had “exposed people to risk of infection, illness and death” at a hearing prior to a planned trial at Glasgow sheriff court, those calls for her to resign have once more gained momentum. Martin Lennon, a Scottish Labour councillor for Rutherglen Central and North said: Most people here are aghast that this has gone on so long. The fact that she pleaded guilty is the cherry on top. If she plans to squat in the seat until the next election, she needs to do the decent thing. She had a really good reputation locally, but now has tarnished all that.” Read more here: Following the news that Vladimir Putin will be heading to the G20 meeting in Indonesia in November, Rishi Sunak has said he would lobby the summit to ban the Russian president while Liz Truss said previously she would use it as an opportunity to “call out” Putin. A spokesperson for Sunak said: Our G20 partners and allies have a collective responsibility to call Putin’s abhorrent behaviour out. Sitting round a table with him isn’t good enough when he is responsible for children being killed in their beds as they sleep. We need to send a strong message to Putin that he doesn’t have a seat at the table unless and until he stops his illegal war in Ukraine. Last month, Truss – who is currently the foreign secretary – said it would be important to confront Putin in front of allies like India and Indonesia. She said: I would go there, and I would call Putin out. Indonesia is head of the G20 this year and has faced pressure from the west to uninvite Putin over his invasion of Ukraine. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy has been invited to attend the summit in Bali.

Here’s the report from PA Media: Figures obtained by the party from the Environment Agency through freedom of information requests indicate that, since 2016, raw sewage has been pumped into the natural environment for a total of 9,427,355 hours. Labour warned that the figures, which equate to 392,806 days’ worth of raw sewage discharge, probably do not cover the full scale of pollution. The shadow environment secretary, Jim McMahon, attacked water companies and the government over the findings. He said: Families across Britain are trying to enjoy the summertime. Whilst water companies are paying billions in dividends, the Tories have allowed them to cut corners and pump filthy raw sewage on to our playing fields and into our waters. Labour will put a stop to this disgraceful practice by ensuring there can be enforcement of unlimited fines, holding water company bosses legally and financially accountable for their negligence, and by toughening up regulations that currently allow the system to be abused. The party said areas affected by raw sewage discharge include popular tourist and bathing spots, such as rivers and beaches. Labour also said the data shows there has been a 2,553% increase in the number of monitored discharge hours between 2016 and 2021, with the party arguing that the situation is “drastically worsening” under the Conservatives. In 2016, the Environment Agency recorded 100,533 hours’ worth of spills. By 2021, that figure had rocketed to 2,667,452. Earlier this month, a story in the Telegraph suggested that official plans to reduce the level of raw sewage discharged into waterways had been temporarily shelved. However, the government now appears to be sticking to the September deadline. A spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs pointed to a statement released on its website on Thursday, which said the government is “taking action” on sewage discharges, with the current administration being the first to set an expectation on water companies to significantly reduce discharges from storm overflows. The water minister, Steve Double, said: We are the first government to take action to tackle sewage overflows. We have been clear that water companies’ reliance on overflows is unacceptable and they must significantly reduce how much sewage they discharge as a priority. This is on top of ambitious action we have already taken, including consulting on targets to improve water quality which will act as a powerful tool to deliver cleaner water, pushing all water companies to go further and faster to fix overflows. Work on tackling sewage overflows continues at pace and we will publish our plan in line with the 1 September statutory deadline. A green thinktank has criticised Rishi Sunak’s promise to protect farmland from solar farms, saying biofuels use 77 times the amount of arable land. Dustin Benton, policy director at Green Alliance, said: Solar energy isn’t standing in the way of food production in the UK. Instead, solar panels generate cheap, clean energy that doesn’t depend on Russia, and provide income to farmers too. A much better way of feeding people would be to stop using food crops to fuel cars. Biofuels for cars are a zombie policy. It’s now cheaper to decarbonise transport by getting more electric vehicles on the roads and freeing up land we’ve used for biofuels for food production instead. Green Alliance said biofuel production covered 108,000 hectares of arable land, enough to grow food for 3.5 million people, while solar farms covered only 1,400 hectares. The thinktank added that land used for solar farms could be used to grow crops at the same time. Conservative leadership frontrunner Liz Truss has been accused of showing “her true colours” in an 2009 paper promoting government spending cuts including slashing doctors’ pay. Truss called for patients to be charged to see their GP and for doctors’ pay to be slashed by 10% in a controversial report she co-authored when she was deputy director of the Reform thinktank, TalkTV discovered. It came days after the Guardian revealed a leaked recording of Truss saying that British workers needed “more graft” and suggesting they lacked the “skill and application” of foreign rivals. Polls have consistently put Truss as clear favourite to win the race for No 10, with polling expert Sir John Curtice saying he would be “extraordinarily surprised” if she does not take office. Labour said Truss’s report from 13 years ago, entitled “Back to Black”, revealed that “the reality of her agenda is devastating cuts”. In the document, the seven authors, including Truss, recommended cutting £28bn in a year by introducing “user charges for GPs” and reducing the pay of registrars, consultants, GPs and managers by 10%.

The figures from 2019-20 and 2020-21 include almost £4m in bonuses to Avanti for “operational performance”, “customer experience” and “acting as a good and efficient operator”. At the same time, the firm raised prices, with an open return from Manchester to London – barely a two-hour journey – costing £369.40. The performance-related fees, signed off by transport ministers, came despite Avanti being the worst-performing operator in the country with almost half of its services arriving late. In the last two years alone the firm received more than 50,000 complaints, the most of any operator and almost double that of the parallel east coast mainline operator, LNER. Avanti, co-owned by the Italian national railways, has come under renewed criticism for slashing services between major cities by up to two-thirds on the west coast mainline, and earlier this week passengers were forced to climb a fence at Oxenholme station in Cumbria after being locked in as their train arrived 100 minutes late. Avanti West Coast, whose contract is due for renewal in October, already has the lowest passenger satisfaction rating possible, a figure the transport minister Charlotte Vere said last month was “terrible”. Despite this, the Department for Transport (DfT) confirmed it would continue to hand over millions of pounds in management fees, after ruling out fining the operator for the failing service. The shadow transport secretary, Louise Haigh, has warned her counterpart, Grant Shapps, that the government “cannot continue to wash their hands of responsibility, nor reward failure” as the damage to the economy from the ongoing failure of the private operator mounts. Read more here: The Tory leadership candidates face a further hustings with voting party members in Manchester on Friday, as frontrunner Liz Truss was accused of showing “her true colours” in an unearthed 2009 paper promoting vast government spending cuts. Truss called for patients to be charged to see their GP and for doctors’ pay to be slashed by 10% in the controversial report she co-authored when she was deputy director of the Reform thinktank, PA Media reports. Polls have consistently put Truss as clear favourite to win the race for No 10, with elections guru Sir John Curtice saying he would be “extraordinarily surprised” if she does not take office. He told the Times that the foreign secretary “would have to foul up in some spectacular fashion” for her rival Rishi Sunak to enter Downing Street. Labour said Truss’s report from 13 years ago, entitled “Back to Black”, revealed that “the reality of her agenda is devastating cuts”. In the document, the seven authors - including Truss - recommended cutting £28bn in a year by introducing “user charges for GPs” and reducing the pay of registrars, consultants, GPs and managers by 10%. The report also called for the abolition of universal child benefit, the removal of the winter fuel payment, and the axing of several major military procurement projects including the Royal Navy’s planned aircraft carriers HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales – which were described as “inappropriate defence projects”. Truss’s campaign attempted to distance the Tory leadership candidate from the paper, with a campaign spokesperson saying: Co-authoring a document does not mean that someone supports every proposal put forward. Liz is focused on her bold economic plan to boost growth, cut taxes and put money back into hardworking people’s pockets. Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner said: Liz Truss’s track record shows her true colours. She is out of touch and out of step with the public. The reality of her agenda is devastating cuts that risk national security, punishing patients already facing record waiting times and cutting the pay of frontline workers. Her desperate attempts to distance herself from her own views now will fool no one. Railway changes will be imposed if workers do not agree to new deals, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, has said. The Conservative party has repeatedly targeted unions with criticism, in a move that the Trades Union Congress has argued is deliberately “picking a fight” for electoral purposes. Shapps is likely to remain transport secretary until at least 5 September, when a new Conservative party leader – likely to be Liz Truss if recent polls are correct – will be in place. There is little sign there would be a change of attitude under a new leader. Asked on Friday by Sky News if compulsory redundancies were on the table for rail workers, Shapps said (PA Media reports): The deal that is on the table actually means largely no compulsory redundancies at all. If [the unions] are not prepared to put that deal to your membership we will never know whether members would accept it. What I do know and I can say for sure is if we can’t get this settled in the way that we are proposing, which is ‘please put the deal to your membership’ then we will have to move to what is called a section 188; it is a process of actually requiring these changes to go into place so it becomes mandated. That is the direction that this is moving in now. Shapps claimed that outdated work practices needed to be updated – a characterisation of the industry that is disputed by the unions, who argue that employers are trying to use modernisation as an excuse to reduce members’ real pay and conditions. Shapps said: “If we can’t get those modernisations in place we will have to impose those modernisations but we would much rather do it through these offers actually being put to their members.” Follow our business liveblog for more on the rail strikes: Labour has urged Boris Johnson to recall parliament next week so the government can offer more help to struggling households before the announcement of the new energy price cap. The opposition has written to the prime minister and both Tory leadership candidates warning that it is a “crucial deadline” for government action to tackle soaring energy bills, after inflation topped 10% for the first time in 40 years. Ofgem will announce the new level at which energy bills will be capped next Friday, with forecasts predicting an increase to £3,582, or 82% above the current cap. Annual energy bills are expected to hit £4,500 a year from January, and £5,456 from April, with warnings that households across the country face serious hardship without government intervention. Labour this week unveiled a £29bn plan to freeze the cap at the current level of £1,971 for six months from October, which would save the average household £1,000, piling pressure on the next prime minister to follow suit. Thangam Debbonaire, the shadow leader of the House of Commons, has now written to the prime minister, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak, urging them to recall parliament two weeks early and to freeze the price cap before winter. Across Britain, people are having to make unthinkable choices about how to pay their bills, causing endless worry for households and businesses. In seven days, Ofgem will announce the rise of the energy price cap. Against the backdrop of a rise in inflation to 10.1%, this won’t just send households into a further spiral of worry, pushing them to cut back even further ahead of the winter. But it will create another shock for our economy. With businesses and households on the brink, we cannot wait to act. Families deserve a government that is on their side, and is ready to take the action needed now to meet the scale of this national emergency. Earlier this month, the Lib Dem leader, Sir Ed Davey, called on the government to announce an emergency budget to deal with the cost of living crisis. Ian Blackford, the SNP’s leader at Westminster, has also urged the prime minister to bring back MPs before the end of the summer recess. Read more here: A former executive at the oil company BP has called for increases to the energy price cap to be scrapped and for suppliers that fail to help households struggling with bills to be nationalised. Nick Butler, who worked for BP for almost 30 years and was group vice-president for strategy and development, said that expected rises in the cap should be abandoned by the industry regulator, Ofgem, which he said had been “overwhelmed by events” after turmoil in the global energy markets sent 29 British energy retailers to the wall. Butler is also calling for a “forensic examination” of the accounts of remaining suppliers to ensure they are still viable businesses. Ofgem is expected to announce next week a rise in the price cap, which is supposed to protect consumers. This could mean annual bills jumping from an average of £1,971 to £3,582. Butler, who was a senior policy adviser to Gordon Brown, echoed the former prime minister’s view that energy firms unable to offer lower bills should be re-nationalised. Writing for the Guardian, Butler said: As with the financial sector in 2008, if the private energy sector fails to meet the needs of the society it serves, its functions must and will be taken on by the government. The companies involved now must show they understand that they must use their skills and resources in the public interest. Butler’s comments come as the government assesses options to help households facing soaring energy bills this winter. His former employer BP has been accused of “unfettered profiteering” during the energy crisis, aided by a rise in wholesale oil and gas prices caused in part by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Read the full story here: Health sector leaders have warned the UK faces a “humanitarian crisis” of worsening health outcomes unless the government does more to help with rising energy costs. Families are looking ahead to a grim winter as experts predict the cap on energy bills will hit close to £3,600 a year from October, before rising again next year, PA Media reports. Surging prices mean people will have to choose between skipping meals to heat their homes or living in poor conditions, the NHS Confederation said in a letter to ministers. Matthew Taylor is chief executive of the body, which represents NHS leaders, and was quoted by the BBC and the Times as saying: The country is facing a humanitarian crisis. Many people could face the awful choice between skipping meals to heat their homes and having to live in cold, damp and very unpleasant conditions. This in turn could lead to outbreaks of illness and sickness around the country and widen health inequalities, worsen children’s life chances and leave an indelible scar on local communities. The regulator is set to announce the new price cap, which will come into effect from October, next Friday. Labour and the Liberal Democrats have suggested plans to freeze bills at the same level as now, while many of the biggest energy suppliers have backed a similar idea. But the government has made it clear it will not do anything substantial until a new prime minister is in office on 5 September. On Thursday, the trade body for energy companies called for more support on top of the £400 promised to households in May. Dhara Vyas, Energy UK’s director of advocacy, said: Time is running very short ahead of October and we know many customers are already struggling after the last price rise – so the predicted increases will simply be unaffordable for millions of households. Given the urgency, our industry believes the most practical way to help customers ahead of Christmas will be to increase the amount of support made through the existing bills support scheme. Labour is calling for the government to get a grip on the energy crisis and said the two Tory leadership candidates need to show they are “serious” about the problem and back a recall of parliament. Ofgem is expected to announce next week a rise in the price cap, which is supposed to protect consumers. This could mean annual bills jumping from an average of £1,971 to £3,582. The opposition party has written to Boris Johnson, as well as Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss, to ask for MPs to return to Westminster on Monday in a bid to propose their plan to freeze the cap. Asked by Sky News what the purpose of a recall would be, shadow Commons leader Thangam Debbonaire said: It would be so that we can pass the legislation that would be necessary for us to override the price rise, the rise in the price cap that Ofgem will be announcing in seven days’ time. That could happen next week if we get back to parliament on Monday. That is up to the government to request of the Speaker, and they can do that. The prime minister is perfectly capable of opening his email which I sent him last night asking him to do just this. I have also asked both leadership candidates to back that call. If they are really serious about helping working people and struggling households and businesses through this cost-of-living crisis, they should back our call right now and we should be passing that legislation next week. The Labour frontbencher added: The time to act is now; the government has failed. They could have acted weeks ago, they could have acted months ago in fact when Labour first called for a windfall tax on oil and gas way back in January. Welcome to today’s politics liveblog.

Here’s where things stand: Germany has delivered four more Gepard anti-aircraft guns and 65 refrigerators to Ukraine, the German government announced on Wednesday. The 4 additional Gepard units now brings the total number of Gepard units provided by Germany to Ukraine to 24. Kremlin sources “are now working to clear [Russian President Vladimir] Putin of any responsibly of the defeat, instead blaming the loss of almost all of occupied Kharkiv Oblast on underinformed military advisors,” according to The Institute of the Study of War. In a statement reported by CNBC, the institute said that “Kremlin officials and state media propagandists are extensively discussing the reasons for the Russian defeat in Kharkiv Oblast, a marked change from their previous pattern of reporting on exaggerated or fabricated Russian successes with limited detail.” The prospects for peace in Ukraine are currently “minimal,” the UN secretary-general said on Wednesday after a telephone conversation with Russian president Vladimir Putin. “I have the feeling we are still far away from peace. I would be lying if I would say it could happen soon,” Guterres said, adding, “I have no illusion; at the present moment the chances of a peace deal are minimal,” he added, noting that even a ceasefire is “not in sight.” Russian president Vladimir Putin still believes he was right to launch an invasion of Ukraine, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Wednesday after a 90-minute-long telephone call with the Russian president. “Sadly, I cannot tell you that the impression has grown that it was a mistake to begin this war,” Scholz said in a press briefing. Germany has delivered four more Gepard anti-aircraft guns and 65 refrigerators to Ukraine, the German government announced on Wednesday. The Gepard anti-aircraft self-propelled gun can fire 35 mm shells at a rate of up to 1,000 rounds per minute. The 4 additional Gepard units now brings the total number of Gepard units provided by Germany to Ukraine to 24. “Under the 2022 budget process, the funds for the security capacity building initiative were increased to a total of 2 billion euros for the year 2022. The additional funds are to be used primarily to support Ukraine,” the German government said in a statement. “At the same time, they will be used to finance Germany’s increased mandatory contributions to the European Peace Facility (EPF), which in turn goes towards reimbursing EU member states for costs incurred to them in providing support for Ukraine,” it added. Kremlin sources “are now working to clear [Russian President Vladimir] Putin of any responsibly of the defeat, instead blaming the loss of almost all of occupied Kharkiv Oblast on underinformed military advisors,” according to The Institute of the Study of War. In a statement reported by CNBC, the institute said that “Kremlin officials and state media propagandists are extensively discussing the reasons for the Russian defeat in Kharkiv Oblast, a marked change from their previous pattern of reporting on exaggerated or fabricated Russian successes with limited detail.” It went on to add that the Kremlin’s acknowledgement of its defeat in Kharkiv is “part of an effort to mitigate and deflect criticism for such a devastating failure away from Russian President Vladimir Putin and onto the Russian Ministry of Defense and the uniformed military command.” The prospects for peace in Ukraine are currently “minimal,” the UN secretary-general said on Wednesday after a telephone conversation with Russian president Vladimir Putin. Antonio Guterres said he and the Russian president discussed efforts to overcome “obstacles” that remain related to Russia’s food and fertilizer exports, but warned it would be “naive” to believe there has been sufficient progress towards a rapid end to the war in Ukraine. “I have the feeling we are still far away from peace. I would be lying if I would say it could happen soon,” Guterres said, Agence France-Presse reports. “I have no illusion; at the present moment the chances of a peace deal are minimal,” he added, noting that even a ceasefire is “not in sight.” Guterres nevertheless reaffirmed that he was maintaining contact with both sides and expressed hope that “one day it will be possible to go to a higher level of discussion.” In the meantime talks continue on Russian exports. Guterres said he spoke with Putin earlier Wednesday and that they discussed the exports initiative “and its extension and its possible expansion.” A two-part agreement - allowing both the flow of Ukraine’s grain exports blocked by the war and Russia’s food and fertilizer exports - was brokered by the United Nations and Turkey in July and is scheduled to last 120 days. While some three million tons of grain have been allowed to leave Ukraine, Russia says exports of its own foodstuffs and fertilizer continue to suffer under Western sanctions, which have targeted Moscow for its military assault. “There are some exports of Russian food and fertilizers but much lower that what is desirable and needed,” Guterres said, adding there is discussion about the possibility of Russian ammonia exports though the Black Sea. Guterres warned the fertilizer crisis has reached a “dramatic” level, repeating his fears of a global food shortage next year. Russian president Vladimir Putin still believes he was right to launch an invasion of Ukraine, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Wednesday after a 90-minute-long telephone call with the Russian president. “Sadly, I cannot tell you that the impression has grown that it was a mistake to begin this war,” Scholz said in a press briefing, Agence France-Presse reports. “And there was no indication that new attitudes are emerging,” he added at joint press conference with his Georgian counterpart, Irakli Garibashvili. In the call Tuesday with Putin, Scholz urged the Russian leader to seek a diplomatic solution “based on a ceasefire, a complete withdrawal of Russian forces and respect for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Ukraine.” The exit of Russian troops from Ukraine was the only way for “peace to have a chance in the region”, Scholz said Wednesday. While Putin’s positions did not appear to have shifted, the German chancellor said it was necessary to remain in conversation with the Russian leader, saying, “It is right to speak with each other and to say what there is to say on this subject.” It is 9pm in Ukraine. Eight Russian missiles that struck Kryvyi Rih at about 5pm local time were directed at hydraulic structures, causing enough damage that the water level of the Inhulets river is now rising and posing a serious threat to the city. This aligns with Ukraine’s concerns that Russia will continue to target Ukraine’s infrastructure in retribution for its success in regaining occupied territory. In particular, Kryvyi Rih is the hometown of Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Speaking of recently regained occupied territory, since 6 September, Ukrainian troops have liberated about 388 settlements, about 8,500 sq km and about 150,000 people. These are updated figures provided by Hanna Maliar, Ukrainian deputy minister of defence, who explained that she is constantly clarifying the figures because the situation is dynamic. Meanwhile in these recently liberated territories, authorities are working to restore life back to normalcy, which is a tall order given the devastation the Russian troops left behind. In Balakliia, there is no electricity, no water and only part of the city has gas, said the State Emergency Service of Ukraine. But Ukraine’s national railway was able to run a test train today into a station here today. But in the same city of Balakliia, Ukraine’s ministry of defence found what its officials believe to be a “torture chamber” used by Russian troops to hold Ukrainian prisoners. While some Balakliia residents told the Guardian that they had little interaction with the Russian forces, who mostly stayed on edges of the town, and did not experience the scenes of torture and execution seen elsewhere in the country, Serhiy Bolvinov, head of the Kharkiv Region National Police Investigation Department, said that 40 people had been detained during the occupation. One resident told the The BBC that he was held by Russians in the city’s police station for more than 40 days, and was tortured with electrocution. Russian troops have returned to Kreminna, a city in the Russian-occupied Luhansk oblast that was “completely empty” yesterday, said Serhiy Hadai, the governor of the Luhansk region, and tore down the Ukrainian flags that local partisans had raised in celebration. Yesterday, a similar situation happened Svatove – Russian troops left, but returned after some time, Hadai said. Russian troops also left Starobilsk, another city in the Luhansk oblast, yesterday, and have so far not returned. Hanna Maliar, Ukrainian deputy minister of defence, has an updated account of territory regained by Ukrainian forces in the Kharkiv region since 6 September: Since 6 September, Ukrainian troops have liberated about 388 settlements, about 8,500 sq km and about 150,000 people, Maliar said. “The numbers are constantly being clarified because the process is dynamic,” she explained. “In addition, the liberated territories still need additional security and stabilisation measures in order to safely live there. Therefore, official messages with the figures of discharged settlements are provided with conscious delay and may or may not take into account the stabilisation measures undertaken, and therefore vary.” She said the front line currently measures at 2,500 km, 1,300 km of which are active combat. “Yes, we have long waited for this success, but we still have to fight and fight,” Maliar said. “Until a complete victory, we release many more of our people and our lands. We need more time, strength and patience.” Germany has delivered four more Gepard anti-aircraft vehicles to Ukraine, after receiving criticism that the country was not following through on its commitment to supply Ukraine with weaponry. Yesterday, Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, had harsh words for Germany and German chancellor, Olaf Scholz. Early in the invasion, Scholz had shocked the world by announcing a historic 180-degree policy turn on defence spending and exporting lethal weapons and committing Germany to sending missiles and anti-tank weapons to help Ukraine defend itself against Russian aggression. But six months later, many of those weapons have yet to arrive. “Disappointing signals from Germany while Ukraine needs Leopards and Marders now – to liberate people and save them from genocide,” Kuleba tweeted. “Not a single rational argument on why these weapons can not be supplied, only abstract fears and excuses. What is Berlin afraid of that Kyiv is not?” In light of Ukraine’s recent victories in regaining territory, Ukrainian officials have been particularly outspoken on the need for more foreign aid in the form of military weaponry. The rising water level of the Inhulets river has already swept a bridge away Kryvyi Rih, according to footage over the area. The water is rising because the hydraulic structures that usually keeps the level regular were damaged when they were struck by eight Russian rockets earlier today. The eight Russian missiles that struck Kryvyi Rih at about 5pm local time were directed at hydraulic structures, and the damage to the structures are now causing the water level of the Inhulets river to rise, posing a serious threat to the city, officials said. “Today, the Russian troops sent the maximum number of their weapons at hydrotechnical structures,” Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of Ukraine’s presidential office, said on Telegram. “The goal is obvious - an attempt to create an emergency situation. It is not important to them whether people will remain without water or whether the city will be in water.” “This is a terrorist act against our people, against a specific city.” “They need our panic, in which it will be difficult to make decisions. So don’t panic,” Tymoshenko said. “Services are already eliminating the consequences of the missile strikes, and the military administration is coordinating the work on the spot. The main thing is that there are no victims among the civilian population. We will restore the rest.” Kryvyi Rih is a populous city in the Dnipropetrovsk oblast in central Ukraine. It is the hometown of Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. It appears that today’s missile strikes on Kryvyi Rih in the Dnipropetrovsk oblast were aimed at the city’s waterworks. This attack aligns with Ukraine’s concern that Russia will continue to target the country’s infrastructure in retribution for Ukraine’s continued success in recapturing occupied territories. The general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces reported today that Russia forces hit civilian infrastructure of more than 15 settlements in the Luhansk, Dnipropetrovsk, Kherson and Mykolaiv oblasts. “In total, during the current day, eight rockets, four air strikes and 15 shelling from the enemy’s battalion-fire jet systems were counted,” the general staff posted on Telegram. A lot of work lies ahead for the newly liberated territories of the Kharkiv oblast – currently in Balakliia, there is no electricity, no water and only part of the city has gas, said the State Emergency Service of Ukraine. “Demining of the most important objects of the city’s critical infrastructure has already started today, to enable other emergency and utility services to work to restore safe and normal living conditions for its residents,” officials said. In a very sweet moment between mother and son, Vyacheslav Zadorenko, the mayor of the Kharkiv suburb Derhachi, reunites with his mother after her village of Kozacha was liberated following six months of Russian occupation. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said troops have so far liberated 8,000 sq km in the north-eastern region of Kharkiv in a counteroffensive launched in early September. Russia missiles strike Kryvyi Rih, a populous city in the Dnipropetrovsk oblast in southeast Ukraine, said Oleksandr Vilkul, head of the military administration of Kryvyi Rih. “We are all in shelters!” Vilkul posted on Telegram. “Another launch of rockets in our direction.” Ukraine’s ministry of defence has posted what its officials believe to be a “torture chamber” used by Russian troops to hold Ukrainian prisoners in the recently liberated Balakliia in the Kharkiv oblast. The cell has the Lord’s Prayer craved into the wall in Ukrainian. With about 8,000 sq km (3,100 square miles) recaptured so far, authorities have repeatedly warned of the horrors that the Russian troops likely left behind. After liberating the Kyiv region, Ukrainian forces uncovered a number of war crimes, including mass graves and bodies of civilians that bore the signs of torture. They expect to find the same in the Kharkiv region. Balakliia residents told the Guardian that they had little interaction with the Russian forces, who mostly stayed on edges of the town. Although they lived amid a near information vacuum – with patchy phone signal, no mobile internet or wifi and TV for most of the period – and had to get by without basic utilities and cope with looting by Russian forces and the terror of shelling, they did not experience the scenes of torture and execution seen elsewhere in the country. But Serhiy Bolvinov, head of the Kharkiv Region National Police Investigation Department, said that 40 people had been detained during the occupation. One resident told the The BBC that he was held by Russians in the city’s police station for more than 40 days, and was tortured with electrocution. The man, identified only as Artem, said he could hear screams of pain and terror coming from other cells. “They made me hold two wires,” he said. “There was an electric generator. The faster it went, the higher the voltage. They said, ‘if you let it go, you are finished’. Then they started asking questions. They said I was lying, and they started spinning it even more and the voltage increased.” Artem told us he was detained because the Russians found a picture of his brother, a soldier, in uniform. Another man from Balakliia was held for 25 days because he had the Ukrainian flag, Artem said. Ukraine’s national railway ran a test train today into a station in Balakliia in the Kharkiv oblast, less than a week after Ukraine’s dramatic counter-offensive led to the liberation of more than 8,000 sq km of the region, which had been living under Russian occupation for almost the entirety of the invasion. Oleh Synyehubov, governor of Kharkiv oblast, said on Telegram that returning “liberated towns and villages to normal life” was a priority at the moment. “Currently, our main priority is to carry out demining, restore critical infrastructure and provide public services - payment of pensions, social benefits, etc,” he said. “I am sure that normal life will return…very soon.” Russian troops have returned to Kreminna, a city in the Russian-occupied Luhansk oblast that was “completely empty” yesterday, said Serhiy Hadai, the governor of the Luhansk region, and tore down the Ukrainian flags that local partisans had raised in celebration. Yesterday, a similar situation happened Svatove – Russian troops left, but returned after some time, Hadai said. Russian troops also left Starobilsk, another city in the Luhansk oblast, yesterday, and have so far not returned. “We are only waiting for…the (Ukrainian) military,” Hadai said on Telegram. Like in other parts of the Luhansk oblast, Russian troops have cut off the mobile Internet in Kerminna and other occupied territories “so that people could not transmit information to us,” Hadai said. Hadai warned that occupied territories were experiencing a shortage of fuel due to the large-scale exodus of Russian occupiers and collaborators. The Kremlin has given a predictably lukewarm reaction to the draft set of security guarantees published by the Ukrainian President’s office yesterday. Co-authored by the former Nato secretary general, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, and Volodomyr Zelenskiy’s chief of staff, Andrey Yermak, the report said Ukraine’s allies should commit to legally binding large-scale weapons transfers and multi-decade investment in the country’s defences, as an alternative to Kyiv’s long-term aspirations to join Nato. Today Reuters reports that Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia viewed the document negatively, saying the idea of Ukraine joining Nato was “the main threat to Russia”: “It once again emphasises the relevance and urgent need for us to ensure our own security and our own national interests.” Peskov also criticised Kyiv’s use of Western support to guarantee its security, saying Zelenskiy could boost Ukraine’s security by giving in to Russian demands right away. “The leadership of Ukraine must take actions that eliminate the threat to Russia, and they know perfectly well what those actions must be,” he said. He did not provide any details. Pope Francis has spoken explicitly about Ukraine during his visit to Kazakhstan, where he is taking part in a multi-faith conference. Reuters reports that at the end of a Mass for about 6,000 members of Kazakhstan’s Catholic community, he spoke of Ukraine, asking “how many deaths will it still take” before conflict yields to dialogue. He also expressed concern over the flare up in the South Caucasus between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Ukraine’s President Volodomyr Zelenskiy has posted to Telegram to thank the commander of the ground forces in Ukraine for the recent counteroffensive advances. He writes: You can temporarily occupy the territory of our state. But you definitely cannot occupy the Ukrainian people. You can brainwash people’s minds, but you cannot do this to the hearts of Ukrainians. I am thankful to commander of the ground forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces Oleksandr Syrsky, to all our warriors for liberating the Ukrainian land from the enemy. You save our people, our hearts, children and the future. Nataliya Gumenyuk is a Ukrainian journalist specialising in foreign affairs and conflict reporting, and she has written for us today, arguing that Ukrainians are joyful as the Russian occupiers flee, but must be wary of an ambush: People are generally hopeful. For the last five months, the Russian army has waged an artillery war instead of engaging in direct battles. But within days of this new offensive, the Ukrainian army claims to have captured thousands of Russian soldiers as prisoners of war. This raises hopes that at least 8,000 Ukrainian military personnel being held in Russia might be released in exchange. Make no mistake, though: it’s not an easy path. Ukrainian soldiers are fighting and dying. Scrolling through my Facebook feed, I learned about the death of a fellow soldier of two of my friends, killed in the Kharkiv region during the past few days, and read about members of the national opera joining the army. I have found that the most excitement is expressed by international experts, diplomats and correspondents. Ukrainians are hopeful but wary. Every one of us has a friend, a relative or somebody we know fighting on the ground at the moment, somebody whom we are unable to contact, or who might be sent on assignment. Read more of Nataliya Gumenyuk’s piece here: Ukrainians are joyful as the Russian occupiers flee, but we must be wary of an ambush Volodymyr Zelenskiy made a surprise visit to Izium, one of the many settlements recently liberated by Ukrainian forces in the Kharkiv region. While there, he met with the victorious troops took part in the flag raising and surveyed some of the damages. “Earlier, when we looked up, we always looked for the blue sky. Today, when we look up, we are looking for only one thing – the flag of Ukraine,” Zelenskiy said. Zelenskiy said about 8,000 sq km (3,100 square miles) have been liberated so far, apparently all in the north-eastern region of Kharkiv. “Stabilisation measures” had been completed in about half of that territory, Zelenskiy said, “and across a liberated area of about the same size, stabilisation measures are still ongoing”. Ukraine now has set its sights on freeing all territory occupied by invading Russian forces. While the mood is joyous over the recent gains the Ukrainian military, officials understand the challenges that lie ahead in the newly liberated territories – many of which had been living under Russian occupation for almost the entirety of the invasion. Much of the city of Izium was destroyed, and the people were terrorised. Investigators are now beginning to look into possible war crimes committed by Russian soldiers. Russia has probably used Iranian-made uncrewed aerial vehicles in Ukraine for the first time, Britain’s defence intelligence said on Wednesday, after Kyiv reported downing one of the UAVs – a Shahed-136 – on Tuesday. The German paper Bild has added weight to the British defence intelligence reports, raising questions of the extent of weaponry that Moscow has at hand. Russian forces have ordered that the mobile Internet be cut off in the Russian-occupied Luhansk oblast Wednesday, Serhiy Haidai, governor of Luhansk oblast, said on Telegram. One person was killed and a number more injured by Russian shelling in the Zaporizhzhia oblast in southern Ukraine over the past two days, according to the regional state administration. Five civilians were killed and 16 more wounded in Bakhmut in the Donetsk oblast yesterday, said Pavlo Kyrylenko, governor of the Donetsk oblast. The region has seen heavy fighting in the past day, Kyrylenko said, with Russian troops attacking infrastructure “with tanks, mortars and artillery”. In addition to the casualties in Bakhmut, Russian troops wounded 12 in Toretsk, one in Avdiivka, one in Kurdiumivka and one in Kodema, Kyrylenko said. A dispatch from Guardian correspondent Lorenzo Tondo, who reports from the recently liberated Izium, where president Volodymyr Zelenskiy made a surprise visit earlier today: Horror is slowly unfolding from the burned-out rubble of Izium, one of the most strategically vital towns for the Russians before its recapture last weekend by Ukrainian forces. The carcasses of tanks with Russia’s signature ‘Z’ symbol dot streets peppered with craters. Dozens of bombed-out apartment buildings in the city centre lie derelict along roads covered with debris from what was one of this war’s most fierce battles and which here, in Izium, has resulted in the death of hundreds, perhaps even thousands of people. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Wednesday described the scene in Izium as “very shocking” but not shocking for him – not shocking for the Ukrainian people, who experienced this same bittersweet victory earlier in the war that is the relief of long-awaited liberation but the horror of what is left behind. “The same destroyed buildings, killed people,” Zelenskiy said. “Our soldiers are here”, he added. “That’s a very important thing. It supports people. I see how people meet them, in what a sensitive moment. It means that with our army, life comes back.” More to come. Five civilians were killed and 16 more wounded in Bakhmut in the Donetsk oblast yesterday, said Pavlo Kyrylenko, governor of the Donetsk oblast. The region has seen heavy fighting in the past day, Kyrylenko said, as Russian troops attack infrastructure “with tanks, mortars and artillery”. In addition to the casualties in Bakhmut, Russian troops wounded 12 in Toretsk, one in Avdiivka, one in Kurdiumivka and one in Kodema, Kyrylenko said. “Every night in Donetsk region is restless. Civilians should leave the area. This is a matter of life and death,” Kyrylenko wrote on Telegram. Russian forces have ordered that the mobile internet be cut off in the Russian-occupied Luhansk oblast on Wednesday, Serhiy Haidai, governor of Luhansk oblast, said on Telegram. “The occupying authorities of Luhansk region continue to claim that nothing threatening is happening in the territory of the region, or as they say, the ‘republic’,” Haidai wrote on Telegram. “Just in case, mobile internet is turned off in the region. As the local operator explains, this is an order of the occupation authorities to ensure defence capability and security. Previously, they did not focus on these issues. At the same time, queues at checkpoints have not been decreasing for several days.” One person was killed and others injured by Russian shelling in the Zaporizhzhia oblast in southern Ukraine over the past two days, according to the regional state administration. A rocket attack damaged two infrastructure facilities in the region’s centre, and shelling destroyed homes and residential buildings in the settlements of Orikhiv and Hulyaipole, as well as in several villages in the Polohy district. The attacks in Zaporizhzhia come as Ukrainian intelligence warn the Kremlin will begin targeting more and more of Ukraine’s energy infrastructure – including the besieged Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which would cause catastrophic harm to the region if damaged. “Earlier, when we looked up, we always looked for the blue sky. Today, when we look up, we are looking for only one thing – the flag of Ukraine,” Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, wrote on Telegram regarding his surprise visit to the recently liberated city of Izium. Izium was one of more than 300 settlements the Ukrainian military have recaptured since 6 September. Zelenskiy said earlier that troops have liberated about 8,000 sq km (3,100 sq miles) so far, apparently all in the north-eastern region of Kharkiv. “Our blue-yellow flag is already flying in the de-occupied Izium,” Zelenskiy continued. “And it will be so in every Ukrainian city and village. We are moving in only one direction – forward and towards victory.” Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, made a surprise visit to the recently liberated city of Izium today where he met with troops, took part in the flag raising and surveyed some of the damages. Here are some images of his visit: The German paper Bild has added weight to British defence intelligence reports that Russia has likely used Iranian-made drones in Ukraine, following the downing of one of them yesterday, as announced by Kyiv. The tabloid says remains of a Shahed-136 ‘kamikaze drone’ were found in wreckage following the liberation of the town of Kupiansk, near Kharkiv. Existence of the drone was first made public by Iran in 2021, when it described it as “very precise”. However, experts that Bild have spoken tosay there’s doubt about the drone’s efficiency, which was viewed as a prop - or part of the propaganda tool kit - of Iran’s Mullahs. Nevertheless, the discovery of the Shahed-136 remains have set alarm bells ringing among western intelligence agencies, the paper writes (adding there is evidence, from reports by Russian bloggers, that Iranian Qods Yasir drones have also been used over eastern Ukraine). In July, the US warned that Russia was on the search for new drones to use in its campaign against Ukraine, and appeared to have found what it was looking for in Iran. The theory goes that Moscow was at pains to use the Iranian drones to replace the considerable losses of its own observation, conflict and kamikaze drones in Ukraine. However, shortly after the US warnings emerged about the existence of the drones, western intelligence services reported that the “Mullahs’ drones” had disappointed Russia’s military and was not planning to buy any more of them ‘beyond a few test examples’. Yesterday’s discovery in Kupiansk raises the question: were the remains of one of the ‘test drones’ considered by Moscow not worthy of further use; or did western intelligence read the whole situation incorrectly and did Moscow put its faith in what Bild refers to as the ‘Iranian killer drones’ and buy stockpiles of them? Izium, the recently recaptured city in Kharkiv oblast that Volodymyr Zelenskiy is visiting today, was left devastated after Russian forces withdrew following months of occupation. Like much of the rest of the recaptured parts of region, Ukrainian authorities must now take stock of the damages and get a full scope of what horrors took place under when Russian troops had control of the city of nearly 46,000. “The view is very shocking but it is not shocking for me,” the Associated Press reported Zelenskiy saying, “because we began to see the same pictures from Bucha, from the first de-occupied territories so the same destroyed buildings, killed people.” When Ukrainian troops retook Bucha, they uncovered a slew of war crimes – mass graves and the bodies of civilians, many of them bearing signs of torture. Here’s a look at what the Russian troops left behind in Izium: Volodymyr Zelenskiy is making a surprise visit today to Izium, one of the many towns recaptured by Ukrainian forces after months under Russian occupation. Western sanctions on Russia are having a real impact and are there to stay, the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said on Wednesday, stressing that the European Union’s solidarity with Ukraine would be “unshakeable”. “This is the time for us to show resolve, not appeasement,” she said. “We are in it for the long haul.” Von der Leyen also sent a strong signal over European Union expansion, saying the European Union is not complete without Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia and western Balkan countries. “You are part of our family, you are the future of our union. Our union is not complete without you,” she said. Ukraine has set its sights on freeing all territory occupied by invading Russian forces after driving them back in a speedy counteroffensive in the north-east. In an address on Tuesday evening, Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said about 8,000 sq km (3,100 square miles) have been liberated so far, apparently all in the north-eastern region of Kharkiv. “Stabilisation measures” had been completed in about half of that territory, Zelenskiy said, “and across a liberated area of about the same size, stabilisation measures are still ongoing”. Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych held out the prospects of building on the gains made over the weekend in the Kharkiv region by moving on the eastern province of Luhansk. “There is now an assault on Lyman and there could be an advance on Siversk,” Arestovych said. The pro-Russian leader of the Donetsk People’s Republic denied the claims and said in a video post that Lyman remains in their hands, saying “the situation has been stabilised.” However, the frontline in eastern Ukraine is approaching the borders of territory claimed by the self-proclaimed pro-Russian separatist Luhansk People’s Republic (LPR) according to Andrey Marochko, a senior LPR military commander. The general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces warned that Russian forces were continuing to loot as they withdrew from occupied territories. On a stretch of highway heading into Russian territory, Ukrainian officials spotted civilian vehicles with licence plates from the Kharkiv region, driven by Russian military and weighed down with looted belongings. In the south, there were reports of Russian occupants breaking the gates of private garages and taking cars, as well as removing furniture. Russia has probably used Iranian-made uncrewed aerial vehicles in Ukraine for the first time, Britain’s defence intelligence said on Wednesday, after Kyiv reported downing one of the UAVs – a Shahed-136 – on Tuesday. The device is a “one-way attack” weapon, the MoD said, and has been used in the Middle East. The shooting down of the drone near the frontline in Ukraine suggests that Russia is using the weapons as a tactical weapon rather than a strategic one, targeting military installations deeper into Ukrainian territory. Russian oil and gas revenues have fallen to their lowest for almost a year, despite a big rise in prices. Pope Francis, at a summit of religious leaders in Kazakhstan, has said that God does not guide religions towards war in what appears to be an implicit criticism of Russian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill, who has backed the invasion of Ukraine. In this video explainer, Guardian correspondent Luke Harding chronicles the key historical events that led to the invasion of Ukraine, from the Euromaidan protests to the annexation of Crimea, and explains why Vladimir Putin’s belief that Russians and Ukrainians are “one people” is rooted in history from a thousand years ago. Reuters reports the frontline in eastern Ukraine is approaching the borders of territory claimed by the self-proclaimed pro-Russian separatist Luhansk People’s Republic (LPR). That is according to Andrey Marochko, a senior LPR military commander who has spoken to Russian news agency Tass. Here is a video clip of European Commission president Ursula Von Der Leyen saying this morning that the EU’s solidarity with Ukraine was “unshakeable” and sanctions against Russia were “here to stay”. Pope Francis has said that God does not guide religions towards war in what appears to be an implicit criticism of Russian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill, who has backed the invasion of Ukraine. On his second day in Kazakhstan, Francis addressed the Seventh Congress of Leaders of World and Traditional Religions, a meeting that brings together Christians, Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus and other faiths. “God is peace. He guides us always in the way of peace, never that of war,” Francis said. “Let us commit ourselves, then, even more to insisting on the need for resolving conflicts not by the inconclusive means of power, with arms and threats, but by the only means blessed by heaven and worthy of man: encounter, dialogue and patient negotiations,” he said. Reuters reports the pope, who earlier this year said Kirill could not be Russian president Vladimir Putin’s “altar boy”, told the conference: “The sacred must never be a prop for power, nor power a prop for the sacred!” Kirill was to have attended, but pulled out. The Russian Orthodox Church (ROC) sent a delegation headed by its number two, Metropolitan Anthony, who later briefly met the pope. Kirill has given enthusiastic backing to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Sir Hugo Swire, previously a minister of state for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and who served in the Grenadier Guards during the 1980s has suggested this morning that Russian President Vladimir Putin was misguided in his thinking about how the world would react to his invasion of Ukraine, and how well prepared the Russian military was for the campaign. He told viewers of Sky News in the UK: I think a lot of his equipment just looks great on parades in Moscow, but actually in the field is proven to be not very effective, and the terrible logistical problems and so forth. The reaction of the world? I don’t know. Did he really think he could go into Ukraine in a sort of Blitzkrieg operation and it would all be over in a matter of days and then the world would settle down and deal with him on a an equal level? I think we can now see the how wrong he was. During her state of the union speech this morning, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen sent a strong signal over European Union expansion. Reuters reports she said the European Union is not complete without Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia and western Balkan countries. “You are part of our family, you are the future of our union,” she told the EU’s eastern neighbours. “Our union is not complete without you.” Pavlo Kyrylenko, Ukraine’s governor of Donetsk, has repeated his refrain that people should evacuate where possible from areas that remain under the control of pro-Russia forces or are being targeted by Russian strikes. Posting images to Telegram of what he claims are recent attacks by Russia on Kramatorsk, Kyrylenko says: The rocket fell right in the middle of a residential quarter and partially damaged at least three private houses; the garage burned down as a result of the fire that broke out. The Russians are deliberately terrorising the local population. Under such conditions, the only correct way out for civilians is to evacuate to safer regions of Ukraine. Don’t become a target for Russian terrorist forces. Evacuate! Western sanctions on Russia are having a real impact and are there to stay, the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said on Wednesday, stressing that the European Union’s solidarity with Ukraine would be “unshakeable”. With the Ukrainian first lady, Olena Zelenska, the guest of honour as she delivered her annual state of the union speech, Von der Leyen told the European parliament in Strasbourg: “Never before has this parliament debated the state of our union with war raging on European soil.” “And I stand here with the conviction that with courage and solidarity, Putin will fail and Europe will prevail,” Von der Leyen said, adding: “Europe’s solidarity with Ukraine will remain unshakeable.” Reuters reports many lawmakers and EU commissioners wore Ukraine’s blue and yellow colours. “Russia’s financial sector is on life-support,” she said, adding that nearly a thousand international companies had left the country. “The Russian military is taking chips from dishwashers and refrigerators to fix their military hardware, because they ran out of semiconductors. Russia’s industry is in tatters.” At a time when Ukraine is working on securing territory it has reclaimed from occupying Russian forces in a swift counter-offensive, Von der Leyen said this was not the time for the bloc to soften its stance. “This is the time for us to show resolve, not appeasement,” she said. “We are in it for the long haul.” On Sky News in the UK, Moscow correspondent Diana Magnay has said that she does not see the Russian president, Vladimir Putin “ending this anytime soon and withdrawing his troops”. She told viewers: Ukraine does seem to be on the advantage now. And the Russian forces, on a long and overstretched frontline which clearly has weaknesses in it that the Ukrainians have identified, are going to be suffering from pretty poor morale. I think that is the main problem that Russia is facing. The Kremlin has been pretty tight-lipped about the counteroffensive. But what has been very interesting here [inMoscow] is to watch the kind of comments and criticism from not the liberal camp, but pro-war nationalist bloggers, especially on Telegram, and some military analysts who want Russia to be doing better. They are very angry that they are suffering the kind of setbacks that we are now seeing. We heard yesterday from the leader of the Communist party saying that Russia should just turn around and call a war a war, and declare full mobilisation. And we’ve heard certain calls from various parties that Russia needs to do that. The Kremlin are understandably very hesitant about mobilising the entire country. It will be politically extremely risky. It would show that this special military operation is not going according to plan. Ukraine’s governor of Mykolaiv, Vitaliy Kim, has posted to Telegram to say that in shelling on his region by Russia in the last 24 hours two civilians have been killed and six injured. He listed damage to residential and commercial premises, particularly in the city of Mykolaiv, the regional capital. This morning Reuters is touting that it has an exclusive that Vladimir Putin’s chief envoy on Ukraine told the Russian leader as the war began that he had struck a provisional deal with Kyiv that would satisfy Russia’s demand that Ukraine stay out of Nato, but Putin rejected it and pressed ahead with his military campaign. It reports that, according to three people close to the Russian leadership, the Ukrainian-born envoy Dmitry Kozak told Putin that he believed the deal he had hammered out removed the need for Russia to pursue a large-scale occupation of Ukraine. Kozak’s recommendation to Putin to adopt the deal is being reported by Reuters for the first time. Putin had repeatedly asserted prior to the war that Nato and its military infrastructure were creeping closer to Russia’s borders by accepting new members from eastern Europe, and that the alliance was nowpreparing to bring Ukraine into its orbit too. Putin publicly said that represented an existential threat to Russia, forcing him to react. But, despite earlier backing the negotiations, Putin made it clear when presented with Kozak’s deal that the concessions negotiated by his aide did not go far enough and that he had expanded his objectives to include annexing swathes of Ukrainian territory, the sources said. The deal was dropped, and on 24 February Russia invaded. Asked for a comment about Reuters’ findings, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said: “That has absolutely no relation to reality. No such thing ever happened. It is absolutely incorrect information.” It should be noted that in November 2021 Peskov described accusations that Russia was preparing to invade Ukraine as a “hollow and unfounded” invention of the western media. Russian oil and gas revenues have fallen to their lowest for almost a year, despite a big rise in prices, according to a report. Bloomberg has reported that the Kremlin’s gains from its fossil fuel resources, which account for more than a third of nation’s budget, fell to 671.9bn roubles ($11.1bn) in August, the lowest since June 2021, using calculations based on Russian finance ministry data. The figure is down 13% from July and is a 3.4% decline from 12 months ago. Russia has probably used Iranian-made uncrewed aerial vehicles in Ukraine for the first time, Britain’s defence intelligence said on Wednesday, after Kyiv reported downing one of the UAVs – a Shahed-136 – on Tuesday. The device is a “one-way attack” weapon, the MoD said, and has been used in the Middle East. The shooting down of the drone near the frontline in Ukraine suggests that Russia is using the weapons as a tactical weapon rather than a strategic one targeting military installations deeper into Ukrainian territory. It added: Russia is almost certainly increasingly sourcing weaponry from other heavily sanctioned states like Iran and North Korea as its own stocks dwindle. Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych held out the prospects of building on the gains made over the weekend in the Kharkiv region by moving on the eastern province of Luhansk, which together with Donetsk is known as the Donbas. “There is now an assault on Lyman and there could be an advance on Siversk,” Arestovych said in a video posted on YouTube. However, the pro-Russian leader of the Donetsk People’s Republic denied the claims and said in a video post that Lyman remains in their hands. “The situation has been stabilised. The enemy naturally is trying to advance in small groups but (Russian-led) Allied forces are fully repelling them.” Any such move by the Ukrainian military would be a very bold one after Zelenskiy spoke about trying to stabilise the huge amount of territory retaken in the region. His comments suggested a safety first approach to avoid being outflanked by counterattacking Russian forces. But it does the question of whether Ukraine can capitalise on its forces momentum and press on and even win the war. With some answers to that big quesdtion, you can read this piece by our diplomatic editor, Patrick Wintour. Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy that “stabilisation measures” were still ongoing in the Kharkiv region in order to consolidate his armed forces’ spectacular gains over the weekend. In an address on Tuesday evening, he said that about 8,000 sq km (3,100 square miles) had been liberated so far, apparently all in the north-eastern region of Kharkiv. “Stabilisation measures” had been completed in about half of that territory, Zelenskiy said, “and across a liberated area of about the same size, stabilisation measures are still ongoing”. He also said that progress had been made towards shoring up international support for Ukraine’s future security. He said: We are working to ensure that the guarantors of our state’s security become the strongest entities in the free world. We have already built together with our partners a powerful anti-war coalition that includes dozens of different countries. And now we are working to turn the most powerful states that are already helping us into a coalition of peace that will last forever. I’m Martin Farrer and welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’ll be bringing you updates for the next hour or so. Here are the main developments you need to know: Ukraine has set its sights on freeing all territory occupied by invading Russian forces after driving them back in a speedy counteroffensive in the north-east. In an address on Tuesday evening, Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said about 8,000 sq km (3,100 square miles) have been liberated so far, apparently all in the north-eastern region of Kharkiv. “Stabilisation measures” had been completed in about half of that territory, Zelenskiy said, “and across a liberated area of about the same size, stabilisation measures are still ongoing”. Major setbacks for Moscow’s forces in Ukraine will further test the “limitless partnership” between Russia and China when Vladimir Putin meets his Chinese counterpart in Uzbekistan on Thursday, analysts say. The meeting scheduled for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in Samarkand, is likely to involve jostling for influence in central Asia, where the two global powers have long waged a “quiet rivalry”. US president Joe Biden said it was hard to tell if Ukraine had reached a turning point in the six-month war. Asked about the situation on Tuesday, he sai: “It’s clear the Ukrainians have made significant progress,” he said. “But I think it’s going to be a long haul.” The White House said the United States is likely to announce a new military aid package for Ukraine in “coming days”. Russian forces have left defensive positions, particularly in and around Kharkiv, the second largest city in Ukraine, a US spokesperson said. Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych held out the prospects of building on the gains by moving on the eastern province of Luhansk, which together with Donetsk is known as the Donbas. “There is now an assault on Lyman and there could be an advance on Siversk,” Arestovych said in a video posted on YouTube. The pro-Russian leader of the Donetsk People’s Republic denied the claims and said in a video post that Lyman remains in their hands. “The situation has been stabilised. The enemy naturally is trying to advance in small groups but (Russian-led) Allied forces are fully repelling them.” Asian shares tumbled in Wednesday’s trading session as a worse-than-expected US inflation report dashed hopes for a peak in the fuel and food inflation that has been partly driven by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The US Federal Reserve bank is now almost certain to raise rates by another 0.75% next week to fulfil its vow of stamping out inflation, meaning more pain for economies facing energy shortages this coming northern winter. The general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces warned that Russian forces were continuing to loot as they withdrew from occupied territories. On a stretch of highway heading into Russian territory, Ukrainian officials spotted civilian vehicles with licence plates from the Kharkiv region, driven by Russian military and weighed down with looted belongings. In the south, there were reports of Russian occupants breaking the gates of private garages and taking cars, as well as removing furniture. Russian forces continued to hit a number of civilian and civilian infrastructure facilities throughout the eastern and southern portions of Ukraine on Tuesday, the general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces said. Via air attacks and missile strikes and high mobility artillery rocket systems, Russian force attacked settlements in the Luhansk oblast and the Donetsk oblast in the east, and the Dnipropetrovsk, Mykolaiv and Cherkasy oblasts in the south."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2020/jul/13/uk-expected-u-turn-huawei-fails-to-satisfy-tory-rebels","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2020-07-13T19:58:33Z","webTitle":"UK's expected U-turn on Huawei fails to satisfy Tory rebels","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jul/13/uk-expected-u-turn-huawei-fails-to-satisfy-tory-rebels","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2020/jul/13/uk-expected-u-turn-huawei-fails-to-satisfy-tory-rebels","fields":{"headline":"UK's expected U-turn on Huawei fails to satisfy Tory rebels","bodyText":"Ministers have failed to head off a rebellion from up to 60 Tory MPs over plans to strip Huawei of its role in the UK’s 5G and broadband networks, amid claims that a proposed U-turn will not go far enough. Oliver Dowden, the culture secretary, is expected to announce a climbdown in the Commons on Tuesday, phasing out the role of the Chinese telecoms giant. It comes after the US and a growing number of MPs raised security concerns over surveillance. A final decision is due to be taken by the National Security Council on Tuesday morning. A source close to the rebels said the expected concessions from ministers were not enough and they “would be beefing up their opposition” unless last-minute changes were brought in. They had wanted ministers to ban the purchase of new Huawei kit in the next 12 months across Britain’s phone networks, and to eliminate it entirely by 2026, but while the government is understood to have moved in this direction, they were not placated. One source said the rebels had heard that while there would be a ban on new Huawei kit from January, they were only going to be offered a removal of 5G Huawei kit from 2027 while other 3G and 4G mobile equipment would remain in place until the 2030s. However, this could not immediately be confirmed. Some believe that the offer is a carefully crafted compromise designed to peel off some of those rebelling and prevent them inflicting a defeat on the government. “It would be interesting to see if there’s a single unified rebel position,” a Whitehall source said. Downing Street has been caught between the growing number of backbenchers who want Huawei banned, backed by Donald Trump’s White House, and companies such as BT and Vodafone that argue a hasty move would cost billions and affect consumers. Economists at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) have warned GDP could fall by up to 0.75% and inflation rise by up to 0.6% if kicking the Chinese company out of the UK prompted a wider trade conflict with Beijing. A letter signed by 10 of the rebel Tory MPs on Monday night – who say they number 60 in total – warned Boris Johnson that their support for a planned telecoms security bill was “predicated on ending altogether the role for high-risk vendors” such as Huawei. The signatories, including the former party leader Iain Duncan Smith, ex-cabinet minister David Davis and Bob Seely, who organised the letter, went on to insist they wanted the government to complete the rip-out of Huawei across 5G and all other phone networks “without unreasonable delay”. Seely said that if Dowden announced a ban on new Huawei equipment purchases in the next 12 months, that would reassure fellow rebels and they would support a complete removal by 2025 or 2026, after the next election. Widening their criticism, the rebels also said China cannot be trusted, accusing Beijing of presiding over “systematic human rights abuses” against its Uighur Muslim minority and “the effective ending of one country, two systems in Hong Kong” through the introduction of a new national security law. Philip Jansen, the chief executive of BT, the largest Huawei customer in the UK, said: “If you want to have no Huawei in the whole of the telecoms infrastructure across the whole of the UK, I think that’s impossible to do in under 10 years.” He added that the industry would want to be given a seven-year window to rip out Huawei from the 5G networks alone but added “we could probably do it in five”. But he warned moving any quicker could put BT’s service at risk. “If we get in a situation where things need to go very fast, then we go into a situation where service for 24 million BT Group mobile customers is put into question – outages would be possible.” NIESR economists said in a report released on Monday they believed China could respond by imposing restrictions, which “would depress GDP and put upward pressure on inflation, so that interest rates would increase”. In the worst-case scenario, it warned that imports and exports could fall by 90% if new trading barriers were erected rapidly, leading to a fall of 0.75% to GDP in 2020 and lifting inflation by 0.6%. Last week China’s ambassador to the UK warned: “You cannot have a golden era if you treat China as an enemy.” Six months ago, Johnson announced plans to cap Huawei at 35% of the overall network for future 5G, while leaving existing investments unaffected. The rebels, who theoretically have enough votes to defeat Johnson despite his 80-seat majority, say the Chinese company represents a long-term surveillance risk to the UK, although Huawei says it is an independent company owned by its employees and had never engaged in spying activities against its customers. They also want the prime minister to eventually go further and remove Chinese companies from their role in the UK’s nuclear programme, where state-owned China General Nuclear Power is a minority investor in the new build at Hinckley Point in Somerset behind France’s EDF. Huawei insiders have resigned themselves to a defeat, although in a last show of defiance aimed at their customers around the world chose to release financial results showing its revenues had jumped by 13.1% in the first six months of the year. Britain is gradually becoming embroiled in a more confrontational stance with China. On Monday night it emerged that military chiefs were considering basing the new £3.1bn Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier in east Asia as one of a number of options for the long term deployment of the flagship vessel, which will make its first grand voyage next year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2020/feb/26/tv-tonight-very-british-history-kevin-mccloud","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2020-02-26T06:20:10Z","webTitle":"TV tonight: an intimate look at life for Britain's Bengali families","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/26/tv-tonight-very-british-history-kevin-mccloud","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/26/tv-tonight-very-british-history-kevin-mccloud","fields":{"headline":"TV tonight: an intimate look at life for Britain's Bengali families","bodyText":"A Very British History 9pm, BBC Four The academic Aminul Hoque has spent his career working on the intersections of immigrant identity.

We need allies to hold the line","bodyText":"The UK and the People’s Republic of China make an odd couple. In the “golden era” of bilateral relations, ushered in by David Cameron, the UK welcomed Chinese companies to invest in critical infrastructure such as 5G and nuclear power plants. But the Chinese ambassador has now threatened Britain with dire consequences if the government were to act upon its more recent second thoughts. Should we take the ambassador’s threat seriously? Yes. When the Australians raised issues about Chinese interference in their politics Beijing responded by restricting imports from Australia. When Canada allowed its courts to deal with a US extradition request against the daughter of Huawei’s founder for a criminal offence, Beijing held two Canadian citizens hostage. Are such reprisals used only against other countries and not the UK? History provides a clear warning. Britain was the first major western democracy to recognise the People’s Republic, in January 1950, less than three months after its foundation. That good will was not reciprocated and the British chargé d’affaires was treated as the “representative to negotiate for the establishment of diplomatic relations” – a supplicant. Beijing only established full diplomatic relations with the UK in March 1972, after the US president, Richard Nixon, visited China. In the early 1950s, British investments in China, greater in value than its investments in Hong Kong, were expropriated, and British companies with operations in China were forced to remit significant additional sums to secure the safe return of UK workers employed there. In 1967, as the Communist party engulfed China in the Cultural Revolution, British diplomats were physically assaulted and the Reuters journalist Anthony Grey was incarcerated in Beijing for more than two years. Among the western great powers, then, the UK was the first to engage positively with the Chinese government under the Communist party. However, it also turned out to be the one most harshly treated before Deng Xiaoping introduced the policy of “reform and opening up” at the end of the 1970s. The Communist party’s preparedness to act tough on the UK far predates President Xi Jinping. How, then, should we understand ambassador Liu Xiaoming’s warning about the British offer of a pathway to citizenship to the British nationals overseas (BNOs) in Hong Kong? BNOs are people who were born in the Crown colony of Hong Kong before 1 July 1997. They are British nationals by birth, though without the right of abode in the UK. No one born in Hong Kong after it became a Chinese special administrative region is entitled to BNO status. Thus, the latest British offer does not apply to Hongkongers who were born Chinese citizens (post 1997). If BNOs who choose to come, live and work in the UK do so for five years without being a charge on the public purse, they will be able to apply for UK citizenship. According to Liu, the British offer is an interference in China’s domestic affairs and one that will be met with consequences. But why should a British offer to end the less advantageous treatment of a group of British nationals be grounds for retaliation by China? Would it be defensible for the UK to threaten China if Beijing announced a policy to accord its Uighur minority the same citizenship rights as its majority Han population? How then should we understand Liu’s offer of friendship to the UK? We should recognise it for what it is. He has offered friendship as long as the UK embraces terms laid down by Beijing, reminiscent of China’s treatment of the UK’s initiative to establish diplomatic relations in the 1950s. It means that we must allow Huawei to build up to 35% of our 5G infrastructure and we are not allowed to change our mind. However, there will be no level playing field between companies, institutions and individuals operating in each other’s territory. While China insists Huawei be allowed to build our critical infrastructure, no British company will be permitted to do anything comparable in China. Likewise, we shall continue to host Confucius Institutes on British university campuses, under the supervision of China’s propaganda department, while accepting that British universities with branches in China will not be allowed to teach constitutional democracy, universal values, civil society, or even free and independent journalism. It also means that we must ignore British law, under which the UK has an obligation to the people of Hong Kong under the Sino-British joint declaration – an international treaty registered at the United Nations and valid until 2047 – simply because Beijing has decided it is a historical relic. It would be wrong for the UK to forsake positive engagement with China. We have never treated the People’s Republic as an enemy and should not do so now. Nor should we abandon our basic values as we engage with China. No amount of trade and investment can justify abandonment of our commitment to the rights and dignity of the individual, the rule of law and democratic principles. The reality remains that upholding our values will result in the UK being punished by China, whose foreign policy aims to make the world safe for authoritarianism – a world in which the Communist party’s hold on power in China cannot be challenged. To face this reality, we must work with our democratic allies to form a united front. Chinese threats to inflict economic pain on an individual democracy become hollow if we all hold the same line and do not allow Beijing to divide and rule. •Steve Tsang is director of the China Institute at SOAS University of London"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2020/feb/02/does-brexit-really-bring-economic-reasons-to-be-cheerful","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2020-02-02T19:03:42Z","webTitle":"Does Brexit really bring economic reasons to be cheerful? | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/02/does-brexit-really-bring-economic-reasons-to-be-cheerful","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2020/feb/02/does-brexit-really-bring-economic-reasons-to-be-cheerful","fields":{"headline":"Does Brexit really bring economic reasons to be cheerful?","bodyText":"Is Larry Elliott the only economist apart from Patrick Minford who believes we are better off outside the EU (Why there are many reasons to be cheerful, 1 February)? His attempt to defend such a calamitous and damaging act flies in the face of virtually all respected expert analysis. Being part of the EU has civilised this country in a way that would have been otherwise unthinkable. Workers’ rights, environmental protection, social and regional development immediately come to mind. Does he truly believe a government led by Boris Johnson is going to unleash allegedly hidden potential and end the north-south divide by loosening state aid rules and taking other measures? More likely we’ll end up as the 51st US state or worse. In any case, Europe is about much more than trade deals and economic performance – it has been the most successful peace project in history, bringing countries and peoples together in a way that was inconceivable in the immediate aftermath of the second world war. Of course, the EU is not perfect but it is far better to be on the inside, making it work better. Emeritus professor David Hunter Richmond, North Yorkshire • Larry Elliott writes that “the UK is one of the world leaders in artificial intelligence and could seize a competitive advantage once it can set its own regulations”. The old illusions are starting to come back. Since the 1950s how many wonderful examples of Britain leading the world have crashed because there was no economic machinery behind them? The world leadership in jet transport is all gone. The first computer was built in Manchester, but where is our computer industry? The first nuclear power station was at Calder Hall. Now the French and Chinese are building our next one. It will be the same for all the wonderous advantages of artificial intelligence. We may be at the point of progress at this moment, but without an economic clout behind it we will see the field taken over by the Americans, the Chinese and probably the Europeans. As members of the EU we could have led the way with 28 modern economies and a 500 million-population market behind us. With us as members the EU could have “seized the competitive advantage and set its own regulations”. But alone we can’t.

The chancellor, Nadhim Zahawi, and the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, will meet gas and electricity bosses as the Treasury considers toughening the 25% levy on the profits of North Sea oil and gas operators announced in May. Since the tax was announced, oil and gas companies have announced even larger profits than previously anticipated. Unions labelled the bumper earnings an “insult to millions” as the cost of living hits households, who are facing bills of more than £4,000 next year. Consumers already owe energy suppliers a record £1.3bn even before bills go up further, according to research from uSwitch. Consumer champion Martin Lewis and the bosses of Octopus Energy and Utilita have called on the government to act urgently to stop what Lewis described as a “national crisis on the scale of the pandemic”. Higher energy costs are expected to push UK inflation, currently at 9.4%, above 13% in coming months. It’s a different picture in the US, where inflation slowed more than expected last month to 8.5% from June’s four-decade high of 9.1%, reflecting lower energy and gasoline costs, while the core rate (excluding food and energy) remained at 5.9%, rather than picking up to 6.1% as forecast. Stocks on Wall Street have rallied and the dollar has fallen sharply as investors are betting that the US Federal Reserve may hike interest rates less aggressively, with signs that inflation has peaked. Our other main stories today: Thank you for joining us today. We’ll be back tomorrow. Take care – JK Just in: The environment secretary George Eustice and environment minister Steve Double met with the CEOs of water companies this morning to discuss their response to the driest summer in more than 50 years. Ministers heard from CEOs about how their companies are taking necessary steps to safeguard public water supplies and mitigate the effects of this exceptionally dry period. Eustice said: All water companies have reassured me that water supplies remain resilient across the country. Each company has a pre-agreed drought plan which they are following, and I have urged them to take any precautionary steps needed to protect essential supplies as we go into a likely very dry autumn. We are better prepared than ever before for periods of dry weather with a system that is working well to manage water usage, protect the environment and maintain water supplies for the public and critical sectors. We will continue to actively monitor the situation, working alongside partners including the Environment Agency. Flight disruption in the UK was the worst in Europe in recent months, according to Tui, while Manchester was the most-affected airport, as the travel operator reported a €75m (£63m) hit from air traffic chaos, writes my colleague Joanna Partridge. “We had significant challenges and interruptions, especially on the UK side,” said Sebastian Ebel, Tui’s incoming chief executive, who will take over the top job at the start of October. “We have never before invested so much into standby aircraft, into wet lease [short-term] capacity, into people to take the calls,” Ebel said. He said the company had not anticipated such levels of disruption as consumer demand for foreign holidays bounced back in the spring after the lifting of coronavirus travel restrictions. Tui blamed labour shortages for the difficulties at Manchester, and added there had also been disruption at Amsterdam airport, which is continuing. Like others, James Knightley, chief international economist at ING, believes that the Fed could still hike interest rates by 75 basis points again at the next meeting in September: A rare pleasant surprise from the CPI [consumer prices index] report with headline inflation dropping to 8.5% year-on-year from 9.1% on lower fuel prices, airline fares, clothing and education costs. Ongoing falls in gasoline will mean the headline rate falls further in August, but core inflation is likely to be stickier due to labour costs and will keep the Fed firmly in tightening mode. It is important to remember that there is another jobs report and another inflation report ahead of the September 21st FOMC meeting. But inflation remains far from target, the economy has added more than half a million jobs last month and third-quarter GDP is set to rebound based on consumer movement data. Add to all that a positive contribution from net trade and a less negative drag from inventories, then the case for a third consecutive 75bp Federal Reserve rate hike in September remains strong. Wall Street has opened higher after the slowdown in US inflation. The Dow Jones jumped 440 points, or 1.3%, to 33,214 at the opening bell, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 70 points, or 1.7%, to 4,193 and the Nasdaq surged 293 points, or 2.4%, to 12,787. In Europe, stock markets are also trading higher. The FTSE 100 index is up 0.2% or 16 points, at 7,505 while Germany’s Dax is 1% ahead, France’s CAC has gained 0.6% and Italy’s FTSE MiB is trading 0.8% higher. The dollar has fallen sharply, with the pound and the euro gaining 1% against the greenback. Investors are betting that the Fed may raise interest rates less aggressively, with signs that inflation has peaked, although it is still way above its target. Michael Metcalfe, head of macro strategy at State Street Global Markets, said: July’s inflation print will be more comforting for the Fed, especially the lower than expected rise in core inflation. This was partly reliant on an outsized fall in airfares and the trend in housing related and medical care inflation is still troubling. Nevertheless, this was a big improvement on June’s data and if repeated in August would take some pressure off the Fed’s September FOMC meeting. Here’s our full story on US inflation: Gas prices eased bringing down the annual rate of inflation to 8.5%, still close to a multi-decade high but lower than the four-decade peak it hit in June. July’s figure, while still high, represents a significant fall from the annual rate of 9.1% recorded in June and will raise hopes that inflation has finally peaked in the US. It follows other indicators that have suggested price rises are finally moderating. But the report showed once again how broadly inflation has spread through the economy. After stripping out food and energy costs – which are highly volatile – prices climbed by 5.9% in the year to the end of July, matching last month’s reading. Mike Bell, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, echoed this. Much will inevitably be made of the fact that US inflation appears to finally be peaking. However, with core inflation still significantly above target, it is far too early for the Fed to declare victory and stop raising rates. With the Atlanta Fed’s measure of wage growth now at 6.7%, core inflation is unlikely to return to anywhere near target until wage pressures moderate significantly. With unemployment at the lowest level in over 50 years and workers demanding pay rises to try to keep up with inflation, it’s hard to see wage growth moderating by enough to return inflation to target without first seeing a rise in unemployment. So while a peak in inflation is welcome news, it’s probably not enough to allow the Fed to ease off its tightening or to put recession fears to bed. Mike Owens, global sales trader at Saxo Markets, has looked at the market reaction. Initial reaction sees US dollar selling off hard down 1% vs the euro and sterling, almost 1.5% vs Japanese yen, showing how it’s caught out the market. Equity futures rally, the sign of a slowing in the rate of inflation offers hope the Federal Reserve’s rate increases won’t need to go as far as previously thought. Both these moves may be short lived if the market returns its attention back to the Fed; one month of data won’t change their current hawkishness as it stands by its mission to force inflation down. US stock futures rose after the data, pointing to a higher open on Wall Street in half an hour. Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics, said: Consumer prices were unchanged in July and there’s a good chance that prices will fall outright in August. With core consumer prices increasing by a more modest 0.3% month-on-month last month, we still think the Fed will hike interest rates by 50bp at the upcoming meeting in September. He has looked at the figures in detail: Gasoline prices fell by 7.7% m/m in July and, with the crude oil price continuing to trend lower, retail gas prices are on track to fall by an even bigger 11% in August. Food prices increased by 1.1% m/m last month, extending a run of very big increases, but this is the next deflationary shoe to drop. The surge in food at home prices has been unusually broad based, with cereal and dairy prices leading the way in July. Nevertheless, in recent weeks there has been a collapse in not just agricultural crop prices, but dairy, egg and chicken futures prices too. There is now a good chance that CPI food at home prices will be falling outright by the time the fall arrives. And turning to core prices, excluding food and energy, they increased by a modest 0.3% month on month in July, helped by a 7.8% drop in airline fares. Clothing prices fell by 0.1%, but household furnishings prices increased by 0.6% and recreation prices increased by 0.2%. Overall, there is little sign that retailers are discounting prices because they’ve been caught with too much inventory. IT commodity prices did decline by 0.8% m/m, however, which reflects the easing of semiconductor shortages. Semiconductor shortages look to be improving for motor vehicles too, with new vehicle prices increasing by a more modest 0.6% m/m and used vehicle prices down by 0.4%. Cyclical price pressures remained high, with owners’ equivalent rent increasing by 0.6% and rent increasing by 0.7%. Even there, however, the alternative measures of rents point to a moderation, albeit one that won’t show up in the CPI for another few months. Overall, with headline inflation still at 8.5% and core inflation at 5.9%, this is not yet the meaningful decline in inflation the Fed is looking for. But it’s a start and we expect to see broader signs of easing price pressures over the next few months. The bigger-than-expected slowdown in US inflation last month to 8.5%, from a 40-year high of 9.1% in June, should take some pressure off the Federal Reserve to continue aggressively hiking interest rates. Prices were unchanged in July from the previous month, according to the US Labor Department. Energy costs fell 4.6% and gasoline prices were down 7.7%, offsetting increases in food and accommodation costs, up 1.1% and 0.5% respectively. The drop in July’s annual inflation rate has raised hopes that US inflation may have peaked. The dollar has fallen on the news, and is trading about 1% lower against both sterling and the euro. US inflation has slowed more than expected, to an annual rate of 8.5%, dropping for the first time since April. It’s down from 9.1% in June, reflecting lower energy prices. Core inflation, which strips out volatile energy and food costs, defied expectations of a pick-up and stayed at 5.9%. This is in stark contrast with the UK, where inflation reached a fresh 40-year high of 9.4% in June. It’s expected to rise above 13% in the coming months, alongside a recession lasting longer than a year, according to the latest Bank of England forecasts. Nadhim Zahawi, the chancellor, has just defended the government’s decision to draw up contingency plans for power cuts this winter in the event of the UK running short of gas. He said he thought the UK would be “in a good place” in terms of energy supply. Speaking on a visit to Belfast, Zahawi said the government was making “all sorts of contingency plans” for what might happen over the winter. He went on: One of the reasons that I think we had one of the most successful vaccine programmes in the world is because we prepared for all sorts of scenarios. I am very, very confident that the work we will do with the energy producers and suppliers will mean we will be in a good place. The pound has hit a two-week low against the euro as investors worry about potential blackouts in Britain. Sterling slipped 0.1% to €1.1818. Businesses and even consumers could face blackouts this winter under government crisis plans as concerns grow over power supplies, it emerged yesterday. Under the government’s latest “reasonable worst case scenario”, officials believe the UK could experience blackouts for several days in January if cold weather combines with gas shortages to leave the country short of power. Concerns are mounting over the toll on households this winter as new forecasts showed annual energy bills are forecast to top £4,200 from January, triggering a warning that Britons face “serious hardship on a massive scale” without government intervention. In less than a quarter of an hour, we’ll be getting the latest US inflation figures, which are expected to show a slight slowdown in the inflation rate to 8.7% in July from 9.1% in June. However, the core rate which strips out food and energy, as they tend to be volatile, is expected to pick up to 6.1% from 5.9%. The Don’t Pay UK campaign group, which is calling on people to stop paying their energy bills from 1 October, says it has attracted more than 97,000 supporters so far. It says it will only take action if one million people sign up. However, charities have warned people of the serious consequences of not paying their bills. Simon Clarke, chief secretary to the Treasury, has tweeted: Liz Truss, the foreign secretary and frontrunner in the Tory leadership contest, has insisted that she is not ruling out giving cash payments to people struggling with their energy bills, reports Andrew Sparrow. In a pooled broadcast interview, shown on Sky News, when she was asking what she would do on this issue, she restated her commitment to cutting the tax burden, by reversing the national insurance increase and removing the green levy from fuel bills, as a priority. But, when she was asked if that meant she was ruling out cash payments in any form (or targeted support, as it could be described), she replied: That’s not what I said. What I said is my priority is making sure we’re not taking money off people and then giving it back to them later on. I believe in people keeping their own money and I believe in a low tax economy. That’s the way we’re going to drive growth. I’m not going to announce the contents of a budget in the future at this stage in August, but I can assure people I will do all I can to make sure that energy is affordable, and that we get through this winter. More on our UK politics live blog. Rocketing inflation has caused a shortfall for UK government departments which need a £44bn cash boost to maintain public services such as the NHS and schools – or 40% of the planned funding increase will be wiped out, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. The government will need to spend an extra £44bn over the next three years on public services to keep pace with rising inflation and avoid steep cuts. In a review of the rising costs facing the public sector, the IFS said that without further funding, Whitehall budgets faced being overwhelmed by rising cost pressures that would force departments to cut staff and services. The government said in its November spending review that it would increase departmental budgets by 3.3% on average above the then inflation rate. But with prices soaring since then, the tax and spending thinktank is forecasting the rise in budgets is now unlikely to be more than 1.9%. Oil prices have drifted lower again today. Brent crude is trading $1.22 lower at $95.08 a barrel while US light crude is down $1.18 at $89.33 a barrel. Oil flows from Russia to central Europe via the Druzhba pipeline were suspended on 4 August after transit fee payments fell foul of sanctions against Moscow, but Hungarian energy group MOL said they could resume within days because it has transferred the transit fee for the use of the Ukrainian section of the pipeline. The suspension drove oil prices higher yesterday. Hungary, which has been critical of EU sanctions against Moscow, said it was working on a solution. MOL said in a statement: By assuming the fee, MOL could provide a swift solution to the issue: the Ukrainian party has pledged to resume the transport of crude oil within a matter of days, which has been halted a few days ago due to technical issues emerging on the banking front. The suspension of pipeline flows had hit Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic, whose ability to import alternative supplies by sea is limited. Ministers will need to at least double the amount of support given last time to help protect the poorest households from rising energy bills, the consumer rights campaigner Martin Lewis said this morning. In February, the then chancellor, Rishi Sunak, now vying for the Tory leadership, announced that eligible UK households would receive a £400 discount to help with energy bills from October, writes the Guardian’s Tobi Thomas. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Lewis said: “We’ve heard mutterings from the Rishi Sunak camp that he would increase the previous handouts that were given … but if he were to be consistent he would have to essentially double every number in that package. “He will effectively need, if he wants to make this work, to double the numbers, especially for the poorest.” The education secretary, James Cleverly, confirmed that crisis talks to “knock some heads together” would take place between energy sector bosses and the government this week. The chancellor, Nadhim Zahawi, and the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, will ask gas and electricity company executives to submit a breakdown of expected profits and payouts as well as investment plans for the next three years. Lewis also criticised proposals from the other Tory leadership contender, Liz Truss, which focused on tax cuts as a way of helping the poorest households. Truss has appeared reluctant to offer further assistance for people to pay their energy bills aside from the tax cuts she has proposed, saying she does not favour “handouts”.

More strikes – this time at an oil refinery run by the chemicals company Ineos, which could have an impact on UK fuel supplies. Around a hundred workers at the Grangemouth oil refinery in central Scotland have walked out in a ‘wildcat strike’ over a pay dispute this morning, STV News is reporting. Maintenance and repairs staff, who are members of the Engineering Construction Industry Association (ECIA) trade union, blocked a road outside the Ineos building which is used as access for tankers getting in and out of the site after they walked out in the face of the rising cost of living. Last year, workers at the refinery agreed to a pay rise of 5% over two years. However, with inflation expected to rise above 13% in coming months, they want to reopen the agreement and negotiate a higher offer. The strike means that maintenance at the refinery could be paused, with production of oil and gas across the country being impacted. The Falkirk-based refinery is owned by Petroineos, formed in 2011 between the state-owned Chinese oil giant PetroChina and Ineos, part of billionaire Jim Ratcliffe’s petrochemical empire. Speaking to STV News last week, one worker said: “This isn’t the path we wanted to go down but we feel like we have no choice now.” An Ineos spokesperson at the Grangemouth site said in a statement emailed to the Guardian: We can confirm that a number of contractors employed by third parties are taking unofficial industrial action at the Ineos Grangemouth site as part of a nationwide protest event. Our manufacturing and fuel distribution operations are unaffected. The site has a very good working relationship with the contracting companies and their employees at Grangemouth, including those operating under the NAECI [National Agreement for the Engineering Construction Industry] agreement. We are disappointed that the protesters have chosen to use the Ineos Grangemouth site as one of their backdrops for their unofficial action today. The Liberal Democrat Leader Ed Davey has warned that tomorrow’s meeting between government ministers and energy companies risks becoming “a pointless talking shop” unless a tougher windfall tax is confirmed. The Liberal Democrats have put forward plans for an expanded windfall tax that could raise around £20bn, four times more than the government’s weaker levy is currently expected to generate. Davey said: There is no time to waste in putting in place a tougher windfall tax, so we can raise extra cash and cancel October’s energy price rise. The Conservative government’s windfall tax has been far too soft on the energy bosses who are making eye-watering profits from this crisis whilst the British public suffer. This meeting cannot afford to be another pointless talking shop. Families and pensioners worrying about how to pay the bills this winter need a clear plan now. On what must be done to protect consumers from falling into debt, Jayne Gardner, Partner at Shakespeare Martineau, a debt lawyer who works with energy providers, said: There isn’t a magic “fix-all” which can be implemented to solve the surging energy prices and the rising cost of living – energy providers, with one arm tied behind their backs, are doing what they can to help customers. Ofgem have recognised that providers have little-to-no decision making power on the price of energy, with the huge increase in the wholesale costs of energy (as a result of the Ukraine crisis) that is driving the increase in bills. For the most part, the ball is Ofgem’s court to implement changes for the benefit of both customers and providers. One positive regulatory change being considered is to update price caps quarterly in line with current wholesale energy costs – meaning that, if wholesale prices fall, caps will be downwards and therefore passing on price reductions benefit to customers more quickly than the current six months. Ultimately though, what the sector needs is government intervention to reduce the wholesale price of gas and electricity. The coming year will be tough, and with the October cap rise, the situation for both providers and consumers alike is likely to get worse before it gets better. While the Treasury’s Energy Bill Support Scheme granting £400 towards energy bills for all domestic electricity customers will score political points for the Government, many will be left scratching their heads wondering why those who are financially comfortable and able to pay their bills are granted the same support as those most vulnerable, where financial support will go the furthest. Poorly insulated homes will pay £1,000 to £2,000 more this winter than better-rated homes, according to new analysis by the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, a non-profit group. With the dual fuel price cap forecast to reach £3,958 this winter, the group found homes rated band F on the Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) system, a measure of the home’s efficiency, are set to have a gas bill £968 higher than a home rated band C, the government’s target for 2035. The average home in the UK is rated band D and these homes will pay £420 more for their gas this winter, compared to a band C home. Wholesale gas costs are set to have added around £2,500 to energy bills during the gas crisis. This includes electricity, as high wholesale gas prices have a knock-on effect in the power market as some electricity is still generated from gas, and the current market design means that has also sets the price for some other generators. When gas and electricity bills are taken together, those living in the worst rated homes will pay almost £2,000 extra compared to EPC band C, and the average EPC band D homes will pay almost £600 extra. Jess Ralston, senior analyst at ECIU said: These stark differences between highly insulated and poorly insulated homes show the real-world impacts insulation could have in time to dent exorbitant bills this winter. The most vulnerable, such as the elderly, tend to live in colder homes and these are the groups that are being placed at risk by inaction from the government on energy efficiency. The ECO insulation scheme has worked well and is knocking at least £600 a year off the bills of fuel poor households, but government is non-committal on doing more. We have to consider security of supply too, but more UK gas won’t come online anytime soon, so insulation is our best bet to shield us from the whims of Putin and lower bills during this cost of living crisis and each year after. EDF is suing the French government for €8.3bn (£7bn) after the president, Emmanuel Macron, forced the nuclear energy firm to sell energy at a loss. The French government extended a price cap in January to protect consumers and businesses from the rocketing cost of energy, forcing EDF to sell power below market prices. The 84%-state-owned company has filed a compensation claim with the Conseil d’Etat, the French administrative supreme court, over “losses incurred” as a result of the price cap. EDF, which is in the process of being fully nationalised, said it had lost €8.3bn to date and suggested the price cap could cost it €15bn over the full year. In addition, EDF has had to power down some sites temporarily near the Rhône and Garonne rivers as heatwaves push up river temperatures, restricting its ability to use river water to cool the plants. Under French rules, the company can’t discharge water above certain temperatures back into the rivers because this could harm wildlife. But at the start of this week, France’s nuclear power regulator extended temporary waivers allowing five power stations to continue discharging hot water into rivers. The ASN watchdog approved a government request for the waivers introduced in mid July to be prolonged at the Bugey, Saint Alban, Tricastin, Blayais and Golfech power plants. Half of EDF’s 56 nuclear reactors have been offline due to planned maintenance and work to repair corrosion which was delayed by the pandemic, just as Europe faces an energy crunch following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. As a result of the maintenance work, the French nuclear giant estimates its power output this year will be the lowest in more than three decades. The company recently reported a first-half loss of €5.3bn. The energy network operator E.ON has slashed the value of its investment in the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline by about €700m (£592m), as a result of “increased uncertainties” following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, reports my colleague Joanna Partridge. The German utility firm had said in March that its 15.5% stake – which E.ON holds indirectly via its pension fund – had a book value of €1.2bn, so its revaluation represents a 58% decline in value. The company Nord Stream owns and operates two pipelines that each stretch 1,224km (761 miles), to bring natural gas from Russia to Germany. Germany halted the certification process for the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline in late February, days before Russia’s full invasion of its neighbour, after Moscow granted recognition to the self-proclaimed republics of Luhansk and Donetsk in east Ukraine. E.ON’s chief executive, Leonhard Birnbaum, said: “The current energy crisis finally makes clear that Europe needs to transform its energy system. To be independent of Russian gas. To ensure supply security.” At the release of its last annual results in March, E.ON warned of the “valuation risks for investments”, including its stake in Nord Stream 1, which is majority-owned by Russian state energy firm Gazprom. The flow of gas to Europe through Nord Stream 1 has reduced to about 20% of the pipeline’s usual capacity in recent weeks, half the amount that had been delivered since service resumed after maintenance work. Here’s our full story on the meeting between the chancellor and business secretary and energy company bosses tomorrow to discuss measures to tackle the rocketing cost of living. Annual energy bills are forecast to rise above £4,000 in January. The tax cuts proposed by Liz Truss, the favourite contender to become the new prime minister, are not enough and without more support measures could “leave millions destitute and in danger this winter,” consumer champion Martin Lewis warned this morning. A Treasury source told the Sun, which first reported news of the meeting: “If you look back at what these firms were projected to make and what they actually brought in, it was beyond their wildest expectations. We are looking at options to go further and faster on those profits.” The government has also floated the idea of extending the tax to electricity generators, although Boris Johnson later rejected the proposal. Lord Howard, former Conservative party leader, was also speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. And here is the full interview with Octopus Energy boss Greg Jackson, who called on the government to double support measures aimed at helping people with rocketing energy bills. But last night, Liz Truss said she rejects the “Gordon Brown economics” of helping people directly with bills as her rival, Rishi Sunak, warned the British people “will not forgive us” if vulnerable households do not get extra help this winter, writes our chief political correspondent Jessica Elgot. At the latest Conservative hustings, the former chancellor said he would not be prepared to spend sums similar to the help offered earlier this year, and that support should be more targeted. He said: “I don’t think that will be necessary because what we are talking about now … is the extra increase on top of what we thought. “It’s right that we target that on the people who most need our help.” He also admitted that despite his 5p cut to fuel duty, people were “not feeling it at the pumps” and said further help was going to be needed for the most vulnerable. Speaking at the hustings in Darlington, which was dominated by questions on rising energy bills, Truss said she did not believe in using further taxation to boost government help. “The first thing we should do as Conservatives is help people have more of their own money. What I don’t support is taking money off people in tax and then giving it back to them in handouts. That to me is Gordon Brown economics.” But Cleverly didn’t offer details of what the government might do to help households with rocketing energy bills. Boris Johnson waded into the Tory leadership row over energy costs last night by declaring he was “absolutely certain” his successor will offer further help to households, as average annual bills are now forecast to top £4,200 by January, write the Guardian’s Rowena Mason and Alex Lawson. Johnson made an unexpected intervention on energy bills at a No 10 reception, as Liz Truss, the frontrunner to be the next prime minister, was accused by Rishi Sunak’s campaign of being “divorced from reality” over her refusal to commit to more handouts. Johnson has repeatedly refused to act on rocketing gas and electricity bills before leaving office on 5 September, but said he was sure the next prime minister “will be wanting to make some more announcements in September/October about what we’re going to do further to help people in the next period in December/January”. He added: “I just want you to know that I’m absolutely confident that we will have the fiscal firepower and the headroom to continue to look after people as we’ve done throughout.” Government ministers are to meet energy companies on Thursday as the Treasury considers toughening the 25% levy on the profits of North Sea oil and gas operators announced in May. Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi and business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng will meet energy bosses to discuss soaring energy bills for households, at a time when oil and gas companies are raking in billions of pounds in profits. Education secretary James Cleverly, an ally of Liz Truss, told ITV’s Good Morning Britain that the chancellor and business secretary were “calling in” the leaders of the big energy companies to “knock some heads together” and “hold them to account about what they’re going to do with those profits”. What we need to do is make sure that we have a short, medium and long term plan, so the chancellor and the business secretary are getting those energy companies in as part of the short-term response. Households face average energy bills of more than £4,000 bills a year from January. Speaking on BBC radio 4’s Today programme, Cleverly said in the short term, a “targeted support package for people that need help the most” is needed. Consumer champion Martin Lewis, founder of moneysavingexpert.com, is on the radio now. He said for every £100 a month that people pay on direct debit for their energy bills now, that will go up to £181 probably at the end of August, before the new prime minister is in place, and rise again to £215 in January. Sitting down with the energy companies is the right thing to do but ultimately it is government and government alone that can make the decision to stop the terrible cataclysmic risk millions of people in our nation face this winter and it needs to do it soon. He said with the difference in the energy price cap likely to double between April and January, the chancellor should also double all the figures in his support package. Liz Truss, the frontrunner to become prime minister, has pledged tax cuts, but Lewis said: Tax cuts will not help the millions of the poorest in society tax cuts will not help the millions of the poorest in society who are making the choice between heating and eating. That just will not help them because they don’t pay tax. Tax cuts are not going to help the poorest pensioners, it’s not going to help those on universal credit. The dropping the green levy is a sticking plaster on a gaping wound. It’s £150. By the time we get to January, some people will see their bills go from £800 to £4,200 on the same use. This is a national crisis on the scale we saw in the pandemic. If it’s just tax cuts and the green levy, then we’re going to leave millions destitute and in danger this winter and that cannot happen in our country. Greg Jackson, the founder and chief executive of Octopus Energy, said the government needs to improve its offer of a £400 discount to households, a package that cost £16bn. He told Radio 4’s Today programme: If the £16bn package was right previously then clearly it’s not sufficient now and we need to look at a similarly significant assistance from the government for this winter. Question: Do you think the government is on it right now? Clearly we’re in a state of flux with the government and this needs to be the absolute top item in the intray of an incoming prime minister. Tackling energy bills is critical to ensure people can get through this winter. It’s counter inflationary if it’s done right. Question: How is it counter inflationary? If support is given on the bills through wholesale market mechanisms, then energy makes less of a contribution to inflation and that is obviously doubly beneficial. It’s going to help people through the winter when we need it and it’s going to help tackle inflation. In an ordinary year, the energy company might spend £1.5bn on the energy it buys to supply its customers, he said. At current prices, it’s more like £9bn. “There is no company that can tackle this problem alone.” The increases are going to be unmanageable for so many without the right support from the government and it’s beyond what any one company can do. Derek Lickorish, chairman of the energy supplier Utilita Energy and former chair of the government’s committee on fuel poverty, is calling for a “social tariff” funded by the Treasury to help the poorest in society. Speaking on the Today programme, he said: The situation is absolutely dire and I am astonished that we don’t see the two political contenders for prime minister declare a unity of purpose over this issue along with the current prime minister and start sorting it out. We have to do something very profound, we have to do it quickly because all the time we’re sitting here the clock is ticking and the price of gas keeps on increasing. When Rishi Sunak announced the last package of measures to help, the closing price of gas on 26 May was 237p a therm. The day before yesterday the price of gas closed on the market at 463p a therm. That’s gone up 90%. The time has come to put in place a social tariff to help the poorest in society and get on with it. And if we were to get on with it now we could have it in place by 1 January and we need dramatically the help that customers need for this winter and that looks like another £800 to £1,000 and then actually fix the problem for the fuel poor and vulnerable which looks to be 10m households. It has to be a properly funded social tariff by the Treasury. That will cause more borrowing but is essential if we are to take the stress out of it for the poorest. Liz Truss is talking about tax cuts, but Lickorish said the 4.5m of the poorest households who earn less than £12,500 a year don’t pay any tax so would not benefit, nor would those on benefits. Emma from Kent was on BBC radio 4’s Today programme, talking about how she’d been trying to clear her energy debt and saying that things would become “unbearable for so many families”. As much as I’ve paid off a fair amount so far, I’m not going to be able to clear the outstanding amount before winter comes. With the energy prices going up in October and then even more so in January this winter is going to be tough. I was working towards a better future and hopefully not repeating the Christmases we’ve had for the past two years. Last Christmas we were averaging a food shop once every 10 weeks if we could… I was hoping that with us both working full-time we wouldn’t have to go back to a food bank. I guess never say never. It’s going to be unbearable for so many families and to be honest I’m dreading it. Good morning, and welcome to our live, rolling coverage of business, economics and financial markets. UK households owe £1.3bn to their energy suppliers, two months before bills are set to soar by more than 80%. The overall debt bill is already three times higher than it was a year ago, experts at Uswitch said today, and it seems likely it will grow further over the winter. Six million homes across the UK owe an average of £206 to their energy provider, according to the uSwitch report. In April the same average debt was £188. Normally at this time of year people build up credit to help even out heating bills during the winter months. Th energy regulator Ofgem is expected to hike the price cap on energy bills to £3,582 a year for the average household from October, according to a new forecast. Analysts at Cornwall Insight predicted further rises, to £4,266 in January and then £4,427 from the start of April. Justina Miltienyte, head of policy at uSwitch, said: Energy debt has hit an all-time high with the worst possible timing, turning this winter’s energy price hike into a deeply precarious situation for many households. This is an alarming situation, as summer is traditionally a time when households are using less power for heating, which helps bill payers to build up energy credit ahead of the winter. Markets are waiting for the latest US inflation figures for July, out at lunchtime. We are expecting inflation to ease to 8.7% from 9.1%, largely due to recent sharp falls in gasoline and other energy prices. However the bigger concern is around core prices, which exclude volatile items like food and energy and are expected to rise at an annual rate of 6.1%, up from 5.9%. In Germany, final figures show that inflation eased to 7.5% in July from 7.6% in June, but remained high. The €9 rail ticket offered for unlimited travel and the fuel discount had a downward effect on the rate, as did the removal of the EEG renewables surcharge in July, said Destatis, the German statistics office. In China, consumer price inflation is rising at the fastest rate since July 2020, at an annual pace of 2.7% last month, pushed up by higher pork prices. Food prices rose 6.3% compared with a 2.9% uptick in June. Pork prices jumped 20.2%, reversing a 6% decline in June as production slowed. Factory gate prices eased to a 17-month low, however, despite global cost pressures, as slower domestic construction weighed on demand for raw materials. China’s producer price index rose 4.2% year-on-year, down from 6.1% in June, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. Producer prices fell 1.3% in July from June, the first monthly drop since January, with the biggest falls in the price of metals and petrochemicals. This is giving Chinese policymakers room to stimulate the flagging economy, in stark contrast to central banks elsewhere that are scrambling to rein in rampant inflation with aggressive interest rate hikes even as recession looms.

Millions of Australians have woken up today to new freedoms after 106 days of lockdown. Greater Sydney reopened at 12:01 am on Monday as stay-at-home orders were lifted across NSW. This comes after the state reached its milestone of 70% of the over-16 population fully vaccinated last week. Gyms, cafes, restaurants, pools, shops, hairdressers and beauticians can now reopen, people can have 10 people over to their home, gather in groups of 30 people outdoors in public, and travel more than 5km from their home. But these new freedoms are only available to the fully vaccinated and those who have a medical exemption. Here is a round up of today’s key Covid-19 lines: UK Health Security Agency chief executive Dr Jenny Harries has warned that people who catch flu and Covid at the same time this winter are twice as likely to die than those who only have coronavirus. Harries also said that it’s hard to predict what the next chapter of the pandemic will look like in the UK, as immunity from vaccines wanes among older people. More than 2 million people have been given the coronavirus booster jab in England so far. The first minister of Wales, Mark Drakeford, expects the country’s Covid pass, working from home, and the mask mandate to continue into next year. Police in Italy arrested 12 people including the leaders of the far-right Forza Nuova party on Sunday, following clashes in Rome a day earlier over government attempts to make Italy’s Covid-19 “Green Pass” mandatory for all workers. Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan, the man regarded as the “father of Pakistan’s nuclear bomb”, has died at 85 after being hospitalised with Covid-19. The prime minister of Australia, Scott Morrison, backed plans to fast-track the resumption of international travel as soon as New South Wales’ home quarantine program is ready. Sydney is opening up on Monday after over 100 days in lockdown. Malaysia on Sunday lifted interstate and international travel restrictions for residents fully vaccinated against Covid-19, as the country achieved its target of inoculating 90% of the adult population, Reuters reports. Three people have been arrested in Egypt for dumping thousands of unused Covid-19 vaccines along a water channel in the Nile Valley city of Minya, Reuters reports. Egypt’s public prosecution office - which is responsible for investigating criminal complaints - said on Sunday it had ordered the arrest after 18,400 vaccine packages valued at over 5 million Egyptian pounds ($319,000) were reported missing. An inventory check showed that an additional 5,000 vaccine packages were also missing from Minya’s health directorate after being stored at improper temperatures, the prosecution office said. It is unclear what type of vaccines the packages contained, but an earlier statement from Egyptian authorities said they were Sinopharm. New research shows Covid-19 has exacerbated the gap in life expectancy between England’s richest and poorest people. The difference in expected lifespan between some of the wealthiest and poorest areas across the country has more than doubled since the early 2000s, a Guardian analysis of data by the King’s Fund shows. Coronavirus has exacerbated England’s north-south divide and the “deprivation divide” in life expectancy, said Veena Raleigh, an epidemiologist at King’s Fund who studies health inequalities. The new data follows a report from last week by a group of doctors, statisticians and NHS leaders, which found that male and female life expectancy fell by 1.3 years and 0.9 years respectively in 2020 as a result of the pandemic. After over 100 days of lockdown, millions of vaccinated Sydney residents will emerge from their homes on Monday and be welcomed into restaurants, gyms, beauty salons and public pools. 72.8% of people aged 16 and over are now fully-vaccinated in New South Wales. An outbreak of the Delta variant which started in June has kept the state’s five million residents under a strict stay at home order for some 15 weeks. Taking their cues from the UK, Australians have labelled Monday “Freedom day.” NSW recorded 477 new locally acquired cases of Covid-19 in the last 24 hours. Canada is bracing for staffing shortages in its health and aged care sectors, as workers quit or are being dismissed due to vaccine mandates, Reuters reports. Federal employees are required to show proof of their full vaccination status in Canada by the end of the month, or they’ll face unpaid leave, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced Wednesday. One long-term care home in Toronto was forced to put 36% of its workforce on unpaid leave last week because they were still unvaccinated, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reported. Federal employees make up roughly 8% of Canada’s total workforce according to the country’s Treasury. Starting Monday, British Columbia will be the latest Canadian province to begin placing healthcare staff on administrative leave if they haven’t received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine. Russia will temporarily suspend test-firing rocket engines in one of the country’s space manufacturing plants to save oxygen supplies for Covid-19 patients, Reuters reports. At various stages throughout the pandemic liquid oxygen has been redirected from rocket launch pads and design centres to boost hospital supplies. “In view of growing demand for medical oxygen to treat the sick, today we decided to suspend test firing rocket engines at Voronezh’s Chemical Automatics Design Bureau ranges until the end of the month,”Dmitry Rogozin, the head of Russia’s space agency tweeted. Russia is dealing with a surge in Covid-19 cases and deaths. Its coronavirus task force reported on Saturday that 968 people had died of the virus within 24-hours, a new daily record. The UK Government’s latest Covid-19 figures are out. As of Sunday, a further 38 people have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus, bringing the UK’s total death toll to 137,735. 34,574 new lab-confirmed cases were also recorded, the government said. By comparison, 34,950 new cases and 133 deaths were reported Saturday. Sunday’s figures do not include data from Wales. Tea-party firebrand and Republican candidate for governor of Texas Allen West has been hospitalised with Covid-19. In a Facebook post Saturday the former Florida Congressman announced he had pneumonia caused by coronavirus and warned that he was “probably going to be admitted to the hospital.” His wife, Angela West, has also tested positive and the two say they are receiving antibodies. According to his social media accounts, West has not been vaccinated against the virus, but his wife has. He vehemently opposes vaccine mandates and has promised to “crush anyone” who tries to enforce them in Texas.

If you think I’m missing anything, please get in touch via the comments section below. Here is a round up of the day so far: People who catch flu and Covid at the same time this winter are twice as likely to die than those who only have coronavirus, according to the UK Health Security Agency chief executive, Dr Jenny Harries. Harries said it is not the case that 120 deaths a day in the UK is seen as an “acceptable death rate” for Covid and added the difficulty now is in predicting what is to come with Covid-19, as immunity from vaccines wanes in some older people. More than 2 million people have been given the coronavirus booster jab in England so far. The first minister of Wales, Mark Drakeford, expects the country’s Covid pass, working from home, and the mask mandate to continue into next year. The policymaker Michael Saunders has added to signs the Bank of England might become the first major central bank to raise rates since the coronavirus pandemic struck. Police in Italy said on Sunday they had arrested 12 people including the leaders of the extreme right-wing party Forza Nuova, after clashes in Rome a day earlier over a government drive to make the Covid-19 “Green Pass” mandatory for all workers. Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan, the man regarded as the “father of Pakistan’s nuclear bomb”, has died aged 85 after being hospitalised with Covid-19. The prime minister of Australia, Scott Morrison, has backed plans to fast-track the resumption of international travel as soon as New South Wales’ home quarantine program is ready. Malaysia on Sunday lifted interstate and international travel restrictions for residents fully vaccinated against Covid-19, as the country achieved its target of inoculating 90% of its adult population, Reuters reports. Italian police said on Sunday they had arrested 12 people including the leaders of the extreme right-wing party Forza Nuova, after clashes in Rome a day earlier over a government drive to make the Covid-19 “Green Pass” mandatory for all workers, Reuters reports. Draghi introduced the pass – a digital or paper certificate confirming its holder has either received at least one vaccine dose, has tested negative or has recently recovered from the virus – in the summer to help prevent infections and encourage people to get vaccinated. The certificates were initially needed to enter many cultural and leisure venues, but their scope has gradually been widened. Last month, the government made it compulsory for all workers. Thousands of people took to the streets of the Italian capital on Saturday to oppose the move. Some tried to break past police in riot gear guarding access to Prime Minister Mario Draghi’s office, while a separate group broke into the headquarters of Italy’s main CGIL trade union and turned its offices upside down. Overnight, dozens of protesters also tried to break into the accident and emergency unit at Rome’s Policlinico Umberto I hospital, where one of them was being kept for treatment, forcing health workers to barricade themselves inside, emergency department head Francesco Pugliese told reporters on Sunday. “It was a fascist squad attack, and it is unacceptable,” CGIL’s head Maurizio Landini said on Sunday, speaking to supporters in front of the union offices in Rome. The riots drew widespread condemnation, including from Matteo Salvini and Giorgia Meloni, the leaders of the rightist League and Brothers of Italy parties, respectively. The police said in a statement that 38 police officers were injured during the Rome anti-vax clashes. More than 80% of all Italians over the age of 12 have been fully vaccinated as of 10 October. Dr Jenny Harries, the chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency, was doing media rounds this morning. My colleague Maya Wolfe-Robinson has covered the key points from her appearances. She writes: People who catch flu and Covid at the same time this winter are twice as likely to die than those who only have coronavirus, according to the UK Health Security Agency chief executive, Dr Jenny Harries. The former deputy chief medical officer for England warned that the UK faces an “uncertain” winter – with both flu and Covid-19 circulating for the first time – and urged people to take up both the coronavirus and flu jabs if eligible. Asked how worried the public should be about flu this winter, she told Sky’s Trevor Phillips On Sunday: “We should be worried about flu each winter. I think people still don’t realise it can be a fatal disease. “But I think the important thing about this winter is, we are likely to see flu, for the first time in any real numbers, co-circulating with Covid. So the risks of catching both together still remain. And if you do that, then early evidence suggests that you are twice as likely to die from having two together than just having Covid alone. “So I think it’s an uncertain winter ahead – that’s not a prediction, it’s an uncertain feature – but we do know that flu cases have been lower in the previous year so immunity and the strain types are a little more uncertain,” she said. Read more here: Getting flu with Covid doubles risk of death, says UK health chief The first minister of Wales, Mark Drakeford, expects the country’s Covid pass, working from home, and the mask mandate to continue into next year. Speaking to Tom Swarbrick on LBC on Sunday he said: “Mask-wearing in crowded public places, continuing to ask people to work from home, a Covid pass for high-risk locations – that is the suite of measures we hope will see us through this autumn and winter without needing to do anything else, but I do expect they will continue into the early part of next year.” The policymaker Michael Saunders has added to signs the Bank of England might become the first major central bank to raise rates since the coronavirus pandemic struck. Saunders has warned households to get ready for “significantly earlier” interest rate rises as inflation pressure mounts in the British economy. Saunders said investors were right to bet on faster increases in borrowing costs with consumer price inflation on course to rise above 4%, adding to signs the Bank might become the first major central bank to raise rates since the coronavirus pandemic struck. “I’m not in favour of using code words or stating our intentions in advance of the meeting too precisely. The decisions get taken at the proper time,” Saunders said in a an interview with the Telegraph. “But markets have priced in over the last few months an earlier rise in Bank rate than previously and I think that’s appropriate.” Read more here: Bank of England official warns of potential early interest rate rise Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan, the man regarded as the “father of Pakistan’s nuclear bomb”, has died aged 85 after being hospitalised with Covid-19, the BBC reports. Khan was hailed as a national hero for transforming his country into the world’s first Islamic nuclear power. But he was also notorious for having smuggled nuclear secrets to states including North Korea and Iran. Prime Minister Imran Khan said Pakistan had lost a “national icon”. Italy has reached the target of fully vaccinating 80% of the population over the age of 12 against Covid-19, according to official data, achieving a goal Rome had set as a safety cut-off point, Reuters reports. According to a government website showed 43,229,551 people over-12, out of a total population of around 60 million, had completed their vaccination cycle as of 10 October. The 80% target was set by special commissioner for the Covid emergency, Gen Francesco Paolo Figliuolo, in March and was hit late on 9 October. “That’s a critical level above which experts say - and the trend we’ve been recording for weeks confirms this – that the risk of hospitalisation is drastically reduced”, the commissioner’s office said. Italy was a harbinger for Europe in the first wave of the pandemic in early 2020 with the rest of the continent watching on in horror as they realised what was unfolding in Italy was soon to befall on their own shores. Staying with Dr Jenny Harries, she said it is not the case that 120 deaths a day is seen as an “acceptable death rate” for Covid. She told The Andrew Marr Show: “Clearly we’ve got large vaccination programmes ongoing, we’ve got significant testing. “This isn’t how we normally treat an endemic disease so I think the answer to that is very clearly no. We’re taking it extremely seriously. “But it is important to remember that for an average flu season it’s about 11,000 deaths a year – it’s somewhere between four [thousand] to 22,000 over the last four to five years. “So we are starting to move to a situation where, perhaps Covid is not the most significant element and many of those individuals affected will of course have other comorbidities which will make them vulnerable to serious illness for other reasons as well.” Staying with the UK Health Security Agency chief executive, Dr Jenny Harries, she told The Andrew Marr Show on BBC One that the difficulty now is in predicting what is to come with Covid-19, as immunity from vaccines wanes in some older people. She said: “We’ve obviously had extremely good vaccine uptake and that is now preventing very significant amounts of hospitalisation and death.” She added: “Probably the difficulty is at this point in the pandemic, it’s one of the most difficult times to predict what will come. “We have different levels of vaccination, we have a little bit of immunity waning in older individuals, which is why we’re now starting to put in a Covid booster vaccine. “We have slightly different effectiveness in different vaccinations that have been provided.” The UK Health Security Agency chief executive, Dr Jenny Harries, has said that this year there could be a “multi-strain flu” and encouraged everyone who is eligible to ensure they take up the offer of both their coronavirus and flu jabs. She told Sky: “The difference here is because we have, if you like, skipped a year almost with flu, it’s possible we might see multi-strain flu. “We usually get one strain predominating. We look to the southern hemisphere, who hits winter sooner than we do. “We work with WHO [the World Health Organization] and then take JCVI [the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation] advice to know which strains to include in the vaccine each year, and there are four in there. “So we’ve got a pretty good array in our toolbox to try and hit whichever one becomes dominant but it could be more than one this year, and people’s immunity will be lower. “So I think the real trick here is to get vaccinated – in both Covid and flu – but obviously to continue to do those good hygiene behaviours that we’ve been practising all through Covid.” The UK faces an “uncertain” winter, with the presence of both flu and Covid-19, a health chief has said. The UK Health Security Agency chief executive, Dr Jenny Harries, said there is lower immunity to flu this year. Asked how worried the public should be about flu this winter, she told Sky’s Trevor Phillips On Sunday: “We should be worried about flu each winter. I think people still don’t realise it can be a fatal disease. Recent studies suggest that about 25% of us don’t actually understand that. On average, over the last five years, about 11,000 people have died with flu-related conditions. “But I think the important thing about this winter is, we are likely to see flu, for the first time in any real numbers, co-circulating with Covid. “So the risks of catching both together still remain. And if you do that, then early evidence suggests that you are twice as likely to die from having two together, than just having Covid alone. “So I think it’s an uncertain winter ahead – that’s not a prediction it’s an uncertain feature – but we do know that flu cases have been lower in the previous year so immunity and the strain types are a little more uncertain.” Malaysia on Sunday lifted interstate and international travel restrictions for residents fully vaccinated against Covid-19, as the country achieved its target of inoculating 90% of its adult population, Reuters reports. Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob said the government has agreed to allow fully vaccinated Malaysians to travel overseas without applying for permission. The new rules take effect on Monday. The government is preparing to shift into an endemic Covid-19 phase where it will not impose wide lockdowns again if cases rise, Ismail Sabri told a news conference. The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, has backed plans to fast-track the resumption of international travel as soon as New South Wales’ home quarantine program is ready. In a Facebook livestream on Sunday, the prime minister said he had had discussions with NSW premier Dominic Perrottet about bringing forward the start date of international travel for fully vaccinated people. Morrison has previously said states would be allowed to reopen to international travellers in mid-November once their 80% vaccination targets had been met. His comments come after Perrottet said earlier on Sunday that he wanted to resume international travel “as quickly as possible”, flagging that a home quarantine program for fully-vaccinated people could begin as soon as the end of this month.

Booster jabs are being given at least six months after a second dose. NHS England said on Saturday that three weeks after the booster programme began, a total of 2.08m top-ups have been administered. It said these include third jabs given as boosters, and doses given to those people with severely weakened immune systems who might not have mounted a strong response to their initial jabs.

Here’s where we stand: The US secretary of state, Anthony Blinken, told Volodymyr Zelenskiy the war with Russia was in a “pivotal moment” as Ukraine’s military continues its counteroffensive in the south of the country. AP reports that Blinken told Zelenskiy: “We know this is a pivotal moment, more than six months into Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, as your counteroffensive is now under way and proving effective.” Blinken’s surprise trip to Kyiv came after the United States unveiled nearly $2.7bn (£2.4bn) in new military support to Ukraine and other European countries threatened by Russia. Blinken travelled in secret on his second trip to Kyiv since the Russian invasion began in February. Blinken approved $2bn in foreign military financing, a programme in which the US offers loans or grants to other nations to buy US-produced weapons. This amount comes on top of the announcement by the defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, of another $675m in military assistance that includes more arms, ammunition and supplies for Himars, the precision-guided rockets that can hit targets as far as 80km (50 miles) away. Poland and the Baltic states have announced they will temporarily restrict access for Russian citizens holding EU visas. The prime ministers of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland said in a statement that the move had been taken to address “public policy and security threats” arising from the “substantial and growing influx of Russian citizens” into the EU. “We believe that this is becoming a serious threat to our public security and to the overall shared Schengen area,” they said. The measures are expected to come into force by 19 September, and will “restrict the entry into the Schengen area for Russian citizens travelling for tourism, culture, sport and business purposes”. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy paid tribute to Queen Elizabeth II who has died at the age of 96. He said on Twitter: “It is with deep sadness that we learned of the death of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. On behalf of the people, we extend sincere condolences to the @RoyalFamily, the entire United Kingdom and the Commonwealth over this irreparable loss. Our thoughts and prayers are with you.” Ukraine has now recaptured more than 700 sq km (270 sq miles) of territory in Kharkiv and in the south, according to a Ukrainian general. Speaking at a public briefing, Brig Gen Oleksiy Gromov said Ukrainian forces had advanced as far as 50km (31 miles) into Russian lines and retaken more than 20 villages. The comments are the most detailed public assessment so far of Ukraine’s counter-offensive. Ukraine has struck over 400 Russian targets with Himars rocket systems supplied by the United States, Reuters reports. Gen Mark Milley, the chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, told reporters at Ramstein airbase in southern Germany: “We are seeing real and measurable gains from Ukraine in the use of these systems. For example, the Ukrainians have struck over 400 targets with the Himars and they’ve had devastating effect.” Norway said it will donate approximately 160 Hellfire missiles to Ukraine as well as launching pads and guidance units. During the meeting of 40 allied defence departments at the Ramstein base in Germany, Norwegian defence minister Bjørn Arild Gram said his country would also supply Ukraine with night-vision equipment, adding that Kyiv had requested the weapons, reports AP. Two people have been killed and four have been injured by Russian shelling in the Donetsk region, according to the office of the prosecutor general of Ukraine. A post on Facebook said there had been “massive shelling” in the central part of the city of Bakhmut on Thursday, and that the shells had come from the Soviet-designed Uragan rocket system. It added that a woman had also died near her home after shelling in the town of Toretska in the New York region. Ukraine’s top military chief has claimed responsibility for an attack on Russia’s Saky airbase in Crimea last month. It marks the first official acknowledgment from Kyiv that it was behind the strike, which destroyed at least nine Russian aircraft at the site. About 51,250 Russian personnel have now been killed since the start of the invasion, the Ukrainian military has said. The figure represents an increase of 640 since Wednesday’s update. Local authorities said that two people have been killed and five have been injured in Russian shelling in Kharkiv’s industrial district. Three bodies have been recovered from the rubble of a building shelled by Russian forces in the eastern city of Sloviansk. The UK’s ministry of defence said Ukraine appears to be “imposing pressure on Russian forces” in Kherson and has probably destroyed a bridge that served as “one of the main routes between the northern and southern sectors of Russia’s military presence along the Dnipro River”. The UK’s permanent representative to the UN, Dame Barbara Woodward, has said the deportation of people from Ukraine has “chilling echoes from European history” and that the “appalling term ‘de-nazification’” was a “cover for obliterating Ukraine from the map”. Belarus has started military exercises near the Polish border, its capital Minsk, and the northeastern region of Vitebsk, according to the country’s defence ministry. It said the exercises, which are set to last a week, will practise “liberating territory temporarily seized by the enemy” and regaining control over border regions. That’s it from me, Joe Middleton, and the Russia-Ukraine war blog today. Thank you for reading. Inna Sovsun, a Ukrainian MP, paid tribute to Queen Elizabeth II who has died at the age of 96. Sovsun said on Twitter that Her Majesty was a “faithful friend of Ukraine” and offered her “deepest condolences” to the British people.

The Himars multiple launch rocket system is a mobile unit that can simultaneously launch multiple precision-guided missiles. Our defence and security editor Dan Sabbagh offers his analysis of Ukraine’s counterattack, which seems to have taken Russia and everyone else by surprise: A sudden, unexpected Ukrainian military success south-east of Kharkiv changes the analysis of Kyiv’s counterattack strategy. What had been expected to be a well-telegraphed effort to isolate the city of Kherson in the south has been turned on its head by the sudden pushback against Russian forces at the northern edge of the front. The effort started on Tuesday, and by Wednesday the US Institute for the Study of War estimated that Ukraine’s forces had, in a surprise attack, advanced “at least 20km into Russian-held territory” recapturing approximately 400 sq km (154 sq miles) in an area scarcely focused on by military analysts until now. According to one Russian military blogger, as highlighted by Rob Lee, a former US marine and military analyst, Ukrainian forces massed a “powerful tank fist” with 15 tanks to break through the occupiers lines. Cleverly, Kyiv had brought up its air defences in support, preventing Russian jets from immediately striking back to eradicate the gains, a sign of more sophisticated battlefield tactics. The fighting is concentrated around the village of Balakliya, roughly 45 miles south-east of Kharkiv – which appears to still be held by the Russians, but which Ukraine hopes to surround – and in the vicinity of Shevchenkovo on the way to the Russian staging post of Kupiansk. The military aim is to increase pressure on Izium, a strategic city captured by the invaders at the end of April, a gateway to the western Donbas. Read more: Ukraine counterattack takes Russia – and everyone else – by surprise The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, warned today that Ukraine and its supporters face a tough winter in coming months. Stoltenberg told the Associated Press: We need at least to be prepared for this winter, because there is no sign of Russia giving up its goal of taking control of Ukraine. The war in Ukraine is approaching a pivotal moment where we see that the Russian offensive in Donbas has stalled. We see that the Ukrainians have been able to fight back, to strike back and regain some territory. Despite the promise of further and equipment and weapons during a meeting of Western allies in Ramstein, south-west Germany on Thursday, more winter equipment is required, said the head of the western military alliance. He said: Winter’s coming, and winter’s going to be hard on the battlefield in Ukraine. We know that the size of the Ukrainian army is now roughly three times as big as what it was last winter. “They are in urgent need for more winter uniforms, for generators that create electricity, warmth, and also of course tents and other things that can help them through the winter. Stoltenberg also urged western countries that were suffering with high energy prices and inflation to keep the faith and that the price of ending support now would be a price that’s too high to pay. He said: I understand that many people are frustrated and actually feel the pain in Nato countries with increasing energy prices, the cost of living. But at the same time, we have to remember that the price we pay is measured in money, in US dollars or pounds or euros, while the price that Ukrainians are paying is measured in lives lost every day. If President Putin wins in Ukraine, then the world will become more dangerous. Then he will see that he is rewarded, that he can get this way by using brutal military force, by invading a neighbour, by blatantly violating international rule and attacking innocent civilians. The US secretary of state, Anthony Blinken, told Volodymyr Zelenskiy the war with Russia was in a “pivotal moment” as Ukraine’s military continues its counteroffensive in the south of the country. Blinken made a surprise visit to Ukraine’s capital Kyiv on Thursday after the US unveiled nearly $2.7bn (£2.4bn) in new military support to Ukraine and other European countries threatened by Russia. AP reports that Blinken told Zelenskiy: We know this is a pivotal moment, more than six months into Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, as your counteroffensive is now under way and proving effective. Zelenskiy replied: We are grateful for the signal, for this enormous support that you’re providing on a day-to-day basis. Pjotr Sauer reports: “The war in Ukraine will continue until the complete defeat of Russia,” Igor Girkin, a far-right nationalist, grumbled in a video address to his 430,000 followers on Telegram on Monday. “We have already lost, the rest is just a matter of time.” Girkin, a former Russian intelligence colonel who became a commander of the pro-Russian separatist forces in 2014, is arguably the most prominent voice within an increasingly loud and angry group of ultra-nationalist and pro-war bloggers who have taken to berating the Kremlin for its failure to achieve its tactical objectives as the fighting in Ukraine has entered its seventh month. After Ukraine’s latest counteroffensive in the south and the north-east of the country, these bloggers – who have so far been granted a public platform denied to many – have intensified their criticism of the Kremlin, slamming the army’s inadequate performance in the war and urging Vladimir Putin to declare a full-scale mobilisation.

Here is everything you might have missed: The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has made a surprise trip to Kyiv as the United States unveiled nearly $2.7bn (£2.4bn) in new military support to Ukraine and other European countries threatened by Russia. Blinken travelled in secret on his second trip to Kyiv since the Russian invasion began in February. Blinken approved $2bn in foreign military financing, a programme in which the US offers loans or grants to other nations to buy US-produced weapons. This amount comes on top of the announcement by the defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, of another $675m in military assistance that includes more arms, ammunition and supplies for Himars, the precision-guided rockets that can hit targets as far as 80km (50 miles) away. Poland and the Baltic states have announced they will temporarily restrict access for Russian citizens holding EU visas. The prime ministers of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland said in a statement that the move had been taken to address “public policy and security threats” arising from the “substantial and growing influx of Russian citizens” into the EU. “We believe that this is becoming a serious threat to our public security and to the overall shared Schengen area,” they said. The measures are expected to come into force by 19 September, and will “restrict the entry into the Schengen area for Russian citizens travelling for tourism, culture, sport and business purposes”. Ukraine has now recaptured more than 700 sq km (270 sq miles) of territory in Kharkiv and in the south, according to a Ukrainian general. Speaking at a public briefing, Brig Gen Oleksiy Gromov said Ukrainian forces had advanced as far as 50km (31 miles) into Russian lines and retaken more than 20 villages. The comments are the most detailed public assessment so far of Ukraine’s counter-offensive. Norway said it will donate approximately 160 Hellfire missiles to Ukraine as well as launching pads and guidance units. During the meeting of 40 allied defence departments at the Ramstein base in Germany, Norwegian defence minister Bjørn Arild Gram said his country would also supply Ukraine with night-vision equipment, adding that Kyiv had requested the weapons, reports AP. Two people have been killed and four have been injured by Russian shelling in the Donetsk region, according to the office of the prosecutor general of Ukraine. A post on Facebook said there had been “massive shelling” in the central part of the city of Bakhmut on Thursday, and that the shells had come from the Soviet-designed Uragan rocket system. It added that a woman had also died near her home after shelling in the town of Toretska in the New York region. Ukraine’s top military chief has claimed responsibility for an attack on Russia’s Saky airbase in Crimea last month. It marks the first official acknowledgment from Kyiv that it was behind the strike, which destroyed at least nine Russian aircraft at the site. About 51,250 Russian personnel have now been killed since the start of the invasion, the Ukrainian military has said. The figure represents an increase of 640 since Wednesday’s update. Local authorities said that two people have been killed and five have been injured in Russian shelling in Kharkiv’s industrial district. Three bodies have been recovered from the rubble of a building shelled by Russian forces in the eastern city of Sloviansk. The UK’s ministry of defence said Ukraine appears to be “imposing pressure on Russian forces” in Kherson and has probably destroyed a bridge that served as “one of the main routes between the northern and southern sectors of Russia’s military presence along the Dnipro River”. The UK’s permanent representative to the UN, Dame Barbara Woodward, has said the deportation of people from Ukraine has “chilling echoes from European history” and that the “appalling term ‘de-nazification’” was a “cover for obliterating Ukraine from the map”. Belarus has started military exercises near the Polish border, its capital Minsk, and the northeastern region of Vitebsk, according to the country’s defence ministry. It said the exercises, which are set to last a week, will practise “liberating territory temporarily seized by the enemy” and regaining control over border regions. Activists from Greenpeace blocked a shipment of Russian gas from unloading at a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in Sweden today, the terminal owner and environmental group said. A spokesperson for terminal owner Gasum, Olga Väisänen, told AFP. Activists climbed up on the loading arms at the terminal and they have boats in the water. She said the protest at the Nynäshamn terminal near Stockholm began around 10am (8am GMT) and was still going on more than five hours later, though police had forced the activists to climb down from the loading arms. Greenpeace’s sailboat Witness and activists in kayaks were blocking the Dutch-registered LNG tanker Coral Energy from docking and unloading. They unfurled banners reading “Stop financing Putin’s war” and “Stop Russian fossil trade”. Greenpeace campaigner Karolina Carlsson said in a statement. That Russian gas is still allowed to flow into Sweden, more than six months after Putin began his bloody invasion of Ukraine, is unacceptable. We all know that fossil fuels from Russia are financing the war. The [Swedish] parliament has given the government a clear mandate to stop all imports of Russian energy to Sweden and it is prime minister Magdalena Andersson’s obligation to act on this. These are some of the latest images to be sent to us over the newswires from Ukraine. Two people have been killed and four have been injured by Russian shelling in the Donetsk region, according to the office of the prosecutor general of Ukraine. A post on Facebook said there had been “massive shelling” in the central part of the city of Bakhmut on Thursday, and that the shells had come from the Soviet-designed Uragan rocket system. “The invaders’ shells hit private houses, shops, gas stations and high-rise buildings. One local resident died, four others were injured,” the post said. It added that a woman had also died near her home after shelling in the town of Toretska in the New York region. Ukraine has now recaptured more than 700 sq km (270 sq miles) of territory in Kharkiv and in the south, according to a Ukrainian general. Speaking at a public briefing, Brig Gen Oleksiy Gromov said Ukrainian forces had advanced as far as 50km (31 miles) into Russian lines and retaken more than 20 villages. The comments are the most detailed public assessment so far of Ukraine’s counter-offensive. “The total amount of territory returned to Ukrainian control in the Kharkiv and Pivdennyi Buh directions stands at over 700 sq km,” Gromov said. Pivdennyi Buh is a river that runs through the southern frontline city of Mykolaiv before discharging into the Black Sea. Poland and the Baltic states have announced they will temporarily restrict access for Russian citizens holding EU visas. The prime ministers of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland said in a statement that the move had been taken to address “public policy and security threats” arising from the “substantial and growing influx of Russian citizens” into the EU. “We believe that this is becoming a serious threat to our public security and to the overall shared Schengen area,” they said. The measures are expected to come into force by 19 September, and will “restrict the entry into the Schengen area for Russian citizens travelling for tourism, culture, sport and business purposes”. Exceptions will be made for various categories, including “dissidents”, “humanitarian cases”, family members and holders of residence permits in EU countries. “We fully uphold the need to continue to support opponents of the Putin regime and provide them with opportunities to leave Russia,” the leaders said. But they added that it was “unacceptable that citizens of the aggressor state are able to freely travel in the EU, while at the same time people in Ukraine are being tortured and murdered”. Lorenzo Tondo reports for us from Kyiv An independent Italian journalist has been wounded while covering the fighting near the frontline in the southern region of Kherson. Italian authorities said Mattia Sorbi, a contributor to several Italian newspapers, was taken for surgery after an incident on Thursday, but added that his condition was not life threatening. The Italian foreign ministry said Sorbi was in hospital in Russian-occupied territory, but that it was in touch with him and working to bring him back to Italy soon. Ukraine said last week that it had launched offensives in several directions in Kherson, but has since released few details and continues to insist on a “regime of silence” for strategic reasons, with journalists temporarily banned from travelling to the frontlines in the south. Norway said today it will donate approximately 160 Hellfire missiles to Ukraine as well as launching pads and guidance units. During the meeting of 40 allied defence departments at the Ramstein base in Germany, Norwegian defence minister Bjørn Arild Gram said his country would also supply Ukraine with night-vision equipment, adding that Kyiv had requested the weapons, reports AP. The minister said: This is the weapon that Ukraine asked for, and it will come in handy in the fight against Russian occupying forces. The Hellfire is an anti-tank and anti-aircraft missile that Arild Gram said is easy to control and can be used on land or sea targets. US secretary of state Antony Blinken is visiting Kyiv and has tweeted his thanks to US embassy staff based in the Ukrainian capital “for their service to our country and the US-Ukraine partnership”. Julia Kollewe reports: Lloyd’s of London has warned of a “challenging year” of natural catastrophes, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and inflation as the world’s oldest insurance market braced for a £1.1bn hit from unrecoverable planes and cargoes related to the war in Ukraine. Lloyd’s said it had set aside the sum for customers affected by the conflict, mostly for grounded aircraft, ships trapped in the Black Sea, and disrupted exports of cereals and agricultural products from Ukraine and Russia. Bruce Carnegie-Brown, the chairman, said Lloyd’s had estimated the losses using the same methodology as for the pandemic, but that only about 4% of claims for losses from the war had been received so far. Covid-19 was far more costly for the Lloyd’s market, where 76 firms operate, at £3.5bn. Overall, the war in Ukraine could cost the global insurance industry £10bn to £12bn, according to estimates. Read more: Lloyd’s of London takes £1.1bn hit from Ukraine war Ukraine’s minister of defence, Oleksii Reznikov, has thanked the US for the $675m in military assistance that will fund arms, ammunitions and military vehicles. As we reported earlier, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has made an impromptu visit to Kyiv. As part of his trip, Blinken visited a children’s hospital in the Ukrainian capital and was pictured holding a landmine sniffer dog and talking to six-year-old Marina from the Kherson region. Lorenzo Tondo reports for us from Kyiv Ukrainian police have uncovered a sprawling child sexual abuse network involving dozens of Russian children, whose images and videos were allegedly traded inside and outside the country, but said it was impossible to pursue the case because of the war. A Ukrainian man has been arrested and 15 children, all Russians living in Russia, identified, but prosecutors in the Kyiv region have said they were not able to trace other victims or arrest other suspects because of the severing of Russia-Ukraine relations since the Kremlin’s invasion. “These kinds of crimes are unfortunately common everywhere, in Ukraine and Europe,” said Oleh Tkalenko, a senior prosecutor for the Kyiv region, who led the investigation. “But what terrifies us is the large scale of these crimes in Russia.” Read more here: Ukraine police uncover child sexual abuse ring involving Russian children US secretary of state Antony Blinken has made a surprise trip to Kyiv as the United States unveiled nearly $2.7bn in new military support to Ukraine. Blinken travelled in secret on his second trip to Kyiv since the Russian invasion began in February, AFP reported. A senior US official accompanying Blinken said: The secretary very much wanted to come on this trip now because it’s such a consequential moment for Ukraine. She pointed to Ukraine’s counter-offensive nearly seven months into the invasion, with Volodymyr Zelenskiy announcing on Wednesday that Kyiv had retaken several places in the Kharkiv region. She added: All of the security assistance is trying to help ensure that Ukraine is successful in the counter-offensive,” the official said on condition of anonymity. If they are, I do think it is very significant in terms of how the war moves forward. Blinken approved $2bn in foreign military financing, a programme in which the US offers loans or grants to other nations to buy US-produced weapons. Half of the new $2n package will go to Ukraine and the rest to 18 other nations seen as under threat from Russia, another State Department official said. The approved recipients include Moldova and Georgia, which both have breakaway regions backed by Russia, as well as the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania and Bosnia, where tensions have grown with Russian-backed Bosnian Serb leaders. This amount comes on top of defense secretary Lloyd Austin’s announcement of another $675n in military assistance that includes more arms, ammunition and supplies for Himars, the precision-guided rockets that can hit targets as far as 80km (50 miles) away. If you’re just joining us, here’s a quick roundup of all the latest on the war in Ukraine. Ukraine has recaptured up to 400 sq km of territory in the eastern region of Kharkiv in a surprise counter-offensive. The operation is thought to have been made possible after Russia was forced to refocus its forces to the south to counter Ukrainian offensives in Kherson. Hailing the counter-offensive in an address last night, President Zelenskiy said that “each success of our military in one direction or another changes the general situation along the entire frontline in favour of Ukraine”. Figures within the Russian military are said to be concerned that the counter-offensive will cut lines of communication between Russian forces in the Kharkiv region. Ukraine’s top military chief has claimed responsibility for an attack on Russia’s Saky airbase in Crimea last month. It marks the first official acknowledgment from Kyiv that it was behind the strike, which destroyed at least nine Russian aircraft at the site. About 51,250 Russian personnel have now been killed since the start of the invasion, the Ukrainian military has said. The figure represents an increase of 640 since Wednesday’s update. Local authorities said that two people have been killed and five have been injured in Russian shelling in Kharkiv’s industrial district. Three bodies have been recovered from the rubble of a building shelled by Russian forces in the eastern city of Sloviansk. The UK’s ministry of defence said Ukraine appears to be “imposing pressure on Russian forces” in Kherson and has probably destroyed a bridge that served as “one of the main routes between the northern and southern sectors of Russia’s military presence along the Dnipro river”. The UK’s permanent representative to the UN, Dame Barbara Woodward, has said the deportation of people from Ukraine has “chilling echoes from European history” and that the “appalling term ‘de-nazification’” was a “cover for obliterating Ukraine from the map”. President Biden has approved additional military aid to Ukraine worth up to $675m, including howitzers, artillery munitions, Humvees, armored ambulances, anti-tank systems, and more. Belarus has started military exercises near the Polish border, its capital Minsk, and the northeastern region of Vitebsk, according to the country’s defence ministry. It said the exercises, which are set to last a week, will practise “liberating territory temporarily seized by the enemy” and regaining control over border regions. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) has shared its latest map of Russian attacks and troop locations in Ukraine. Two people have been killed and five have been injured in Russian shelling in Kharkiv’s industrial district, the regional governor has said. Posting on Telegram, Oleh Syniehubov said: “Unfortunately, as a result of the shelling of the Industrial District, there are casualties. “According to the preliminary data of medics, 2 people died, 5 were injured.” He added that emergency services were at the scenes of the strikes. The counter-offensive in Kharkiv will help the efforts of the Ukrainian military along the entire front of the conflict, President Zelenskiy has said. Speaking in his nightly address on Wednesday, Zelenskiy said: “This week we have good news from the Kharkiv region. Probably, you all have already seen reports about the activity of Ukrainian defenders. “And I think every citizen feels proud of our warriors. It is a well-deserved pride, a right feeling.” He said that “now is not the time to name the settlements to which the Ukrainian flag returns”, but went on to list and thank brigades operating in Kharkiv and elsewhere. “Each success of our military in one direction or another changes the general situation along the entire frontline in favour of Ukraine,” he said. “The more difficult it is for the occupiers, the more losses they have, the better the positions of our defenders in Donbas will be, the more reliable the defense of Zaporizhzhia, Mykolaiv and the cities of the Dnipropetrovsk region will be, the faster we will be able to liberate the Azov region and the entire south.” Three bodies have been recovered from the rubble of a building shelled by Russian forces in the eastern city of Sloviansk. Posting on Facebook, Vadym Liakh, the head of the city’s military-civil administration, said the bodies of two men and a woman had been recovered from a building on Torska Street. Reports on Wednesday said a building on the same street had been hit by Russian shelling. A nearby school was also reportedly struck. Pictures from the city showed a building with the roof caved in. Rescue personnel could also be seen working to clear debris and extinguish a fire. “We hold on. We are together,” Liakh said. President Biden has approved additional military aid to Ukraine worth up to $675m, the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin has said. The announcement came at a meeting of defence ministers and military chiefs from more than 40 countries at the Ramstein airbase in Germany. In remarks opening the talks, Austin said the US and its allies were “seeing the demonstrable success of our common efforts on the battlefield”. He added that the latest package of aid would include howitzers, artillery munitions, Humvees, armored ambulances, anti-tank systems, and more. Ukraine appears to be “imposing pressure on Russian forces” in the southern region of Kherson, according to the UK’s ministry of defence. The ministry’s latest update said Ukrainian forces has “probably destroyed a military pontoon bridge” at Darivka, a village near the Black Sea coast. It added that Russian forces set up the crossing after a nearby road bridge had been severely damaged, and that it is “one of the main routes between the northern and southern sectors of Russia’s military presence along the Dnipro river”. “Ukraine’s systematic precision targeting of vulnerable crossing points likely continues to impose pressure on Russian forces as they attempt to contain Ukrainian attacks,” the ministry said. “It slows their ability to deploy operational reserves and resupply materiel from the east.” Sustained pressure on Russian forces in the south is thought to have been key to enabling Ukraine to launch a counter-offensive in Kharkiv in the northeast. Figures within the Russian military are said to be concerned that the Ukrainian counter-offensive in Kharkiv will hinder communication between Russian forces in the region. According to the latest assessment from US-based thinktank the Institute for the Study of War, Russian milbloggers – military personnel who write blogs – have voiced concern that the operation seeks to cut ground lines of communication to forces in the cities of Kupyansk and Izyum, and that that could “allow Ukrainian troops to isolate the Russian groupings in these areas and retake large swaths of territory”. “These milbloggers used largely panicked and despondent tones, acknowledged significant Ukrainian gains,” the institute said. “The level of shock and frank discussion of Ukrainian successes by Russian milbloggers speaks to the scale of surprise achieved by Ukrainian forces, which is likely successfully demoralizing Russian forces.” The deportation of people from Ukraine has “chilling echoes from European history”, the UK’s permanent representative to the UN has said. Dame Barbara Woodward was speaking at a briefing on Ukraine at the UN Security Council. “We are deeply concerned by reporting by the UN, the OSCE and civil society organisations that Russia is systematically detaining, processing and deporting Ukrainian men, women and children, with chilling echoes from European history,” she said. “As we have heard, civilians reportedly face interrogation, body searches, stripping, invasive data collection, ill-treatment and torture while passing through ‘filtration’. “Those who are deemed most threatening are reportedly held indefinitely in detention centres, while others, including unaccompanied children, are forcibly deported to Russia. Some simply disappear.” She added that the “appalling term ‘de-nazification’” was a “cover for obliterating Ukraine from the map”. Some 51,250 Russian soldiers have been killed since the beginning of the invasion, according to figures published by the Ukrainian military. A graphic posted to Twitter by the general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces showed “total combat losses of the enemy” from 24 February to today. As well as the soldiers killed, it said Russia has lost a total of 2,112 tanks, 4,557 armoured personnel vehicles, and 239 aircraft. The number of total Russian deaths is an increase of 640 on Wednesday’s update. A separate post on Facebook said Russia had suffered the greatest losses in the region of the southeastern city of Donetsk. Asked about the cost of the invasion during a speech at the Russian Eastern Economic Forum on Wednesday, Vladimir Putin denied reports of Russian losses. “We haven’t lost anything and we won’t lose anything,” he said. “The main gain is the strengthening of our sovereignty.” An upbeat message from Ukraine’s Ministry of Defence this morning as that counter-offensive in Kharkiv continues. “Dracarys” is a command used by characters in Game of Thrones when they want a dragon to breath fire. Russian forces carried out two missiles strikes in Kharkiv overnight, according to the city’s mayor. Posting on Telegram, Ihor Terekhov said rockets hit the neighbourhoods of Saltovskoye and Kholodnogorsk at around midnight local time. He said preliminary reports suggested the strike in Saltovskoye had hit infrastructure that was “critically important for the normal life support of the city”. He said the strike in Kholodnogorsk had hit a local business. “Information about the destruction and victims is being clarified,” he said. Ukraine has retaken 400 sq km of territory in the east of the Kharkiv region, according to US-based think tank The Institute for the Study of War. In its latest assessment of the situation on the ground, the group said that, on 7 September, Ukrainian forces “likely used tactical surprise to advance at least 20km into Russian-held territory”. It said Ukraine was “likely exploiting Russian force reallocation” to the south to “conduct an opportunistic yet highly effective counteroffensive” northwest of the city of Izyum. It added that Russia had been forced to refocus its forces in the south because of Ukraine’s ongoing operations in the Kherson region. The Ukrainian letter ‘Ї’, which has become a symbol of resistance to the Russian occupation throughout Ukraine has been painted on a number of public monuments and statues in Mariupol, according to reporters in the southern city. A senior Ukrainian presidential advisor has reiterated Ukraine’s desire for long-range weapons in order to equalise the battlefield. “Increasing long-range is our mission,” Andriy Yermak wrote in a Telegram post early this morning. “Because long-range gives birth to symmetry. And it is the basis of success in confrontation with the aggressor.” Ukraine’s military chief has also predicted the war is likely to rage on into next year with no signs of letting up. General Valeriy Zaluzhnyi said in an article co-authored by lawmaker Mykhailo Zabrodskyi and published by state news agency Ukrinform: There is every reason to believe that it is not going to end anywhere within 2022. … As long as the current situation persists, this war can last for years.” Ukraine’s top military chief has warned of the threat of Russia using nuclear weapons in Ukraine, which would create the risk of a “limited” nuclear conflict with other powers, according to an opinion piece attributed in his name in Ukraine’s state news agency Ukrinform. Ukraine’s commander-in-chief of the armed forces, general Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, gave a detailed assessment of the war to date in rare public comments published on Wednesday. Zaluzhnyi said the “direct threat” of Russia’s possible use of tactical nuclear weapons has had a major influence on the adoption of relevant decisions. Another factor is the direct threat of the use by Russia, under certain circumstances, of tactical nuclear weapons. Battles on the territory of Ukraine have already demonstrated how much the Russian Federation neglects the issues of global nuclear security even in a conventional war. … It is hard to imagine that even nuclear strikes will allow Russia to break Ukraine’s will to resist. But the threat that will emerge for the whole of Europe cannot be ignored. The possibility of direct involvement of the world’s leading powers in a ‘limited’ nuclear conflict, bringing closer the prospect of World War 3, cannot be completely ruled out either.” “Any Russian attempts at practical steps in the use of tactical nuclear weapons must be pre-empted by employing the entire arsenal of means at the disposal of world powers,” he added. “After all, starting from this moment, the Russian Federation will become not only a threat to the peaceful coexistence of Ukraine, its neighbours, and a number of European countries but also a truly global-scale terrorist state.” Belarus has started military exercises near the Polish border, its capital Minsk and the north-east region of Vitebsk, the country’s defence ministry said on Thursday morning, according to Reuters. It said the exercises, which are set to last a week, will practice “liberating territory temporarily seized by the enemy” and regaining control over border regions. According to the ministry, the level of troops and military equipment involved in the exercise did not require them to provide notice under OSCE guidelines. Ukraine has stationed troops and built defences along its border with Belarus amid repeated signals that its northern neighbour could join forces with Russia. Belarus’s autocratic leader, Alexander Lukashenko, is the Kremlin’s most loyal ally and allowed Russian troops to use his territory to enter Ukraine in February. Ukraine’s top military chief has claimed responsibility for the attack on Russia’s Saky airbase in Crimea in the first official acknowledgment from Kyiv since the strike destroyed at least nine Russian aircraft last month. Ukraine’s commander-in-chief of the armed forces, general Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, gave a detailed assessment of the war to date in rare public comments published on Wednesday. An opinion piece attributed in his name in Ukraine’s state news agency Ukrinform acknowledged rocket strikes on Russian air bases in annexed Crimea, including one that damaged the Saky military base in August. Until now, Ukraine has refused to publicly acknowledge its involvement. Referring to the approaches Ukraine could adopt to gain advantage as the war rages on, Zaluzhnyi cited the Crimea attack as an example. A convincing example proving that this is a correct approach to be applied this year is the successful efforts of the Armed Forces of Ukraine to physically transfer the zone of hostilities to the temporarily occupied territory of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea. This was done by a series of successful missile strikes on the enemy’s Crimea-based air bases, first of all, the Saky airfield. The task of the Armed Forces of Ukraine for 2023 is to make these experiences even sharper and more tangible for the Russians and for other occupied regions, despite the massive distance to the targets.” The Saky airbase lies at least 200km from the front lines and Zaluzhnyi did not clarify what he meant by missile strikes. A series of images from Ukraine’s frontlines have been sent over our newswires today. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has remained guarded about the military counter-offensive in the east while Ukraine’s army has yet to comment on the alleged new battle plan. Without giving details, Zelenskiy reported “good news” from the Kharkiv region east of Kyiv, implying some settlements had been recaptured from Russian forces but adding that “now is not the right time to name those settlements where the Ukrainian flag has returned”. In a Wednesday evening address, Zelenskiy cited “the extremely successful hits in areas where the occupiers are concentrated”, and thanked Ukrainian artillery troops for what he said were successful strikes against Moscow’s forces in the south. Ukraine has launched a surprise counterattack in the north-east Kharkiv region, stretching Russian forces who are also facing Ukrainian attacks in the south. An official representing the Russian-controlled Donetsk People’s Republic said on Tuesday that Ukrainian forces “encircled” Balakliia, an eastern town of 27,000 people situated between Kharkiv and Russian-occupied Izium. “Today, the Ukrainian armed forces, after prolonged artillery preparation … began an attack on Balakliia,” Daniil Bezsonov said on Telegram. “At this time, Balakliia is in operative encirclement and within the firing range of Ukrainian artillery. All approaches are cut off by fire,” he said, adding that a successful Ukrainian offensive would threaten Russian forces in Izium, a strategically important town that Russia has been using for its own offensive in eastern Ukraine. Unverified footage circulating on social media on Wednesday showed what looked like a Ukrainian soldier posing in front of an entrance sign for Balakliia. Analysts have said that the initial target of the offensive could be the city of Kupyansk, a key road hub for Russian supplies heading south from the border into eastern Ukraine. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has remained guarded about the military counter-offensive in the east while Ukraine’s army has yet to comment on the alleged new battle plan. Without giving details, Zelenskiy reported “good news” from the Kharkiv region east of Kyiv, implying some settlements had been recaptured from Russian forces but adding that “now is not the right time to name those settlements where the Ukrainian flag has returned”. In a Wednesday evening address, Zelenskiy cited “the extremely successful hits in areas where the occupiers are concentrated”, and thanked Ukrainian artillery troops for what he said were successful strikes against Moscow’s forces in the south. One of Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s advisers, Oleksiy Arestovych, said on Tuesday night that “lightning-fast changes are taking place” in the Kharkiv region, in parallel to the southern offensive in the Kherson region announced by Ukraine’s military last week. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I will be bringing you all the latest developments for the next short while. Whether you’ve been following our coverage overnight or you’ve just dropped in, here are the latest lines. Ukraine has launched a surprise counterattack in the north-east Kharkiv region, stretching Russian forces who are also facing Ukrainian attacks in the south. Ukraine’s top military chief has also warned of the threat of Russia using nuclear weapons in Ukraine, which would create the risk of a “limited” nuclear conflict with other powers, according to an opinion piece attributed in his name in Ukraine’s state news agency Ukrinform. It is 7.30am in Kyiv. Here is where things stand: Ukraine has recaptured several settlements in the north-eastern Kharkiv region as part of a surprise counterattack, president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has claimed. “This week we have good news from Kharkiv region,” he said in his Wednesday evening address, adding that “now is not the right time to name those settlements where the Ukrainian flag has returned”. An official representing the Russian-controlled Donetsk People’s Republic said on Tuesday that Ukrainian forces “encircled” Balakliia, an eastern town situated between Kharkiv and Russian-occupied Izium. US intelligence says Ukrainian forces are making “slow but meaningful progress” on the battlefield. “We’ll see how things pan out,” defence undersecretary Colin Kahl said. “But I certainly think things are going better on the Ukrainian side right now in the south than is true on the Russian side.” The Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a Washington-based thinktank, reported on Wednesday that Ukrainian forces probably captured Verbivka, less than two miles (3.2km) north-west of Balakliia, on Tuesday, citing geo-locatable images posted by Ukrainian soldiers. Shelling resumed near Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant on Wednesday. Ukrainian officials accused Russian forces of firing on the city of Nikopol, across from the plant, as well as in Enerhodar, where the power plant is located. “Employees of communal and other services simply do not have time to complete emergency and restoration work, as another shelling reduces their work to zero,” the Ukrainian mayor of Enerhodar, Dmytro Orlov, said on Telegram. The UN has accused Moscow of forcing Ukrainians into detention camps and even prisons via a Kremlin-directed “filtration” program, and removing children from the war zone to hand over to adoptive parents inside Russia. “We are concerned that the Russian authorities have adopted a simplified procedure to grant Russian citizenship to children without parental care, and that these children would be eligible for adoption by Russian families,” Ilze Brands Kehris, assistant UN secretary-general for human rights, told the security council. The US ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, told the council that estimates indicate authorities have “interrogated, detained, and forcibly deported” between 900,000 and 1.6 million Ukrainians to Russia since late February in an attempt “to prepare for an attempted annexation”. The body of a British aid worker who was captured by Russian proxies in April has been handed to Ukraine with “possible signs of unspeakable torture”, according to the country’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba. Paul Urey, 45, from Warrington, Cheshire, was captured along with another Briton, Dylan Healey. The two men were charged with “mercenary activities” by the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic, but in July the Russian proxy authorities announced that Urey had died as a result of “illness and stress”. Kuleba said Urey’s body had been returned, showing possible signs of torture. Vladimir Putin has threatened to tear up a fragile Ukraine grain deal allowing exports from the Black Sea. During a bellicose speech at an economic conference in Vladivostok, Putin said he would speak with the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, about “limiting the destinations for grain exports”, claiming that only two of 87 ships leaving Ukraine with grain had gone to developing countries. Data from the UN showed the claim was false by a factor of at least 10. Putin also threatened to cut off all deliveries of gas, oil, and coal to Europe if they imposed a price cap on Russian energy imports. “Will there be any political decisions that contradict the contracts? Yes, we just won’t fulfil them. We will not supply anything at all if it contradicts our interests,” he said, according to a Reuters translation of his remarks. “We will not supply gas, oil, coal, heating oil – we will not supply anything.” Recalling a Russian fairytale, he said that Europeans could “freeze like the wolf’s tail”. Putin declared that Russia had “lost nothing” in launching a war on Ukraine during a belligerent and defiant speech at the Russian Eastern Economic Forum on Wednesday. “We haven’t lost anything and we won’t lose anything,” he said, when asked about the cost of the invasion. “The main gain is the strengthening of our sovereignty.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2020/dec/31/sector-by-sector-are-british-firms-ready-for-post-brexit-trade","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2020-12-31T06:00:32Z","webTitle":"Sector by sector: are British firms ready for post-Brexit trade?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/dec/31/sector-by-sector-are-british-firms-ready-for-post-brexit-trade","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2020/dec/31/sector-by-sector-are-british-firms-ready-for-post-brexit-trade","fields":{"headline":"Sector by sector: are British firms ready for post-Brexit trade?","bodyText":"After months of tortuous negotiations between the UK and the EU, a Brexit trade deal was agreed at almost the last minute. But how prepared are UK businesses for the significant changes that will come into force on 1 January? Are they happy with the terms of the agreement? Retail A shock rise in high street prices caused by billions of pounds of new import taxes on everyday goods has been avoided thanks to the new trade deal. Four-fifths of UK food imports come from the EU, and the British Retail Consortium has told shoppers they can heave a “collective sigh of relief”. Retail Economics’ chief executive, Richard Lim, said: “Two weeks ago there was a risk that Brexit could be catastrophic. The deal has provided certainty in terms of what retailers need to do. What we are facing now is at the lower end of the scale in terms of the potential for disruption.” John Allan, the chairman of Tesco, who had warned that import tariffs would have triggered higher food prices, said he was now “relatively calm” about the impact of Brexit on retail, and food retail in particular. But he cautioned: “If we don’t do something very positive to counteract it in terms of the national economy in the long run, we will be a bit worse off than we would have been if we’d stayed in the EU.” Zoe Wood Ports The chaos caused by last week’s French travel ban, which left thousands of truckers stranded in Kent and supermarkets flying in fresh fruit and vegetables, means we have already seen what the worst-case scenario for 1 January could look like. Could those scenes be repeated? The Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, has already predicted “bumpy moments” for companies navigating the new customs procedures, and analysts think tailbacks at the ports are inevitable in the early days. However, the government’s decision to temporarily waive most of its border checks takes some of the pressure off. The initial focus is on imports of “controlled” goods such as alcohol and tobacco, but controls will ratchet up in April and again in July. After the frenetic stockpiling before Christmas and the Brexit deadline, the volume of goods moved in January is lower, which will also help if there are hiccups with new systems. But any disruption to the flow of cross-Channel trade caused by new Brexit bureaucracy would soon be felt on British shores. With 3,500 trucks a day using the Channel tunnel, the Eurotunnel terminal is an obvious bottleneck if businesses struggle with new customs paperwork. Border delays would be disastrous for exporters of perishable goods, such as Scottish seafood, which were badly hit last week. ZW Logistics Given that UK haulage companies had feared having to fight over a small number of annual permits to carry on sending lorries across the Channel, for most the agreement is a significant improvement on the no-deal scenario. However, their operations will be constrained in terms of cabotage (ie moving goods within an EU country) and cross-border deliveries within the EU. That could pose a headache for some, and could prove insurmountable for specialist companies providing logistics for events such as music tours through several countries. The deal still means an enormous amount of red tape for customs and borders, and while the haulage sector itself will not be responsible, lorries could be held up or stopped if their importing/exporting companies have not got the new paperwork correct. Gwyn Topham Pharmaceuticals Drugmakers have long been preparing for Brexit by stockpiling more medicines to ensure there are no shortages of vital drugs and by planning alternative supply routes away from the busy Dover to Calais straits. The industry is confident that medicines will reach patients come 1 January and beyond, but says some things are out of its control, such as delays at borders due to new customs and border checks. Under the Brexit deal, inspections of drug manufacturing facilities are recognised by both sides, but the text does not mention mutual recognition of medicine batch testing. Additional safety tests on medicines made in the UK before they are sold in the EU and vice versa would lead to delays of several weeks. For Northern Ireland, the UK and EU have agreed a one-year phase-in period to implement medicines regulation. Julia Kollewe Aviation UK airlines had long been resigned to losing some of their freedoms to operate throughout Europe, such as flying between two EU member states, with easyJet having already hived off part of its operations into a new company in Austria to tackle potential losses from its route network. Meanwhile, contingency measures had guaranteed that flights could continue between the UK and EU in the event of no deal. The structure of International Airlines Group, the Madrid-based owner of British Airways, was questioned before the deal. A clause now allows UK carriers to be controlled by a combination of EU and UK shareholders, which should avert any obligation for BA or other airlines to be split off from owning groups or for shareholders to divest. GT The City While the Brexit deal says very little about financial services, it has been broadly welcomed by City firms whose business borrowers and corporate clients could have suffered from tariffs and quotas on cross-border trade. But industry groups including UK Finance are calling for an equivalence agreement on financial services – which would give similar access rights to City firms after the end of the transition period – as soon as possible. The lobby group TheCityUK has said that while there are agreements covering basic banking transactions, there are up to 40 treaties affecting cross-border activities for the financial industry that need to be renegotiated. However, reports suggest an agreement on equivalence may not come until spring or summer 2021. TheCityUK’s boss, Miles Celic, said: “While a deal is welcome, financial and related professional services are clear-eyed about the need for both sides to continue to develop the relationship in services in the years ahead.” Most City firms – investment banks, asset managers and insurers – had not expected a deal covering financial services to be struck before the transition deadline, and prepared accordingly. Firms have spent the last four years applying for licences with local regulators, revising client contracts, and shifting more than 7,500 roles and a combined £1.2tn in assets to the EU, to ensure they could continue serving continental customers by the time the UK left the bloc. However, areas that have not yet been granted equivalence, such as derivatives trading, are facing disruption despite the deal. Traders and brokers will have to make alternative arrangements, bypassing the London market to use derivatives trading platforms in countries such as the US that have already been granted equivalence. If traders and brokers get used to rerouting their business through different countries, it could threaten London’s dominance as a financial centre, and make trading less efficient and more costly for users. Kalyeena Makortoff Manufacturing UK manufacturing firms were overwhelmingly in favour of a deal that avoided tariffs and quotas that would have destroyed the business models of many companies importing or exporting materials, parts or goods from Europe. However, new customs and rules of origin checks at the border mean parts will be slower to enter the UK, which in turn means carefully planned “just-in-time” supply chains for companies will have to cope with longer import times, adding billions of pounds of extra customs costs for EU and UK businesses. Manufacturers have called for a significant adjustment period to allow them to continue to trade freely while they adjust to the new rules. One of the trickiest issues for advanced manufacturers is around complex rules of origin. For instance, Japan’s Nissan or Toyota will only be able to source 45% of their car parts from Asia to avoid tariffs. However, the deal means parts sourced from the EU and vice versa will not be affected, and there will be leeway with electric car batteries until 2023. Jasper Jolly Energy The trade deal’s energy chapters have a notable emphasis on the climate crisis, including commitments on using more renewables and avoiding a race to the bottom on climate regulations. In fact, the trade deal could be suspended entirely if either side reneges on the 2015 Paris agreement. The deal includes a new commitment for both sides to work together in the North Sea on big offshore windfarms linked to both the UK and the EU. However, there are large gaps remaining on how exactly existing trade in gas and electricity across interconnectors will work, with only a commitment to sort technical details by 2022. The energy industry is particularly keen for the deal’s parallel UK and EU carbon pricing schemes to be joined together, which it says would avoid extra costs. Emma Pinchbeck, the chief executive of the lobby group Energy UK, said that agreeing to link carbon markets in 2021 would be “a great demonstration of collaboration on decarbonisation” before the UK hosts the Cop26 climate talks in the autumn. On nuclear power, the UK and the EU have agreed to continue cooperating, including on the safe movement of nuclear material, equipment and waste. The UK will still be part of various nuclear research programmes. And as with many parts of the deal, the agreement heralds the start of rolling negotiations: the energy chapter will cease to apply in June 2026 – potentially a worry for investors looking at the big energy projects that will be needed to reduce carbon emissions to net zero. JJ Fishing Taking back control of the UK’s waters was a rallying cry for the Brexit campaign, even if fishing’s contribution to the UK and EU economies is small relative to other sectors. The deal transfers 25% of the value of fish caught by EU boats in UK waters back to the UK over five years – considerably less than the 80% originally demanded by the UK. UK vessels will catch about two-thirds of fish caught in UK waters, but EU boats will be able to operate as close as six miles from the UK’s coast. Fishers’ lobby groups were aghast that the deal will end the practice of quota swapping between British and EU vessels, meaning that in some cases UK fishers may be limited to smaller catches. And the deal is by no means an end point: instead, the EU and the UK will conduct annual negotiations on catch size. Some UK fishers hope the UK will continue to push for further increases in their catch.

This is low-lying land, bordering the urban spread of Chepstow and Newport, and is a special place for wildlife, with big skies overhead and miles of waterways that are not only a soup of biodiversity but protect the area from Severn estuary floods. At Magor Marsh you can walk along boardwalks near where monks once worked to reclaim the land from the sea, through reed beds with Cetti’s warblers singing wildly, water voles dashing off, the sound of distant cuckoos floating on the air and plenty of waterfowl. If you are really lucky you may catch the splash of an otter or, by peering into the ancient reeds, spot a magnificent diving beetle glistening in the water. • Free to enter, no dogs permitted, gwentwildlife.org Gemma Bode Croydon butterflies Croydon may be the last place you’d expect to find a wildlife paradise but if you head south-east of the town into the North Downs and Hutchinson’s Bank, you won’t be disappointed. Off Featherbed Lane in New Addington, the reserve is home to 40 of the UK’s 59 butterfly species, several varieties of orchid and a host of other invertebrates and wildflowers. It is a true green-space gem. Paths (some quite steep) crisscross the dry valley over the chalk grassland meadows and along woodland edges, and there are plenty of benches where you can pause for thought and do some nature spotting. Just five minutes’ walk from New Addington tram stop, the London Wildlife Trust site is open all year round and completely free. • Free to enter, access from Featherbed Lane, dogs on lead, wildlondon.org.uk Anna Guerin Edinburgh waterfowl A trip to Arthur’s Seat and Bawsinch and Duddingston nature reserve on Duddingston Loch in Edinburgh is never a wasted day. A great view of the heronry can be had from Hangman’s Rock overlooking the loch. The plethora of birdlife around the loch is a joy to behold. Dr Neil’s Garden is close by. The whole place has an air of being in the wilds and yet is only a short distance from the city centre. Use the Innocent Railway foot and cycle path which also passes the new Holyrood whisky distillery to gain a new perspective. • Access from car park just west of Duddingston village, scottishwildlifetrust.org.uk Calum MacLeod Lovely Lancashire trails The cafe and visitors’ centre at Leighton Moss RSPB nature reserve are currently closed because of the coronavirus outbreak but visitors are free to wander its lovely trails. There are superb views throughout of the extensive reed beds, and there is an interesting mixture of undergrowth, natural farmland and woodland. Bitterns, avocets, marsh harriers, bearded tits and water rails are the stars of the show, and in autumn, winter and early spring there’s always the chance of wondrous starling murmurations. Morecambe Bay is on the doorstep and (for times when taking public transport is advisable) Silverdale railway station is just metres from the entrance. • £8/£4, half price if arrive on public transport, rspb.org.uk Chris Taylot Swanning around in the Highlands Our trip to the RSPB reserve at Loch Leven in Perth and Kinross, began with a walk in the woodlands, the highlight of which was watching a red squirrel eat a beech nut on a bough less than two metres away. Hordes of bright goldfinches, chaffinches, green finches and siskins flurried around the feeders while a treecreeper crept up a nearby oak. In autumn there are thousands of pink-footed geese here and in winter, whooper swans. Ospreys are present in summer. There’s also a bumblebee sanctuary. We climbed to the top of the hill under soaring buzzards to enjoy a great loch-dominated panorama. We watched the sunset with views of the Ochil Hills fading into the west and snow-capped highlands peeking from behind them, beautifully lit in the twilight glow. • rspb.org.uk Brent Walker Embrace the former base, Berkshire Greenham Common is a name that brings to mind the US air force, cruise missiles and the famous women’s peace camp of the early 1980s, especially the “embrace the base” protest, when thousands of women surrounded the airfield and held hands. There are many reminders of the cold war here still, but the site is now a superb 444-hectare nature reserve managed by Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire Wildlife Trust. Anyone can walk for free around the extensive heathland, with its sites of special scientific interest; there are a great number of interesting bird, reptile and invertebrate species flitting around the gorse, heather, gravel and grassland. When conditions are right, Greenham Common hosts a late-summer wildlife spectacle as hundreds of autumn lady’s-tresses orchids flower. • bbowt.org.uk Holly Mills Once bittern, Kent Over the years few places in the UK have recorded more rare bird, insect and plant species than Dungeness, but even if you aren’t a twitcher or botanist the RSPB reserve here is something of a marvel. A mile-or-so-long trail leads to various hides overlooking lagoons, passing reeds, scrub, gorse, shingle and lots of exotic-looking plants that I haven’t seen anywhere else. We went on a hot day in early June last year without binoculars so spent a frustrating time trying to work out what bird was singing what song. Luckily for us a bittern salvaged the day, flapping ponderously overhead before disappearing into a reedbed. Later, we saw a couple of great egrets. Even more memorable were the viper’s-bugloss flowers growing in great vivid blue profusion everywhere. With the weird combo of lighthouse, tiny steam train and nuclear power station, it was like a day spent on another planet. • rspb.org.uk DeeplySpurred Marine world, Pembrokeshire Seals and a plethora of seabirds including puffins swirling around the cliffs of this ruggedly beautiful island are the highlights but don’t rule out basking shark and dolphin sightings.

Gusts of up to 100mph were predicted to cause disruption through to Thursday, potentially affecting voting in the general election. Storm Atiyah swept in from Ireland on Sunday, bringing gales that caused disruption to power and transport networks across the south-west and Wales and led to yellow weather alerts being issued overnight, with winds of 70mph measured in Culdrose in Cornwall at about 9pm. Power companies registered 26 faults in the south-west on Sunday and two in Wales, which led to 5,500 customers being cut off. There were lane closures on the M48 Severn Bridge on Sunday, and coastal communities were warned tidal surges could throw debris over sea defences. “The strong winds are pretty widespread,” said the Met Office meteorologist Alex Burkill. “It’s very windy in the west and south-west so that’s where we’re going to see the greatest impact unfortunately.” The Met Office said delays were likely to continue on road, rail, air and ferry transport, and that short-term loss of power was possible in some areas on Monday. In Ireland, there were warnings of coastal flooding, and Christmas events across the country were cancelled due to high winds. Thousands of residents were temporarily without power on the west coast in County Galway and West Limerick. A silver lining of the blustery conditions was that a renewable power record was set on Sunday evening, when windfarms generated more than 16GW of power – five times the output expected from the new Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant, according to the National Grid.

Donald Trump has blamed the uptick in case numbers on an increase in testing, a deflection Meyers found ludicrous. “I can’t believe I have to explain this,” Meyers said. “If we stopped testing, that wouldn’t mean the cases went away. That would just mean we don’t know about them. When you play peekaboo with a baby, the baby can’t see you but that doesn’t mean you actually disappeared. “Now this is a sentiment Trump has repeated several times – if only we could stop testing, we’d look so much better – which is just insane. It’s like if you went to your optometrist, and they said, ‘I could give you an eye exam, but then you’d need glasses to drive.’ That doesn’t mean you don’t need glasses, it just means you’ll probably get in more car accidents.” Meyers also noted that top US infectious disease experts such as Dr Anthony Fauci agree that recently rising case numbers are tied to loosened social restrictions in various states, and have openly contradicted the Trump administration. On Tuesday, Fauci said the increase in cases could not be explained by increased testing, “which is just obviously true”, Meyers said. “What do you think is more likely to be responsible for an increase in cases of infectious disease: increased testing, or reopening gyms, malls, barber shops, bowling alleys, massage parlors? “And yet, the Trump administration is committed to the lie that the coronavirus has just disappeared, when in reality it never went away, and it is in fact getting worse.” Stephen Colbert On the Late Show, Stephen Colbert dug into the much-hyped book by Trump’s former national security adviser John Bolton. Several newspapers released excerpts from The Room Where It Happened on Wednesday, Colbert explained, and “I can’t believe I’m saying this: it’s worse than even I imagined.” Bolton’s book, which the Trump administration has attempted to block from publication, features stories about the president and his administration which ranged, according to Colbert, from “amoral idiocy to just downright evil”. “According to Bolton, Trump’s ignorance is near-bottomless. Apparently, Trump didn’t seem to know that Britain was a nuclear power and asked if Finland was part of Russia. Now, you can understand his confusion there, because under President Trump, it feels like we’re kind of part of Russia.” Bolton, who is scheduled to appear on The Late Show next week to discuss the book, also claims that he was told on his first day of work in 2018 by then chief of staff John Kelly – who was reportedly “desperate” to leave – that the White House was a “bad place to work”. “Sounds like working there was like the movie Get Out, except the characters were more hostile to black people,” Colbert said before turning his glare to Kelly. “While we’re on the subject, boo-fucking-hoo, General. It’s the White House, not Dairy Queen. If it’s this horrible of a place, you’re obliged to tell the world about the crimes and save the nation. Not privately bitch about it with your buddy until there’s an opening at Cold Stone Creamery.” Colbert also condemned Bolton, who wrote that “obstruction of justice” seemed to be “a way of life” for Trump that “we couldn’t accept”. “John Bolton knew it was wrong to stand idly by and accept the president repeatedly obstructing justice. He knew that the right thing was to stand idly by and wait on that book deal.” “See you Tuesday, sir,” he added. Trevor Noah And on the Daily Show, Trevor Noah discussed the resurgence of coronavirus cases, which have very much not gone away. China, for example has enacted shutdown measures in Beijing after 100 new cases were reported in the capital. “Wait a minute, China is shutting down Beijing because of 100 cases? Either China takes this way more seriously than everyone else or there’s something they’re not telling us again.” Meanwhile, cases are also on the rise in several US states, which Donald Trump has blamed not on reopening measures but on the increase in testing. Earlier this week, he told reporters that there would be fewer cases if fewer tests were conducted – logic which is “technically right”, Noah noted, because “if you don’t test anybody, then you don’t have any cases. The same way if black people stopped recording the cops, we would have zero cases of police brutality. Ignorance is bliss.” In other coronavirus news, researchers have generally reached consensus that the most risky environment for the spread of virus is mass indoor gatherings in which people are talking – such as, for example, the political rally Trump plans to hold in Tulsa, Oklahoma, this weekend. “Now, we know the total nightmare scenario for catching coronavirus would be like a big crowded indoor event where thousands of people are packed together, screaming and chanting about locking someone up,” Noah said. “But luckily, no one would do such a thing.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2020/mar/31/35m-crowdfunding-campaign-saves-derek-jarman-kent-home-prospect-cottage-tilda-swinton","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2020-03-31T15:38:31Z","webTitle":"£3.5m crowdfunding campaign saves Derek Jarman’s Kent home","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/31/35m-crowdfunding-campaign-saves-derek-jarman-kent-home-prospect-cottage-tilda-swinton","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2020/mar/31/35m-crowdfunding-campaign-saves-derek-jarman-kent-home-prospect-cottage-tilda-swinton","fields":{"headline":"£3.5m crowdfunding campaign saves Derek Jarman’s Kent home","bodyText":"A £3.5m fundraising campaign to save for the nation the idyllic home of artist, activist and film maker Derek Jarman has been successful, it has been announced. The Art Fund said the money had been raised after what was the largest ever arts crowdfunding campaign. As well as big offerings from trusts and foundations and a “substantial personal donation” from David Hockney, there were 7,300 donations from the public including nearly 2,000 in the last week. Campaigners argued that Prospect Cottage and its internationally recognised garden combined to make a work of art in its own right. Nestling on a shingle beach in Kent and overlooked by Dungeness nuclear power station, the house remains a place of pilgrimage and inspiration for devotees of one of the most important and influential artists of his generation. The campaign was launched 10 weeks ago by Jarman’s friend, the actor Tilda Swinton, who was with him when he first saw and fell in love with the house. She said: “When we first launched this appeal, we were throwing ourselves into the void in the hope and faith that others might feel, as we do, that seeds planted with love make for a resilient and sustaining garden, even one grown amongst stones. “What could be a clearer indicator of our collective commitment to a rich and inspiring future than this phenomenal response?” Jarman, the gay rights activist and maker of films such as Sebastiane, Caravaggio and Jubilee, bought the small Victorian former fisherman’s cottage in 1986, the year of his HIV diagnosis. He lived there until his death in 1994. After that it was carefully looked after by his long-time companion Keith Collins, who died in 2018. The artist Tacita Dean, a friend of Collins who enlisted the help of the Art Fund to save the cottage, said: “I cannot express how delighted and moved I am that so many people have come together to protect this very special place.” She said Collins “laid the way for this to happen enabling us all to keep Prospect Cottage as a beacon of hope in the resilience and redemption of the creative process in times of adversity. As it was for Derek, it is for us now. Thanks Keith and thank you to everyone who has made this possible.” The campaign’s success means the Art Fund can purchase the cottage, conserve and maintain it, and fund a permanent public programme that will include residencies for artists, academics, writers, filmmakers and gardeners. There will also be small “by appointment” tours for members of the public. One of the most eye-catching elements of the fund raising was the cream “autograph” suit worn by Jarman’s friend Sandy Powell, the costume designer. At the Oscars and Baftas she gathered more than 200 signatures including those of Scarlett Johansson, Brad Pitt, Spike Lee, Joaquin Phoenix, Renée Zellweger and Laura Dern. It was sold at auction for £16,000. Stephen Deuchar, who this week steps down after 10 years as director of the Art Fund, said: “Securing the future of Prospect Cottage may seem a minor thing by comparison with the global epidemic crisis which has recently enveloped all our lives. “But Derek Jarman’s final years at the cottage were an inspiring example of human optimism, creativity and fortitude battling against the ravages of illness, and in that context the success of this campaign seems all the more apposite and right for its time.” Jarman’s archive from the cottage – notebooks, sketchbooks, letters, drawings and photographs – will be looked after by Tate Britain. Maria Balshaw, the director of Tate, said: “The success of the campaign to save Prospect Cottage raises our spirits in these difficult times. It is testament to the profound impact of Derek Jarman’s originality, energy and activism and his influence on generations of artists and actors who came after him.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/live/2021/oct/19/financiers-executives-uk-investment-summit-heathrow-charges-ftse-sterling-supply-chains-interest-rates-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2021-10-19T16:42:39Z","webTitle":"UK forms green investment partnership with Bill Gates; rate hike talk lifts pound – as it happened ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2021/oct/19/financiers-executives-uk-investment-summit-heathrow-charges-ftse-sterling-supply-chains-interest-rates-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2021/oct/19/financiers-executives-uk-investment-summit-heathrow-charges-ftse-sterling-supply-chains-interest-rates-business-live","fields":{"headline":"UK forms green investment partnership with Bill Gates; rate hike talk lifts pound – as it happened ","bodyText":"Time to wrap up... here’s all today’s stories. Goodnight. GW The pound had a strong day, hitting a one-month high against the US dollar. Sterling jumped over $1.38 for the first time since 17th September, as the City continues to anticipate a rise in UK interest rates before Christmas. The pound also hit a 20-month high against the euro, touching €1.187 for the first time since the early stages of the pandemic, in February 2020. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at ThinkMarkets, says traders are “buying the pound across the board”, after Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey warned that the Bank may have to take steps to rein in inflation. Investors have bought the pound aggressively this week, suggesting they expect interest rates to rise very soon. Although Bailey has acknowledged that monetary policy cannot solve supply-side problems, the BoE must try and tame inflation nonetheless, if policymakers see a risk “particularly to medium-term inflation and to medium-term inflation expectations.” The money markets are currently pricing in a more than 80% chance of a rate hike in November, up from record lows of 0.1% to 0.25%. Further rises are expected next year: But the situation is something of a communications mess, as the Bank had only recently been arguing that inflation pressures were transitory, and that higher borrowing costs wouldn’t address the supply chain problems or the energy crunch. Now some policymakers including Bailey seem to be pushing for rates to rise, although other Monetary Policy Committee members have argued against a hike at this stage. My colleague Richard Partington explains that the Bank’s credibility is now in the spotlight.... With the lack of a stronger steer from the governor, rates are expected to rise by more in the next 10 months than at any point in the past 10 years; rising from its historic low to 1% by August, the highest since the 2008 financial crisis. Britain has, however, been here before, only to leave Mark Carney compared to an “unreliable boyfriend” for stepping back from the brink of rate rises in 2014. Now economists say his successor could be at risk of history repeating, if lack of action next month leaves the City befuddled by Bailey. Andrew Sentance, a member of the MPC between 2006 and 2011, said the governor could be readily accused of obfuscation after sending mixed messages. “I don’t think he comes across as managing communications very well. The message he sends often seems to come out by accident rather than by design,” he said. Although advocating for interest rates to rise, Sentance said it was unlikely that the Bank would move rates in November or December. “It seems to me that their most likely first move is in February. Acting now would send a signal that the MPC feels like it’s behind the curve. It would be admitting it.” Morrisons investors have given the green light for the supermarket chain to be taken over by private equity giant Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice (CD&amp;R). Shareholders in Britain’s fourth-largest supermarket chain have voted to back CD&amp;R’s £7bn bid, after it beat another consortium led by rival Fortress in a takeover auction last month. Morrisons told the City that 99% of shares cast were in favour of the deal. Andrew Higginson, chair of Morrisons, said: We thank shareholders for the strong support received at today’s meetings. We remain confident that CD&amp;R will be a responsible, thoughtful and careful owner of Morrisons and we will now move forward with the remaining steps in the acquisition process.” Opposition politicians and unions are concerned that the Morrisons takeover could see the company loaded with debt or stripped of its assets such as its valuable store estates. Sir Terry Leahy, senior adviser to CD&amp;R funds (and the former boss of Tesco), pledged to be ‘very mindful’ of Morrisons heritage, culture and operating model: “We are very pleased to have received the approval of shareholders and are excited at the opportunity that lies ahead. The particular heritage, culture and operating model of Morrisons are key features of the company and we will be very mindful of these during our tenure as owners. We very much look forward to working with the Morrisons team, not just to preserve the company’s many strengths - but to build on these, with innovation, capital and new technology - helping the business realise its full potential and delivering for all of its stakeholders.” Tobacco firm Philip Morris has become the latest company to be hit by the chip shortage. Philip Morris International told shareholders that the global shortage of semiconductor meant it was struggling to meet consumer demand for its IQOS products, which heat tobacco rather than burning it. PMI’s CEO, Jacek Olczak, said the company is still confident in hitting its growth targets, but flagged that device constraints “could persist into the first half of 2022”. Semiconductors are in short supply due to a surge in demand for electronics kit during lockdown, and the temporary closure of some fabrication plants due to Covid-19. This chip famine has highlighted just how prevalent semiconductors are. Tobacco firms use them in e-cigarettes for many functions, such as power control, current stability, temperature monitoring, puff counters, identifying vapour, and controlling inhalation settings. Despite the IQOS issues, PMI beat analyst expectations by growing revenues by 9.1% in the last quarter, to $8.12bn. PMI won the takeover battle for UK inhaler maker Vectura this summer, as part of its move to expand ‘beyond tobacco and nicotine’. Today, it reported that revenues from smoke-free products made up 28.6% of total adjusted net revenues so far this year. Alok Sharma, president for COP26, tells the UK’s Global Investment Summit that the G20 group of leading economies need to step up to meet global warming targets. Asked what headline he wants to come out of the Glasgow summit at the end of this month, Sharma says: World leaders deliver on keeping 1.5 alive. That’s because keeping global warming to 1.5 degrees is the difference whether some countries continue to exist or go underwater, he explains. Sharma says rich countries haven’t delivered on their pledge from Paris in 2015 to mobilise $100bn per year from 2020 to support developing countries’ transition to net zero. We’re not there yet -- latest figures show it only reached $80bn in 2019. The UK is working on a delivery plan to close the gap.... but even so, the challenges needs “trillions of dollars” per year to transform economies. Sharma says it will be tough to get consensus on the way ahead for the next few years. But he hopes to finalise agreement on transparency -- how countries report their emissions, so people can see if they’re delivering on commitments. At the end of Cop, people will look world leaders in the eye and ask whether or not we delivered for future generations. That’s why Cop26 is so important. Sharma signs off by telling business leaders: Please, tell the G20, the world leaders you’re talking to, to step up to the plate. We need them to step up now, before Cop. Here’s the BBC’s Faisal Islam on the prospect of new taxes to replace lost revenues from fuel duty and tax on fossil fuel-powered cars. On that point, the Treasury analysis of the cost of net zero today warns: Policies to support the adoption of EVs may disproportionately benefit higher income groups, and the costs of any policies that affect the remaining drivers may fall disproportionately on low-income groups; this could create a trade-off in some areas between incentivising decarbonisation and minimising distributional impacts. The UK government announced plans to launch a £400m package of investment alongside the US billionaire Bill Gates to boost the development of new green technologies, my colleague Rupert Neate reports. Boris Johnson said the deal would help power a “green industrial revolution” and develop emerging technologies that were currently too expensive to be commercially successful but were essential to hitting the government’s climate goals. Speaking at a Global Investment Summit at the Science Museum in London on Tuesday, the prime minister said the partnership would help develop UK technology related to carbon capture and storage, long-term battery life, jet zero (zero-carbon aviation) and green hydrogen technology. Johnson said: “I think these are all technologies that have massive potential but are currently underinvested in, by comparison with some others.” “We will only achieve our ambitious climate goals if we rapidly scale up new technologies in areas like green hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuels – technologies that seemed impossible just a few years ago.” The UK has already pledged at least £200m to the development of new British green technologies. Gates announced on Tuesday that he would match the commitment via Breakthrough Energy Catalyst, a coalition of private investors he leads in funding innovative approaches to tackling the climate crisis. Here’s the full story: Alison Rose then explains that the UK should look at emissions by sector, as it plots its move to net zero. Then, it can bring public and private sector together to tackle the sectors which need the greatest change. NatWests CEO says the housing sector is a huge part of the emissions challenge. The UK needs to work to avoid a ‘dislocation’ between regions or within society, she warns. [reminder: the government wants to encourage banks to focus lending on energy efficient homes] Agriculture is another key sector -- it represents 1% of financing on NatWest’s balance sheet, but 19% of the emissions. So private financing can help cut those emissions, such as by funding innovative technologies for low-carbon farming. Alison Rose, the CEO of NatWest, is also on stage at the Summit. She says there’s no lack of finance available to fund the transition to net zero. But at a practical level, ‘commonality’, such as measuring emissions in the same way, are an important step. Rose says that it’s much harder for consumers and small businesses to plan their path to net zero. So we need to move the debate onto the “opportunity of transition”, and the value it will create, which is a ‘huge opportunity’ for British firms. Rose explains that SMEs make up 50% of UK turnover, and 60% of the employees. So, there’s a £160bn revenue opportunity as businesses transition to a low-carbon economy, she explains. Back at the Global Investment Summit, Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, is discussing the net zero strategy. Kwarteng says the government’s 10-point plan (announced last November), the energy white paper, and today’s net zero strategy share the same principle: The taxpayer, the government, isn’t going to spend its way to net zero. We have to hook in and leverage private capital. Kwarteng says the UK has already managed to reduce the ‘green premium’ on offshore wind (derisking it, making it more economically viable). The challenge is to reduce the green premium in other technologies to help attract private investment (such as through the partnership with Bill Gates). He explains that the UK successfully used contracts for difference (a subsidy) to incentivise investment in offshore wind. Those CFDs attracted investment, pulling down the cost of producing renewable energy, and that can used again on other green technologies, Kwarteng argues. Kwarteng also says that the £450m committed for boiler upgrade grants today will help consumers with the cost of moving to net zero (although it’s already been criticised for not going far enough). The Treasury’s analysis of the UK’s Net Zero Review also suggests that adding a carbon price to gas usage could help achieve net zero. It says that energy levies could be rebalanced away from electricity onto gas (even though gas prices have already soared). Current pricing of electricity and gas does not incentivise households to switch from gas boilers to electric heat pumps, as it affects the level of household savings possible. Expanding carbon pricing to gas and reducing policy costs in electricity bills would improve price incentives. The Heat and Buildings Strategy confirms that the government will look at options to shift or rebalance energy levies (such as, the Renewables Obligation and Feed-in Tariffs) and obligations (such as, the Energy Company Obligation) away from electricity to gas over this decade. A decision could be taken next year.... This will include looking at options to expand carbon pricing and remove costs from electricity bills while limiting any impact on bills overall. A Fairness and Affordability Call for Evidence will be launched, with a view to taking decisions in 2022. The government have also released their heating and building strategy, which shows ministers could force mortgage lenders to disclose details about the energy performance of homes on which they lend. The government could also set a date for all homes to meet minimum energy standards, ahead of 2050. The strategy says: We are considering how we can kick start the green finance market and have consulted on introducing mandatory disclosure requirements for mortgage lenders on the energy performance of homes on which they lend, and on setting voluntary improvement targets to be met by 2030. In addition, we will consider the case for setting a date to ensure that all homes meet a Net Zero minimum energy performance standard before 2050, where cost-effective, practical and affordable. That could potentially deter banks from lending to people trying to buy ‘leakier’ properties... It could also create a two-tier housing market, with potentially trapping homeowners in some properties if the cost of upgrading is too high. Ed Davey MP, Leader of the Liberal Democrats, has criticised the move, saying the government helped create the problem by scrapping plans to make all new UK homes carbon neutral back in 2015. “This is an insult to first-time buyers who have scraped and saved to get on the housing ladder. The Conservatives must cancel this plan immediately. Ministers are attempting to clean up their own mess by forcing innocent first-time buyers to fork out thousands of pounds extra, just as an interest rate rise is about to bite. The Treasury also warns that the temporary boost from a carbon tax are unlikely to fully offset the general decline in tax revenues as the UK decarbonises. In their report on the move to net zero, the Treasury lays out that revenues from fossil fuels, principally Fuel Duty and Vehicle Excise Duty, will decline as the UK moves to electric cars. Those duties brought in £37bn in 2019-20 – equivalent to 1.7% of GDP, so a significant amount of revenue to make up. The Treasury argues that this will create “a significant and permanent fiscal pressure”, which may not be offset by the temporary revenues from making polluters pay more through expanded carbon pricing. Carbon tax revenues will also “quickly decline” as the economy decarbonises and the number of polluters drops, it explains: Without action to offset these pressures the public finances will be put in an “unsustainable position”, argues the Treasury -- so motoring taxes must ‘keep pace’ with changes. Therefore, delivering net zero sustainably and consistently with the government’s fiscal strategy requires expanding carbon pricing and ensuring motoring taxes keep pace with these changes during the transition. The document adds that extra borrowing isn’t the answer: If there is to be additional public spending, the government may need to consider changes to existing taxes and new sources of revenue throughout the transition in order to deliver net zero sustainably, and consistently with the government’s fiscal principles. Seeking to pass the costs onto future taxpayers through borrowing would deviate from the polluter pays principle, would not be consistent with intergenerational fairness nor fiscal sustainability, and could blunt incentives. This could also push up the economic cost of the transition. Currently, pure battery electric vehicles are exempt from VED while plug-in hybrids attract a lower rate. This means the move to electric cars is already hitting government revenues (but helping the environment), which has already prompted warnings that road taxes might be needed to fill the shortfall. Back in July, the UK’s fiscal watchdog warned that global climate crisis would add 21% of GDP to the national debt by 2050, or £469bn in today’s terms. But that cost will be lower if the government acts quickly. The Treasury have weighed in, warning that some new taxes may be needed to cover the loss of revenues from fossil fuels, as the UK pushes its net zero strategy. Reuters has the details: Britain will probably have to introduce new taxes to compensate for the loss of revenues from its shift away from fossil fuels which will hit government income currently raised by fuel duty, the finance ministry said on Tuesday. “The largest impacts of the transition on the public finances will stem from permanent changes to behaviour that feed through to the tax system,” the ministry said. “Primary among these is the loss of significant amounts of tax revenue as the economy shifts away from the use of fossil fuels.” Fuel duty and vehicle excise duty revenues amounted to 37 billion pounds ($51.2 billion) in the 2019/20 financial year, equivalent to 1.7% of economic output, it said. Back in July, the UK’s fiscal watchdog warned that global climate crisis would add 21% of GDP to the national debt by 2050, or £469bn in today’s terms. But that cost will be lower if the government acts quickly. The UK’s 368-page net zero strategy lays out various key policies, including: On Power, the UK will be powered entirely by clean electricity by 2035, “subject to security of supply”. That includes a “final investment decision on a large-scale nuclear plant” by the end of this Parliament, and developing 40GW of offshore wind by 2030. On Heating, there is ‘an ambition’ of new gas boilers being sold by 2035, and £5,000 grants to help households upgrade to low-carbon heating systems (as reported today). Transport includes a “zero emission vehicle mandate” , which sets targets for a percentage of manufacturers’ new car and van sales to be zero emission each year from 2024 That will deliver on the policy to stop the sale of new petrol and diesel cars by 2030, and making all cars must be fully zero emissions capable by 2035. There’s also a pledge to invest £3bn to transform bus services and £2bn for cycling. And on the issue of potentially linking mortgages to green home improvements, the document says that “catalysing the market for Green Finance is a priority”: We are working with mortgage lenders to support homeowners to improve the energy performance of their properties and will publish our response to our lenders consultation in due course. Government is also exploring the case for a further green home finance innovation programme, focussed on supporting lenders to develop green finance products targeted at consumer types who will be impacted by future regulation, and which the market is unlikely to develop on its own in the short term. Greg Hands, Minister of State for Business, Energy and Clean Growth, is laying out the UK’s net zero strategy in parliament. Hands says the UK will embrace the green industrial revolution, and get to the front of the global race to go green. He says the strategy will support 440,000 jobs across the UK in 2030, and leverage up to £90bn of private investment by 2030. But, the strategy has been criticised by Labour’s Ed Miliband, for not going far enough to meet the challenge. My colleague Ben Quinn has more details in our Politics Live blog: The biggest single difference that could be made would be a steet by street retro fit of housings. Miliband criticised Hands for failing to even mention ‘nuclear’ in his statement and asked for the government to say what its position on ‘new nuclear’ was. “The failure to invest does not just affect whether this transition is fair for consumers but also workers in existing industries. Take steel. it will cost £6bn for the steel industry to get to net zero in the next 15 years... but there is nothing for steel in this document.” The Net Zero strategy is online here. In it, Boris Johnson declares: This strategy sets out how we will make historic transitions to remove carbon from our power, retire the internal combustion engine from our vehicles and start to phase out gas boilers from our homes. But it also shows how we will do this fairly by making carbonfree alternatives cheaper. We will make sure what you pay for green, clean electricity is competitive with carbon-laden gas, and with most of our electricity coming from the wind farms of the North Sea or state-of-the-art British nuclear reactors we will reduce our vulnerability to sudden price rises caused by fluctuating international fossil fuel markets. And the report says there are four principles to the UK’s strategy to reach net zero by 2050: We will work with the grain of consumer choice: no one will be required to rip out their existing boiler or scrap their current car We will ensure the biggest polluters pay the most for the transition through fair carbon pricing We will ensure that the most vulnerable are protected through Government support in the form of energy bill discounts, energy efficiency upgrades, and more We will work with businesses to continue delivering deep cost reductions in low carbon tech through support for the latest state of the art kit to bring down costs for consumers and deliver benefits for businesses. Back on the UK supply chain crisis... new data shows that Britain has lost 53,000 HGV drivers over the last four years. The Office for National Statistics has found that the number of lorry drivers has dropped by 16% since its peak of 321,000 in 2016-17, to 268,000 in June. That includes a net fall of 42,000 UK nationals, and 12,000 fewer EU nationals -- a loss that has led to the delays and shortages hitting UK shops and factories. The ONS adds that the bulk of the losses have come since Covid-19 hit the UK. The decrease was greatest during the coronavirus pandemic, with 26,000 (10%) fewer UK nationals employed as HGV drivers in the year ending June 2021 than in the year ending June 2019 (263,000). The number of European Union drivers has also fallen since the start of the pandemic (which also coincides with the move to the Brexit trade deal with the EU). The number of EU nationals employed as HGV drivers had risen to 43,000 in the year to March 2020 (from 40,000 in 2017), but had dropped to 28,000 by this summer. The report also shows that the age group 46 to 55 years has seen the largest decline in HGV drivers. The number of driving tests conducted during the first year of the coronavirus pandemic was the lowest for more than a decade -- after health restrictions forced testing centres to pause work. The Times are reporting that the UK government is planning to link mortgages to compulsory green home improvements Under the proposal, home buyers will have to improve the energy efficiency of their properties as part of their mortgage requirements, as part of the push to cut the carbon footprint of Britain’s housing stock. They say: Mortgage lenders will have to disclose the energy efficiency of homes they lend money for and set themselves targets to improve the insulation of buildings in their portfolio. Ministers hope the plan will encourage lenders to fund homeowners to carry out green improvements when they move into a property, with the money spent added to mortgages and repaid through cheaper bills. However, it will lead to fears that new buyers could find it hard to get a mortgage unless they commit to spending potentially thousands of pounds on home improvements. More here: Government plans to link mortgages to compulsory green home improvements The government is due to publish details of its net zero strategy to reduce CO2 emissions across the economy later today. Despite Bill Gates’s on-stage attempt to double their green tech partnership to £800m, Boris Johnson is sticking to the £400m figure: Here’s today’s pitch to global investors from Anne-Marie Trevelyan, Secretary of State for International Trade: Back at the UK’s global investment summit, the head of the World Trade Organisation has called for a new push to develop a global carbon price. WTO director-general Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala says the current situation is very fragmented, with 68 or 69 jurisdictions having a different approach to carbon tax. Those regimes differ from charging less than a dollar per tonne of carbon dioxide in Ukraine to $130 per tonne in Sweden. Navigating this system is “a bit of a nightmare” for businesses, Dr Okonjo-Iweala says. So, she is advocating that world leaders, perhaps through the G20, should task the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the WTO and the OECD to develop a common methodology to a global carbon price. Okonjo-Iweala explains that this would even boost government revenues: This would really help business, it would help households, it would even help finance ministers - I used to be one. This is a new approach, and i’m very excited about the possibilities. Back in June, the IMF proposed that companies with high greenhouse gas emissions should be subject to a carbon price of $75 a tonne of CO2. Inflation in the UK’s hospitality sector is running at ‘terrifying’ rates, Ian Wright, chief executive of the Food and Drink Federation, tells MPs: Update. Wright told MPs that: The committee really needs to think seriously about inflation. “In hospitality, inflation is running between 14% and 18%, which is terrifying. “If the Prime Minister is, as I know he is, serious about levelling up, inflation is a bigger scourge than almost anything because it discriminates against the poor.” Kate Nicholls, the CEO of UKHospitality, also warned of rising costs in the sector this morning, with further price pressures building. Over in parliament, MPs have been warned that the lorry driver shortages is not improving. Duncan Buchanan, policy director at the Road Haulage Association, has told the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee that the government’s recent measures don’t appear to be having much effect. Buchanan also criticises the UK’s offer of temporary visas to overseas lorry drivers.... ...and last week’s u-turn to allow EU drivers to make more deliveries in the UK, saying they will undermine efforts to lift UK wages: The UK government has formed a partnership with Bill Gates to invest in ‘next generation’ green technologies. The partnership, announced at the Global Investment Summit, will pump money into green technologies that aren’t attracting as much support from investors. This will include green hydrogen (obtained from electrolysis of water), long term energy storage, sustainable aviation fuels and direct air capture of carbon dioxide. The UK government and Gates are putting in £200m each, Downing Street says. Although, there’s some confusion about the size of the project. Johnson double-checked the numbers with Bill Gates on stage, and the Microsoft founder glibly replied that it’s actually £400m each. This display of the business acumen that made Gates one of the world’s richest people startled the PM... ...After joking that he’ll need go back to the chancellor Rishi Sunak for the extra cash, Johnson explains that these technologies could offer ‘real, real hope to humanity’. We want to support direct air capture, longterm battery life, jet zero, and green hydrogen. These are all technologies that have massive potential but they are currently underinvested in, compared to some others. The Government has already committed at least £200m for the development, demonstration and deployment of UK projects in these areas -- and Gates is now matching that cost through his Breakthrough Energy Catalyst project. Gates explains that the “Green Premium” for these technologies are currently very high, (making them currently uneconomic). But by making investments in the UK, in partnership with the government, Gates argues it should be possible to cut the costs of clean technologies so they can compete with and replace the high-emitting products we use today. Gates says: “We will scale those up and bring down that cost, so we’ll get these to the same place we are today with solar and onshore wind, and so they can be scaled up to reduce emissions,. Breakthrough Energy Catalyst brings together a coalition of private investors who want to back innovation to tackle climate change. During his speech, Boris Johnson said the UK had a responsibility to lead the world in decarbonising because it was the first nation to industrialise. Or, as he dubbed it, “We were the first to knit the deadly tea cosy of C02 that is now driving climate change”. The PM says the UK is making “big bets” on electric vehicles and gigafactories for battery production, and also singles out hydrogen: “Hydrogen provides that grunt, so we are making big bets on hydrogen, we are making bets on solar and hydro, and, yes - of course - on nuclear as well, for our baseload.” However... there are concerns that the UK’s hydrogen strategy isn’t green enough, because ministers plan to use ‘blue hydrogen’ (derived from a fossil fuel, methane gas), as well as ‘green hydrogen’. The crux of Johnson’s speech is that Britain is heading into a green industrial revolution, ‘turbocharged’ by Brexit freedoms and his levelling up agenda. He runs through the familiar advantages to encourage investment -- the UK’s timezone, language, rule of law, great universities, its technology “unicorns”, and the cultural and media footprint. In a classic Johnson-ism, the PM says Peppa Pig teaching Americans children to pronounce ‘tomato’ the English way, and say petrol and mummy. There are three contenders for the world number one - Adele, Coldplay, and Ed Sheeran, (a sign of Britain’s cultural heft). And if you’re worried about the weather, he jokes, it rains more in Rome. And he rounds up by citing the scene in Trading Places when the investors stop panicking, and shift from a ‘sell, sell, sell’ mentality to ‘buy, buy, buy’. Now’s the time to buy into the UK..... Johnson calls on business leaders to heed the growing consumer demand for environmentally friendly properties. The market is going green, the PM insists. People know we have technological solutions, and they want to buy them. Johnson says that consumers know that the price of electric vehicles, heat pumps and solar panels will come down sharply, as we’ve already seen with microwaves and mobile phones. The PM adds that when he was a child, 80% of UK energy came from coal, now it’s less than 1%. [although it hit a one-month high last week, when weak wind speeds hit renewable output]. Johnson hails AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Moderna, and the Welsh bottling plant which got the Oxford Covid vaccine out to the public. That factory in Wrexham is owned by the Indian firm Wockhardt, who Johnson says it named after the founder’s family motto to work hard. It was that spirit of hard work that made the vaccine success possible, Johnson continues, arguing that the investors, shareholders, bankers also played a role. It was free market capitalism that helped the world develop the most effective vaccines, Johnson declares. The formula of “Innovation, capitalism, and a strong government lead” is needed again to tackle an even bigger challenge -- climate change. Pointing to the Cop26 summit in Glasgow, Johnson says. The lesson of Covid is absolutely clear. We have to listen to the scientists, they’ve very often right you know. We need urgent government action. But we must mobilise the markets, we must bring in the private sector. I can deploy billions, with the approval of the chancellor*, Johnson deadpans. But the investors here today represent $24trn -- and the PM says each of those dollars is “very welcome to the UK”. * - That’s not a joke. Confidential documents leaked to the Observer last weekend showed an extraordinary rift between Johnson and Rishi Sunak over the potential economic effects of moving towards a zero-carbon economy. The Treasury is warning of serious economic damage to the UK economy and future tax rises if the UK overspends on, or misdirects, green investment, which green experts warn is a ‘one-sided’ view that doesn’t take in benefits such as green jobs, lower energy bills and avoiding the disastrous impact of global heating. Prime minister Boris Johnson is speaking at the Summit now. He starts by citing the display at the Science Museum, such as the Spinning Jenny, as an example of successful innovation. They are the cornflakes that got to the top of the packet, like those of you in the audience, says Johnson, trying to charm the global investors attending today’s shindig. He hails the UK’s development of the Covid-19 vaccine within a year -- it is thanks to that vaccine protection that can meet at the summit and even shake hands again. The ‘lightning speed’ of the vaccine rollout was due to several factors, Johnson says. Scientists at a great university (my own, Johnson mentions immodestly) created an affordable room-temperature vaccine, the government struck a ‘fantastic deal’ that will see 1.5bn doses sent overseas, and the NHS and volunteers who injected it into the nations arms. But there was another factor: Free-market capitalism - the willingness to spend masses sums at risk on something which might not come off. Johnson also argues that ‘vaccine-induced confidence’ is causing the current stresses and strains in global supply chains, with demand surging as economies reopen. And he says the UK is on track for the fastest growth in any advanced economy next year, according to the OECD. [However, that follows one of the worst slumps of any advanced economy in 2020, and the IMF warned last week that the coronavirus crisis will bring more longer-lasting damage to the UK economy than any other country in the G7] The Global Investment Summit is under way at the Science Museum in London. There’s a live feed at the top of this blog. Over in China, the coal price is surging amid the global energy crunch. Prices are rocketing, after Chinese Vice Premier Han Zheng last week ordered state-owned energy giants to secure fuel supplies for winter at any cost, with Beijing planning to build more coal-fired power plants. With the Christmas rush approaching, Asda is seeking to recruit 15,000 people to help with the busiest time of the year for retail. The supermarket giant will be hiring the temporary workers for a raft of roles in its stores and depots and for its home delivery service. About 500 jobs will be based in depots and 1,500 will be home delivery roles, with the remainder being in stores across the UK. More here: Ministers have unveiled plans for £5,000 grants to allow people to install home heat pumps and other low-carbon boiler replacements as part of a wider heat and buildings strategy that some campaigners warned lacked sufficient ambition and funding. Labour also condemned the plans as “more of Boris Johnson’s hot air”, without sufficient substance. Details for the scheme, to be formally set out on Tuesday alongside the government’s net-zero strategy, include £450m committed towards grants to replace boilers, with a pledge that the fund will mean heat pumps should cost no more than boilers to install or run. More widely, the heat and buildings strategy contains a commitment to funding totalling £3.9bn to decarbonise buildings and how they are heated, with a confirmed 2035 target for all new heating systems in UK homes to be energy-efficient. With the crucial Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow starting in a fortnight, the business and energy secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, said recent gas price rises “have highlighted the need to double down on our efforts to reduce Britain’s reliance on fossil fuels and move away from gas boilers over the coming decade”. He said: “As the technology improves and costs plummet over the next decade, we expect low-carbon heating systems will become the obvious, affordable choice for consumers.” However, some environmental groups said more urgent action was needed. Caroline Jones, of Greenpeace UK, said efforts to decarbonise housing were being hampered by “unambitious policies and inadequate funding”. She said: “More money must be provided to rapidly increase the number of homeowners switching to heat pumps over the next few years, with full costs covered for families on low incomes. “A clearer signal would have been a phase-out of new boilers before 2035. And all of this must be delivered with a fully funded, nationwide programme to insulate our homes at a scale and speed that the government hasn’t fully grasped.” British households will be £1,000 worse off next year from a cost of living squeeze created by rising energy prices and shortages of workers and supplies caused by Covid and Brexit, a leading thinktank has warned. The Resolution Foundation said higher levels of inflation would weigh down workers’ earnings next year, contributing to a hit to the average household income in Britain at a time when the government is cutting benefits and raising taxes. It said the average household disposable income, after adjusting for inflation, would be about 2% lower by the end of 2022 relative to forecasts made in March by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), before the surge in shop and energy bill prices. Although the OBR had predicted that household disposable income would rise in 2022, the Resolution Foundation said soaring inflation would mean households would have £1,000 less than originally forecast. “Higher inflation reduces the amount of goods and services that households are able to afford, eroding the real value of incomes.” Britain is deploying its trump card, the Queen, as it tries to woo the world’s largest financial institutions to invest in the UK. Top investors and business leaders attending today’s investment summit will travel to Windsor Castle for a reception attended by the Queen and other senior royals. The government hopes that the royal touch, of drinks and canapés at the Castle, will go down well with investors. The UK is tussling with other European nations to secure green investment deals, notably Paris. France holds an investment summit in recent years --- this summer’s gathering saw 22 new investment projects representing €3.5bn announced. Boris Johnson also told Bloomberg that the UK won’t “pitchfork away” investment approaches from China, saying: China is a gigantic part of our economic life and will be for a long time -- for our lifetimes -- but that does not mean that we should be naive in the way that we look at our critical national infrastructure, the way you look at -- you mentioned nuclear power -- you mentioned 5G technology, those are all legitimate concerns that any government, many, many other governments around the world have. Last month, we reported that ministers were close to removing China from the project to build a £20bn nuclear power station at Sizewell on the Suffolk coast. Johnson also argued that the City has a bright future, despite some major City firms moving jobs abroad since Brexit (such as JPMorgan’s new trading hub in Paris). Johnson insisted that “far fewer” jobs have actually moved than had been suggested: The City of London is crucial not just for our country but for the whole of Europe and for this hemisphere and that’s why -- for the world -- and that’s why I think it’s profoundly in the interests of our partners to ensure that we do have good relations, we do continue to see proper flow of capital and services between London and all the other parts of Europe, and I’m sure that that will continue. If you want to raise money around Europe, if you want to finance your merger or whatever it is, London is still the place to come and always, always will be. Boris Johnson has given an interview to Bloomberg, in which he warns that the COP 26 global climate talks taking place in Glasgow at the end of the month will be “extremely tough”. Asked about his goals for the summit (which China’s Xi Jinping seems unlikely to attend), Johnson says he’s hoping for a “good turnout”, and to “keep 1.5 alive” (the goal of limiting global temperature increases to 1.5 degrees celsius). Johnsons says: I think COP was always going to be extremely tough, we’re hoping that we’ll get a good turnout in spite of the pandemic. What we want people to focus on is their nationally determined contributions, in reducing their CO2, making those hard pledges. Plus we want commitments on coal, cars, cash and trees. So we want the world to move away from coal by 2040 (2030 for the developed nations). We want to make sure that everyone stops using hydrocarbon-fueled internal combustion engine cars and the U.K.’s in the lead there, we said that we would stop that by 2030. We want a big package for the developing world to help countries that haven’t been historic emitters to cut their carbon so we need that 100 billion dollars a year, we need that 100 billion dollars, and the last thing is we want to make sure we plant millions and millions of trees to help to fix the carbon and to restore the balance of nature so those are the -- we need the nationally determined contributions, we need to keep 1.5 alive, we need to restrict the growth in temperatures to 1.5 degrees by the end of the century. We think that with the commitments that we’re seeing we could, we could do it but we’re going to need to see some real action from the participants in Glasgow. However, the signs ahead of Cop26 are’t encouraging, with some sponsors unhappy that the climate summit is “mismanaged” and “very last minute”... The UK’s aviation regulator is curbing Heathrow’s bid to sharply raise passenger charges, as the country’s busiest airport tried to recover from the economic shock of the pandemic. The Civil Aviation Authority has proposed this morning that Heathrow could raise its price per passenger to between £24.50 and £34.40 over the next five years. The range is planned to come in effect from summer 2022, with an interim cap of £30 being introduced at the beginning of the year. Previously the charge was set at £22, so this is still a significant increase - which will ultimately be paid by passengers as airlines add the cost to the price of tickets. But, Heathrow has been pushing for the cap be set at between £32 and £43 per passenger, as it looks to rebound from the plunge in revenues during the pandemic. That move, though, was opposed by airlines who didn’t want to face raising ticket prices to cover higher airport charges, as they also try to recover from Covid-19. The CAA said its proposals, which will be finalised next year, struck the right balance between consumer interests and the airport. Richard Moriarty, Chief Executive at the UK Civil Aviation Authority, said: “While international air travel is still recovering, setting a price control for Heathrow Airport against the backdrop of so much uncertainty means we have had to adapt our approach. Our principal objective is to further the interests of consumers while recognising the challenges the industry has faced throughout the Covid-19 pandemic. These initial proposals seek to protect consumers against unfair charges, and will allow Heathrow to continue to appropriately invest in keeping the airport resilient, efficient and one that provides a good experience for passengers. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Some of the biggest names in business are in town today as the UK pushes for foreign investment in green industries of the future. Boris Johnson is hosting a one-day Global Investment Summit (GIS) where Britain will try to secure global partnerships to support green growth, with more than 200 of the world’s financiers and executives expected to attend. Bill Gates, Goldman Sachs boss, David Solomon; JP Morgan’s Jamie Dimon, Barclays CEO, Jes Staley, BlackRock’s Larry Fink and Blackstone’s Stephen Schwarzman are among the attendees. Prime minister Boris Johnson will be pitching the case for global investment in UK companies, based on green technology and finance. Johnson is due to announce £9.7bn of “new foreign investment” in the UK has been secured at the Global Investment Summit, creating at least 30,000 new jobs. However, the top three “green growth” projects highlighted by the prime minister - and worth a combined £8.5bn - have already been announced by the companies involved. The list includes Spanish utility group Iberdrola investing £6bn in the East Anglia Hub offshore windfarm through its ScottishPower Renewables. The plan, which is said to create 7,000 jobs, was reported back in February -- and is subject to securing planning consent and a government subsidy contract (a Contract for Difference). Iberdrola’s Chairman, Ignacio Galán, says this project would help the UK hit its climate goals: We share the ambition of the Prime Minister’s Ten Point Plan and, following the stable and predictable UK framework, we are committed to playing our part. Our £6bn investment in the East Anglia Hub would be a significant step to achieving enough offshore wind to power every UK home by 2030. Johnson hopes to get more deals nailed down: We will see new partnerships for green growth forged at today’s Global Investment Summit, as we look ahead to COP26 and beyond. Last night, the PM hosted an exclusive dinner for some of the world’s most influential business leaders on Monday evening as he urges them to provide a “rocket boost” for “global Britain”. He looked to woo top investors with a power dinner prepared by the Michelin three-star chef Clare Smyth, which included canapés of jellied eel, chicken liver parfait, pumpkin and white truffle gougères. Smyth’s signature starter of potato and roe, a main course of venison cooked with 16-year-old whisky, and lemon and pear meringue was also on the menu. Also coming up today...

An annual public service in Tokyo to remember the victims of the March 2011 disaster was among a growing number of events called off, one day after the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, said sports, cultural and other large gatherings must be postponed for another 10 days in an attempt to contain the spread. The main memorial service, at the capital’s National Theatre, is usually attended by members of the imperial family, politicians and the relatives of people who died. The anniversary of the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear meltdown in Fukushima came as Japan reported 59 new cases of Covid-19, its biggest one-day rise since the start of the outbreak, public broadcaster NHK said. Total infections in Japan have risen to 1,278 including 696 passengers and crew from the Diamond Princess cruise ship – which was quarantined in the port of Yokohama last month – and 14 people repatriated from China at the start of the outbreak. As of Wednesday, Japan’s death toll stood at 19 from the virus, including seven from the cruise ship. “We have reached an extremely important moment in the prevention of any rapid spread of domestic infections,” Abe told a government task force on Wednesday, the Kyodo news agency reported. “For about 10 days until an expert panel makes a new assessment, I’d like to ask for people’s cooperation.” Japan has closed schools, zoos, museums and theme parks, and drastically scaled back public events since the outbreak. Professional sport has been hit by delays to the start of the baseball, football and rugby seasons, and a major sumo tournament that opened in Osaka at the weekend is being held without spectators for the first time in the sport’s long history. The coronavirus outbreak forced communities that were hardest hit by the tsunami to cancel or postpone memorial services, with some setting up altars for people to lay flowers. Abe, who announced the cancellation last week, said he would lay a wreath and observe moment’s silence at 2.46pm – the time the earthquake struck off the north-east coast – and deliver an address from his official residence. The coronavirus outbreak looks certain to affect the start of the Japan leg of the Olympic torch relay later this month, with concern also mounting that the Tokyo Games, due to open on 24 July, may have to be cancelled or postponed. Olympic organisers are reportedly considering scaling down the domestic section of the torch relay, which is due to begin on 26 March at J-Village, a sports complex located 20km south of the ruined Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. Japan’s government is hoping the torch’s passage through areas of Fukushima will demonstrate that the region is recovering from the nuclear disaster. Many of the 160,000 evacuated residents have yet to return home, however, while work to decommission the nuclear plant has barely begun. There are signs of progress across the disaster zone, where the vast majority of victims were killed by the tsunami. More than 90% of public housing in the three hardest-hit prefectures of Iwate, Miyagi and Fukushima is complete, Kyodo has reported, adding that a railway line closed since the disaster was due to fully reopen at the weekend. About 48,000 people, mostly from Fukushima, have yet to return to their hometowns from among 470,000 people who were initially displaced by the disaster."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2020/apr/22/planet-of-the-humans-review-environment-michael-moore-jeff-gibbs","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2020-04-22T08:32:59Z","webTitle":"Planet of the Humans review – contrarian eco-doc from the Michael Moore stable","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/22/planet-of-the-humans-review-environment-michael-moore-jeff-gibbs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2020/apr/22/planet-of-the-humans-review-environment-michael-moore-jeff-gibbs","fields":{"headline":"Planet of the Humans review – contrarian eco-doc from the Michael Moore stable","bodyText":"Recently, petrolhead pundit Jeremy Clarkson was thought to have disgraced himself by pointing out that the hi-tech sea yacht used by Greta Thunberg for her transatlantic crossing, for all its solar panels and underwater turbines, had an old-fashioned diesel engine aboard for emergencies. I thought about Clarkson’s jibe while watching this refreshingly contrarian eco-documentary from environmentalist Jeff Gibbs, which has been uploaded for free online viewing by its executive producer, Michael Moore. Gibbs has a cheeky habit of going backstage at music festivals that solemnly declare themselves to be using 100% renewable energy, only to find that the fancy array of solar panels behind the tent is enough to power a single bass guitar. The rest of the energy is provided by just plugging into the shameful old electricity grid, provided by fossil fuels. He sees it as symptomatic of the mainstream environmental movement, running on delusional piety. All the green, liberal A-listers – Bill McKibben, Al Gore, Van Jones, Robert F Kennedy Jr – are attacked in this film as a pompous and complacent high-priest caste of the environmental movement, who are shilling for a fossil fuel industry that has sneakily taken them over. (Although it should be said that, for all his radical bravado, Gibbs does not dare criticise Thunberg.) Big Oil and its corporate and banking representatives have, according to this film, found a way to rebrand themselves as green or greenish, to use the green movement for their own ends, and to get their mitts on the huge subsidies that taxpayers around the world are handing over to anyone claiming to be developing renewable energy resources, which turn out to be the same old fossil-fuel entities in different packaging. Solar panels and wind turbines? These provide no energy when there is no sun or wind and degrade after only a few decades, says Gibbs. And in any case they need a lot of fossil fuels in their manufacture: silicon, cobalt, silver, graphite, rare earths – and of course coal. The same goes for manufacturing storage batteries. Factories claiming to have gone “beyond coal” again and again turn out to be relying on natural gas. Corporate behemoths such as Apple make spurious claims for their energy usage. But how about the ultra-fashionable new “renewable” energy source: biomass or wood-chips? This is basically a colossal logging industry that requires a lot of fossil fuel energy to harvest and transport the material. As Gibbs’ interviewees point out, you might just as well as burn the fossil fuels in the first place. And it is laying waste rainforests and areas of natural beauty. This, says Gibbs, is the queasy merger of environmentalism and capitalism – and he makes a refreshingly sceptical case. But he takes it further, suggesting that unfettered capitalism and its insanity of eternal growth on a finite planet is also what is leading us to the cliff edge. True enough, although his comments on overpopulation have an unintentionally ironic chime, in the middle of the Covid-19 outbreak. Most chillingly of all, Gibbs at one stage of the film appears to suggest that there is no cure for any of this, that, just as humans are mortal, so the species itself is staring its own mortality in the face. But he appears to back away from that view by the end, saying merely that things need to change. But what things and how? It’s not at all clear. I found myself thinking of Robert Stone’s controversial 2013 documentary Pandora’s Promise, which made a revisionist case for nuclear power: a clean energy source that (allegedly) has cleaned up its act on safety and really can provide for our wholesale energy needs without contributing to climate change, in a way that “renewables” can’t. Gibbs doesn’t mention nuclear and – a little lamely, perhaps – has no clear lesson or moral, other than the need to take a fiercely critical look at the environmental establishment. Well, it’s always valuable to re-examine a sacred cow. • Planet of the Humans is available on YouTube."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2020/jun/17/john-bolton-book-trump-china-dictators-saudi-arabia","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2020-06-17T22:06:13Z","webTitle":"John Bolton’s bombshell Trump book: eight of its most stunning claims","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/17/john-bolton-book-trump-china-dictators-saudi-arabia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2020/jun/17/john-bolton-book-trump-china-dictators-saudi-arabia","fields":{"headline":"John Bolton’s bombshell Trump book: eight of its most stunning claims","bodyText":"Donald Trump’s former national security adviser John Bolton has made a series of explosive claims about the US president in his new book The Room Where It Happened, according to numerous news reports and an excerpt. Most notably, Bolton claims Trump asked China to use its economic power to help him in the 2020 election, and tried to kill criminal investigations as “favors” for authoritarian leaders he liked. The explosive allegations came after a White House lawsuit sought to block the publication of Bolton’s book. But ahead of its scheduled release next week it has now been leaked to the New York Times and Washington Post, which reported on some of the stunning claims. An excerpt also appeared in the Wall Street Journal. Here are eight of the most shocking revelations: 1 Trump pleaded with China to help win the 2020 election According to the excerpt of Bolton’s book published by the Wall Street Journal, Trump asked China to use its economic power to help him win a second election. In one instance, Trump and President Xi Jinping were discussing hostility to China in the US. “Trump then, stunningly, turned the conversation to the coming US presidential election, alluding to China’s economic capability and pleading with Xi to ensure he’d win,” Bolton writes. “He stressed the importance of farmers and increased Chinese purchases of soybeans and wheat in the electoral outcome. I would print Trump’s exact words, but the government’s prepublication review process has decided otherwise.” 2 Trump suggested he was open to serving more than two terms In another eye-opening exchange published in the Wall Street Journal, Trump also seems to support Xi’s idea of eliminating presidential term limits. “Xi said he wanted to work with Trump for six more years, and Trump replied that people were saying that the two-term constitutional limit on presidents should be repealed for him,” Bolton writes. “Xi said the US had too many elections, because he didn’t want to switch away from Trump, who nodded approvingly.” 3 Trump offered favors to authoritarian leaders Bolton’s book reportedly details cases where Trump tried to kill criminal investigations as favors to authoritarian leaders. One incident published in the Washington Post includes a 2018 discussion with the Turkish president, Recep Erdoğan. Bolton says Erdoğan gave Trump a memo claiming that a Turkish firm under investigation in the US was innocent. “Trump then told Erdoğan he would take care of things, explaining that the southern district prosecutors were not his people, but were Obama people, a problem that would be fixed when they were replaced by his people.” 4 Trump praised Xi for China’s internment camps According to Bolton, Trump was also approving when Xi defended China’s internment of Uighur Muslims in detention camps. “According to our interpreter,” Bolton writes, “Trump said that Xi should go ahead with building the camps, which Trump thought was exactly the right thing to do.” According to leaked Communist party documents published in November, at least 1 million Uighur Muslims are detained in the camps. 5 Trump defended Saudi Arabia to distract from a story about Ivanka Trump made headlines in November 2018 when he released a bizarre statement defending the Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman over the killing of Jamal Khashoggi. It included lines such as “The world is a very dangerous place!” and “maybe he did and maybe he didn’t!” According to Bolton’s book, making headlines was the point. A story about his daughter Ivanka using her personal email for government business was also in the news at the time. After waging war on Hilary Clinton during the 2016 campaign for doing the same thing, Trump needed a distraction. “This will divert from Ivanka,” Trump reportedly said. “If I read the statement in person, that will take over the Ivanka thing.” 6 Trump’s top staff mocked him behind his back From what has been reported, it sounds like Bolton’s book provides one of the clearest insights into the despair of Trump’s top officials behind the scenes. In one example given by the New York Times, Bolton claims he received a note from the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, after Trump’s 2018 meeting with North Korea’s Kim Jong-un, simply saying, “He is so full of shit.” On top of this, Pompeo also allegedly said a month later that Trump’s diplomatic efforts with North Korea had “zero probability of success”. 7 Trump thought Finland was part of Russia Bolton’s book reportedly details some giant holes in Trump’s knowledge. In one instance, Bolton says Trump didn’t seem to know basic knowledge about the UK, asking its former prime minister Theresa May: “Oh, are you a nuclear power?”. On top of this, he also alleges that Trump once asked if Finland was part of Russia, and repeatedly mixed up the current and former presidents of Afghanistan. 8 Trump thought it would be ‘cool’ to invade Venezuela According to the Washington Post, Bolton claims Trump said invading Venezuela would be “cool”, and that the country was “really part of the United States”. • This article was amended on 18 June 2020 because an earlier version referred to Recep Erdoğan as a dictator, rather than as an authoritarian leader."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2022/nov/24/australian-politics-live-federal-icac-nacc-integrity-commission-corruption-watchdog-environment-floods-industrial-relations-vic-qld-nsw","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-24T07:49:16Z","webTitle":"Dutton given official warning by Speaker – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2022/nov/24/australian-politics-live-federal-icac-nacc-integrity-commission-corruption-watchdog-environment-floods-industrial-relations-vic-qld-nsw","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2022/nov/24/australian-politics-live-federal-icac-nacc-integrity-commission-corruption-watchdog-environment-floods-industrial-relations-vic-qld-nsw","fields":{"headline":"Dutton given official warning by Speaker – as it happened","bodyText":"Here are the main stories on Thursday, 24 November: The Albanese government has ordered an investigation into contracts awarded in the government services portfolio, with Bill Shorten declaring parliamentarians using public office to “enrich private mates” is corruption; Traditional owners “angry and disappointed” they were not consulted over Juukan Gorge report response; Controversial Canadian speaker Jordan Peterson visits Parliament House, giving a talk to some Coalition MPs including former prime minister Scott Morrison in a committee room; Columnist Peter Gleeson has left Queensland’s Courier-Mail and Sky News after a series of articles published under his byline were found to contain other people’s work without attribution; The opposition leader Peter Dutton is given an official warning during question time; and The Senate passes the second reading of the territory rights bill. We will see you all again tomorrow morning. Interesting tweet from a pollster who used to very much be inside the Labor tent ahead of Saturday’s Victorian election: Government is ‘breaking the back of the visa backlog’, minister says The minister for trade and tourism, Don Farrell, and the minister for education, Jason Clare, met with International Education and Training finalists at Parliament House today, ahead of the 60th Australian Export Awards tonight. Farrell said: On behalf of the Albanese government, I extend my warmest welcome to all international students studying or planning to study with Australia. We are excited to have you with us, in Australia and around the world. You are such an important part of our proudly diverse society and our global education programs. The Albanese government supports our world-class international education sector and I congratulate the Australian Export Awards International Education and Training finalists. Clare said: International students who study with Australia move the dial. They go on to lead countries, become entrepreneurs and make meaningful change in their communities and around the world. We are breaking the back of the visa backlog. We have also announced an extension of work rights for students who get degrees in areas where we have a skills shortage and students are coming back. It is great to see, but there is still a lot more work to do. Conservative figure wowed by Canberra Jordan Peterson seems to have enjoyed his visit to Parliament House this afternoon, judging from a flurry of photos he’s just posted online – including one happy snap with Scott Morrison inside a politician’s office. Posting a pic of the committee room he spoke in, Peterson added that the empty seats were due to “politicians called to vote”. He also passed judgement on Parliament House’s design itself ... And spoke warmly of an interview he’s taped with Sky News host Rita Panahi, who was also in attendance at the quietly organised speech to conservative MPs. Columnist Peter Gleeson has left Queensland’s Courier-Mail and Sky News after a series of articles published under his byline were found to contain other people’s work without attribution. The Courier-Mail just published a short piece on its website. It reads: Columnist and journalist Peter Gleeson has ended his roles at The Courier-Mail and Sky News. In a personal note to The Courier-Mail editor Chris Jones today Mr Gleeson said: ‘I apologise for breaching News Corp’s Code of Conduct and instances where I have not met the standards required.’ This follows recent examples of material first written by others appearing in articles published under Mr Gleeson’s byline. In his note Mr Gleeson said he had had extraordinary career opportunities during a 34-year career with News Corp and added that ‘it is a fantastic company for which I have the greatest respect.’ On Wednesday, Guardian Australia revealed Gleeson had been caught plagiarising for the third time this month, when it was discovered he had filled almost half his column with the unattributed reporting of a regional ABC journalist. Two days of the campaign to go in Victoria… Judge to consider if police must respond in Kumanjayi Walker inquiry After hearing two days of complex legal argument, NT supreme court judge Judith Kelly has retired to consider whether or not constable Zach Rolfe and other police officers will be able to refuse to answer questions from the coroner investigating the shooting death of 19-year-old Warlpiri man Kumanjayi Walker. Walker was shot three times by Rolfe in the remote NT community of Yuendumu in November 2019. Rolfe was found not guilty of murder and two alternative charges after a six-week trial in the NT supreme court in Darwin earlier this year. Rolfe declined to answer 14 categories of questions about his involvement in the shooting or what counsel assisting the coroner said were “obviously racist” and “sexist and homophobic” texts he exchanged with fellow officers, arguing his answers could expose him to a penalty. Rolfe’s legal team joined a case brought by a fellow police officer, Lee Bauwens, in seeking an injunction restraining the coroner and other parties from calling them to give evidence or answer questions on matters that could give rise to a claim for penalty privilege. Over the past two days they have argued that the coroner does not have the power to compel a person to answer a question, notwithstanding a claim of common law penalty privilege. Judge Kelly has reserved her decision and says she will have a response to all parties within two weeks. Counsel for Rolfe, Luke Officer, explained that the inquest is due to finish for the year on Friday 2 December, and won’t sit again until 23 February. Andrew Boe, representing members of Walker’s families, asked if the judge could give a ruling this week, so that Constable Rolfe would be expedited and brought on next week, so that it was still possible for the inquest “to achieve what it had programmed”. Judge Kelly said she would “not be in a position to do that”. Rolfe and his fellow officers will now not appear at the inquest in any capacity until February, and the inquest is set to run well beyond its original finishing date of early 2023. It is the afternoon, meaning it is time for an Afternoon Update: Coalition pro-nuclear group meet in Canberra The Parliamentary Friends of Nuclear Industries is meeting in Parliament House today to hear from hand-picked experts about why we need small modular nuclear reactors. The chair, National MP David Gillespie, told the gathering that nuclear is the way to “settle the battle” between “climate and energy”, fighting climate change and achieving our energy needs. Gillespie says that households getting electricity from the Ontario Power Generation company were paying 4.5c kw/h compared with 35-45c in Australia. Steven Wilson, University of Queensland adjunct professor and the author of ‘What would be required for nuclear energy plants to be operating in Australia from the 2030s’, said that he was “pleasantly surprised” to discover nuclear is possible here. Over 30 years, he said the estimated cost would be 7.5c kw/h, a little higher at the start (10c), a little lower at the tail (6c). And would taxpayers be required to help get it going? Wilson: It’s definitely the case that there is an important role for government in the development and the financing and the support of nuclear power technology. But as his report notes: Australian governments are already underwriting all wind and solar capacity (through various laws and schemes), new pumped hydro (2000 MW Snowy 2.0), new open-cycle gas peaking plant (660 MW Kurri Kurri), batteries and new transmission investments. Deputy chair, Bob Katter, delivered some brief remarks and left early, blaming a bout of food poisoning. Katter complained households were paying more than $3,000 for electricity, when they should be paying “no more” than $674, a figure based on his experience as Queensland mines and energy minister in 1989. Katter said solar sounds like a “great idea” but would see the households that can’t afford solar subsidising the grid for those who can. Keith Pitt, a former resources minister, asked about the possibility of replacing coal power plants with nuclear, noting that not all would be suitable but “some would”. Robert Parker, a civil engineer and former past president of the Australian Nuclear Association, agreed this would help bring the cost down by using the existing grid rather than expanding it, and keeping people employed in coal communities. The rest of the crowd is a Coalition who’s who: Liberal leader Peter Dutton, former DPM Barnaby Joyce, the shadow energy minister, Ted O’Brien, David Van, Richard Colbeck, Ian Goodenough, James Stevens, Anne Webster, Susan McDonald, Kevin Hogan, Terry Young, Pat Conaghan, and Colin Boyce, to name a few. If there are any Labor friends of nuclear power, none of them are here. Greens criticise government over attending grassland clearing meeting David Shoebridge, Greens senator and justice spokesperson, has criticised the federal environment department for allowing the National Farmers’ Federation to attend a meeting about an investigation into clearing of native grasslands against the warnings of their own officials. Guardian Australia revealed details of the 5 April 2019 meeting about an investigation into Jam Land, a company part-owned by the then energy minister Angus Taylor and his brother Richard. The meeting was attended by the department’s then deputy secretary Dean Knudson, its chief compliance officer, Monica Collins, the Jam Land director, Richard Taylor, the NFF’s chief executive, Tony Mahar, and another official. Officials in the department warned allowing the NFF to attend could breach the commonwealth prosecutions policy. There is no suggestion that Richard Taylor did anything wrong by attending the meeting. Shoebridge said there was “no credible reason” for the department to allow the NFF “to be in this meeting and having any input into the decision of the department on whether or not it will prosecute”: This fresh material demands clear answers and accountability from the department in order to restore trust in their incredibly important regulatory work. Environment groups, meanwhile, said it highlighted the need for a “genuinely independent” environment protection agency. The federal government has promised to establish an EPA as part of its response to the 2020 review of national environmental laws. Nathaniel Pelle, a nature campaigner at the Australian Conservation Foundation, said “it is not appropriate for a regulator to meet with an industry lobby group to discuss an open compliance investigation”. This demonstrates the need for a national EPA that is genuinely independent and has backbone – one that the public can have confidence in. Tim Beshara, of the Wilderness Society, called it “another case study to add to the tomes of why we need an independent EPA”. The environment department has said its approach to managing potential breaches of national environmental law was outlined in its compliance policy. It said: Consistent with this policy, the department does not comment on methodologies used or how they are used during individual matters. The relevant compliance action is currently before the federal court of Australia in relation to an application made under section 480K of the EPBC Act and, as a result, we will not comment any further. The National Farmers’ Federation has said it “routinely helps farmers navigate complex regulatory matters with federal departments. That’s part of our job.” Victorian Coalition makes debt promise The Victorian opposition has pledged that the state’s net debt will be $10.4bn lower than Labor before the end of the next parliamentary term if a Coalition government is elected at the weekend. The Coalition has released its election commitment costings ahead of Victorians going to the polls on Saturday. The costings have been audited by the parliamentary budget office. The opposition’s costings estimate a $2.1bn budget surplus in the 2024-25 financial year. Labor has forecasted a $1.05bn surplus the following year. But the opposition has not revealed what the total dollar figure is for its election commitments, despite Victorians heading to the ballot box in less than two days. Bet the Andrews government think this is a stinker of an idea… Update on review of RBA We’ve had an update today from the three members on the review panel examining the operations of the Reserve Bank. It’s the first forensic look at the country’s central bank since the 1990s, and timely of course given how active the RBA has been in the past few years. First up, we learnt the panel provided a briefing yesterday to the shadow treasurer Angus Taylor. (We’ve asked what he made of it.) Anyway, treasurer Jim Chalmers has chimed in, saying it was “really gratifying to see the high level of engagement in the RBA Review from right across the community”. “The government wants the review to be as bipartisan as possible - that’s why I’ve ensured the opposition has been kept up-to-date on its progress,” he said. Announced in July, the review is about half way through its work, with a final report due to be handed to the government by March. The three panelists - Canadian professor Carolyn Wilkins, ANU professor Renee Fry-McKibbin and former professor Gordon de Brouwer - gave a lengthy and fairly candid discussion about progress to a lunch organised in Sydney today by CEDA. So, there’s 100-plus submissions and 220 people consulted, meetings with RBA present and former staffers and so on. Not much chance of a summer holiday for the panelists but interestingly apparently nobody asked for the RBA to give up its traditional January holiday when the board hits the beaches or the bush (or wherever they repose). If anything, the board should meet less often, submissions have said. (That would echo the mood of anxious borrowers checking their pulses and bank balances at 2.30pm AEST/AEDT every first Tuesday for those other 11 months of the year.) The RBA board didn’t meet in January 2008 as the Global Financial Crisis began unfolding so I suppose January breaks are sacred. We’ll have a separate article published soonish, but the three panelists outlined the big issues - if not yet committing which way they will lean on them. These range from whether the RBA should target more than the inflation rate over time (they now try to keep it within a 2%-3% spread) and full employment. Also, what qualifications or skills should the board members have and how should they be selected? And even whether the RBA needs to be split since monetary policy and market operations (and all the HR and other processes) may require different skills. Should other goals be added too, such as asset bubble avoidance (a largely unwritten responsibility shared with Apra). How should climate shocks be prepared for? (See this week’s State of the Climate report and our accompanying report for a litany of wha’s underway). How the RBA communicates its various messages (and how should it respond when the public is mishearing them) are central to the review. Today’s panel discussions, at least, suggest an encouragingly open debate awaits. AFP asked Pavlou to leave Parliament House yesterday The Australian federal police has now said it was behind the decision to ask activist Drew Pavlou to leave Parliament House yesterday. In a new statement this afternoon, the AFP said the request for Pavlou to leave came “after a direction was issued by the AFP security controller at APH”. It was earlier unclear who had asked for Pavlou to leave, and why, with the AFP, the Department of Parliamentary Services and the presiding officers of parliament all either denying involvement or not commenting. The AFP said in a statement: The individual referred to was not banned from APH yesterday, and was told yesterday he could return closer to his appointment at APH. The AFP has engaged today with the individual, who was clear about his intentions at APH and gave an undertaking about his conduct while at APH. Pavlou returned to Parliament House today and was allowed to enter without incident. “The job of the AFP is to ensure the safety and security of APH,” the AFP statement said. Here is our earlier story about Pavlou being ordered to leave: Australia claims its first female astronaut Dr Meganne Christian has been selected as one of 11 reserve astronauts – alongside five career astronauts and the first para-astronaut – as part of the European Space Agency’s 2022 astronaut class. The UK-born researcher moved to Australia aged five and attended Illawarra Grammar school in Wollongong. In 2009, she received a bachelor of engineering from the University of New South Wales and in 2014 completed a PhD there on hydrogen storage. However, Christian currently works at the Italian National Research Agency, and holds UK, New Zealand and Italian citizenship. Ed Husic, the minister for industry and science, said in a statement: “Dr Christian’s selection is further evidence of the extraordinary scientific talent that we generate through our education and university system here in Australia. We know we need more young Australians, particularly women and people from diverse backgrounds, to enter the Stem workforce. Role models like Dr Christian will help show girls and young women that they can dream big. The head of the Australian Space Agency, Enrico Palermo, said in a statement: We often refer to space as the gateway to Stem because of its ability to ignite curiosity – and what does that more than knowing someone who grew up right here in Australia might one day end up in space. This also presents a great opportunity for Australia to build on our relationship with the European Space Agency and UK Space Agency. As a reserve, Christian will continue in her day job but will receive astronaut training from the European Space Agency. Thank you Amy Remeikis for your masterful performance. On that note, I am going to hand you over to Nino Bucci who will take you through the rest of the afternoon. The house will take a short breather after it rises tonight, but the senate is all systems go. We will bring you all the details as they happen, as always. Hope you are ready for the final week of parliament because I am not! I’ll chat to you all very soon – take care of you. Unconventional policies, high-performing staff: RBA in review Wondering how the Reserve Bank of Australia review is going? The panel has provided an update on what themes it is hearing emerge from its review so far: The panel is seeing a number of themes emerging which it is currently analysing. On monetary policy frameworks, the panel has heard deep support for monetary policy to continue to be conducted by an independent central bank. There has been general, but not universal, support for a flexible inflation targeting framework, which is seen to have contributed to strong economic outcomes over the last 30 years. Several suggestions have been put to the panel for how to specify that framework more clearly. On the RBA’s performance, there have been criticisms of the Bank’s approach to implementing the framework and communicating its decisions over recent years. These have focussed on periods of undershooting and overshooting the inflation target as well as the use of unconventional monetary policies. On governance, the panel has heard suggestions for ways to increase the clarity of the board’s role and strengthen its accountability and composition to support effective future monetary policy decision making. On the RBA as an institution, the panel has heard that the RBA has high‑performing, collegiate staff who are dedicated to public service. It has received suggestions for ways that the Bank’s culture could be strengthened, including to increase internal debate and openness to outside ideas. Haines ‘disappointed’ over lack of support from major parties on integrity bill Dr Helen Haines has released a statement on the integrity bill and the lack of government support for her amendments: I am a vocal supporter of this bill which will establish a powerful anti-corruption commission. But it can be better. My amendments would have made the National Anti-Corruption Commission stronger, more independent, more transparent and set it up for success for years to come,” Haines said. The amendments moved by Haines included: • Removing the ‘exceptional circumstances’ clause for holding public hearings • Making it mandatory for the commissioner to consider certain factors when deciding whether to hold a public hearing, including unfair prejudice to a person’s reputation, privacy, safety or wellbeing caused from a public hearing • Explicitly include pork-barrelling in the definition of corrupt conduct included in the commission’s remit • Strengthening oversight and transparency of the commission’s budget so future governments would be prevented from starving the commission of funding • Increasing the independence of the parliamentary committee’s role when approving the appointment of the commissioner, deputy commissioner and inspector. These amendments were supported by members of the crossbench and the member for Bass Bridget Archer, but were opposed by the Labor, Liberal and National parties. I am disappointed that the major parties did not support them, but I am still hopeful that similar amendments will be successful in the Senate. These amendments are supported by integrity advocates and received support through the committee inquiry process and should be considered seriously when the Senate debates the bill next week. The four moods of QT, as caught by Mike Bowers: Chevron to end Australian of the Year Awards partnership Fossil fuel energy giant Chevron has confirmed it will not be renewing a controversial sponsorship deal with the National Australia Day Council when the current three-year deal runs out. Chevron has been the “National Diversity and Inclusion” partner of the Australian of the Year Awards since 2020 with the current deal ending in June 2023. Climate campaigners have been pushing the council to end the deal – the value of which has never been disclosed. But Chevron denied its decision was linked to a broad pushback against fossil fuel sponsorship in sports and the arts. In a statement, the company said: In August 2022, we advised the National Australia Day Council that we would not seek to renew the partnership when our current agreement ends in June 2023. We acknowledge there has been commentary about the support provided by the energy industry to arts and cultural programs and events, however, our decision is based on our focus to support the needs of the most vulnerable members of the communities where we live and work. The statement said its three-year support was for a “range of programs designed to inspire and promote inclusion, foster unity and connect people of all ages and backgrounds”. As part of the deal, Chevron also had one representative on state selection panels – each with either 10 or 11 members – for Australians of the Year in Western Australian, Northern Territory, and Queensland. Belinda Noble, the founder of climate campaign group Comms Declare that launched a petition against the sponsorship this week, welcomed the “parting ways” but said “these arrangements should never be allowed to happen in the first place”. Australia was a leader in stopping the promotion of tobacco. Global warming is now our biggest health challenge and banning all fossil fuel sponsorships is the next logical step. We need a tobacco-style ban on all fossil fuel sponsorships to disentangle our public institutions from this polluting influence. And then question time is brought to an end. Until next week. Aren’t we all so lucky? Then we get to the pointy end of the Julie Collins campaign. Russell Broadbent asks: Question is to the minister for small business: can the minister confirm to the House that under Labor’s extreme industrial relations changes, small businesses such as a hardware store, a hairdresser, a cafe, a butcher, could be compelled to bargain together with a large supermarket if they’re located inside the same shopping centre as that large supermarket? Milton Dick has also had enough: Look. No, I don’t want the question again. The question is clearly directed to the wrong minister. With industrial relations, I’m just saying, if the minister chooses to have someone also supplement the answer because she’s not directed to her responsibilities under the standing orders, I invite the minister ... I’m not ruling the question out of order. I invite the minister to take the question. Julie Collins has also had enough: And I do thank the member opposite for his question. As I have said clearly in this place, more than two million businesses will be exempt from the single interest stream the member is referring to, in terms of the industrial relations bill. Can we also ... remind the house, Mr Speaker ... There are so many interjections, Dick steps in again and gives Peter Dutton an official warning: I can’t be clearer. When a minister is on her feet, within barely seconds into the answer, it’s unacceptable for the yelling, for the interjections. Collins: And as I have said earlier in this week, in this place, Mr Speaker, there are other thresholds that need to be met. One of those is of course that the Fair Work Commission would say they have the same single interest. That would not be the case in the example the member actually refers to. Bob Katter has a question. The chamber holds its breath. Katter continues to read out the subject of the question: Resources and Northern Australia: minister, would you agree that 92% of Australia, only 1.2 million people, is an area bleeding. Three-quarters of Australia’s water is in north Queensland’s inland, not its coast. The Hughenden dam, 13 schemes, each worth $300m a year. Why not HipCo dam now, minister? Madeleine King: I thank the member for Kennedy for his question. I do note the question goes to water infrastructure. Which is a shared – I will get to your – I know what you’re getting at, member for Kennedy. It has intersections with the minister for infrastructure but equally the minister for the environment and water. But also of course as you pointed out, this is a lot to do with northern development and Northern Australia. So more than happy to answer that question as best I can. As for the statistics you mention in the question, I am not about that, but I’m really happy to take that away and look at it and get back to your office. But you have mentioned HipCo and the Hughenden dam. I note your long standing concern around water security right across Queensland and in your seat of Kennedy. It’s appropriate there’s water security for that region, I entirely agree with the member in that regard. You have had a long interest in the Hughenden irrigation scheme and so have many members in this place. You would be aware, funding for that scheme does remain in the budget. However there’s a number of steps to be taken. Sufficient water allocation must be obtained from the Queensland government, I understand this is a process that government is undertaking right now and with vigour. Also infrastructure Australia, which of course is the minister for infrastructure’s responsibility, will be assessing the business case in relation to the Hughenden. We’re happy as a government to engage with any member of the parliament on any of their requests for water infrastructure and other infrastructure, particularly those in the Northern Australia seats on any project they think has value and can add to the economic and social involvement north. I’m really – member for Kennedy, we have spoken many times on many of the projects that are of benefit to Northern Australia and I know all relevant ministers will continue to do the same. This government is more than happy to engage actively and look at projects that are brought forward, but they do need to be supported by a proper business case and the really need to be engaged with the state and territory governments involved. Governments need to work together to make projects like the Hughenden project, the HipCo project go ahead. Katter is back on his feet. Does he have a point of order? No. I don’t want – I bypassed the brilliant and gracious lady who is the minister for water. I just think it’s more northern development, that’s all. Paul Fletcher to Julie Collins: Can the minister confirm that a small business specialising in importing and exporting whose workforce includes 12 Australian-based employees and eight workers overseas in an associated entity of that business could be compelled into multi-employer bargaining under Labor’s extreme industrial relations changes? Milton Dick: Before I call the minister, that question was clearly directed to the minister but contains the responsibilities of another minister. But I will give her the call. If she wishes to transfer the question under practice, she’s able to do so. Just want to remind members it’s very clear for ministers, whoever they are, to transfer answers to another minister. I give her the call. The deputy leader of the opposition is constantly interjecting. By right of her position, which I respect, she’s entitled to certain latitude. But that latitude is really pushing against the wall at the moment. I give the minister the call. Collins: Thank you, Mr Speaker. And I thank the member opposite for that question. Of course, as he will know, it is the responsibility of the workplace relations minister, he well knows more than 2 million businesses will be exempt from the provisions they’re so concerned in terms of the single interest stream bargaining provisions. More than two million businesses will be exempt from this provision and I’ll happy to hand over to the minister for workplace relations in terms of this particular question. Tony Burke: I wish them they would direct them to me. Australian workplace laws covers Australian businesses and the people employed in Australia. The independent member for North Sydney, Kylea Tink, has a question: My question is to the minister for climate change and energy: It is currently estimated there are over 20m motor vehicles in Australia powered by internal combustion engines. These engines are running on some of the dirtiest fuel in the world. Please tell us when the Australian government will take action to ensure the quality of our petrol will meet international best standards? Chris Bowen: I’m very pleased to confirm to the honourable member that the government is currently as we speak consulting on fuel quality standards, particularly in relation to Euro standards. The process has begun. And that is the matter for the climate change portfolio for those opposite who don’t understand government arrangements. The minister for transport and I are working closely on the related matter of fuel efficiency standards, two separate programs, very closely related, but quite separate, in terms of their implementation. Fuel efficiency standards are those which encourage and require manufacturers to send electric vehicles to Australia and other low emissions vehicles. Perhaps low emissions vehicles and electric vehicles like utes that do exist around the world and are available in many countries around the world, not currently available in Australia because we lack fuel efficiency standards. They do exist. And they’re available else where, but because of 10 years of policy indolence they’re not available in Australia. It’s important our fuel efficiency standards are best practice. And our fuel quality standards are best practice. This government is in its first six months has started the process of reviewing both. It is important we consult with manufacturers, with motoring groups, I met with motoring groups, as did the Minister for Transport, just yesterday, and talked about exactly these two matters. In the normal consultative way of government. Tink is back: It’s on the point of relevance. I specifically asked about petrol vehicles. I appreciate if the minister can give an answer on petrol. Bowen returns to that part of the question: In relation to the honourable member’s exact question, I only began the consultation process a couple of weeks ago. That process is nearing its ends. After I read through all the submissions and assessed all the evidence, I will make a decision and announce it. Here is that question: A Canberra small business owner has told Nine News he’s worried the government’s industrial relations changes will mean he has to increase prices. It means the prices of your schooner, your pints will go up and your parmis will go up. Will the minister guarantee the small businesses won’t have to increase prices as a result of Labor’s extreme industrial relations changes? Julie Collins: I thank the member opposite for his question. Small businesses have been doing it tough and we know they’re facing rising increases in their costs. We do know that they are dealing with rising energy prices and they’re dealing with rising interest rates. We also know, of course, that they are having trouble attracting staff. We know there’s massive staff shortages which is why we’re also moving in terms of increasing skilled migration, in terms of increasing fee-free Tafe places, to make sure that we have the workforce available for small businesses. We’re also, Mr Speaker, of course, we are changing industrial relations laws to make it easier, simpler, and cheaper for small businesses to be able to engage in enterprise bargaining. That’s what we’re doing. We want to make sure that small businesses get the benefits for the productivity increases that come from bargaining with their employees. That is what the secure jobs better pay is all about. It’s also about making sure that the workers in these positions are able to get their first pay rise in almost a decade. It is all happening in the chamber. Angus Taylor stepped up to ask his question, while Speaker Milton Dick repeatedly said he hadn’t given him the call yet, which Taylor, despite being about 20cm away, didn’t hear Dick say, and kept reading his question despite his microphone being off. The responses to what has happened in the chamber are coming thick and fast today! Max Chandler-Mather has responded to what the resources minister had to say in answer to his question: With climate-fuelled floods hitting so much of the country and a State of the Climate report detailing the devastating effects of climate change, it’s genuinely shocking to hear the government support exporting coal and gas past 2050. This abandons coal and gas workers to a vicious private market and makes a mockery of Labor’s net zero by 2050 target. In actual news, epidemiologist Mary-Louise McLaws has emerged to comment on Covid for the first time since she disappeared from public view early this year to treat her brain cancer, with a submission to the long Covid inquiry. Just wait until the senator sees me when I’ve run out of Milo to eat out of the tin. Now that is a meltdown. What a room. David Littleproud kicks off with a question that leads to a lot of back and forth in the chamber: My question is to the minister representing the minister for agriculture. I refer to a northern Australia cattle properties that employs 20 ringers. If a representative for cattle ringers and station hands from that property successfully applies to the Fair Work Commission to bargain a single interest agreement, could all cattle properties in Northern Australia be [subject] to multi-employer bargaining? Tony Burke steps up: Just an on a point of order, the question goes specifically to the interaction of businesses with a piece of legislation that is entirely within a different portfolio. Happens to be mine. But this question is directed to the wrong minister. And then Paul Fletcher steps in: It’s very clear that what this goes to is the impact on businesses within the sector for which the minister representing the minister for agriculture is responsible. And that’s why she’s the appropriate minister to be asked this question and to answer it. Milton Dick (who sounds like he has aged about 100 years this week) This issue has come up a couple of times this week. Practice makes it clear where a question may involve, on page 549, may involve the responsibility of more than one minister, should be directed to the minister most responsible. However, a minister may direct the question without question. May direct his answer or her answer without question. I will allow … I will allow the minister under the standing orders to answer the question and then another minister may respond as well. Catherine King steps up: I’m proud of the Albanese Labor government’s first budget – a billion dollars has been put into the agricultural sector to make sure we’re growing that sector and protecting it from the biosecurity threats we’ve seen with foot and mouth disease and lumpy skin disease. The question asked is an industrial relations question so I will refer that question to the industrial relations minister to answer. And then Burke is back! First of all the example they asked, they have given, the example they have given as I heard it refers to a single employer making an application with respect to the single interest stream. It starts with multiple employers, that’s the way it works. Are these rules meant to be able to reach agriculture? Yeah. Absolutely. Because those opposite presided over a time when horticulture workers were … when some of the worst examples of wage theft were coming from that exact sector. Not because of the farmers themselves but because of the labour hire firms, rorting the systems, where the farmers thought they were paying decent wages, they were being charged for them, but there was a rort happening that was never meeting the worker. I met with workers, I remember meeting Kate on a visa here from Taiwan, fishing out of the bins beside the supermarket to get food, and she had a full time job. Because that’s what was happening under the laws of those opposite. So when the prime minister before gave the example that this act ... that’s been proposed by the government, the amendments to the fair work act, will make it you can no longer advertise work for less than the legal minimum rate of pay, you bet we’re in favour of it. You bet that will get in the way of some rorts that have been happening. You should be representing all the people in your electorate. Including the workers who have been underpaid. Sussan Ley’s office is VERY quick off the mark with a press release after that question and answer. It is almost like they had it planned! It is clear the Albanese Government doesn’t take small business seriously and Australian small businesses are paying the price,” the deputy leader said. Minister Collins is supposed to be the voice for small business around the Cabinet Table, how can she speak up for small businesses if she doesn’t know basic details about small business programs? Julie Collins is just not up to the task of minister for small business.” Sussan Ley to Julie Collins: I refer to the flood-hit town of Eugowra, which the prime minister visited this week. And the flood-hit town of Moama in my electorate of Farrer. If a small business in Eugowra or Moama is rebuilding next year, will they be able to specifically access the regional small business support program? Collins: I thank the member opposite for her question. We’re concerned by communities that have been impacted by floods. We know they’ve been doing it incredibly tough. That’s why we did move as quickly as we could to make sure that assistance was available for those communities. Indeed, we’re investing $1bn over five years to mitigate potential disasters and loss and damage through the government’s new disaster ready fund. We’re concerned about it. And we have also of course moved in each of the states that have recently had floods in Tasmania, in Victoria, and in New South Wales, to make small business grants available for those communities, Mr Speaker.” Ley has a point of order. Dick says it is not a point of order. Collins: And we had been moving to support small businesses as I said in this place earlier in the week, we have also moved ..to make sure that programs that were due to end at the end of this year on 31 December that those opposite didn’t continue to fund about mental health and wellbeing and the small business debt hotline, we’re not continuing with, we found more than $10m in the last budget to make sure those programs could continue. We are looking at all of the programs to make sure that we are supporting small businesses in every way possible to come out of the floods and we’ll continue to do so, Mr Speaker. Anthony Albanese takes a dixer on “achievements of the Albanese government over the last six months”. That sound you hear is my eyes rolling so far back in my head they hit my heels. The Greens MPs Max Chandler-Mather has a question for Madeleine King: You previously said you supported Australia exporting coal beyond 2050, and they said they would be able to pump gas for hundreds of years. Minister, does the government still support exporting coal beyond the middle of this century, and do you support the pumping of gas for hundreds of years? King: The truth is and the prime minister has said this and the government has always said this, the decision if coal would be exported from this country and bought by others, were made in board rooms right around the world and north Asia. This is an export industry that’s been operating in this country since 1801. It supports tens of thousands of people in communities right up and down the east coast and to disregard them as you tend to do, member for Griffith, and your cam comrades is disingenuous to those communities. Chandler-Mather has a point of order: Just on relevance. Just trying to find out if the government supports exporting coal or not. Baseless accusations about the Green’s policy on coal and gas... Milton Dick rules that is not a point of order. King: I was just pointing out to the member for Griffith the history of this country and the very important export industry and it will remain an important export industry. The member will do well along with his friends and colleagues to visit some of the communities up and down the east coast so they can see exactly the hard work that goes into the coal export industry. We’ve got the member for Hunter, a former coal miner and worked in the coal industry, I’ve been done a coal mine with him and I can see the very hard work the community supports. Gas exports are very important to this country, not only to towns like Karratha and Onslow and Broome, we’re very important to our regional neighbours. Countries across Asia depend on Australia for their energy security. We’ll remain a reliable and trustworthy supplier of energy to our neighbours for so long as we need to be. Bridget Archer to Julie Collins: Minister, under Labor’s extreme industrial relations changes, small and medium businesses will need to pay between $14,000 and $75,000 when dragged into compulsory multi-employer bargaining. Given small and family businesses are already facing higher interest repayments and rising energy prices, can the minister inform the House what financial assistance the government will provide to these Australian businesses to help them meet … these new costs? Collins: I thank the member for Bass for her question. There’s no doubt I’ve said in this place that small businesses have been doing it tough. They’re dealing with rising – increased prices and they are doing it tough in terms of increasing mortgages and increased energy prices. What we’re doing in terms of the better pay secure jobs, we’re trying to actually support small businesses and give them what they want. What we’re doing here is giving them access to enterprise bargaining that will improve productivity and give businesses the benefit of negotiating with their employees. And indeed, when you go to the regulatory impact statement, Mr Speaker, and you do keep reading, it says and I’m going to quote from it, Mr Speaker, it says, “the significant benefits of being covered by an enterprise agreement and the cost that may be associated with remaining covered by a modern award outweigh the additional costs for businesses to engage in a new multiple employer bargaining streams. Not to mention, Mr Speaker, that most small businesses are going to you co-operative stream, where they can get off the shelf type products and that will cost them very little and that’s where we think small businesses will go. Bill Shorten: The Age and Sydney Morning Herald have today reported the member for Fadden used his status as a federal MP in 2017 and 2018 to help the lobbying and consulting firm Synergy 360. To help them sign up corporate clients with the promise of helping them navigate the federal public service and political system and meet key decision makers including senior coalition ministers. Specifically it was reported that emails reveal that Synergy 360 would frequently update corporate clients as to the progress and lobbying and providing access to senior government officials for the allocating and rewarding of several multimillion-dollar contracts. A Mr David Milo is Synergy’s CEO. A major shareholder is Mr John Mardieson. He’s a former business partner for the member for Fadden. The member for Fadden has been a director of a separate business of ... Mr Mardrison. However Synergy 360 is not a registered lobbyist. Stuart Robert is interjecting and Paul Fletcher gets up with a point of order: Mr Speaker, practice is very clear about personal reflections on other members of the House. And it also is very clear on - very clear on ... On page 515 that members can only direct a charge to other members or reflect on their conduct in a vote of the House. What the minister is doing is out of order. Milton Dick asks Shorten to return to the question. Shorten: The leaked emails reveal that Synergy 360 was lobbying for corporations in relation to lucrative government contracts including in the portfolios I’m now responsible for. Therefore, this morning, I have asked the CEO of Services Australia, and the CEO of the National Disability Insurance Agency to immediately and thoroughly investigate any of the contracts awarded to these companies and individuals named in these reports. To assure me and the Australian people that the process was entirely above board and appropriate. And in conclusion, I want to say to Australians listening to this, the Albanese government believes the job of an MP is to work for infrastructure constituents, not your former business partners. When there’s career lobbying as revealed by the emails, companies are required to be on the lobbyist register. This is not an option. But most importantly, using public office as a politician to enrich your private friends and mates including political donors is not a shade of grey...whether you’re a backbencher or a frontbencher is not - if and when public office, if and when public office has been used to enrich private mates, it’s corruption. We now have a shake up in proceedings. Labor MP Julian Hill asks Bill Shorten a question: My question is to the minister for government services: In light of today’s reports about previous contracting and tendering processes in services Australia and the NDIS, what is the Albanese Labor government doing to ensure federal government contracts are allocated in a proper manner that will ensure transparency for the Australian people? Paul Fletcher, the leader of opposition business in the house, stands up to object: On the point of order goes to the proper content of a question. The minister can be asked about matters for which the minister is responsible in public administration. But not about the practice of the previous government which is expressly what this question went to. Tony Burke steps up to rebut Fletcher: To the point of order, I don’t know how this one could be out of the order and any of the questions asked about the opposition could be in order. This refers to media reports of the day that practice specifically says it can be referred to in questions, and asked specific what actions the Albanese Labor government is taking. They’re the terms of the question. Milton Dick rules Shorten can answer: Practice does say on 557 recording media reports and the minister can answer questions on standing order 98 regarding public affairs and administration. The question does contain his portfolio and how it impacts on his portfolio. It’s in order and I give him the call. Ooft, straight into it and Peter Dutton is wearing his new glasses, so you know he is serious. We haven’t seen Dutton ask a question in a while, so it is a little surprising to see him open the proceedings. Dutton: My question is to the prime minister: before the election the prime minister promised cheaper electricity prices, cheaper gas prices, and cheaper mortgages. since the election the prime minister has mentioned nothing in relation to those promises, instead your actions have delivered the opposite. Now to make a bad situation worse, you’re imposing a job-destroying industrial relations system at exactly the wrong time for our economy. Why, like Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard, does this prime minister get every economic call wrong? Anthony Albanese: I thank the leader of the opposition for his first question in three days. And congratulate him on getting that decision through his tactics committee. I did think that – I know Matthew Guy wants him to have a vow of silence ... And he’s not welcome in Victoria. But I welcome the leader of the opposition here to ask a question about industrial relations. Because his deputy said yesterday, said a couple of times, ‘We think the entire bill is terrible.’ That is their position on industrial relations. “The entire bill is terrible.” Well, let’s have a look at what they say is terrible. In the legislation. Putting gender equality and job security at the heart of the Fair Work Commission’s decision making. Putting it in the objectives of the ACT. They say that’s terrible. Banning pay secrecy clauses, a tool that’s been used to hold down women’s pay in particular. That’s terrible as well. Giving the commission the expertise and the powers to end the historical inequality between the pay and conditions in female dominated care and community sectors and the pay ask conditions enjoyed by the rest of the workforce. They say that’s terrible as well. Expanding access to flexible work arrangements. Particularly for women. They say that’s terrible as well. Especially prohibiting sexual harassment in the Fair Work Act. They say that’s terrible as well. Placing new limits on rolling fixed term contracts so that workers can’t be effectively put on an endless probation period. They say it’s terrible for workers to get back entitlements. Banning job ads advertised for below the relevant minimum pay rate. Do they support that? No, they say that’s terrible. Strengthening anti-sham contracting laws. Do they support that? No. They say guess, what, that’s terrible as well. Reforming the better off overall test so it’s simply, flexible, and fairer for both workers and for business, they say it’s terrible as well. The same mob, the same mob that couldn’t have $1 an hour pay increase for people on the minimum wage, they said it was reckless and damages, they’re lecturing us about industrial relations. Well, we on this side of the House stand for increased productivity, stand for supporting business, but we also stand for supporting workers’s wages. Question time is upon us. It’s the last one for the house this week. Then four more to go next week before the parliament rises until next year (unless you are in the senate – you get another day next week too. Lucky you) The bill will end up being passed in the Senate – the opposition is on board. But it is a missed opportunity for more transparency. Pat Conroy off to Pacific The minister for international development and the Pacific: Tonight I will travel to Vanuatu to attend the Pacific Community (SPC) Ministerial Conference, the first in-person SPC conference since the COVID-19 pandemic. Australia is a proud founding member of the SPC, the largest scientific and technical regional organisation in the Pacific. I am pleased to be joining ministers and senior representatives from all Pacific Island countries and territories, along with New Zealand, France, the United States, and the United Kingdom, to commemorate 75 years since the SPC was established. The conference is an important opportunity for the Pacific family to come together and discuss how we can strengthen our development and economic partnerships. This visit will also be the first by an Australian minister to Vanuatu since its national election. I look forward to meeting with my Vanuatu ministerial counterparts in the new Government to discuss our shared challenges and opportunities, including security cooperation, infrastructure and economic recovery, and real climate action. Australia is committed to working together with Vanuatu in the interests of a peaceful, prosperous and resilient Pacific. Experts voice concerns over largest ever NT water allocation plan draft Water experts have written to the Northern Territory government warning a draft water allocation plan for the Beetaloo basin to allow industry to extract billions of litres a year would put significant environmental and cultural values at risk. Eighteen experts, including Prof Barry Hart who sat on the panel for the territory’s Pepper inquiry into fracking, say the Georgina Wiso water sharing plan “breaches water planning guidelines of the National Water Initiative”. Other academics who signed the letter include profs Sue Jackson from Griffith University, Matthew Currell from RMIT, Marcia Langton from Melbourne University, Richard Kingsford from UNSW and Jamie Pittock from the Australian National University. The plan, published last Friday afternoon, proposes a sustainable water use limit of 262bn litres per year, which the Environment Centre NT has said is the “biggest water allocation ever made in the Northern Territory”. Ten billion litres would be for the gas industry, 21bn for stock and domestic water use and 24bn for the Aboriginal water reserve for Aboriginal economic benefit. The plan includes the towns of Daly Waters, Elliott and Newcastle Waters and the communities of Jangirulu, Likkaparta, Marlinja, Murranji and Wutunugurra. The letter states the territory government had failed to establish any environmental or cultural requirements for water or “trigger rules for assessing unacceptable impacts”: Potential impacts to groundwater dependent ecosystems are completely overlooked. The scientific and procedural deficiencies identified ... need to be addressed, supported by a robust program of technical studies, review, and input from the scientific community – in the public domain. The experts said the NT government had also departed from the common practice of taking input from a water advisory committee in drafting the plan. They called on the government to make several urgent changes, including halting the granting of water licences in and outside the plan area until the water requirements for ecological and cultural values had been established, setting aside provisional Aboriginal water reserves for all aquifers and catchments and establishing consultative committees for the Georgina Wiso and all future water allocation plan areas. Minister defends government’s IR bill The small business minister, Julie Collins, is being interviewed by Henry Belot on the ABC ahead of question time and Collins is defending the government’s IR bill. Collins has been targeted by the Coalition in the parliament over the last week over the bill and its impact on small business. Collins was asked to account for the costings in the regulatory statement put together by the department and how it was done. There was a mistake – the cost to small business to take part would be $5,000, which is one of the issues the Coalition raised in question time yesterday. And there are questions over where the department found the prices. Collins says: The department costed it in a way that is usually done by department. I am not here to explain how it was calculated how it was calculated by the Department. I am here to say the calculation should be correct. They absolutely should be correct but we think here what we saw yesterday was a big distraction about what was essentially a typo. We are trying to make it cheaper and easier for small business to access enterprise bargaining. That is what the bill does. When you look at how much it is costing businesses now to access enterprise bargaining, what we’re doing with this bill will make it cheaper. Many businesses, member for peak organisations that will enable them to bargain in a much cheaper way. LECC to oversee investigation into Danny Lim arrest The independent law enforcement conduct body has warned it could take over the internal New South Wales police investigation into the violent arrest of Danny Lim in the Sydney CBD on Tuesday if concerns were raised. The Law Enforcement Conduct Commission (LECC) released a statement on Thursday stating it was using its “real time monitoring powers” to oversee the internal investigation. The statement said: If the commission has any concerns about the NSW police force’s conduct of the investigation, the commission has the power to step-in and take over that investigation itself. The commission will continue to closely monitor the progress of the police investigation of police contact with Mr Lim. The commission said it had powers to be present as an observer during interviews, request progress updates and access documents and footage related to the investigation. The premier, Dominic Perrottet, expects the “strongest action” to be taken if an investigation into Danny Lim‘s arrest finds any wrongdoing. Speaking at a press conference in the Sydney CBD on Thursday, Perrottet said it was right for the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission to be overseeing the internal police probe. He said: Having the oversight of the LECC is entirely appropriate. If the wrong thing has occurred then I expect the strongest action The LECC has a purpose. It’s an independent board that will oversee that investigation. I believe that’s the appropriate course of action. Prostate cancer-awareness BBQ at Parliament House There’s been a few lunchtime events in Parliament House today; while some Coalition MPs listened to Jordan Peterson, a number of other politicians including the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, and the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, attended a BBQ awareness lunch for prostate cancer. The Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia’ (PCFA) held its Parliamentary Big Aussie Barbie, with hundreds of staff and MPs turning out in the Canberra sunshine in one of APH’s outdoor courtyards, with sausages, shish kebabs and salad on the menu. Albanese urged men to “break that shyness” about getting a prostate cancer check. The PCFA said men over 40 can get what’s called a PSA (prostate-specific antigen) test, instead of the traditional rectal test. The education minister, Jason Clare, one of the chairs of an internal parliamentary group on prostate cancer awareness, joked “It’s not a finger up the bum, it’s just a little prick.” Coalition MP Warren Entsch, the other co-chair, said PSA tests were available today in the Nationals party room in parliament. Albanese pleaded with older men to get a regular check: It’s a simple blood test. I do it regularly with my GP, it’s a sensible thing to do to keep that monitoring. Clare said partners and children of older men should also encourage their loved ones to get a test. GetUp urges ‘clear timeline’ for legislation to protect sacred sites Larissa Baldwin-Roberts from GetUp says Indigenous communities “need a clear timeline” for when legislation that will better protect sacred cultural sites will be implemented. We put our sites at risk when Traditional Owners don’t have an equal seat at the table – investment needs to be made to ensure that this legislation receives adequate First Nations consultation with cultural groups, not just government bodies. This announcement to enshrine legislation is enormous. Traditional Owners must have the power to refuse projects impacting cultural heritage and we need harsher penalties for corporations who destroy cultural heritage, giving Traditional Owners the right to pursue damages. It is everybody’s business to protect our cultural heritage sites and we must ensure this legislation is implemented. This work has been ongoing for over a decade and it’s tied into the bigger work of repatriation. We have an incredibly rich First Nations history and culture and the government needs to make decisions that value it correctly and the decisions around cultural heritage protection need to sit with the Aboriginal affairs minister, the Hon Malarndirri Macarthy.” Nacc bill passes House Paul Karp reports the National Anti-Corruption Commission legislation has passed the house on the third reading, no division. It is off to the Senate. And in the house Controversial Canadian speaker Jordan Peterson is in Parliament House today, giving a talk to some Coalition MPs in a committee room. Nationals senator Matt Canavan’s office sent out invitations to MPs and their staff for a “speaking event” this afternoon. We’ve walked past the room and seen a packed audience - including a number of MPs from the Coalition and One Nation - listening as Peterson spoke. There’s also security posted outside the door. In an invitation to the event, seen by Guardian Australia, Canavan’s office says there was “huge interest” in the event. They also noted that despite it being scheduled for lunchtime, there would be no lunch provided. Peterson is visiting the country on a speaking tour of Australia. The independent MP, Zoe Daniel, has moved to exclude editorial work of the ABC and SBS from the scope of the Nacc. Daniel’s concern - raised by the ABC in its submission to the inquiry - is that employees of the public broadcasters could face “corruption” complaints because of the way they handle leaked documents, which she said would “hobble investigative journalism”. The attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, said the bill has safeguards to prevent journalists needing to disclose the identity of their sources, and noted after the joint committee inquiry this had been extended to other employees of the news agency. Still, the government does not support carving out all the ABC and SBS’s editorial work. The amendment was voted down 34 to 14. We’re now on to the opposition’s amendments, being moved by shadow AG Julian Leeser. Leeser said the Coalition wants to remove the carve-out for unions exercising powers under federal law (basically, that unions aren’t within scope of the Nacc just because federal laws give them right of entry powers). The Coalition also wants a limit on retrospective investigations, requiring that there must be an “identifiable public interest” before the Nacc investigates conduct in the past. The Coalition also wants a “super-majority” of 9 out of 12 members of the joint committee to be required to approve the Nacc commissioner’s appointment. The last house question time for the week is coming up in just under an hour. It seems like it is going to be a bit of a messy affair. Victorian Labor predicts $1bn surplus Victorian Labor has forecast that a re-elected Andrews government will deliver a $1.05bn surplus before the end of the next term, as parts of it’s pre-election costings. The party has released its financial statement and election commitments costings ahead of the state heading to the polls on Saturday. Labor’s health commitments total $4.6bn but the figures released show some of Labor’s major health commitments have not had their funding allocated to specific years across the forward estimates. The Victorian treasurer, Tim Pallas, said some of Labor’s health commitments could not be built “in five minutes.” The government will go about it diligently and consistently and it will get delivered like everything else. Labor has also committed to not introducing new taxes or increasing net debt to pay for its election commitments. Revived foreign interference inquiry to examine TikTok and WeChat The Senate has revived an inquiry into foreign interference through social media – and is expected to examine China-linked platforms TikTok and WeChat as part of its work. The Senate Select Committee on Foreign Interference Through Social Media lapsed because of the federal election – but it has previously tabled an interim report that said the Australian government “must approach the problem of foreign interference through social media with urgency and seriousness”. The earlier recommendations included that the government “establish clear requirements and pathways for social media platforms to report suspected foreign interference, including disinformation and coordinated inauthentic behaviour, and other offensive and harmful content, and formalise agency remits, powers and resourcing arrangements accordingly”. Liberal senator James Paterson will chair the committee, which was led in the previous parliament by Labor senator Jenny McAllister. This morning, the Senate signed off on a motion moved by Paterson to revive the committee with the task of examining the use of social media for purposes that undermine Australia’s democracy and values, including the spread of misinformation and disinformation. The terms of reference say the committee will also investigate what policy responses could reduce those risks, international policy responses to cyber-enabled foreign interference and misinformation, and the extent of compliance with existing Australian laws and regulations. Paterson said in a statement today: The committee will examine the activities of social media applications headquartered in authoritarian countries, such as TikTok and WeChat, which pose a unique risk to the national security of Australia. The committee will also examine the way social media companies headquartered in Western countries, such as Twitter, Facebook and YouTube, have been successfully weaponised by authoritarian states in an attempt to interfere in our democracy. Recent reports from Iranian diaspora communities of targeted online harassment, Russian state-backed disinformation campaigns about the invasion of Ukraine, and the Australian Strategic Policy Institute’s research exposing intimidation of activists and journalists working on Chinese human rights issues, demonstrate this is an ongoing problem which must be addressed. Paterson said Australia led the world with its foreign interference, espionage and influence reforms of 2018, which were now being adopted by likeminded countries around the world. But he described cyber-enabled foreign interference as “a unique challenge which requires further reforms”. The final report will be due in August 2023. Calls for ban on spit hoods in ACT One year on from when Fella’s Bill became law in South Australia, the National Ban Spit Hoods Coalition is working to ban spit hoods in the ACT. Wayne Fella Morrison, a 29-year-old Wiradjuri, Kokatha and Wirangu man, had not been convicted of any crime and was being held on remand when he died on 26 September 2016 at the Royal Adelaide hospital after being restrained at Yatala labour prison. The National Ban Spit Hoods Coalition wants the Australian federal police to stop using them, as part of a campaign to have their use banned in Australia. The National Ban Spit hoods Coalition continues to welcome consultation with those involved in drafting bills to ensure spit hoods are banned in law for all people and in all settings. We will accept nothing less. This includes — police watch houses, prisons, disability group homes, in medical and mental health facilities and in immigration detention. States and territories must not delay legislating the banning of spit hoods. We cannot risk another life. The National Ban Spit hoods Coalition’s new website, banspithoods.com, is now live Farmers urge action on flood recovery, competition laws The National Farmers Federation wants to see the government act in a few more areas, or go further than they already are: Fiona Simson said there were some priorities: Flood recovery: The Government needs to be here with us for the long haul. That’s certainly the message we’ve been given and it will be important this continues to be backed up with funding. We can’t just be lumped with decimated roads once the water recedes and the news cameras leave town.” Stronger competition laws: Too often we see farmers treated poorly when they go to sell their products to supply chain behemoths. The federal government has already shown its commitment to resolving this through new penalties and the expansion of unfair contract laws. Now, we need to go further – exploring mandatory codes of conduct for farm commodities facing significant power imbalances, strengthening merger laws, and bolstering oversight and enforcement by regulators. Energy infrastructure enforceable code: The government’s Rewiring the Nation policy – while needed to modernise and decarbonise our grid – will come at a massive cost to farmland. Recent experience of the approach by energy companies leaves a lot to be desired. We need mechanisms to give farmers a stronger voice in the process, and to assess and avoid productivity impacts. The independent MP Zali Steggall has moved amendments: To introduce time limits both for Nacc reports and for people subject to possible adverse findings to respond For the Nacc to be able to hear evidence subject to legal professional privilege in private hearings. The government, Coalition and the Greens are opposing the amendments. Kate Chaney, Kylea Tink, Sophie Scamps, Zoe Daniel, and Allegra Spender are in favour – but these went down easily. Spender is now moving that if a vote approving the Nacc commissioner’s appointment is tied on the oversight committee, that the government can’t break the tie with the chair’s vote. Let’s have a look inside the chamber thanks to Mike Bowers: Dai Le moves Nacc amendments The independent MP’s measures: Allowing people called to appear to the Nacc to tell a spouse or any medical professional For the Nacc to make public statements explaining “the context” in which witnesses appear and noting “the need for the public not to scrutinise a witness before the corruption investigation has been completed” The shadow attorney general, Julian Leeser, said the Coalition “strongly supports” the measures as a means to mitigate the “very stressful process” of being called to appear and prevent the “oppressive” circumstance of being issued a notice that might ban a witness from telling a family member. The attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, explained the commission can already make statements about the “circumstances and capacity” someone is giving evidence, describing this as “an important reputational safeguard”. For example the commission can note: A witness is appearing voluntary, and is not the subject of a corruption investigation That an investigation is not complete, and no finding of corruption has been made. Dreyfus said that his - and the issue of who witnesses are permitted to tell is “all appropriately left to commissioner” and “does not need to be specified in the legislation”. The government has already supported a joint select committee recommendation to allow witnesses to tell a psychologist. The amendments were voted down 79 to 56. The Coalition, Bob Katter, Kylea Tink, Sophie Scamps, Kate Chaney and Rebekha Sharkie voted with Le. Opposition promises ‘significantly lower debt’ Before both parties release their election costings later today opposition leader Mathew Guy has promised to “significantly lower debt” if he wins office on Saturday. He said: Our costings will be released this afternoon, costed independently by the budget parliamentary Budget Office, who we will give extra resources to if we come to government. And I can tell you, there’ll be significantly lower debt, significantly lower debt over the forward estimates under a Coalition government than under Labor. Analysis in October showed the Liberals had outspent Labor by millions. It’s big ticket item to save money is scrapping the ALP’s signature infrastructure project – the suburban rail loop – but that money has been promised for 24 new hospitals across the state. The Liberals have previously said they will make “public service efficiencies” but Guy promised there would be no cuts to services. No cuts, no closures. What we will do is have a budget that is sensible that is responsible and reasonable and you’ll see that this afternoon. We will bring you more on the costings when they come out. Opposition pledges to lower P-plate age to 17 Appearing in Wodonga, opposition leader Mathew Guy has announced a Coalition government would lower the age Victorians can get their P-plates from 18 to 17. It’s a great opportunity for Victorian kids,” he told reporters on Thursday. “You still need 120 hours of L-plates and you’ll still need to do all the work that you would normally do on your L-plates.” When asked about the risks, he said the Liberals had looked at what happens in other states, such as NSW, where 17-year-olds can get their P-plates and there was no increase in safety issues. The rollout would take about a year and a half, he said: Victorian kids are at a disadvantage. They can’t drive to school [independently at 17], they can’t drive to work, they can’t drive to uni. But lowering the age to 17 gives them the chance to do so. And it breaks that nexus between the age of 18 and when you can get your licence and when you can legally drink. Andrews hits out at Sukkar The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, has hit back at reports federal Liberal MP Michael Sukkar will refer the state government’s Suburan Rail Loop project to the commonwealth parliamentary budget office. The Australian has reported that Sukkar – who represents the Victorian seat of Deakin – would refer the Andrews government’s signature infrastructure project to the federal parliamentary budget office. Andrews responded to the report at a press conference: This is a bloke who couldn’t even build a car park in his electorate. That is all I really need to say about the Liberal party … they’re cancelling it, they’re cutting it. Victoria’s parliamentary budget office has costed the first two stages of the project at $125bn. The Victorian opposition has pledged to shelve the Suburban Rail Loop and funnel available funds into the state’s healthcare system. Dai Le amendment fails Dai Le’s amendment for the Nacc to provide translation and mental health services to people called to hearings, and adding language and cultural sensitivities to the test for public hearings have been defeated, 73 to 63. The entire Coalition voted with Le, whose amendments were also supported by Kylea Tink, Kate Chaney, Sophie Scamps, Zali Steggall, Zoe Daniel, Allegra Spender, Bob Katter, and the Greens. Earlier, the attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, explained that Labor opposed them because it is his “strong expectation” the Nacc will provide these supports where required, as federal courts already do. Dreyfus opposed adding English fluency and cultural sensitivities to the considerations about whether to hold a public hearing. He noted the commission can already consider “any unfair prejudice to privacy, reputation or wellbeing” before ordering a public hearing, including “any particular vulnerability” of the person. Helen Haines also spoke against this element of the amendments. Also supporting Labor to vote the amendments down were Monique Ryan and Rebekha Sharkie. Final Haines amendment defeated The last Haines amendment on Nacc budgetary independence was defeated 55 to 14. Bridget Archer voted with the Coalition and Labor this time. Independent MP Dai Le is now moving amendments which require translation services and mental health supports for those appearing at a hearing. So far, Labor is voting against amendments from Helen Haines, who was elected on a strong platform of increased transparency, in what seems like a bid to ensure bipartisanship with the Coalition. Which did not progress a federal Icac. Didn’t even introduce its toothless tiger version into the parliament. Lots of people watching this debate with eyebrows raised. Haines proposal on funding anti-corruption body voted down The House just divided on the Haines amendment that if the Nacc oversight committee makes a recommendation in relation to the Nacc budget and the government does not follow it, the AG must provide a written statement of reasons to parliament. Dreyfus said: The committee will have the function of reviewing [the Nacc’s] budget and finances, and report to parliament whether it is sufficient to perform its functions. [It can] review the budget at any time. [There are] budget estimates [hearings] three times a year. The committee can also ask for advice from the commission about budget requirements. This will provide powerful parliamentary oversight of the budget.” Dreyfus said these processes of parliament will result in the “imposition of political pressure” by bringing the sufficiency of the Nacc’s budget to public attention, concluding that “the further amendments would not meaningfully enhance the committee’s role”. The amendment was defeated (by Labor and the Coalition) 49 votes to 16. Haines was supported by Bridget Archer, the Greens, and crossbenchers Kate Chaney, Bob Katter, Dai Le, Monique Ryan, Sophie Scamps, Allegra Spender, Zali Steggall, Kylea Tink, Rebekha Sharkie, Zoe Daniel and Andrew Wilkie. Haines is now moving an amendment on appointment of Nacc commissioners: The decision to approve or reject a proposed recommendation is to be determined by a majority of all of the members of the Committee for the time being holding office. The majority must include: (a) at least 2 Government members; and (b) at least 2 non-Government members. Interest rate rises increase housing stress Consecutive interest rate rises have done little to improve housing affordability for first home buyers, as rising interest rates offset the property market downturn. That’s the finding in the latest ANZ CoreLogic Housing Affordability Report, which painted a grim picture for hopeful first home buyers. The typical Australian first home buyer would take 10.9 years to save for a deposit as of the September quarter, the report found, a small improvement on 11.3 years in the previous quarter. The report assumes 15% of household income can be saved for a deposit. Meanwhile nationally, the portion of income needed to repay a new mortgage has risen by 4.4 percentage points to 43.3%. In Sydney, the most unaffordable city, first home buyers would need to save for 12.8 years and set aside more than half their income to service a mortgage. In Melbourne, 42.4% of income was needed to service a new mortgage, while in Brisbane the rate was 40.3%. Renters were also bearing the brunt of consecutive rate hikes. Nationally, 33.4% of renters income was being spent on housing in the latest quarter. A person is considered under rental stress when more than 30% of their income goes towards rent. Some 34.4% of Hobart renters income went towards housing, followed by Sydney and Adelaide (31.6% respectively). The report said low rental supply was contributing to crisis: The decline in rental affordability is the result of several demand and supply factors. On the demand side, the drivers of a soft rental market at the onset of Covid-19, including closed international borders, reduced interstate migration and job loss, have now reversed ... Another reason for additional demand in the private rental market, and a factor putting low income households at greater risk of homelessness, may be the low level of additional social housing. The view from the lens of Mike Bowers Mike Bowers is back with us and in the chamber Kate Chaney is a mood. Haines pork-barrelling amendment fails The attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, has spoken about the Helen Haines amendment to add “allocation of public funds ... to targeted electors for partisan political purposes” to the Nacc bill (to explicitly include pork-barrelling in scope for investigations). Dreyfus has previously spoken in favour of pork barrelling being investigated - but he is arguing that an amendment is not needed to make this explicit: Dreyfus said: As I’ve said previously, there is a point at which making of discretionary grants can cross the line into corruption, public money given away for private purposes. Can I assure the member for Indi and all members of crossbench, the bill would enable the commission to investigate serious or systemic corruption in relation to a discretionary grants program ... if [funds are given] dishonestly or for improper purpose, the commission will be able to investigate.” Dreyfus responded to Zali Steggall that it is “simply not correct that pork barrelling is excluded from the work of the commission – it is included”. The House then voted 58 to 15 to reject the amendment, with Labor and the Coalition voting together to defeat it. Haines’ amendment was supported by Liberal Bridget Archer, the Greens, and crossbenchers Kate Chaney, Zoe Daniel, Bob Katter, Dai Le, Monique Ryan, Sophie Scamps, Allegra Spender, Zali Steggall, Kylea Tink and Andrew Wilkie. We’re now onto a Haines amendment about ensuring Nacc funding independence. The ACT has been ranked as the most progressive state or territory on cutting greenhouse gas emissions from transport, with New South Wales coming in second. According to a report from the Climate Council, the ACT’s zero emissions transport plan, targets for electric buses and government vehicles, high levels of new electric car sales and the lowest emissions per person for transport all put the territory on top. NSW is ranked second, with the highest share of people using public transport and targets for electric buses and government vehicles that don’t deliver as quickly as the ACT, the report says. Victoria and Tasmania were placed equal third in the Are We There Yet report, followed by South Australia, Queensland, WA and the Northern Territory. Latest national data shows transport accounts for 18.7% of Australia’s total greenhouse gas emissions. Before the pandemic, transport emissions were rising. After a sharp drop from the economic slowdown, transport emissions have climbed again but not to pre-pandemic levels. The Climate Council said while progress was being made towards cheaper and cleaner transport, there were big differences in how states and territories were progressing. Dr Jennifer Rayner, the council’s head of advocacy, said: Australians want clean transport options that are accessible, reliable and better for our hip pockets and climate. This includes well-connected networks of footpaths and bike lanes, zero emissions public transport and affordable electric vehicles. State and Territory governments are putting their wheels in motion but our analysis shows they really need to hit the accelerator. So looking around at all the chambers, it seems everything is a bit of a mess at the moment. Stay with us, as we sort through it and keep you up to date. Plibersek’s office responds to traditional owners’ claims of lack of consultation Tanya Plibersek’s office has responded: The minister’s office has attempted to engage with the PKKP on at least four occasions since the Response was approved by Cabinet on Tuesday. The minister’s office spoke to the PKKP cultural heritage manager. A meeting between the CEO and the Minister was also offered. Energy issues are usually not far from the surface these days, and news that AGL Energy has today given a date for the closure of its Torrens Island ‘B’ power plant in South Australia will likely stoke debate anew. The energy giant, which has been under siege from billionaire activist Mike Cannon-Brookes over its decarbonisation pace, told the ASX today it would close its remaining three units of the now 600MW gas-fired power station on 30 June 2026. The company cited the expected completion of a new transmission line between SA and NSW in mid-2026 as affecting the economic viability of the station. Better hope that line is in place by then, I suppose. (The storms that “islanded” SA from the rest of the national electricity market is a reminder of the need for more power supply options.) AGL copped a lot of flak when it gave seven years notice for its plans to close its ageing Liddell coal-fired power plant by 2022. After intense pressure from the Turnbull government that closure date was pushed out to April 2023, handily after the state elections next March. It’s unlikely AGL will get much pressure from Albanese government, but it’s not hard to imagine political and punditry hay being made over the decision to exit a fossil-fuel plant. Expect more media interest on 30 November when the Australian Energy Regulator is due to release its annual retail markets report detailing how household bills have changed over the past year. Shareholder issues of a different kind are on display elsewhere today with one of Australia’s biggest coalminers New Hope Group holding its AGM in sunny Muswellbrook (haze permitting) in the upper Hunter region of NSW. New Hope is hoping a resolution from 100-plus shareholders to wind down coal output in line with global climate goals (think, COP27) won’t get up. Groups like Market Forces aren’t happy that the company is not providing any audio or video webcast as is the practice for most AGMs and something New Hope managed to provide during the Covid years. Will van de Pol, a campaigner at Market Forces, said: New Hope Group is avoiding shareholder accountability, even after complaints from globally significant investors about the company’s lack of engagement. Market Forces analysis indicates New Hope Group will spend nearly $1bn in investor capital to expand the New Acland Stage 3 project in Queensland and continue to explore other coal assets. Given the federal government will have to provide EPBC approval for mine expansions, expect this issue to turn up in Canberra too. Senate runs out of time to finalise territory rights bill Despite concerns raised by Katy Gallagher and David Pocock about opponents’ delaying tactics, the Senate has now run out of time to get a final vote on territory rights today, and the bill will now come back next Thursday. Opponents had asked for more time before a final vote, so they could move amendments. Pocock and Gallagher asked why the amendments weren’t already prepared, considering how long the territory rights push has been on the cards. A line of Liberal senators then stood up to speak and ask for more time. Senate procedure rules mean such bills can only be considered during certain times of the week, and the numerous speeches meant that time was chewed up. The Senate Twitter account tweeted that the time had expired for debating territory rights, and it wouldn’t return to the agenda until next Thursday. But from what we learned today, it should eventually easily pass the Senate – a vote to take the bill through the second reading stage, and towards a final vote, passed 41 to 25 so you’d imagine the final result will be something similar. Haines moves amendment on pork barrelling Independent MP Helen Haines is now moving an amendment on pork barrelling, clarifying the Nacc can investigate it if it constitutes serious or systemic misconduct. Pork barrelling is defined as the “allocation of public funds and resources targeted at electors for partisan political purposes”, which Haines paraphrased as “buying votes with taxpayer money”. Haines said when target seats are pork barrelled “important infrastructure in other electorates misses out”: In the last parliament I heard now the now attorney general constantly calling this out. I heard the now PM doing the same thing, calling for an anti-corruption commission to stamp out pork barrelling. I want to make sure there is not one element of doubt that the commissioner can – if they determine this is serious or systemic – can undertake investigation into this egregious practice. There is growing concern about the alleged misuse of billions of taxpayer dollars. Territory rights bill debate continues in Senate The territory rights debate continues, with opponents seeking a delay to the final vote so they can move amendments – but supporters of the bill are unhappy with the request, and confused about why the amendments were not ready. ACT senator and manager of government business, Katy Gallagher, asked those wanting to bring amendments to detail what they are, even if the exact detail is not ready. She said she was perplexed because the bill was a straightforward repeal of existing legislation and was unsure of what amendments could be moved. Liberal senator Sarah Henderson earlier protested that the Senate procedure office was overworked and had not been able to work up the requested amendments yet, and asked for time to move those amendments. David Pocock, the ACT senator and advocate for territory rights, was also unhappy at the request for delay: We’ve known this bill is coming for quite some time now. I’m quite concerned about process here. This is the simplest of bills. Jonno Duniam, the Liberal senator asking for more time, said he would request three amendments. They included restrictions around providing voluntary assisted dying to those under 18, and around the imports and the approval process or exemptions for medications used in euthanasia. Pocock moved to guillotine debate and put the final question. Labor voted against that, with Gallagher saying it was Labor party process that debate on conscience votes not be cut short. The debate continues. Gallagher still says Labor wants the final vote today. Helen Haines calls for improvements to Nacc bill Earlier, independent MP Helen Haines spoke in favour of lowering the bar for public hearings: Mr Speaker, I am a vocal supporter of this bill. I believe overall it is an exceptional model, an excellent model, and I applaud the government for prioritising the national anti-corruption commission legislation as top order in their agenda since they came to parliament. We have been waiting a long, long time to see legislation such as this, and I think in particular the attorney general for the way in which he has gone about putting this bill together for the consensus approach he has adopted as meetings and for the work of his department and of his staff. This will indeed establish a powerful anti-corruption commission. The fact that we have worked so hard together across the parliament to pull together what ultimately I hope will be a consensus bill I have long called for, that we can together bring about this extremely important change. But, Mr Speaker, it could still be better. I have long said that I won’t finish until the absolute finish line, and we are getting close to that. This bill can be improved before we deliver the Australian people the national anti-corruption commission they truly deserve. An anti-corruption commission that is fit for purpose and fulfils its role, not just now but into the future for many years to come. I urge all members of this House to think very carefully about what our nation has asked us to do, and to consider amendments on their merits. I ask you to support them so that we pass legislation for the best possible integrity body, restore its trust in us, I know they do. Part of that is that they see how we deal with corruption when it comes before us. I would never ask for carte blanche public hearings, but that is not what I’m talking about here, what I’m talking about is a public inquiry when it’s in the public interest ... Amendment five will strike out the unnecessary and alarming exceptional circumstances requirement. In my mind, this is the single most important change to this bill. My amendment will ensure the commission may decide to hold public hearings if the commission is satisfied it is in the public interest. I sat through almost 40 hours of evidence from former judges, past and present, Icac and Ibac commissioners, advocates. We heard so little evidence about the exceptional circumstances test and an overwhelming amount of evidence against it. Sufficient protections are provided by providing a hearing to be public only when in the public interest. Coalition committee members indeed cited fears about grave mental health impacts that may arise from appearing in public when arguing to keep the exceptional circumstances. I would point members to their government amendments which will allow additional protections to seek mental health support. It is an important concern and I share it, but the exceptional circumstances test is not the way to fix it. The House of Representatives is considering the national anti-corruption commission bill in committee stage, including amendments. First up were Helen Haines’ amendments to remove the “exceptional circumstances” test for public hearings, so that the Nacc can have public hearings whenever it is in the public interest to do so. Haines also proposed that the optional considerations for the Nacc in judging exceptional circumstances be made mandatory. The house voted the amendments down 77 to 14. Liberal Bridget Archer – as she flagged last night – crossed the floor, voting with the Greens, and most of the crossbench (Kate Chaney, Zoe Daniel, Haines, Bob Katter, Monique Ryan, Sophie Scamps, Allegra Spender, Zali Steggall, Kylea Tink and Andrew Wilkie). Haines’ amendment to define what “exceptional circumstances” are is next up – but I expect that Labor and the Coalition will again vote together to defeat them. The attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, told the House that “reasonable minds can differ” on the question of exceptional circumstances: This is an appropriate threshold that reflects the significant nature of the power to compel people to give evidence at a public hearing. And in the House of Representatives: The PKKP Aboriginal Corporation, which administers the traditional lands and waters of the Puutu Kunti Kurrama people and the Pinikura people on their behalf, has released a statement slamming the federal government for its response to the Juukan Gorge report, saying they were not consulted. The statement in full is below: The PKKP Aboriginal Corporation RNTBC is angry and disappointed with the announcement in Canberra today of the Federal Government’s response to the Joint Select Committee Report into the destruction of Juukan Gorge. PKKPAC Chairman Burchell Hayes said the Corporation could not comment on the Response because they had not been consulted on the content. All of this started with the destruction of our cultural heritage, everyone keeps on telling us they are sorry about it, but actions speak louder than words,” Mr Hayes said. It seems like a media event in Canberra is more important than giving PKKP people the respect of asking us what can be done to try and stop something like the destruction of the Juukan rock shelters happening again, or even letting us know what the government is planning. We received an email on Tuesday 22nd November from the Minister’s Office that this was happening with no detail or meaningful follow-up. We would have expected the Minister would want to meet with us before making a public announcement about our Country and cultural heritage. It is disappointing the media know more than we do. Mr Hayes said today’s events had confirmed that the PKKP peoples, not governments, had to look after themselves when it came to their country. We have tasted the devastation and we know what needs to be done. The corporation said it would not be providing any further comment. Tanya Plibersek tables government’s response to the Juukan Gorge destruction report This morning, our government signed an agreement with the First Nations Heritage Protection Alliance. This partnership will guide the reform process – to ensure that Indigenous voices are present at every stage, in every room, and in every decision we make. Members of the alliance are here in the chamber today – and I want to thank them for their ongoing work and dedication. Mr Speaker, the committee report identified eight recommendations for reforming Australia’s cultural heritage. We have accepted seven of them, and we are working through the final recommendation with the alliance, which is whether ultimate responsibility for cultural heritage protection should sit with the Indigenous affairs minister or the environment minister. As I said, these are thorough and considerate reports – and the recommendations speak to the principles and priorities that will shape our legislation. Free, prior, and informed consent. Truth telling and open dialogue. Genuine partnership – the kind that can only be entered into by equals. And wrapped around it all, a new respect for Indigenous culture and history, enshrined in our national law, honoured by business and civil society, and celebrated in communities right across this country. The alliance and i are working closely with minister Burney and Senator Dodson to make sure we get these laws right. Just like we are working closely with the states and territories, to make sure our rules are harmonised across the commonwealth. And we will work closely with business – who have already shown a great willingness to learn from past experience and to grow. Push to finalise territory rights bill today The Senate could pass the territory rights bill, to allow the territories to make their own euthanasia laws, as early as today – with finance minister Katy Gallagher saying the Senate can be “nimble” when necessary. The Senate is now debating the bill. As reported, the Senate had earmarked time next Thursday to finally resolve the bill, but after the second reading stage of debate ended this morning (no more senators wanted to make speeches at that time), Gallagher said she wanted to “resolve” the issue today. The Senate agreed 41-25 to move the bill through the second reading stage and towards a final vote. We reported this morning that the bill was likely to pass, after doing our own headcount – but some Coalition senators who had previously voted against territory rights, including Linda Reynolds and Richard Colbeck, voted for it this time. Liberal senator Jonno Duniam has asked the Senate to wait until next week because he wants to move amendments to it – but that they weren’t ready. Greens senator Larissa Waters said she found that highly unusual, as the territory rights bill has been on the agenda for some time, and she doesn’t want the Senate held up by opponents of the bill not being ready. Duniam admitted it was “inconvenient” and apologised but claimed it was not a deliberate delaying tactic – and he said it was “clear” the bill would be eventually successful. There is still the third reading (and maybe committee) to go, but this is a very big indication of where it is heading: This was the biggest hurdle for the bill so far. Katy Gallagher is now pushing to have the bill resolved before the Senate rises – today. The territory rights bill has passed its second reading in the Senate, 41 to 25. An earlier version of this post incorrectly recorded the vote as 39 to 25. It is getting close to crunch time in the territory rights bill vote: Danny Lim released from hospital Sydney street personality Danny Lim has been released from hospital after being thrown to the ground and suffering a brain bleed during a “discontinued” arrest by police. Lim’s lawyer, Chris Murphy, said there was a plan in place for his care: Danny Lim has been released from hospital with a plan in place for ongoing monitoring. Thank you staff at St Vincent’s Darlinghurst for the loving care. Thank you to the community for your love &amp; support, hope to get our happy icon back with his smiles and his signs. Previous reporting: Senate debates territory rights bill In the Senate, the private member’s bill to give territories the right to make their own laws on things like voluntary assisted dying (a right taken away by the Howard government in the late 1990s) is being debated. The legislation does not legalise VAD in the Northern Territory or the ACT, it only means the territories can bring forward that legislation, if they wish. A debate and vote would still have to occur. The Liberals have a conscience vote, as do Labor. Low risk doesn’t mean no risk, Andrews says of repatriation of women and children from Syria Karen Andrews, the former home affairs minister, is continuing the political attack against Clare O’Neil, the Labor home affairs minister, over the repatriation of Australian women and children from Syrian refugee camps. The women had left Australia for Syria in most cases with partners who were in support of the Islamic State regime, which has since fallen. Mayors in western Sydney have raised concerns about the families resettling in their communities. Andrews has been taking up those mayors’ case. Asked if Australians should have confidence in its security agencies which have said there is “low risk” of any problems, Andrews says: They should. They should have confidence in the capability of Asio and the Australian federal police, without a doubt. But low risk doesn’t mean no risk. So let’s be clear about that. And what the government has failed to do is reassure the people that proper measures are in place. We don’t actually know if there are any measures, let alone what those measures may well be. And I think it’s, again, a fundamental mistake that rookie ministers made. Again, the women and their children are Australian and if they had been able to make their own way out of the camps, we would have been obliged to allow them to return anyway. Dreyfus seeks ‘respectful’ discussion on religious discrimination bill Attorney general Mark Dreyfus gave a speech at the Australian Catholic University interfaith breakfast event where he spoke about the government’s plan for a religious discrimination bill. As a first step, Dreyfus has asked for a review of Australia’s laws. He told the breakfast he did not want any subsequent debate to be political: It is my strong belief that these are matters that should be above party politics. And it is my hope that the new leader of the Liberal party, Peter Dutton – whose presence here this morning I would like to acknowledge – and the new shadow attorney general, Julian Leeser, will work constructively with the government to extend the federal anti-discrimination framework in a way that brings Australians together. As the expert panel led by Philip Ruddock recognised, designing legal rules to protect freedom of thought, conscience and religion without unjustifiably burdening other rights is an immensely difficult and delicate task. The expert panel described it as “a many-sided discussion”. To the extent possible, the government will seek to encourage a “many-sided discussion” that is respectful, constructive, accepting and unifying, and recognises the wealth and value of Australia’s diversity. Many contributions to that discussion will come from within the Labor caucus, which is more reflective of the diversity of Australia than ever before. The caucus is made up of people who are Christian, who are Jewish, who are Muslim – people from a range of other faiths, and others who are not adherents of any religion at all. There are a record number of First Nations members of caucus. There are caucus members who went to university, and others who didn’t – people who were born in Australia, and many who weren’t. There are a record number of women in the caucus and the cabinet. There are people from the LGBTIQ community. There are single parents, working parents – big families and small. The Albanese government sees this diversity as a strength. Different perspectives are to be welcomed as we search for common ground – rather than exploited for the purposes of sewing division. I think everyone in this room, and Australians across the country, have had enough of the division – and will embrace a more constructive and respectful path forward. Treaty needed to restore First Nations rights, Lidia Thorpe says The latest research from Reconciliation Australia shows support for a treaty has increased by about 20% in the last two years to reach a high of 72% people in support. The biennial Barometer report showed there was also increased support for an Indigenous representative body to be established, with about 80% of the general population in support. But the report also found an uptick in Indigenous people experiencing racism. Greens senator Lidia Thorpe says self-determination through treaty is one solution. She says Indigenous people need more than “just a say”: We learnt yesterday that First Nations children are 10x more likely to be living in out of home care than non-Indigenous kids, less than half of them are living with First Nations carers. Forcibly taking children away from their community is an act of genocide, according to the United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. Today, Reconciliation Australia showed us that 60% of First Nations people have experienced racism in the last six months. We know that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children are 26x more likely than their non-Indigenous classmates to be incarcerated. This is all evidence of systemic racism in this country. The solution is self-determination. It’s critical that First Nations people have more than just ‘a say’ over the matters that affect us. Everyone is better off when we are free to steer our own course, yet successive Governments continue to lock First Nations people out of decision making processes and force policies onto us that continue the violent legacy of colonisation. We need a Treaty to redefine and rebuild the relationship between the Government and First Nations people. A Treaty will restore our right to make decisions for ourselves, our families, our communities and our homelands. Through real justice, we can build a society where everyone is treated with respect and dignity. Treaty was promised by Bob Hawke’s Labor government in the 80s and it’s still unfinished business today. There’s growing support for First Nations people to be in the driver’s seat when it comes to making decisions about our community, our country and our culture. The Greens will keep fighting to make this a reality. Taylor pushed on Indigenous voice Patricia Karvelas asks Angus Taylor whether or not Liberal MPs should be able to individually decide how they campaign on the Indigenous voice. His entire voice changes at this question. Taylor is obviously not comfortable with this: Well, look, we’ll wait and see. We’re working our way through this. And to discussing this with colleagues. We haven’t come to landed at a view on it. And the right time, we’ll have more to say. Karvelas asks again – what is Taylor’s own view? Taylor: My view is we should work through the issue methodically systematically and get to a sensible outcome. Karvelas goes in for a third time – John Howard says no but others are pushing back against that – does Taylor think it’s reasonable that people argue their own case in a big referendum campaign? Taylor: I think what’s reasonable in these things to give is to give people time to work through the issues and come to a landing as a party room joint party room, and that’s exactly what we’ll do. Angus Taylor on opposition to Labor’s IR bill The shadow treasurer Angus Taylor is speaking to ABC radio now about the government’s IR bill. The opposition is absolutely, 100%, no thank you when it comes to the legislation. So what does Taylor think will lead to pay rises? Well, let me tell you the mechanism that is working best right now. And that’s individual arrangements between employers and employees in fact, in the last a WPI data that came out, just in the last week or so, we saw individual arrangements going up twice or even four times faster than union-driven arrangements. And it’s it’s allowing employers and employees to sit down and work together to get the best possible outcome for the business and the workers. And it is actually working best in those sorts of arrangements. Yes, but that is not getting people wage rises. Taylor: I’m saying that’s where it’s working best. Now, we want to see it working better over time. There’s no doubt about that. But you’ve got to have a strong economy, you’ve got to have productivity. You’ve got to have employees working with employees. And you know, we saw that era of toxic industrial relations in the 70s and 80s come to an end as as this approach of getting employers and employees working together closely … Actually, to their great credit, the Labor party under Bob Hawke was really important to achieving that. So we don’t want to reversion I don’t think any business wants to reversion. I just hear exhaustion from businesses at the what they’ve experienced in the last couple of years, particularly small businesses in my electorate. And they don’t want another hurdle in front of them in getting on with a post-pandemic world, which is a real challenge is there are labour shortages. They are having to pay more to retain workers and that’s the market at work and that’s that’s a good thing. And we just don’t need union officials getting in the middle. They’re driving industry-wide disputation as a way of strengthening their power base rather than strengthening the economy. ‘It’s a shameful moment in Australia’s history’ The report into Juukan Gorge’s destruction was titled “Never Again”. Can Tanya Plibersek ensure it won’t ever happen again? I’m determined that this sort of cultural heritage destruction should never happen again in Australia. It is a shameful moment in Australia’s history. It’s not unique. And one of the really terrible things about the report that was led so well by Senator Pat Dodson was that it was an opportunity for Aboriginal groups from around Australia to talk about their own experiences of cultural heritage destruction. And Juukan Gorge was perhaps the most high profile but certainly not a unique experience of cultural heritage protection. We are so very fortunate in Australia, like, you know, you think about kids growing up in Egypt not knowing about the pyramids. It’s impossible to imagine and yet we have cultural heritage here in Australia that is tens of thousands of years older … and I think we need to change that we need to value it properly. How can strengthening federal laws stop the destruction of sacred heritage sites? Tanya Plibersek: I think I think it’s really worth having a look at the two inquiries that the the parliament undertook into the Juukan Gorge destruction because it describes not just the failure of laws, but the failure of process and the failure of people to listen and that happened at the commonwealth level and it also happened at the West Australian state government level. The other thing that it describes is a company that paid lip service to consultation and really, you know, really didn’t do what it should have done when Aboriginal people said you can’t blow up caves that are 46,000 years old, that have examples of continuous use and habitation that you know, the site of finds like a 4,000-year-old hair belt, and tools that are tens of thousands of years old. The company didn’t listen when the traditional owners said that. I would very much hope that this catastrophic destruction has made businesses more aware of their responsibilities. It has led to some changes at the West Australian state level and certainly it will lead to more changes at the commonwealth level as well. How long will this take? Tanya Plibersek: There’s absolutely a sense of urgency to ensure that this sort of cultural heritage destruction doesn’t happen again. I completely agree with that, but a very strong message from the the First Nations Heritage Protection Alliance is also that they genuinely want to sit at the table to work through these issues in partnership and cooperation. And so we’ve got to balance the urgency that you describe with really thorough and thoughtful consultation with First Nations people around Australia so that it is a genuine co-design process. It’s not just the government, you know, dropping a few suggestions on the table in a, you know, take-it-or-leave-it sort of fashion. Q: Have you got an idea about how quickly you’d like to be able to introduce some laws to ensure this happens? Plibersek: Yeah, I’m not going to put I’m not going to put a timeline on it yet. I think that’s something that we determined as we work through the complexity of these issues, and there are a lot of complexities involved. Plibersek targets imbalance of power in protecting First Nations sacred sites Removing those gag clauses would require changes to the Native Title Act, which Tanya Plibersek says is not an issue, but will require a process. It’s just a process we going through, a co-design process for the cultural heritage protection laws. And of course the attorney general has also said that there are areas of the Native Title Act that he would like to examine in more detail … There’s also the issue of resourcing one of the other recommendations of the Juukan Gorge inquiry is about resourcing for prescribed body corporates. You’ve got not just the imbalance of power in negotiations that occur because of the way the laws are drafted … But there’s also a massive imbalance in the resources that people bring to the to the negotiating table if you’ve got very large corporations with very deep pockets, up against, for example, a small prescribed body corporate. It’s, you know, it’s not an easy thing to to negotiate in those circumstances. Q: No, so how do you change that? How do you balance it up? Who provides the funding? Plibersek: Well, that’s why we’re going through this. That’s why we’re going through this process with the First Nations Cultural Heritage Protection Alliance. It’s about the legal changes we need to make. We do need to look at some of these issues around prescribed body corporates. I mean, I think, you know, this is yet to be determined, but it makes sense to me that if the expectation is that native title holders, for example, negotiating with big mining companies, it makes sense to me that some of those big companies would make a contribution to make sure that the the negotiations are taking place on a level playing field. ‘When those beautiful Buddhas were destroyed by the Taliban, there was an international outcry’ Tanya Plibersek says the recommendations in the report alone won’t stop another sacred site from being destroyed: We need to strengthen our laws as well. And that’s why we’ve entered into this code design process with the First Nations Heritage Protection Alliance we need to change the law. I mean, the the the current law was written in 1984. There’s been a few changes along the way. But certainly not nearly enough to give the sort of cultural heritage protection that we need to have in Australia. I think your introduction was quite right – when those beautiful Buddhas were destroyed by the Taliban, there was an international outcry about that destruction. The Juukan Gorge destruction is similarly significant. But it happened because of the weaknesses of our laws and that that’s the commonwealth laws and there was criticism in the reports of the Western Australian government – there were certainly criticisms of the company itself. The fact that there are gag clauses included in agreements between companies and traditional owner groups, means that traditional owners feel constricted from speaking out about cultural heritage destruction. These are all things that we need to address when we reform our laws. Tanya Plibersek is speaking to ABC radio RN Breakfast and says the destruction of Juukan Gorge was a wake-up call: One of the very clear findings of the two inquiries into the Juukan Gorge destruction was that this wasn’t a one-off incident and there were really significant flaws in our laws protecting Aboriginal cultural heritage. In fact, the destruction of Juukan Gorge was legal under the laws as they exist at the moment and that was completely wrong, but it shows how weak the laws are that that’s the case. We’ve said that we will work with the First Nations heritage protection Alliance, an organisation that was set up after the Juukan Gorge destruction made up of around 30 Aboriginal organisations from across the country. We will sit down with the First Nations heritage protection Alliance and co-design stronger laws to give better protection to Aboriginal cultural heritage. And today in the parliament, I’ll also be tabling the government’s response to those two Juukan Gorge inquiries to deal with a number of other recommendations from the reports. Grants for cashless debit card trial sites Communities that formerly hosted cashless debit card trial sites will be eligible for up to $17m in federal grants, as the government looks to create employment opportunities in those towns. The “Community-led Solutions – Economic Development Grant Opportunity” will be open to projects in Ceduna, Goldfields, East Kimberley and Cape York. It comes after the Labor government passed laws to repeal the income management tool this year. Social services minister Amanda Rishworth said: This funding will meet the call for additional investment in shovel-ready infrastructure projects that provide ongoing and sustainable opportunities for training and employment. Applications open today, with funding to flow from early 2023. The government expects to give funding for capital projects like tourism centres, upgrading major facilities or capital equipment like farming machinery that are part of local employment programs. Rishworth said it was an example of the government listening to communities that raised concerns after the ceasing of the cashless debit card program: Breaking the cycle of welfare dependency is critical, and we need to provide pathways to employment for people in their communities. Anyone wanting to transition off the cashless debit card could visit servicesaustralia.gov.au/debitcard or call the cashless debit card hotline on 1800 252 604. We have made it to the Thursday, which as we all know, is traditionally the worst day of the week. The house has been preoccupied with the national anti-corruption commission legislation – which will soon be the Senate’s problem, while the Senate has been preoccupied (at least behind the scenes) with the government’s IR legislation. All of that is coming to the pointy end, with just five House sitting days left, and seven Senate sitting days (it is sitting on the Fridays as well to get through the legislation backlog). But today the parliament will also turn its attention to Tanya Plibersek, the environment minister, as she delivers the government’s response to the joint select committee into the report into the destruction of the Indigenous heritage site Juukan Gorge. Juukan Gorge’s destruction was another dark moment in the nation’s history, highlighting how little protection Aboriginal sacred sites had. Plibersek will be speaking very soon and we will bring you that. You have Katharine Murphy, Paul Karp, Josh Butler and Daniel Hurst – as well as Amy Remeikis on the blog for most of the day. I have already had three coffees already and am headed for my fourth. Ready? Let’s get into it. Government to respond to Juukan Gorge report One of the first items of business today will be environment minister Tanya Plibersek giving the government’s response to the joint select committee on northern Australia report into the destruction of Juukan Gorge. The committee found Australia must do more to protect Aboriginal cultural heritage by overhauling “grossly inadequate” laws and giving traditional owners the “right to withhold consent” over developments on their country. Plibersek will be joined by Linda Burney, Senator Pat Dodson and the First Nations Heritage Protection Alliance to sign the co-design partnership agreement on cultural heritage reform. MPs could vote on setting up federal anti-corruption watchdog after debating the matter last night and hearing suggested amendments from independents including Zali Steggall. She said while the government’s proposed model would help increase accountability and transparency, she did not believe it went far enough: At the moment there is much too much provision in this bill that keeps it behind closed doors and provides a whole different standard for politicians than the rest of the public. Another independent, Dai Le, who represents the multicultural electorate of Fowler, pushed for the commission to ensure anti-corruption measurers would not negatively impact the mental health of witnesses called to give evidence. Coalition MP Bridget Archer, who crossed the floor in the last parliament to bring on debate about Helen Haines’ proposal for an anti-corruption commission, is sticking to her guns by flagging last night that she was supporting crossbench amendments removing “exceptional circumstances” as the test for whether or not there are public hearings, and replacing that threshold with a public interest test. Katharine Murphy wrote last night: She’s backed an extension of protections for whistleblowers, and Archer has also argued if the government of the day departs from the recommendations of a parliamentary committee overseeing the new integrity body, the government should provide reasons for that departure. This won’t make a difference to the final outcome on current indications because Labor has the numbers with the bulk of the Coalition to make exceptional circumstances the legislated test for public hearings – but Archer is remaining true to the spirit of her floor crossing one year ago. Good morning and welcome to the Australian politics live blog. Amy Remeikis will be here shortly but let’s look at the main stories making news overnight. Parts of regional NSW remain at high risk of flooding today with the Lachlan River still rising downstream of Forbes in the central west. Helicopters have been used to airlift sheep to safety in Condobolin, which is cut off by an inland sea. Residents in Euabalong have been told to evacuate because the river is going to peak at a record 8m today. Some residents in Moulamein in the Riverina have chosen to stay despite a warning that it could be cut off until December. The federal environment department allowed the National Farmers’ Federation to attend a meeting about clearing of native grasslands by a company called Jam Land, part-owned by then-energy minister, Angus Taylor. A document obtained by Guardian Australia shows that the department’s own officials said allowing the NFF to attend would not normally be “acceptable” and could set the wrong precedent. This is Lisa Cox’s exclusive story. We also have a report this morning that the Liberal party is expected to allow members the freedom to campaign however they wish on the Indigenous voice to parliament referendum, defying advice from former prime minister John Howard. Even Liberal backers of the voice say the government must give more information about it and conduct a parliamentary inquiry before they can pledge their support."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2020/jul/05/fifteen-years-after-gleneagles-its-the-uk-thats-in-need-of-aid","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2020-07-05T13:19:00Z","webTitle":"Fifteen years after the G8 summit, it's the UK that's in dire need of aid","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jul/05/fifteen-years-after-gleneagles-its-the-uk-thats-in-need-of-aid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2020/jul/05/fifteen-years-after-gleneagles-its-the-uk-thats-in-need-of-aid","fields":{"headline":"Fifteen years after the G8 summit, it's the UK that's in dire need of aid","bodyText":"Just like Gordon Brown 15 years ago, Rishi Sunak has spent June working on an aid package. As was the case in 2005, details of the chancellor’s plan to help the vulnerable will be announced on 8 July. There, though, the similarity ends. Sunak’s focus is the UK economy and in particular those about to lose their jobs as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. The doubling of work coaches in job centres tells its own story: the government knows unemployment will soar in the coming months. By contrast, in early July 2005, final preparations were being made for the G8 summit to be hosted by Tony Blair at the Gleneagles hotel in Scotland. The leaders who gathered for three days of talks didn’t spend much time discussing their own economic problems, for the good reason that they thought they had none. Instead, they worked on proposals that would provide debt relief and additional aid for Africa. The years leading up to the 2005 G8 marked the defeat of communism and the triumph of the market economy. It was a time of rising living standards and lower trade barriers; an era when globalisation seemed unstoppable and central banks had to do little but provide the occasional tweak to interest rates. Living standards rose year in, year out. Economists dubbed it the Great Moderation: a time of steady growth and low inflation. The fact that the UK had 16 years of uninterrupted growth between 1992 and 2008 and has since suffered the two severest downturns of the post-war era is one obvious difference between the pre-Gleneagles and post-Gleneagles worlds but there are plenty of others. For a start, the G8 has become a G7. The hopes in the 1990s that the collapse of communism, financial support channeled through the newly created European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and a seat at the west’s top table would transform Russia into a liberal western democracy have proved over-optimistic. Russia was kicked out of the G8 in 2014 after Vladimir Putin’s annexation of the Crimea and, despite the best efforts of Donald Trump, is viewed as a pariah state. Suma Chakrabarti, who left the EBRD last week after an eight-year stint, thinks there is more chance of the organisation extending its operations to sub-Saharan Africa than of resuming lending to Russia. Among the G7’s members – the UK, the US, France, Germany, Canada, Japan and Italy – some have also had second thoughts about China in the years since 2005. One of the guest invitees to Gleneagles was Chinese president Hu Jintao, which made sense given his country’s rapid growth in the 1990s and early 2000s. A big part of the globalisation story in the 1990s was the shift of production from the west, where labour costs were high, to China, where they were dirt cheap. This meant lower prices for Western consumers as a quid pro quo for the hollowing out of their manufacturing sectors. As with Russia, the assumption was that the arrival of the market would turn China into a western-style democracy. Again, the assumption was wrong: China does capitalism its own way, and stronger growth has not led to political freedom. On the contrary, as China has become richer so it has become more repressive. The passing last week of the Hong Kong national security law has led to a hardening of the mood. India has banned 59 Chinese mobile apps; the US congress has passed a bill that would make it possible to impose sanctions on banks that connive in the loss of Hong Kong’s autonomy. The UK government has promised to offer citizenship to 3 million residents of Hong Kong. It also has some awkward decisions to make over whether it wants China to be involved in the building of nuclear power stations or the 5G wireless network. One thing is certain: the dream of a community of countries all committed to the same ends is dead. Which is a pity, since the world still has to tackle the three issues that faced the Gleneagles summiteers: one that they didn’t tackle because they thought it didn’t exist; one that they thought they had solved but didn’t; and one where they tried and failed. The problem that failed to blip on to the G8 radar in 2005 was that the global economy was much more vulnerable than they imagined. Cheap goods from China and other emerging market economies meant low inflation, which in turn meant central banks could keep interest rates low. This created the right conditions for soaring asset prices and a widening of the gap between those who owned shares and houses, and those who didn’t. In 2005, the pricking of the bubble was only two years away. The problem that the G8 thought they had cracked was Africa. Debts were cancelled, aid budgets were increased, African governments improved the management of their economies. For a while, all looked good, and countries with strong growth and plentiful natural resources were able to borrow freely on the international financial markets. Even before Covid-19, many of those debts were unpayable. The pandemic has inevitably made things a lot worse. The World Bank is forecasting the first rise in global poverty in two decades. Finally, there’s the climate crisis: the issue that was on the agenda at Gleneagles, but where – courtesy of the hardline stance taken by George W Bush – there was no progress. Fifteen years on, the attitude of the man in the White House has not changed but the planet is even hotter. What’s needed? Nothing, apart from a vision of a sustainable, equitable future that all can sign up to and the leadership that was provided at Gleneagles to make it happen. Simple, really."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2019/dec/19/fossil-fuels-fall-to-record-low-in-britains-energy-mix-data-shows","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2019-12-19T13:50:04Z","webTitle":"Fossil fuels fall to record low proportion of UK energy mix","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/19/fossil-fuels-fall-to-record-low-in-britains-energy-mix-data-shows","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2019/dec/19/fossil-fuels-fall-to-record-low-in-britains-energy-mix-data-shows","fields":{"headline":"Fossil fuels fall to record low proportion of UK energy mix","bodyText":"The proportion of the UK’s power generation mix made up by fossil fuels has fallen to a record low after renewable energy became the UK’s largest source of electricity. Government figures showed the UK relied on renewables, such as wind and solar, for 38.9% of its electricity in the third quarter of this year, up from one-third in the same period in 2018. Renewable energy moved narrowly ahead of gas-fired power, which made up 38.8% of the electricity mix, to emerge as the UK’s biggest source of power. The rise of renewables combined with output from nuclear power plants pushed fossil fuels to their lowest share of the UK’s energy mix on record, according to the official data. The dwindling number of coal-fired power stations contributed 1% of the UK’s electricity in the third quarter, down from 2.5% in the same period in 2018. This was in part due to the earlier-than-expected end of generation at Cottam coal plant in Nottinghamshire, which burned through its remaining coal stocks before the official 30 September finish date. Another two coal plants, Aberthaw B and Fiddler’s Ferry, are due to close in March, leaving four coal-fired power stations in the UK. The report also said the UK’s growing fleet of offshore wind projects generated more electricity than onshore windfarms for the first time. The giant turbines off the coast generated 9.8% of the UK’s electricity, up from 6.7% in 2018. Onshore windfarms lagged slightly behind, generating 9.2% of the UK’s electricity in the third quarter, up from 7.3% in the same period last year. Since the record-breaking quarter, wind power reached fresh highs earlier this month to generate almost 45% of the UK’s electricity on one day, and an all-time high of 16GW overnight. The wind power highs meant thousands of homes were paid to plug in their electric vehicles overnight and set their dishwashers on timers for the early hours of the morning to make use of the extra energy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2022/mar/02/oil-price-blasts-111-opec-meeting-sberbank-european-arm-closed-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-02T17:02:54Z","webTitle":"Oil price jumps to nearly $114; natural gas prices reach record highs – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2022/mar/02/oil-price-blasts-111-opec-meeting-sberbank-european-arm-closed-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2022/mar/02/oil-price-blasts-111-opec-meeting-sberbank-european-arm-closed-business-live","fields":{"headline":"Oil price jumps to nearly $114; natural gas prices reach record highs – as it happened","bodyText":"It’s been another day of wild market moves, mainly in commodity markets. Fears that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and wider sanctions imposed by the west could affect supplies from both countries have driven oil and gas prices sharply higher, and have also driven up other commodities such as wheat and corn, and metals. Wheat hit a 14-year peak while aluminium reached a new record high of $3,597 a tonne. Oil prices jumped to near eight-year highs. Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, rose as high as $113.94 a barrel, the highest since June 2014, and has been trading around $111 for most of the day. It has pared some of the gains since then while US light crude is 2.6% higher at $106.1. Brent has gained some 40% so far this year. ED&amp;F Man Capital Markets analyst Edward Meir told Reuters: Oil has been pushing higher on growing perceptions that Russian oil is unable to be ‘transacted’. Although oil is not technically under sanction, traders are understandably nervous about taking delivery of Russian crude, let alone storing, shipping, and ultimately selling it. Natural gas prices have also soared, with the Dutch April gas contract hitting a new record high of €185 per megawatt hour, and is currently trading 41% higher at €171.19 per megawatt hour. British wholesale gas is 35% higher at 390.79p per therm after touching 398.05p per therm, close to the record of 450p seen last December. European coal prices for 2023 rose to a record $260.5 a tonne on fears of shortages in Europe, heavily relies on on Russia for its coal and gas. The Russian steel producer Severstal said it had suspended supplies to the EU due to sanctions on its shareholders. The average cost of a litre of petrol at UK forecourts was at a fresh high of 151.67p on Tuesday, up from 151.16p on Monday, according to the data firm Experian Catalist. The average cost of a litre of diesel is also at a record high, reaching 155.23p. RAC’s fuel spokesperson, Simon Williams, said: “If oil does stay at this level, the journey to an average unleaded price of 155p may be far too quick.” Wheat prices reached hit $10.59 a bushel, the highest since March 2008. Corn prices rose to the highest since December 2012. On the stock markets, the FTSE 100 index index has closed 99 points higher at 7,429.56, a 1.4% gain. Germany’s Dax has finished the day 95 points higher at 14,000, a 0.7% rise, while France’s CAC rose 1.6% to 6,498 and Italy’s FTSE MiB gained 0.7% to 24,534. The Moscow stock exchange was closed for a third day, but the Russian rouble plunged to a new record low of 110 per dollar in Moscow (outside Russia, it hit a record low of 120 per dollar on the EBS electronic trading platform on Monday). Here are some of our main stories: A cargo of oil from Russia is en route to a British port where it is scheduled to arrive on Wednesday evening, due to a loophole in the ban imposed this week by the government in response to Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. The Department for Transport said on Tuesday it had implemented a ban closing British ports to all ships that are Russian-owned, operated, controlled, chartered, registered or flagged. However, the department has confirmed that the prohibition does not cover the origin of the cargo. Roman Abramovich has put Chelsea up for sale and the Swiss billionaire Hansjörg Wyss has said he is part of a consortium interested in buying the club. Thank you for reading. We’ll be back tomorrow. Bye! – JK In case you were wondering: Russia can still send oil and gas to Britain despite a ban on Russian vessels docking at British ports, according to the Department for Transport. This is because prohibition on Russian ships doesn’t cover the origin of the cargo. Yesterday the UK passed a law that banned all ships that have any connection to Russia from entering its ports following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. This applies to all ships that are Russian owned, operated, controlled, chartered, registered or flagged. However, the DfT said the sanctions were focused on the vessel, not its cargo. This means that ships registered with other countries can still transport Russian oil or liquefied natural gas to Britain. On Wall Street, US stocks have opened higher, no doubt boosted by Fed chair Jerome Powell’s comments on interet rate hikes. The Dow Jones and S&amp;P 500 have just extended gains to 1%. Over here, the FTSE 100, the French and the Italian bourses are all more than 1% ahead while the German market is unchanged. Airbus has joined Boeing in halting the supply of aircraft parts and services to Russian airlines, squeezing its aviation industry in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine, reports our transport correspondent Gwyn Topham. The European aerospace giant said today it was suspending support and delivery of spare parts, in line with international sanctions. Boeing stopped work with Russian airlines on Tuesday night after President Biden announced further sanctions on Moscow, including following Britain and the EU in banning Russian planes from its airspace. The Seattle-based manufacturer said: We have suspended major operations in Moscow and temporarily closed our office in Kyiv. We are also suspending parts, maintenance and technical support services for Russian airlines. As the conflict continues, our teams are focused on ensuring the safety of our teammates in the region. Both manufacturers were unwilling to predict how it would affect Russian aviation in the short and medium term. Around two thirds of the total Russian fleet are either Boeing or Airbus made - some 332 by Boeing and 304 Airbus aircraft – and while maintenance and repair of all aircraft in service is routine and ongoing, the impact is unlikely to be immediate unless critical parts fail. The oil cartel Opec and its allies including Russia, known as Opec+, agreed at today’s meeting to stick to their plans for a modest rise in output in April – despite Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and in defiance of calls from the United States and other major consumers for more supplies, as crude prices rocketed to $112 a barrel. Brent crude shot above $110 a barrel to as high as $113.02, a peak last seen in June 2014. US light crude went above $111 and is now at $110.5 a barrel. Both contracts are more than 7% higher on the day. Yesterday’s move by the United States and 30 countries to release 60m barrels of oil from their strategic reserves in an attempt to stabilise global energy markets has had little to no impact so far. Today’s Opec+ meeting lasted less than a quarter of an hour – the shortest meeting on record – and according to Reuters, no mention was made of Ukraine. The group said in a statement: Current oil market fundamentals and the consensus on its outlook pointed to a well-balanced market, and that current volatility is not caused by changes in market fundamentals but by current geopolitical developments. Alexander Novak, the Russian deputy prime minister, who attended the talks, said he hoped oil market volatility would ease and that Russian output was expected to reach pre-pandemic levels in May. Opec+ has been hiking output by 400,000 barrels per day each month since August, unwinding cuts made when the coronavirus pandemic led to a slump in demand for oil. The next meeting is scheduled for 31 March. US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has said that the central bank will push on with plans to hike interest rates this month to counter sky-high inflation, although the outbreak of war in Ukraine has made the outlook “highly uncertain”. In prepared remarks for his testimony to the US House of Representatives’ financial services committee, Powell reiterated the Fed’s view that high inflation and an “extremely tight” labour market warrant higher interest rates. In the UK, we’ve had more evidence of a booming housing market. A shortage of homes for sale last month sent house price growth spiralling for the seventh consecutive month to 12.6%, prompting concerns that property values are moving further out of reach of first-time buyers. Prices of the average home increased by 1.7% in February to more than £260,000 for the first time, said the building society Nationwide, accelerating the pace of growth from 11.2% in January. Britain’s biggest housebuilder, Persimmon, has announced profits of nearly £1bn for 2021, but cautioned that the Ukraine invasion could disrupt the the UK economy in the year ahead. Its shares were among the top risers on the FTSE 100, up 4.5% this afternoon. Persimmon’s profits jumped by nearly a quarter to £970m thanks to “positive pricing conditions” in every British region in which it operated, as the house price boom defied the coronavirus pandemic, it said today. Dean Finch, Persimmon’s chief executive, said he was “mindful of the growing risk of an economic impact as a result of the tragic conflict in Ukraine”, but added he expected continued house price rises to “mitigate build cost inflation”, suggesting higher costs for materials and labour would be passed on to buyers. Vistry Group, the sixth biggest London-listed housebuilder formerly known as Bovis Homes, also announced bumper results on Wednesday, saying it had more than tripled its annual profits to £320m. Everton FC has suspended its commercial ties with the Russian companies USM, Megafon and Yota. The football club said in a statement: Everyone at Everton remains shocked and saddened by the appalling events unfolding in Ukraine. This tragic situation must end as soon as possible, and any further loss of life must be avoided. The players, coaching staff and everyone working at Everton is providing full support to our player Vitalii Mykolenko and his family and will continue to do so. The Club can confirm that it has suspended with immediate effect all commercial sponsorship arrangements with the Russian companies USM, Megafon and Yota. Alisher Usmanov has seen his assets frozen as part of sanctions imposed by the European Union and the Uzbekistan-born billionaire’s USM Holdings sponsors Everton’s training ground, with an initial five-year deal announced in 2017. It also has an option on naming rights for Everton’s new stadium – a deal worth £30m to the club. MegaFon is among USM Holdings’ businesses and Everton Women signed a multi-year principal partnership deal with the telecommunications operator in October 2020, when Yota – part of the MegaFon Group – was added to the sleeve. British and Dutch natural gas prices have jumped as traders fretted about the impact of war in Ukraine and western sanctions on Russian gas supplies. The British wholesale gas contract for day-ahead delivery jumped 85p to 380p per therm, while the April contract rose 68.5p, or 23.5%, to 360p per therm. The Dutch April gas contract hit a new record high of €185 per megawatt hour, and is currently trading 29% higher at €158.60. Brent crude has climbed more than 6% to $111.46 a barrel, after breaching $113 a barrel earlier, the highest since June 2014. Russia accounts for a tenth of global oil supplies and is the second-largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia. Brent crude has gained more than 40% so far this year. The Italian oil giant ENI said today that it was pulling out of the Blue Stream natural gas pipeline that links Russia to Turkey, which the company jointly controls with Russian energy giant Gazprom. A spokesperson said that ENI intends to sell its 50% stake in Blue Stream, following similar moves by BP, Shell and ExxonMobil to exit Russian projects. Commodities prices are booming as sanctions on Russia bite, triggering supply fears: aluminium hit a new record today and nickel and palladium are also rising. Three-month aluminium on the London Metal Exchange reached $3,552 a tonne. It has gained 37% over the past two-and-a-half months, initially on weaker output due to power issues and more recently in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Commerzbank analyst Daniel Briesemann told Reuters he wouldn’t be surprised to see aluminium rise to $4,000 a tonne. Commerzbank analysts said in a note: Supply outages from Russia are now but a question of time. Depending on how long they last, they could cause turmoil – in which case prices would rise significantly further. The price of nickel, used in electric car batteries, rose to $25,530 a tonne, close to an 11-year high reached last week. Palladium, used in catalytic car converters to curb emissions, is hovering near a seven-month peak hit on Tuesday. Zinc and copper prices are also climbing. Wheat and corn prices continue to climb, as Russia and Ukraine are major exporters of both grains. Wheat prices hit $10.59 a bushel, the highest since March 2008, while corn rose to $7.47 a bushel, the highest since December 2012. Analysts at ING said: Global buyers of grains have been increasingly turning to the US, Europe or South America to secure supplies in the medium term, given the ongoing conflict. Moreover, demand for stockpiling has also increased due to current uncertainty. Germany is considering a slower exit from coal-powered energy, in case Russia stops gas deliveries to Europe, economy minister Robert Habeck said today. The comments, made on public radio Deutschlandfunk, show how the escalating war in Ukraine has impacted Germany’s planned shift to a zero carbon economy. In remarks that would have been unthinkable for a Green minister just a week ago, Habeck said: Short-term it may be that as a precaution and in order to be prepared for the worst, we have to keep coal-powered plants on standby and maybe even let them operate. Pragmatism must trump every political commitment. The security of supplies must be safeguarded. In response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last Thursday, German chancellor Olaf Scholz pulled the plug on the planned Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline to ship gas directly from Russia to Germany. He has also announced plans to build two liquified natural gas terminals to handle LNG imports, as an alternative to Russian gas, as well as creating a national gas and coal reserve. The German government had planned to shut its nuclear power stations by the end of this year, and phase out coal-fired power stations by 2030, but the Ukraine crisis has forced a rethink. Ryanair has pledged to be “the first airline to return to Ukraine” when it is safe to do so after the Russian invasion, reports our transport correspondent Gwyn Topham. Its chief executive, Michael O’Leary, said Ryanair had been set to fly 2 million people to four airports in the country this year and had hoped to expand further before the invasion last week. He said he did not believe it would be possible to fly to Ukraine “for the foreseeable future, after Russia … essentially disabled a lot of the flight systems”. He added: “We will be the first airline to return to Ukraine when it is safe to do so … but I suspect it will take until next winter, when hopefully the Ukrainians will have seen off the Russians and sent them back to where they came from.” O’Leary said Ryanair was flying humanitarian cargo in the belly of its planes “for the first time in 30 years” to Polish airports, liaising with Ukrainian embassies. The airline has had a surge in bookings to Poland, where family members are flying to reunite with Ukrainian refugees close to the border. Wider flight bookings on Ryanair have otherwise dropped about 20% in the first days of the conflict, and are still around 10% down. It is not the place for cryptocurrency exchanges to block transactions by Russian users, the founder of one of the largest trading platforms has said, amid concern that digital currencies are being used to bypass sanctions, reports my colleague Joanna Partridge. The chief executive and founder of Binance, Changpeng Zhao, said the company was “not in a position to sanction, like, populations of people”. “There are a few hundred individuals that are on the international sanctions list in Russia, mostly politicians, and we follow that very, very strictly,” Zhao told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “We differentiate between the Russian politicians who start wars and the normal people, many normal Russians do not agree with war.” He added: “We are not political, we are against war, but we are here to help the people.” Europe’s main stock indices have turned positive, while the FTSE 100 index in London (which opened higher unlike the rest of Europe) has extended gains. UK’s FTSE 100 up 0.9%, or 65 points, to 7,395 Germany’s Dax up 0.5% at 13,972 France’s CAC up 0.6% at 6,433 Italy’s FTSE 100 up 0.3% at 24,442 The rouble has lost 8%, falling to 109.15 per dollar today as westerns sanctions against Russia wreaked havoc on the country’s financial system. The Russian currency hit 110 per dollar earlier. There has been speculation that Vladimir Putin might turn to cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin to bypass western sanctions, as crypto doesn’t operate through traditional banking channels. The war in Ukraine has boosted demand for bitcoin in both countries, as sanctions have effectively cut Russia off from the global financial network, while Ukraine has imposed strict capital controls. Russians and Ukrainians have been buying bitcoin above the US market rate. Its price jumped more than 15% yesterday and it is currently trading 1% higher at $44,352. Away from the markets, eurozone inflation has jumped to another record high. Inflation in the 19 countries sharing the euro unexpectedly rose to an annual rate of 5.8% in February from 5.1% in January, according to a flash estimate released by Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union. Energy costs rose at an annual rate of 31.7% after a 28.8% rise in January while food and alcohol prices were up 4.1%, compared with 3.5% in January. Inflation in Germany picked up to 5.5% from 5.1% in January, while Italy was even higher at 6.2% from 5.1% and Spanish inflation surged to an estimated 7.5% from 6.2%. France recorded a 4.1% rate last month, up from 3.3% in January. The escalating war in Ukraine has sent wholesale oil and gas prices and other commodity prices soaring, from metals to wheat, which threatens to push global inflation even higher in coming months. While the Moscow stock exchange remains shut for a third day, some Russian companies have secondary listings in London. Shares in Sberbank, the biggest lender, have collapsed almost 95% and are worth just 1 US cent. The bank has been forced to pull out of Europe after the European Central Bank ordered its European arm to close last night, saying it was failing or likely to fail following a customer run on deposits. The Opec oil cartel and its allies are likely stick to modest oil output rises when they meet later today, officials said. Officials said Saudi Arabia, the world’s biggest oil producer, and the United Arab Emirates had reconfirmed their deal with Russia, the second-biggest oil exporter, despite widening sanctions against Moscow and oil prices hitting eight-year highs. Brent crude, the global benchmark, shot up to over $113 a barrel this morning, the highest since June 2014, and is now trading at $11041 a barrel, up 5.2%. US light crude went over $111 a barrel, the highest since August 2013, and is now at $108.75. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) and allies led by Russia – a group known as Opec+ – have been pumping 400,000 more barrels per day (bpd) each month since August, to unwind cuts made after the Covid-19 pandemic slashed demand. The United States has repeatedly said it would like to see Opec+ ramp up production more, but only a few countries have capacity to do so, including Opec leader Saudi Arabia and its Gulf neighbour, the UAE. Four Opec+ sources told Reuters yesterday that the group would probably agree another 400,000 bpd increase for April. They said Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had had no impact so far on the functioning of the supply agreement. Bloomberg News reported that while Russia increased its oil production in February, it probably missed its quota for a third month. While oil prices are still trading more than 6% higher, with Brent crude above $111 a barrel, natural gas prices have also spiked, taking them close to record highs. Amid fears that war in Ukraine could disrupt gas flows to Europe, British natural gas benchmark rose 37% to 397.48p per therm, while the Dutch gas futures contract jumped 39% to €169.5 per megawatt hour. However, Russia’s Gazprom said this morning that it was shipping gas to Europe via Ukraine in line with customers’ requests. Here is our full story on Sberbank, Russia’s biggest lender, pulling out of Europe after a run on deposits and an order by the European Central Bank to close its European arm. The bank said in a statement that its European subsidiaries had faced “abnormal cash outflows”, meaning it could no longer supply them with liquidity, reports my colleague Joanna Partridge. However, Sberbank said it had sufficient capital to be able to make payments to all of its depositors. Sberbank has been operating in Germany, Austria, Croatia, and Hungary among other countries, and had European assets worth €13bn (£10.8bn) at the end of 2020. The lender’s announcement came only hours after the European Central Bank had ordered closure of its European arm, warning it could fail after a run on deposits amid a backlash resulting from the Russian president Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. They went on to say: The World Bank and the IMF are also working together to assess the economic and financial impact of the conflict and refugees on other countries in the region and the world. We stand ready to provide enhanced policy, technical, and financial support to neighbouring countries as needed. Coordinated international action will be crucial to mitigate risks and navigate the treacherous period ahead. This crisis affects the lives and livelihoods of people around the world, and we offer them our full support. The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank last night issued a rare political statement condemning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva and World Bank president David Malpass said: We are deeply shocked and saddened by the devastating human and economic toll brought by the war in Ukraine. People are being killed, injured, and forced to flee, and massive damage is caused to the country’s physical infrastructure. We stand with the Ukrainian people through these horrifying developments. The war is also creating significant spillovers to other countries. Commodity prices are being driven higher and risk further fueling inflation, which hits the poor the hardest. Disruptions in financial markets will continue to worsen should the conflict persist. The sanctions announced over the last few days will also have a significant economic impact. We are assessing the situation and discussing appropriate policy responses with our international partners. They said the institutions were working together to support Ukraine, and the IMF would respond to the country’s request for emergency financing next week. Ukraine is also eligible for $2.2bn under a pre-existing IMF programme between now and the end of June. The World Bank is preparing a $3bn package of support in the coming months, starting with at least $350m that will be submitted to the board for approval this week, followed by $200m in fast-disbursing support for health and education. The Swiss billionaire Hansjörg Wyss has claimed he has been offered the chance to join a takeover bid for Chelsea as pressure grows on Roman Abramovich to sell the club, writes our football reporter Jacob Steinberg. Abramovich’s future at Chelsea is in doubt after he announced plans to relinquish the running of the club and the Labour MP Chris Bryant claimed that the Russian was hastily selling UK properties to avoid potential financial sanctions. Abramovich’s decision to transfer the stewardship and care of Chelsea to the trustees of the club’s charitable foundation came after a call in parliament for him to face sanctions following the invasion of Ukraine. The move has increased the sense that the 55-year-old, who has vehemently disputed reports suggesting his alleged closeness to Vladimir Putin and Russia or that he has done anything to merit being sanctioned, could be ready to tempted to sell. Time for a quick news round-up. Apple announced last night that it would pause product sales in Russia. Apple Pay and other services have been limited, and Russian state media, RT News and Sputnik News, are no longer available for download from the Apple Store outside Russia. An MP has claimed that the Russian oligarch and Chelsea football club owner, Roman Abramovich, is hastily selling UK properties to avoid potential financial sanctions. Chris Bryant, the Labour MP and head of the parliamentary standards committee, said the government was moving too slowly on imposing sanctions on those with alleged links to Vladimir Putin following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. He told the Commons on Tuesday: “I think he [Abramovich] is terrified of being sanctioned, which is why he’s already going to sell his home tomorrow, and sell another flat as well. My anxiety is that we’re taking too long about these things.” Announcing a package of measures in the wake of the conflict, the Foreign Office said “120 businesses and oligarchs” would be hit by swingeing new financial restrictions. Only a handful of individuals have so far been targeted, however. The FTSE 100 index in London has opened 0.5% higher, while Germany’s Dax fell 0.5%, and Italy’s FTSE MiB lost 1.3%. France’s CAC and and Spain’s Ibex slipped 0.1%. The Russian mining groups Evraz and Polymetal are the main risers on the FTSE 100, but are expected to be ejected from the index in a reshuffle tonight after heavy share price declines in recent days. Other mining companies, Rio Tinto and Fresnillo, along with oil giants Shell and BP and the commodities trader Glencore, are also among the gainers in early trading. They are set to benefit from surging oil, gas and other commodities prices, from metals to wheat. Crude oil prices continue to surge: Brent crude just jumped $8 past $113 a barrel, the highest since June 2014. US light crude rose to $111.5 a barrel, the highest since August 2013. Amanda Blanc, chief executive of the British insurer Aviva, has just said that the company would divest from Russia “as soon as we practically can”. Speaking on a results call to reporters, she said the firm’s asset management arm, Aviva Investors, had less than 0.1% of funds invested in Russia. The insurer Hiscox said it had “negligible exposure” to Ukrainian and Russian assets. More on Sberbank’s European arm, which has been closed by order of the European Central bank, after a run on deposits. The central banks of Slovenia and Croatia announced that Sberbank’s operations in their countries would be taken over by Slovenia’s biggest banking group NLB and the Croatian Postal Bank, which is majority owned by the government. Customers will be able to withdraw money as normal from Wednesday after restrictions over the past two days. Sberbank Europe said in November it had reached a deal to sell its subsidiaries in Croatia, Slovenia, Hungary, Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina to a group including Serbia’s AIK bank and Slovenia’s Gorenjska bank. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The Brent crude oil price has blasted past $111 a barrel, its highest level since early July 2014, despite a decision by the United States to release, with its allies, about 60m barrels from their strategic reserves, in an attempt to stabilise global energy markets. US light crude has also jumped more than 6%, to $109.48 a barrel, its highest since September 2013. The oil cartel Opec will hold a meeting today to discuss production plans. So far, the cartel confirmed that it remained committed to the Opec+ deal with Russia, and is not expected to change production plans despite the war in Ukraine. The American oil giant Exxon Mobil announced yesterday that it would exit its Russian operations, including oil production fields, following similar moves by British companies BP and Shell, and Norway’s Equinor. The Moscow stock exchange will remain shut for a third day, while the rouble is trading at 101.1 per dollar, after hitting a record high of 117 per dollar on Tuesday. Stocks are in for another rough ride. On Wall Street, the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq closed about 1.6% lower while the Dow Jones industrial average dropped nearly 1.8%. Asian markets are mostly lower: Japan’s Nikkei closed down 1.7% while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng lost 1.9%. European bourses are set for a lower open, after suffering declines in the last two days. Last night, the European arm of Sberbank, Russia’s biggest lender, was closed by order of the European Central Bank. The ECB had warned on Monday that the bank, based in Vienna, was failing or likely to fail because of a run on deposits. This prompted Austria’s Financial Market Authority to impose a moratorium on the bank’s activities, and just over an hour before the moratorium was due to expire last night, the FMA ordered the bank to close with immediate effect, citing the ECB order. The US, EU, UK and other nations have responded to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine with a battery of sanctions including banning big Russian banks from Swift, the main global payments system. As a result, Sberbank Europe said on Monday that it had “experienced a significant outflow of customer deposits within a very short period of time”. As sanctions against Russia widened, a number of British firms scrambled to dump Russian assets yesterday, including Legal &amp; General, Abrdn and the state-run pension scheme Nest, which said they would try to sell holdings in Russian stocks. British Gas owner Centrica became the third big British energy firm to cut ties with Russia within a week, echoing BP and Shell by announcing the end of its gas supply agreement with Kremlin-controlled Gazprom. The FTSE 100 commodities trader Glencore said it would review its business activities in Russia, including its equity stakes in two Russian-linked companies: state-controlled oil company Rosneft and FTSE 100 miner En+ Group. Economists at ING said: Given the war raging on the outskirts of western Europe, it is some surprise how little markets have responded in total, with negative days punctuated by dip-buying in some markets. This is especially true of the equity market, where 1.5% falls yesterday in the Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 leave both bourses some way above their lows for the year and with equity futures suggesting a more positive outlook. It’s a different story in bond space. European bond yields were down sharply yesterday. two-year German bond yields fell more than 20bp and 10-year bund yields were down 21bp to -0.08%. US Treasury yields also fell heavily. The Russia-Ukraine conflict will probably continue to dominate markets for the foreseeable future. The announcement yesterday that Russia will not pay coupons to foreign holders on its government debt should push investors further into safe-havens. Support for starting the EU membership process for Ukraine shows the unity of support for Ukraine from Western Europe but is unlikely to help calm tensions.

Renewables are the future","bodyText":"Toshiba’s decision to pull out of building a nuclear power station in Cumbria last week will cause shockwaves far beyond the north-west of England. The outcome is a disaster for the surrounding area, which is heavily reliant on the nuclear industry for jobs and prosperity. Local politicians admit it is a blow and a disappointment for Cumbrians hoping for roles at the proposed Moorside plant. They say they genuinely believe a new buyer for the site will come forward. But that looks like wishful thinking. To an extent, the demise of Moorside can be attributed to problems with it as a specific project. It has looked doomed since Toshiba’s US nuclear unit, Westinghouse, declared bankruptcy in 2017 and the company ruled out new nuclear investments outside of Japan. Efforts to woo the South Korean energy company Kepco as a buyer then floundered. The executive leading the sale for Toshiba blamed the failure to find a buyer on being “caught between a series of unplanned and uncontrollable events”. But the end of Moorside is also emblematic of the wider challenges that new nuclear faces. It took a decade from Tony Blair signalling the UK’s renewed interest in nuclear power in 2006 for France’s EDF Energy and the British government to sign a generous subsidy deal and green-light Hinkley Point C, the UK’s first new nuclear plant in a generation. In all likelihood, it will not be generating electricity until 2027. Ministers insist new nuclear power stations are still an essential way of hitting the country’s greenhouse gas emission targets and providing energy security as old plants are switched off in the 2020s. Losing Moorside means there are just five other new nuclear projects planned, including Hinkley Point C. Eyes will now turn to Hitachi’s proposed Wylfa Newydd plant on Anglesey. The project is the furthest along the line after Hinkley, but it’s far from a done deal. The new nuclear drive was meant to be solely funded by the private sector, but the government has already made a striking exception in the case of Wylfa. Ministers have promised Hitachi they will use public money to take a £5bn stake in the scheme. Such a dramatic U-turn on policy is explained by the fact that Wylfa is about more than the UK’s desire for new nuclear: it is also about cooperation with Tokyo and bringing forth other investment from Japanese firms, such as carmakers, after Brexit. There is a pattern here. The subsidy deal for Hinkley was declared exceptional because it was the first new nuclear plant and the risk was loaded on to the developer. Now the second one will be exceptional too. What’s to say that the third, fourth and fifth will be any different? The collapse of Moorside should be cause for the government to look again at whether it is backing the right horse by doggedly pursuing new nuclear. Even the government’s own advisers, the National Infrastructure Commission, are urging a rethink. Renewables, they point out, are simply less risky. Ministers will probably invoke the spectre of missed climate-change targets to argue for nuclear. But the statutory advisers on those targets recently said the 2030 goal could be achieved with Hinkley alone. The momentum is with renewables. The technology is becoming cheaper, investors view it as an increasingly safe bet and the need for subsidies is diminishing. Next year we will find out how much cheaper offshore wind, which has already halved in cost, can become in a new round of government auctions. Ditching new nuclear would require a huge increase in the amount of wind and solar power already expected in coming years. It would need dramatic progress on energy storage, smarter grids and even more efficient use of energy. All those things will be difficult. But pursuing an impossible atomic dream, as Moorside demonstrates, looks even harder. Sky’s secret weapon? Sky’s departure from the FTSE 100 last week signalled the end of almost three decades of Murdoch control and set the scene for new owner Comcast to grapple with a big strategic challenge: the rise of streaming services. Comcast’s boss, Brian Roberts, has pledged to avoid meddling with Sky - Comcast may be the biggest cable operator in the US but it has zero European pay-TV experience - but he has admitted one Sky jewel has caught his attention. Now TV, an on-demand streaming service, is Sky’s riposte to Netflix and Roberts believes it could become a global product. Roberts failed with his initial streaming effort, Watchable. Since then he has sat on the sidelines while the likes of Disney and Warner owner AT&amp;T have joined the streaming battle against Netflix and Amazon. The acquisition of Sky will allow him to try again. Now TV has about 1.5 million UK subscribers, which is hardly a threat to Netflix’s almost 10 million, but it is being used as a springboard into Sky-free European markets like Spain. The world might follow. The streaming competition also threatens a cornerstone of Sky’s business: content. Sky’s content deal with Disney, which narrowly failed to buy Sky this year, expires in 2020 and the Hollywood giant has considerable leverage after it acquired Murdoch’s Fox this year. If Disney’s plans for a US streaming service prove wildly successful it may look to pull its content from Sky to bolster international ambitions. However, that would be a very big call given its content is viewed in 23m Sky homes across Europe. At least one thing off the “to-do” list appears to be the three-year cycle of worry that is the Premier League. BT has raised the white flag in the football rights bidding wars and there is no serious competition elsewhere. Streaming however, is a different ball game. Has the penny really dropped for Persimmon? So farewell Jeff Fairburn, probably the most egregiously overpaid boss in modern corporate history. Last December Fairburn, the boss of housebuilder Persimmon was handed a £100m bonus from an atrociously badly designed long-term incentive plan (LTIP) set up in 2012. That LTIP morphed into a winning lottery ticket when George Osborne unveiled his help-to-buy scheme for first-time buyers in 2013, backed by billions of pounds of taxpayers’ cash. It put rocket fuel into new house sales, and housebuilders’ profits. The Persimmon share price had risen fivefold when the LTIP matured last Christmas. Other housebuilders’ shares rose just as much, but they did not have LTIPs modelled on those Las Vegas fruit machines which spew out coins like a golden waterfall. The then chairman of Persimmon and the director who signed off the LTIP tried to persuade Fairburn to take a smaller sum and donate a large portion to charity. He refused. They quit. The ensuing furore persuaded Fairburn to forgo £25m. Too little, too late. He promised to set up a charitable trust. When? How much? He wouldn’t say. Last month, when a BBC reporter asked about the payout, Fairburn stomped off, telling the journalist it was “unfortunate” he had asked that. Last week, at long last, Persimmon realised that Fairburn has done lasting damage to the company’s reputation and he was shown the door. There are lessons from this saga: all incentives should have a maximum payout; LTIPs which generate cash from external factors – like help-to-buy – are a reward for luck, not performance; shareholders should wake up and realise the damage done to business by executive greed (more than half of Persimmon shareholders backed this payout even amid the furore). Persimmon will now be linked with executive excess for years. To escape the Fairburn stain it may have to change its name. But has the penny properly dropped, even now? Because the interim boss, David Jenkinson, got £40m from that LTIP. But for Fairburn it would have been Jenkinson branded one of the UK’s greediest bosses."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/sep/30/energy-firms-demand-billions-from-uk-taxpayer-for-mini-reactors","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-09-30T15:34:34Z","webTitle":"Energy firms demand billions from UK taxpayer for mini reactors","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/30/energy-firms-demand-billions-from-uk-taxpayer-for-mini-reactors","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/sep/30/energy-firms-demand-billions-from-uk-taxpayer-for-mini-reactors","fields":{"headline":"Energy firms demand billions from UK taxpayer for mini reactors","bodyText":"Backers of mini nuclear power stations have asked for billions of pounds of taxpayers’ money to build their first UK projects, according to an official document. Advocates for small modular reactors (SMRs) argue they are more affordable and less risky than conventional large-scale nuclear plants, and therefore able to compete with the falling costs of windfarms and solar power. But the nuclear industry’s claims that the mini plants would be a cheap option for producing low-carbon power appear to be undermined by the significant sums it has been asking of ministers. Some firms have been calling for as much as £3.6bn to fund construction costs, according to a government-commissioned report, released under freedom of information rules. Companies also wanted up to £480m of public money to help steer their reactor designs through the regulatory approval process, which is a cost usually paid by nuclear companies. Ten companies hoping to build the plants requested direct government funding, according to the briefing paper by the Expert Finance Working Group on Small Reactors. While the report named the companies involved in the mini nuclear projects, it did not specify who was asking for financial support. David Lowry, a nuclear policy consultant who obtained the document, said: “SMRs are either old, discredited designs repackaged when companies see governments prepared to throw taxpayers’ subsidies to support them, or are exotic new technologies, with decades of research needed before they reach commercial maturity.” The working group that drafted the report, and was appointed by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), urged the government in August to put in place a framework to help bring the smaller plants to market. The government has already offered £44m of funding for research and development of one group of SMRs, which typically have a capacity of less than a tenth of the Hinkley Point C nuclear plant being built in Somerset, or enough power for 600,000 homes. Mini nuclear power stations are unlikely to supply clean energy to Britain’s homes and businesses any time soon. Of more than 30 British, US and Chinese companies that have expressed an interest in building one in the UK, the majority told the working group that their power stations would be ready to deployed in the 2030s. The companies include UK firms such as Rolls-Royce, Sheffield Forgemasters and Atkins, along with China’s CNNC, US companies NuScale and Westinghouse, and France’s EDF Energy. The working group found the firms’ cost estimates “varied significantly”, to the degree that some of the companies clearly had a “lack of understanding” of how British nuclear regulation works. It also noted that some of the companies proposed using “non-standard fuels” rather than the conventional uranium used by today’s nuclear plants, which “may add cost to business models” because of new facilities to produce and later manage the spent fuel. The firms told the group that the four main barriers they faced were finding and confirming sites, the cost of regulatory approval for their designs, a lack of state funding and unclear policy. The government is expected to make announcements soon regarding the siting regime and regulatory approvals for SMRs, sources told the Guardian. Tom Greatrex, the chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, said the reactors could “provide flexible, reliable nuclear power to complement other low-carbon sources of generating electricity … [and] a potential export opportunity”. A spokesperson for the UK SMR consortium, which includes Rolls- Royce, said: “One of the compelling elements of our consortium’s power station is that, after the design is fully developed and licensed, no government funding is required to construct or operate it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/aug/01/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-moscow-moving-troops-towards-kherson-zelenskiy-says-uk-property-register-to-crack-down-on-oligarchs","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-01T17:59:14Z","webTitle":"Attack on Mykolaiv hospital described as ‘cynical terrorism’; Moscow bans 39 Britons including Keir Starmer – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/aug/01/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-moscow-moving-troops-towards-kherson-zelenskiy-says-uk-property-register-to-crack-down-on-oligarchs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/aug/01/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-moscow-moving-troops-towards-kherson-zelenskiy-says-uk-property-register-to-crack-down-on-oligarchs","fields":{"headline":"Attack on Mykolaiv hospital described as ‘cynical terrorism’; Moscow bans 39 Britons including Keir Starmer – as it happened","bodyText":"The Sierra Leone-flagged ship Razoni, carrying 26,000 tons of corn, has left the port of Odesa, destined for Lebanon. It is the first such departure since the start of the Russian invasion, according to Ukraine’s infrastructure ministry. “Ukraine together with our partners has taken another step today in preventing world hunger,” Oleksandr Kubrakov, Ukraine’s infrastructure minister, said in a statement on Monday. Kubrakov stressed that Ukraine had done “everything” to restore the ports and said the lifting of the blockade would give Ukraine’s economy $1bn in foreign exchange revenue. Russia agreed to allow grain ships to leave Ukraine and to not attack them, in a deal signed on 22 July in Istanbul. But less than 24 hours later, the veracity of the deal was cast into doubt when Russian forces struck Odesa port. When questioned by Turkey’s defence minister, Russia at first denied it was involved in the attack. But the next day it issued a statement saying it had struck a Ukrainian vessel carrying western weapons that was in the port. Ukraine’s authorities rejected Russia’s explanation. Russia is moving large numbers of troops to Ukraine’s south in preparation for a Ukrainian counteroffensive, according to Ukraine’s deputy head of military intelligence. “They are increasing their troop numbers, preparing for our counteroffensive [in Ukraine’s south] and perhaps preparing to launch an offensive of their own,” Vadym Skibitsky said. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said Russia was relocating some of its troops from their positions in the east to the south in order to push towards Kherson’s regional capital as well as the Zaporizhzhia region. Hundreds of thousands of civilians have been urged to evacuate the frontline eastern Donetsk region, the scene of fierce clashes with the Russian military. More than 50,000 children are still in the region, according to local officials. “They need to be evacuated, you cannot put them in mortal danger in the winter without heating, light, without the ability to keep them warm,” Kyiv’s ministry of reintegration of temporarily occupied territories said in a statement. Russia claims five people were injured after a Ukrainian drone strike on its Black Sea fleet headquarters, prompting officials to cancel festivities planned for Navy Day. “Early this morning, [Ukraine] decided to spoil our Navy Day,” said Mikhail Razvozhayev, the head of the local Russian administration in Sevastopol in Crimea. “An unidentified object flew into the yard of the fleet headquarters. According to preliminary data, it was a drone. Five people were injured.” Russian strikes hit the southern Ukrainian port city of Mykolaiv early on Sunday, wounding three people and damaging homes and schools, according to the city’s mayor, Oleksandr Senkevych. Zelenskiy described the strikes as “probably the most brutal” on the city and region of the entire war. Russian shelling on Mykolaiv reportedly killed one of Ukraine’s wealthiest men, Oleksiy Vadatursky, and his wife, Raisa. Vadatursky headed the grain production and export business Nibulon, which included a fleet of ships for sending grain abroad. A presidential adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, said Vadatursky was specifically targeted and his death was “not an accident, but a well thought out and organised premeditated murder”. The European Union has sent Ukraine €1bn (£837m) in financial aid to support its budget and help it tackle the financial consequences of the Russian invasion, the Ukrainian prime minister said on Monday. Denys Shmyhal wrote on the Telegram messaging app: “The €1bn is a part of a large package of support for Ukraine … totalling €9bn. The funds will help finance priority budgetary needs.” Ukrainian forces have recaptured more than 40 settlements in the key southern region of Kherson, as Kyiv looks to drive back Russian troops in a counteroffensive, the local governor said Monday. Moscow seized almost all the territory of the economically and strategically important region bordering the annexed Crimea peninsula during the first days of its invasion, Reuters reports. But in recent weeks the Ukrainian army, bolstered by deliveries of western-supplied long-range artillery, has sought to stage a counteroffensive in the area. The mayor of Mykolaiv has said an attack on medical facilities in the city today is “nothing more than cynical terrorism by Russian troops”. Oleksandr Syenkevych described the damage on Telegram, informing residents: “This is an ordinary hospital, which every day received residents of the city, including victims of Russian shelling. Therefore, today’s attack on this medical facility is nothing more than cynical terrorism by Russian troops.” Russia has banned 39 senior British politicians, businesspeople and journalists from entering the country, including the Labour party leader, Keir Starmer, the former prime minister David Cameron and the presenter Piers Morgan. The journalists banned include the Guardian’s defence and security editor, Dan Sabbagh, as well as British journalists working for the BBC, the Sunday Times, the Economist, the Daily Telegraph and Sky News. We are closing this liveblog now. Thanks so much for joining us. The daily gas production of Russia’s Gazprom dropped in July to its lowest level since 2008, figures suggest, amid continued fears that Moscow could cause an energy crisis in Europe by shutting off the supply. The state-owned energy firm pumped 774 million cubic metres a day last month – 14% less than in June – according to analysis by Bloomberg of data released on Monday. It found the Russian gas export monopoly’s overall total output for the year was 262.4 billion cubic metres, a 12% fall compared with the same period last year. The slowdown in production follows the deterioration in relations between Russia and the European Union since Vladimir Putin ordered troops to invade Ukraine in late February. The Kremlin-controlled business cut gas supplies to the continent’s main pipeline to Europe – Nord Stream 1 – last week to just 20% of capacity. Gazprom has claimed this is due to maintenance issues with its turbines, but the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said there was “no justifiable technical reason” for the reduction. Read more here: Russia has banned 39 senior British politicians, businesspeople and journalists from entering the country, including the Labour party leader, Keir Starmer, the former prime minister David Cameron and the presenter Piers Morgan. The Russian foreign ministry said in a statement published on its website on Monday: It was decided to include on the Russian ‘stop list’ a number of British politicians, businessmen and journalists who contribute to London’s hostile course aimed at the demonising of our country and contributing to its international isolation. Given London’s destructive drive to spin the sanctions flywheel on far-fetched and absurd pretexts, work on expanding the Russian stop list will continue. The shadow foreign secretary, David Lammy, and the shadow levelling up secretary, Lisa Nandy, are also on the list. The journalists banned include the Guardian’s defence and security editor, Dan Sabbagh, as well as British journalists working for the BBC, the Sunday Times, the Economist, the Daily Telegraph and Sky News. Moscow banned dozens of British journalists, media figures and defence figures from entering the country in June in what the foreign ministry said was a response to western sanctions and the “spreading of false information about Russia”. In total, more than 200 Britons, including most of the country’s leading politicians, are banned from entering the country. Russia has launched an unprecedented crackdown on Russian and foreign independent news outlets since its 24 February invasion of Ukraine, as well as on foreign social media networks. Legislation was introduced soon after the war began to criminalise media outlets that disseminate “false information” about the Russian army. Russia has already barred dozens of US and Canadian officials and journalists from entering. Read more here: Vladimir Putin said on Monday there could be no winners in a nuclear war and no such war should ever be started. The Russian president made the comment in a letter to participants of a conference on the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT), more than five months into his war on Ukraine, Reuters reports. Putin said: We proceed from the fact that there can be no winners in a nuclear war and it should never be unleashed, and we stand for equal and indivisible security for all members of the world community. His words to the NPT forum appeared aimed at striking a reassuring note and portraying Russia as a responsible nuclear power. They contrasted with earlier statements by Putin and other Russian politicians that have been interpreted in the west as implicit nuclear threats. In a speech on 24 February as he launched the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Putin pointedly referred to Russia’s nuclear arsenal and warned outside powers that any attempt to interfere would “lead you to such consequences that you have never encountered in your history”. Days later, he ordered Russia’s nuclear forces to be put on high alert. Earlier on Monday, a Russian foreign ministry source questioned the seriousness of comments by the US president, Joe Biden, calling for talks on a nuclear arms control framework to replace a treaty expiring in 2026. Russian lawmakers on Monday tabled a bill that would ban the adoption of Russian children by citizens of “unfriendly” countries as tensions soar over Moscow’s military intervention in Ukraine. If passed, the bill would expand a 2012 law that prohibited US families from adopting Russian children, AFP reports. At the time the ban provoked an outcry, with Kremlin critics saying it made Russian orphans – many with physical or mental difficulties – the victims of a standoff between Washington and Moscow. The new bill published on the website of parliament’s lower house, the State Duma, proposes extending the ban to citizens of countries “that commit unfriendly actions” against Russia. After the West piled unprecedented sanctions on Moscow following President Vladimir Putin’s decision to send troops to pro-Western Ukraine on February 24, Russia expanded the list of what it calls “unfriendly” countries. They now include the US, Australia, Canada, Britain, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, and all EU member states. The bill has to be approved by both chambers of the Russian parliament and signed into law by Putin. In 2012, Moscow banned the adoption of Russian children by American families to punish Washington over its passing of a law sanctioning Russian officials implicated in the death in jail of lawyer Sergei Magnitsky in 2009. Since the law was introduced, the number of Russian children adopted by foreign families has dropped drastically. State news agency TASS said 240 Russian children were adopted abroad in 2019, compared with 2,604 in 2012. A ship carrying Ukrainian grain has left the port of Odesa for the first time since the start of the Russian invasion under an internationally brokered deal to unblock Ukraine’s agricultural exports and ease a growing global food crisis. The Sierra Leone-flagged ship Razoni, carrying 26,000 tonnes of corn, finally set sail for Lebanon on Monday morning, according to Ukraine’s infrastructure ministry, after weeks of negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, led by Turkey and the United Nations. The Russian blockade of Ukraine’s ports since the start of the war in February has stoked a worldwide grain shortage that has caused the UN to warn of a looming hunger catastrophe. “Ukraine, together with our partners, has taken another step today in preventing world hunger,” said Oleksandr Kubrakov, Ukraine’s infrastructure minister. He said Ukraine had done “everything” to restore the ports and said the lifting of the blockade would give Ukraine’s economy $1bn (£820m) in foreign exchange revenue. The Kremlin said the news of the departure was “very positive”, and Turkey’s defence ministry said more ships would follow. Kubrakov said 16 loaded vessels had been stuck in Ukraine’s ports since the Russian invasion began, and officials planned for the ports to regain full transport capacity in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, fighting continued across Ukraine’s frontlines, according to Ukraine’s general staff, as four additional US-supplied Himars long-range rocket systems as well as a third German Mars II, another long-range rocket system, arrived in Ukraine.

Russia’s foreign ministry said the citizens listed, including journalists, “contribute to the hostile course of London aimed at the demonisation of our country and its international isolation”. The ministry added: The choice in favour of confrontation is the conscious decision of the British political establishment, which bears all responsibility for the consequences. Russia has banned several dozen British citizens – mostly politicians and journalists – from entering Russia since the start of its military campaign in Ukraine. The new additions include several Labour MPs, Scottish politicians and members of the House of Lords. Among the media names is the head of the BBC newsgathering, Jonathan Munro, the TV presenter Piers Morgan, ITV News’ political editor Robert Peston, The Sunday Times’ political editor Caroline Wheeler and the BBC News presenter Huw Edwards. The list also features shadow communities secretary Lisa Nandy, shadow international trade secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds and Conservative former cabinet minister Liam Fox. Reacting to the news on Twitter, Morgan said: It wasn’t on my immediate vacation to-do list. The mayor of Mykolaiv has said an attack on medical facilities in the city today is “nothing more than cynical terrorism by Russian troops”. Oleksandr Syenkevych described the damage on Telegram, informing residents: For some time, our emergency hospital will not be able to accept patients. There it is necessary to dismantle the rubble of the destroyed trauma centre and remove dangerous structures from the surviving part, dismantle the frames of damaged windows and remove all the garbage. Part of the hospital’s main building was also destroyed. There, too, it is necessary to put everything in order. In those departments that survived, we will remove all the debris, block the windows and check the equipment. He added: “This is an ordinary hospital, which every day received residents of the city, including victims of Russian shelling. Therefore, today’s attack on this medical facility is nothing more than cynical terrorism by Russian troops.” Images have emerged of firefighters tackling a blaze at the hospital, and of a crater left by the attack. A crew member onboard the Razoni, which left Odesa this morning, has said the news that the ship would depart was the “best feeling” of the year. Abdullah Jendi, a junior engineer from Syria, had been stuck in Odesa for some time, and said that because of his work at sea he had not seen his family for more than a year. “It was a great feeling,” he said about the news they could leave. “Everyone on the ship was very happy. I can say that it was the best feeling we have had in 2022.” He admitted some concern, however. He told Reuters: “To be honest, I am scared from the fact that there are naval mines. This is the only thing that I fear during this trip. As for the other things, we are used to them as sailors.” Jendi said alarms would go off in Odesa every day and the crew had feared they would never get to go home. “We did not know when we would be released, so we lived every day on the hope of being released,” he said. “In the beginning there was a lack of food and water supplies reaching the ship, as there was a lockdown when the war started. When the restrictions were eased, we were able to go to the city and buy what we needed and clear our minds from the stress.” The journey to Lebanon will take about a week. “The feeling is indescribable. It is so important to live in security, because I spent a while experiencing the feeling of danger, the great fear knowing that at any moment something could happen to us because of the air strikes,” Jendi said. “We couldn’t even turn on the lights at night. We couldn’t be outside at night for our safety. The port would be completely dark for security reasons.” Ukrainian forces have recaptured more than 40 settlements in the key southern region of Kherson, as Kyiv looks to drive back Russian troops in a counteroffensive, the local governor said Monday. Moscow seized almost all the territory of the economically and strategically important region bordering the annexed Crimea peninsula during the first days of its invasion, Reuters reports. But in recent weeks the Ukrainian army, bolstered by deliveries of western-supplied long-range artillery, has sought to stage a counteroffensive in the area. Kyiv’s forces have been carrying out strikes on Russian military warehouses and positions behind the frontline and hit bridges acting as crucial supply routes for Moscow’s troops in the city of Kherson. “Today, 46 settlements have already been de-occupied in the Kherson region,” Dmytro Butriy, the head of the Ukrainian regional administration, told national TV. Butriy added that the majority of the regained villages lie in the northern part of the region, while some others are located in its southern part, close to the Black Sea and the heavily bombarded Mykolaiv region. The governor said some of the recaptured villages “have been 90% destroyed and today are still under constant fire”. Butriy said the humanitarian situation in the region was “critical” and he reiterated authorities’ call to those who remain in the area “to evacuate to safer regions”. Ukraine has received a batch of four more US-made high mobility artillery rocket systems (Himars), Ukraine’s defence minister said on Monday. Oleksii Reznikov wrote on Twitter that he was grateful for the help strengthening the Ukraine army. Himars have a longer range and are more precise than Ukraine’s Soviet-era artillery, allowing Ukrainian forces to hit Russian targets that were previously unreachable, Reuters reports. My colleague Shaun Walker has looked into Dmitry Medvedev’s journey from liberal to anti-western hawk. Critics say the former Russian leader’s furious tirades are a desperate attempt to retain political relevance. Joe Biden is a “strange grandfather with dementia”. The EU leadership are “lunatics”. Russia will ensure that Ukraine “disappears from the map” in the near future. Welcome to another week as seen through the eyes of Dmitry Medvedev, Russia’s former president and prime minister, and the deputy head of the country’s security council. Medvedev has been on quite a political journey in recent years. Back in 2008, when he became Russia’s president, he promised modernisation and liberalisation, and frequently spoke of his love for blogging and gadgets. He even visited Silicon Valley and received a new iPhone 4 from Steve Jobs. Now, he is an enthusiastic participant in the macho posturing and genocidal rhetoric that have become the main currency of political discourse in wartime Moscow. “I’m often asked why my Telegram posts are so harsh,” wrote Medvedev recently. “Well, I’ll answer: I hate them. They are bastards and degenerates. They want us, Russia, to die. And while I’m still alive, I will do everything to make them disappear.” He did not specify whether the “they” in question referred to Ukrainians, western politicians, or both. Medvedev’s physical transformation is as extraordinary as his ideological shift: a decade ago he was boyish, nerdy and seemed almost charmingly awkward wearing a suit and conducting the business of state. Now he looks jaded and puffy-faced, his eyes glazed over as he launches tirades against the west. Medvedev’s rebooted persona is an apparent attempt to retain political relevance in a climate that has darkened significantly in the decade since he left the presidency. “He’s trying to save himself from political oblivion by out-Heroding Herod, and consequently posturing as a candidate in a Kremlin Apprentice show,” said Ekaterina Schulmann, a Russian political scientist at the Robert Bosch Academy in Berlin. Maria Pevchikh, an associate of the imprisoned Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny, interpreted Medvedev’s shift in more personal terms: “When you feel you are a pointless and pathetic person, like Dmitry Medvedev, you try to reinvent yourself from time to time. He could have shaved his head, or gone to the gym … but instead he decided to reinvent himself as a hawk,” she said, in a video discussion devoted to Medvedev’s strange behaviour in May. Read more here: The EU and Nato on Monday welcomed the departure of the grain shipment from Ukraine as a “first step” towards easing the food crisis caused by the Russian invasion. But an EU spokesperson, Peter Stano, said Brussels still expected the “implementation of the whole deal and resumption of Ukrainian exports to the customers around the world”, Agence France-Press reports. Separately, the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said western allies “strongly support the full implementation of the deal to ease the global food crisis caused by Russia’s war in Ukraine”. Earlier the Razoni, a Sierra Leone-registered cargo ship, had left the Ukrainian port of Odesa bound for Lebanon with a vital shipment of 26,000 tonnes of grain. It was the first vessel to leave a Ukrainian port since Moscow and Kyiv signed an agreement brokered by Turkey and the UN to permit food shipments despite the conflict. Speaking to the EU foreign service, Stano accused the Kremlin of blocking the shipments for months and noted that Russia had fired missiles at the port of Odesa a day after the deal was signed. He blamed the food shortages affecting parts of the Middle East and Africa on “the unprovoked Russian aggression on February 24 and the blocking of Ukrainian ports and grain exports”. Russian forces invaded Ukraine in February and have seized or bombarded several ports, some of which Ukrainian defenders have since mined to protect them. Under the deal signed in Istanbul on 22 July, Ukraine is to remove the mines and Russia to lift its blockade, but shipments have been slow to restart and fighting on land continues. In addition, according to Stano, Russia is “destroying the fields in Ukraine, destroying the silos in Ukraine, burning the grain or looting and trying to sell it on behalf of Russia”. The European Union has sent Ukraine €1bn (£837m) in financial aid to support its budget and help it tackle the financial consequences of the Russian invasion, the Ukrainian prime minister said on Monday. Denys Shmyhal wrote on the Telegram messaging app: The €1bn is a part of a large package of support for Ukraine … totalling €9bn. The funds will help finance priority budgetary needs. He said the first tranche, amounting to €500m, was already in the account of the Ukrainian central bank, while the remainder is expected to be there on 2 August. Twitter accounts that have promoted QAnon and anti-vaccine conspiracy theories are switching focus and increasingly spreading disinformation about the global food crisis caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, according to a new study. The research by the Network Contagion Research Institute (NCRI) found that conspiracy theorist social media accounts have started pushing the idea that western countries are responsible for the interruption of wheat, barley and maize exports from Ukraine. The Russian government has made the same claims in recent weeks, blaming western sanctions for a slowdown in grain exports. Russia has blocked Ukraine’s shipping ports, which has prevented the export of tens of millions of tonnes of grain. The UN has suggested 49 million people could be pushed into famine or famine-like conditions because of Russia’s actions. The NCRI, which tracks misinformation and manipulation on social media, found that conspiracy communities and influencers linked to QAnon, the extremist conspiracy movement whose followers believe Donald Trump is waging war against the “deep state”, are shifting from conspiracy theories around Covid-19 to food crisis disinformation. According to NCRI, the accounts frequently link rising food insecurity to a “cabal of shadowy, and often Jewish elites, for bringing about the ‘New World Order’”, rather than to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In one example GhostEzra, an antisemitic QAnon social media influencer who has declared Covid “fake”, wrote on Telegram: “Never believe for one moment there’s a shortage of anything. Food. Water. Oil. They create and manufacture these shortages. These aren’t naturally occurring whatsoever.” The “they”, the NCRI said, referred to Jewish people. “There is a significant overlap between QAnon and other anti-vax and online conspiracy communities,” said Alex Goldenberg, the lead intelligence analyst at the NCRI and a research fellow at the Rutgers Miller Center for Community Protection and Resilience. “Some of the more colourful food-mandate conspiracies intermingle with anti-vaccine conspiracy theories.” Read more here: The Sierra Leone-flagged ship Razoni, carrying 26,000 tons of corn, has left the port of Odesa, destined for Lebanon. It is the first such departure since the start of the Russian invasion, according to Ukraine’s infrastructure ministry. “Ukraine together with our partners has taken another step today in preventing world hunger,” Oleksandr Kubrakov, Ukraine’s infrastructure minister, said in a statement on Monday. Kubrakov stressed that Ukraine had done “everything” to restore the ports and said the lifting of the blockade would give Ukraine’s economy $1bn in foreign exchange revenue. Russia agreed to allow grain ships to leave Ukraine and to not attack them, in a deal signed on 22 July in Istanbul. But less than 24 hours later, the veracity of the deal was cast into doubt when Russian forces struck Odesa port. When questioned by Turkey’s defence minister, Russia at first denied it was involved in the attack. But the next day it issued a statement saying it had struck a Ukrainian vessel carrying western weapons that was in the port. Ukraine’s authorities rejected Russia’s explanation. Russia is moving large numbers of troops to Ukraine’s south in preparation for a Ukrainian counteroffensive, according to Ukraine’s deputy head of military intelligence. “They are increasing their troop numbers, preparing for our counteroffensive [in Ukraine’s south] and perhaps preparing to launch an offensive of their own,” Vadym Skibitsky said. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said Russia was relocating some of its troops from their positions in the east to the south in order to push towards Kherson’s regional capital as well as the Zaporizhzhia region. Hundreds of thousands of civilians have been urged to evacuate the frontline eastern Donetsk region, the scene of fierce clashes with the Russian military. More than 50,000 children are still in the region, according to local officials. “They need to be evacuated, you cannot put them in mortal danger in the winter without heating, light, without the ability to keep them warm,” Kyiv’s ministry of reintegration of temporarily occupied territories said in a statement. Russia claims five people were injured after a Ukrainian drone strike on its Black Sea fleet headquarters, prompting officials to cancel festivities planned for Navy Day. “Early this morning, [Ukraine] decided to spoil our Navy Day,” said Mikhail Razvozhayev, the head of the local Russian administration in Sevastopol in Crimea. “An unidentified object flew into the yard of the fleet headquarters. According to preliminary data, it was a drone. Five people were injured.” Russian strikes hit the southern Ukrainian port city of Mykolaiv early on Sunday, wounding three people and damaging homes and schools, according to the city’s mayor, Oleksandr Senkevych. Zelenskiy described the strikes as “probably the most brutal” on the city and region of the entire war. Russian shelling on Mykolaiv reportedly killed one of Ukraine’s wealthiest men, Oleksiy Vadatursky, and his wife, Raisa. Vadatursky headed the grain production and export business Nibulon, which included a fleet of ships for sending grain abroad. A presidential adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, said Vadatursky was specifically targeted and his death was “not an accident, but a well thought out and organised premeditated murder”. That is it from me, Martin Belam for now. I will be back later on. Nicola Slawson will be with you for the next few hours. Here is a video clip issued by the Ukrainian ministry of infrastructure of the departure of the Razoni from Odesa. Reuters reports that the Kremlin has said in a short statement that the news of the first ship carrying grain to leave Ukraine’s port of Odesa under a deal brokered by Turkey is “very positive”. Russia’s ministry of defence has issued its daily operational bulletin, in which it has claimed to have killed at least a further 250 Ukrainian service personnel, and injured at least the same amount. The report, however, covers several days, listing attacks that the ministry said took place on 28 July and 29 July. The report lists a large amount of military equipment that Russia says it has destroyed. It also claims 13 Ukrainian drones have been shot down. None of the claims have been independently verified. This is a short video clip posted to social media that appears to show the Razoni on her way out of Odesa. Here are some of the latest images that we have been sent over the news wires from Ukraine. The self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) has issued its daily operational briefing. It claims that one person was killed and nine civilians were injured in shelling by Ukrainian forces on eight of the settlements it claims to control. It says 19 houses and two civil infrastructure facilities were damaged. The DPR says: “At present, the DPR and Luhansk People’s Republic troops, with fire support from the Russian Federation armed forces, have liberated 263 settlements.” The claims have not been independently verified. Russia, Syria and North Korea are the only UN member states to recognise the DPR and the similarly self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic as legitimate authorities. Here is a reminder of the mechanics of the grain export deal. There are some images emerging of the Razoni in Odesa as it becomes the first ship to depart under the new grain export arrangement. The ship is bound for Lebanon, and carrying 26,000 tonnes of corn. Isobel Koshiw reports for us from Kyiv: The Sierra Leone-flagged ship Razoni, carrying 26,000 tons of corn, has left the port of Odesa, destined for Lebanon. It is the first departure since the start of the Russian invasion, according to Ukraine’s infrastructure ministry. “Ukraine together with our partners has taken another step today in preventing world hunger,” Oleksandr Kubrakov, Ukraine’s infrastructure minister, said in a statement on Monday. Kubrakov stressed that Ukraine had done “everything” to restore the ports and said the lifting of the blockade would give Ukraine’s economy $1bn in foreign exchange revenue. Ukraine’s infrastructure minister said 16 loaded vessels had been stuck in Ukraine’s ports since the Russian invasion began, and officials planned for the ports to regain full transport capacity in the coming weeks. But the world is watching to see if Russia sticks to its side if the bargain, after an attack on Odesa port a week ago. Russia agreed to allow grain ships to leave Ukraine and to not attack them, in a deal signed on 22 July in Istanbul. But less than 24 hours later, the veracity of the deal was cast into doubt when Russian forces struck Odesa port. When questioned by Turkey’s defence minister, Russia at first denied it was involved in the attack. But the next day it issued a statement saying it had struck a Ukrainian vessel carrying western weapons that was in the port. Ukraine’s authorities rejected Russia’s explanation. Read more of Isobel Koshiw’s report from Kyiv: Grain ship leaves Ukraine port for first time since Russia blockade Reuters is carrying a little more detail on the first ship expected to depart the port of Odesa under the Turkey-brokered grain export deal – although there has been some conflicting information about destinations and timings. The Turkish ministry of defence is quoted as saying the Sierra Leone-flagged ship Razoni will set off from Odesa port for Lebanon with its cargo of corn. The ministry went on to say: “Deployment of other ships are planned within the scope of the determined corridor and method.” Ukrainian officials have said there are 17 ships docked in Ukraine’s Black Sea ports with almost 600,000 tonnes of cargo. Of them, 16 hold Ukrainian grain with a total volume of about 580,000 tonnes. Oleh Synyehubov, the governor of Kharkiv, has posted to Telegram to say that two men were injured by shelling at 7am today in the Saltivka region of Kharkiv. One of the men, aged 72, subsequently died in hospital. The claim has not been independently verified. This is Martin Belam in London taking over the live blog from my colleague Samantha Lock. About 300 people are still considered missing as a result of hostilities in the Kyiv region, according to the region’s police chief. Andrii Nebytov also said some Ukrainian citizens are currently being held in Belaru and another 216 bodies have not yet been identified in a Telegram post this morning. About 300 people are now considered missing during the hostilities in the Kyiv region. The 216 bodies found have not yet been identified. An appropriate DNA selection procedure was carried out. I hope that thanks to cooperation with relatives, we will be able to identify these persons. It is not only that some citizens are now in captivity. While documenting war crimes in the Kyiv region, we found out that many people are currently being held on the territory of Belarus. According to the testimony of eyewitnesses, these persons were abducted by the occupiers from Gostomel, Buchi and Irpen.” Volodymyr Zelenskiy has urged civilians to evacuate the frontline Donetsk region, the scene of fierce clashes with the Russian military, as Kyiv called on the Red Cross and UN to gain access to its soldiers being held by Moscow’s forces. Ukraine’s president warned in his daily address that hundreds of thousands of people, including tens of thousands of children, were still in the region’s battleground areas, with the Donetsk governor saying six civilians were killed and 15 wounded on Friday. He asked those who knew people still in the Donbas region – especially those with children – to speak to them about leaving. “Many people refuse to leave .. but it really needs to be done … The sooner it is done, the more people leave Donetsk region now, the fewer people the Russian army will have time to kill,” he said. “Leave, we will help,” Zelenskiy said. “At this stage of the war, terror is the main weapon of Russia.” A mandatory evacuation notice posted on Saturday evening said the coming winter made it a matter of urgency, particularly for the more than 50,000 children still in the region. “They need to be evacuated, you cannot put them in mortal danger in the winter without heating, light, without the ability to keep them warm,” Kyiv’s Ministry of Reintegration of Temporarily Occupied Territories said in a statement. Russia is likely re-allocating a significant number of its forces from the northern Donbas sector to southern Ukraine, the UK Ministry of Defence has said. The latest intelligence report reads: Over the last four days, Russia has continued to attempt tactical assaults on the Bakhmut axis, northeast of Donetsk, only managing to make slow progress. Russia is probably adjusting the operational design of its Donbas offensive after failing to make a decisive operational breakthrough under the plan it had been following since April. It has likely identified its Zaporizhzhia front as a vulnerable area in need of reinforcement.” Russia appears to be stepping up its offensive on regions in Ukraine’s south. The mayor of the southern city of Mykolaiv said two people were killed and three wounded after rockets pounded two residential districts on Sunday night. Oleksandr Senkevych said the strikes were “probably the most powerful of the entire time [of the war]”. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, also addressed the attack in his latest national address: Today, one of the most brutal shellings of Mykolaiv and the region over the entire period of the full-scale war took place. Dozens of missiles and rockets... The occupiers hit residential buildings, schools, other social infrastructure, and industrial facilities.” The Russian attack also reportedly took the lives of Oleksiy Vadaturskyi, 74, and his wife Raisa, the founder of one of the largest Ukrainian agricultural companies ‘Nibulon’. An adviser to the Ukrainian president has said he believes the leading Ukrainian agricultural magnate Oleksiy Vadatursky was deliberately killed when a missile struck their home in the southern city. Mykhailo Podolyak said a missile hit the businessman’s bedroom, which he said “leaves no doubt” it was a targeted attack. The first ship to export Ukrainian grain will depart from Ukrainian ports at 8.30am today, according to the Turkey’s Ministry of Defence. The ministry issued an announcement at 7.30am local time, saying: “The first ship from Ukrainian ports will depart today at 8:30.” The first ships will arrive in Istanbul port on Wednesday 3 August en route to Africa, according to CNN. Two people have reportedly been injured as a result of shelling this morning in Ukraine’s second-largest city of Kharkiv. The head of the regional state administration, Oleg Synegubov, said Russia attacked the Saltiv district of the northeastern city and urged residents to stay in shelters in a Telegram post just before 8.30am on Monday. Citing information from the regional centre for emergency medical assistance, he said two people were injured as a result of the shelling. Britain will now require foreign companies holding UK property to identify their true owners in an official register as part of a crackdown on Russian oligarchs and corrupt elites laundering illicit wealth. The register of overseas entities, which becomes active from today, is part of a wider economic crime law enacted this year in an effort to stop the flow of illicit Russian cash into London following Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. It will seek to ensure criminals cannot hide behind secretive chains of shell companies, and support government efforts to root out Russian oligarchs using property in Britain to hide dirty money, the business ministry said in a statement. Junior business minister Martin Callanan said: To ensure we are free of corrupt elites with suspicious wealth, we need to know who owns what. We are lifting the curtain and cracking down on those criminals attempting to hide their illicitly obtained wealth.” Foreign entities that already own land in the UK that is within the scope of the register will have six months to comply by identifying their beneficial owner to Companies House. The register will apply to property bought since January 1999 in England and Wales, and since December 2014 in Scotland. Those not complying with the new rules could face sanctions including fines of up to £2,500 ($3,043) per day or five years in prison. The register has been described as a significant provision of the economic crime law, with a Transparency International official in March calling the step a “seismic change” that will force foreign property ownership into the open. The law was brought in in March as the government faced calls to do more to make it harder for those close to Russian President Vladimir Putin to launder dirty money through property in London, long dubbed by some as “Londongrad”. Russia is moving large numbers of troops to Ukraine’s south for battles against the country’s forces through the newly occupied territories and Crimea, according to Ukraine’s deputy head of military intelligence. If Russia won, it would try to capture more territory, said Vadym Skibitsky. “They are increasing their troop numbers, preparing for our counteroffensive [in Ukraine’s south] and perhaps preparing to launch an offensive of their own. The south is key for them, above all because of Crimea,” he said. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy corroborated these reports in his latest national address, saying Russia was relocating troops from the east to the south of Ukraine in order to push towards Kherson’s regional capital as well as the Zaporizhzhia region. “Now the Russian army is trying to strengthen its positions in the occupied areas of the south of our country, increasing activity in the relevant areas,” he said, adding that “strategically, Russia has no chance of winning this war”. Russian troop movements come in response to Ukraine’s declared counteroffensive to liberate the southern occupied regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. Ukrainian forces have retaken dozens of villages and towns along the border, according to the region’s military governor, Dmytro Butrii, and are pushing towards Kherson’s regional capital. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I will be bringing you all the latest developments for the next short while. According to multiple Ukrainian officials, Russia is moving large numbers of troops to Ukraine’s south where battles are expected to intensify. From today, Britain will now require foreign companies holding UK property to identify their true owners as part of a crackdown on Russian oligarchs and corrupt elites laundering illicit wealth. It is 8am in Ukraine. Here is everything you might have missed: Russia is moving large numbers of troops to Ukraine’s south in preparation for a Ukrainian counteroffensive, according to Ukraine’s deputy head of military intelligence. “They are increasing their troop numbers, preparing for our counteroffensive [in Ukraine’s south] and perhaps preparing to launch an offensive of their own,” Vadym Skibitsky said. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said Russia was relocating some of its troops from their positions in the east to the south in order to push towards Kherson’s regional capital as well as the Zaporizhzhia region. Hundreds of thousands of civilians have been urged to evacuate the frontline eastern Donetsk region, the scene of fierce clashes with the Russian military. More than 50,000 children are still in the region, according to local officials. “They need to be evacuated, you cannot put them in mortal danger in the winter without heating, light, without the ability to keep them warm,” Kyiv’s ministry of reintegration of temporarily occupied territories said in a statement. Russia claims five people were injured after a Ukrainian drone strike on its Black Sea fleet headquarters, prompting officials to cancel festivities planned for Navy Day. “Early this morning, [Ukraine] decided to spoil our Navy Day,” said Mikhail Razvozhayev, the head of the local Russian administration in Sevastopol in Crimea. “An unidentified object flew into the yard of the fleet headquarters. According to preliminary data, it was a drone. Five people were injured.” Russian strikes hit the southern Ukrainian port city of Mykolaiv early on Sunday, wounding three people and damaging homes and schools, according to the city’s mayor, Oleksandr Senkevych. Zelenskiy described the strikes as “probably the most brutal” on the city and region of the entire war. Russian shelling on Mykolaiv reportedly killed one of Ukraine’s wealthiest men, Oleksiy Vadatursky, and his wife, Raisa. Vadatursky headed the grain production and export business Nibulon, which included a fleet of ships for sending grain abroad. A presidential adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, said Vadatursky was specifically targeted and his death was “not an accident, but a well-thought-out and organised premeditated murder”. The International Committee of the Red Cross has not yet received permission to visit the building in Olenivka where at least 50 prisoners Ukrainian prisoners of war were killed, it said on Sunday. Russia said it had invited experts from the UN and Red Cross to examine the deaths “in the interests of conducting an objective investigation”. Zelenskiy denounced the attack as a war crime. Two-hundred Russian marines from the 810th naval infantry brigade refused to return to fight in the southern regions of Ukraine, according to Ukraine’s defence ministry intelligence directorate. Ukraine’s harvest this year could be half its usual amount because of the Russian invasion, Zelenskiy claimed. “Ukrainian harvest this year is under the threat to be twice less,” the Ukrainian president said in comments likely to intensify fears of global hunger. The first grain-exporting ship could leave Ukraine’s ports on Monday, a spokesperson for the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, said.

The cavernous 100,000 sq metre Docklands site is being converted in a high-speed operation involving military planners and personnel, and its capacity will rise quickly from the initial 500 beds, defence sources said on Tuesday. It is intended to deal with the expected surge in coronavirus patients with severe breathing difficulties for whom beds are unlikely be available in London’s overflowing intensive care units. “We will next week open a new hospital, a temporary hospital, the NHS Nightingale hospital, at the ExCel centre in London,” Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said at a news conference on Tuesday. “The NHS Nightingale hospital will comprise two wards each of 2,000 people. With the help of the military and with NHS clinicians, we will make sure that we have the capacity that we need.” Defence sources added that “more than one” emergency hospital would be built around the UK, although London is first because the rate of coronavirus infections is considered to be running 1.5 to 2.5 weeks ahead. “We will service and support the whole of the United Kingdom,” a source added. The NEC in Birmingham has said it “stands ready” and is “well-equipped” should the centre be considered as a suitable location for a temporary hospital. In a statement, a spokeswoman said: “We are and have been in constant communication with the local NHS trust, police and fire service, and the services are fully aware of the capabilities of the venue. We will do our utmost to support the effort in combating the virus.” The Guardian revealed on Monday that the Excel centre would ultimately have capacity for about 4,000 beds, many of whose occupants will be anaesthetised, intubated and kept alive on a ventilator because their lungs have failed. “They are there to deliver the gap, or part of the gap that has emerged between peacetime NHS capability and the stress that we’ve got on our system,” one insider said. There are about 700 military personnel deployed in the UK to tackle the coronavirus crisis, including military planners around the country to help local emergency forums prepare for the anticipated surge in cases. A further 2,000 of the 20,000 troops available in the UK have been placed at 24 hours’ notice to help with any urgent requests from civilian authorities, and a further 1,500 are on 48-hour standby. There are at least 50 soldiers who started helping to deliver badly needed face masks, gloves and other personal protective equipment for the NHS from Monday, a figure expected to rise to 460 when deliveries get to full capacity. But Ministry of Defence insiders said there was no expectation that the military would be needed on the streets to help maintain public order, arguing it was not even “the fourth, fifth, sixth or seventh” priority. Police forces are confident they can enforce the lockdown ordered by Boris Johnson on Monday night, and the only circumstances where soldiers might be used is to guard strategic sites, such as nuclear power stations, to allow constables to be redeployed elsewhere. The main focuses for military aid in the UK are expected to be in the medical and planning areas. Military medics who are not working in the NHS already will be expected to provide help and support to the health service, although they will have to be retrained to some extent to help treat patients suffering from coronavirus."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2020/may/21/new-nuclear-technologies-to-be-examined-in-planning-australias-energy-mix","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2020-05-20T17:30:33Z","webTitle":"New nuclear technologies to be examined in planning Australia's energy mix","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/21/new-nuclear-technologies-to-be-examined-in-planning-australias-energy-mix","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2020/may/21/new-nuclear-technologies-to-be-examined-in-planning-australias-energy-mix","fields":{"headline":"New nuclear technologies to be examined in planning Australia's energy mix","bodyText":"The Morrison government has flagged examining “emerging nuclear technologies” as part of Australia’s energy mix in the future in a new discussion paper kicking off the process of developing its much-vaunted technology investment roadmap. Facing sustained pressure to adopt a 2050 target of net zero emissions, pressure it is continuing to resist, the government plans instead to develop the roadmap as the cornerstone of the Coalition’s mid-century emissions reduction strategy. The new framework will identify the government’s investment priorities in emissions-reducing technologies for 2022, 2030 and 2050, although the paper makes clear the government will only countenance “incentivising voluntary emissions reductions on a broad scale” – not schemes that penalise polluters. The discussion paper to be released on Thursday floats a range of potential technologies for future deployment, including small modular nuclear reactors. It says emerging nuclear technologies “have potential but require R&amp;D and identified deployment pathways”. While clearly flagging that prospect, the paper also notes that engineering, cost and environmental challenges, “alongside social acceptability of nuclear power in Australia, will be key determinants of any future deployment”. As well as championing the prospects for hydrogen, the paper also flags the importance of negative emission technologies, including carbon capture and storage, as well as soil carbon and tree planting. This week the government has signalled its intention to use the existing $2.5bn emissions reduction fund to support CCS projects – a move championed by Australia’s oil and gas industries. The new paper says the geo-sequestration of carbon dioxide “represents a significant opportunity for abatement in export gas” – nominating the Gorgon project as a case in point. Growth in emissions in Australia is largely driven by fugitive emissions from the booming LNG export sector. The paper is also upbeat about the long-term prospects for gas, both in exports and domestic use, even though gas, unlike renewables, drives growth in emissions. It references a statement from the International Energy Agency that switching from coal to gas can provide “quick wins” for global emissions reductions and has the potential to reduce electricity-sector emissions by 10%. LNG exports are characterised in the paper as “an important low emissions export opportunity” and “domestically gas will play an important role in balancing renewable energy, ramping up and down to match supply and demand”. The paper does acknowledge that solar and wind – renewable technologies – are now “projected to be cheaper than new thermal generation over all time horizons to 2050”. But it adds a caveat, contending that “the cost of firming is still a major issue, and will require much more work”. “For instance, renewables are not yet broadly deployed as a power generation source for large, always-on industrial loads that demand stable power supply”. The paper says storage, which could be a large-scale battery, a dam or “a coal stockpile” or a “gas pipeline” will be critical to maintaining affordability and reliability in any electricity grid. The paper also points to a “forthcoming” national electric vehicle strategy, which it says will support “consumer choice as new technologies come to market”. While previous government modelling has assumed electric vehicles will make up between 25% and 50% of new car sales by 2030, the paper contends that “pre-2030 abatement potential is limited by the [slow] turnover of Australia’s light vehicle fleet” and the readiness of technology to support emissions reduction in the heavy vehicle fleet. The paper identifies short-, medium- and long-term objectives. In the short term, the paper says the government will support investment in the new generation, storage and transmission needed to “balance” record investments in renewables. The medium-term objective is “building storage and transmission infrastructure and the electrification of industry while scaling our domestic hydrogen industry”, and the long-term goal is building “new export-facing industries in the global low emissions economy including those leveraging hydrogen and carbon capture and storage”. The paper notes that private capital will drive the transformation but it advocates for governments to play a “supporting” role. It says governments can take on greater risk than private investors, “and can place direct value on these benefits, including for disadvantaged Australians and those in regional areas”. “Government support for innovation in the energy sector means the public can benefit from this innovation sooner, through reduced energy costs, a more secure and reliable energy system, faster emissions reduction or new sources of jobs and growth”. In a statement, the energy minister, Angus Taylor, said the roadmap was about more than reducing emissions. “This is about developing technologies that will support jobs growth,” he said. “This is about backing new industries that will help our regional communities and local economies to prosper. The alternative is to sign up to long term targets without a clear plan. This approach will penalise energy-intensive industries and reduce economic activity”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2019/aug/01/what-should-we-do-with-radioactive-nuclear-waste","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2019-08-01T06:00:47Z","webTitle":"What should we do with radioactive nuclear waste?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/01/what-should-we-do-with-radioactive-nuclear-waste","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2019/aug/01/what-should-we-do-with-radioactive-nuclear-waste","fields":{"headline":"What should we do with radioactive nuclear waste?","bodyText":"There’s a small red hammer and sickle flag of the old Soviet Union on my dresser at home. I found it years ago on the floor of a primary school in Pripyat, the town built for workers at the doomed Chernobyl nuclear plant in what is now Ukraine. Perhaps it had been waved by a child at a state occasion, or had been left behind in the rush to evacuate Pripyat after the world’s worst nuclear disaster in April 1986. Less than two miles away, the stricken, crumbling Reactor 4 was one of the most dangerous places on Earth. Everything for miles around, from the mushrooms in the woods to the trucks left in the parking lots to the toys in the nursery and the hospital beds, was radioactive to some degree. Even though a dosimeter showed that after being washed down, the little flag was barely more radioactive than normal background levels found in nature, it should have been packaged up and landfilled as low-level nuclear waste. By contrast, Chernobyl’s Reactor 4 site will remain dangerous for tens of thousands of years. In July 2019, 33 years after the explosion, 200 metric tonnes of uranium, plutonium, liquid fuel and irradiated dust was finally encased below an enormous €1.5bn (£1.35bn) steel and concrete structure taller than the Statue of Liberty. The new sarcophagus will last about 100 years – after which it will deteriorate and future generations will have to decide how to dismantle and store it permanently. Skip forward to Cameron, Texas, on 16 January 2019. This was a nerve-racking day for Liz Muller, cofounder of California startup technology company Deep Isolation and her father, Richard Muller, professor emeritus of physics at the University of California, Berkeley, and now chief technology officer at Deep Isolation. The father-daughter team had invited 40 nuclear scientists, US Department of Energy officials, oil and gas professionals, and environmentalists to witness the first attempt to test whether the latest oil-fracking technology could be used to permanently dispose of the most dangerous nuclear waste. At 11.30am, the crew of oil workers used a wire cable to lower an 80cm-long, 20cm-wide, 64kg canister — filled with steel rather than radioactive waste — down a previously drilled borehole. Then, using a tool called a “tractor” invented by the industry to reach horizontally into mile-deep oil reservoirs, they pushed it 120 metres farther away from the borehole through the rock. Five hours later, the crew used the tractor to relocate and collect the canister, attach it to the cable and pull it back to the surface – to the cheers of the workers. Until then, few people in the nuclear industry had believed this could be done. By avoiding the need to excavate large, expensive tunnels to store waste below ground, the Deep Isolation team believes it has found a solution to one of the world’s most intractable environmental problems – how to permanently dispose of and potentially retrieve the hundreds of thousands of tonnes of nuclear waste currently being stored at nuclear power plants and research and military stations around the world. “We showed it could be done,” Elizabeth Muller says. “Horizontal, directional drilling has come a long way recently. This is now an off-the-shelf technology. Using larger canisters, we think about 300 boreholes with tunnels up to two miles long would be able to take much of the US’s high-level nuclear waste. We think we can reduce by two-thirds the cost of permanent storage.” “We are using a technique that’s been made cheap over the last 20 years,” says Richard Muller, who has worked in the shale gas industry. “We realised we could put together the oil and nuclear technologies. One offered the solution to the other. These capsules can be lowered deep down, far deeper than anyone has proposed, and stored underneath a billion tonnes of rock so none of the radiation gets out.” Great stockpiles The dilemma of how to manage nuclear waste – radioactive materials routinely produced in large quantities at every stage of nuclear power production, from uranium mining and enrichment to reactor operation and the reprocessing of spent fuel – has taxed the industry, academics and governments for decades. Along with accidents, it has been a major reason for continuing public opposition to the industry’s further expansion despite substantial interest in nuclear’s status as a low-carbon power source that can help mitigate climate change. In 80-odd years of nuclear power, in which more than 450 commercial reactors, many experimental stations and tens of thousands of nuclear warheads have been built, great stockpiles of different levels of waste have accumulated. Depending on how countries classify waste, only about 0.2–3% by volume is high-level waste, according to the World Nuclear Association (WNA), a London-based industry group that promotes nuclear power. Mostly derived from civil reactor fuel, this is some of the most dangerous material known on Earth, remaining radioactive for tens of thousands of years. It requires cooling and shielding indefinitely and contains 95% of the radioactivity related to nuclear power generation. A further 7% or so by volume, known as intermediate waste, is made up of things such as reactor components and graphite from reactor cores. This is also highly dangerous, but it can be stored in special canisters because it does not generate much heat. The rest is made up of vast quantities of what is called low-level and very low-level waste. This comprises scrap metal, paper, plastics, building materials and everything else radioactive involved in the operation and dismantling of nuclear facilities. The consensus is that about 22,000 cubic metres of solid high-level waste has accumulated in temporary storage but not been disposed of (moved to permanent storage) in 14 western countries, along with unknown amounts in China, Russia and at military stations. A further 460,000 cubic metres of intermediate waste is being stored, and about 3.5m cubic metres of low-level waste. About 34,000 cubic metres of new high-level and intermediate waste is generated each year by operating civil reactors, says the WNA. The US, with 59 nuclear power plants comprising 97 working civil reactors, each generating at least several tonnes of high-level waste per year, has about 90,000 tonnes of high-level waste awaiting permanent disposal, according to the US Government Accountability Office. Although it is impossible to come up with a global total because of differences in how quantities are measured and reported, and with some inventories kept secret, other countries harbour significant amounts of waste as well. Many ideas In the early days of nuclear power, waste of any sort was barely considered. British, American and Russian authorities, among others, dumped nuclear waste – including more than 150,000 tonnes of low-level waste – at sea or in rivers. Since then, billions have been spent trying to identify how best to reduce the amount produced and then store it for what may be eternity. Many ideas have been investigated, but most have been rejected as impractical, too expensive or ecologically unacceptable. They include: shooting it into space; isolating it in synthetic rock; burying it in ice sheets; dumping it on the world’s most isolated islands; and dropping it to the bottom of the world’s deepest oceanic trenches. Vertical boreholes up to 5,000 metres deep have also been proposed, and this option is said by some scientists to be promising. But there have been doubts, because it is likely to be nearly impossible to retrieve waste from vertical boreholes. Two scientific developments excite nuclear scientists. One is to build a new generation of advanced fast neutron reactors, which would use the high-level waste as fuel. This slowly emerging “Generation IV” nuclear power programme is billed by the industry as safer and more efficient. But even though such reactors can reduce the degree of hazard the waste poses, they do not solve the issue entirely. “These new reactors will still need a waste repository, likely as large as a repository for the waste produced by the current crop of conventional reactors,” says Allison MacFarlane, director of the Institute for International Science and Technical Policy at the George Washington University and chair of the US nuclear regulatory commission in 2012–14. The other technology that could reduce waste, known as transmutation, aims to reduce radiotoxicity by using lasers to change the composition of dangerous waste. It has been investigated for decades in the UK, US, Sweden and elsewhere but without great success. But the idea was boosted in December 2018 by French Nobel prize–winning physicist Gérard Mourou, who, in his acceptance lecture, said laser beams millions of times brighter than the surface of the sun in bursts that last a millionth of a billionth of a second had the potential to neutralise nuclear waste, reducing its half-life to a few years and its radioactivity to very little. “Nuclear energy may be the best candidate for the future, but we are still left with a lot of dangerous junk. The idea is to transmute this nuclear waste into new forms of atoms which don’t have the problem of radioactivity. What you have to do is to change the makeup of the nucleus,” he said in the lecture. But Mourou accepted that it might take decades before this “extreme light” solution could be deployed to destroy nuclear waste on an industrial scale. ‘No reliable method’ After decades of civil nuclear power and billions spent researching different geological sites and ways to best dispose of the waste, the problems are both technical and political, and the consensus of governments and industry is that deep burial is the best solution – at least for the moment. Yet, so far, no country has managed to build a deep repository for high-level waste. “Although almost every nuclear country has, in principle, plans for the eventual burial of the most radioactive waste, only a handful have made any progress and nowhere in the world is there operating an authorised site for the deep geological disposal of the highest level radioactive waste,” says Andrew Blowers, author of The Legacy of Nuclear Power and a former member of the Committee on Radioactive Waste Management, set up to advise the British government on how and where to store nuclear waste. “Currently no options have been able to demonstrate that waste will remain isolated from the environment over the tens to hundreds of thousands of years. There is no reliable method to warn future generations about the existence of nuclear waste dumps,” he says. “The nuclear legacy stretches into the far future; it poses a risk to environments and human health for periods which extend well beyond our comprehension. Radioactive waste is the achilles heel of the industry,” says Blowers. The US has come closest with a single deep repository. The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico is a 655-metre deep complex for the disposal of “transuranic” waste, or long-lived intermediate level waste, mostly deriving from military bomb-making. By law, however, all high-level US nuclear waste must go to Yucca Mountain in Nevada, which since 1987 has been the designated deep geological repository about 90 miles north-west of Las Vegas. But the site has been met with continued legal, regulatory and constitutional challenges, becoming a political yo-yo since it was identified as a potentially suitable repository. It is fiercely opposed by the Western Shoshone peoples, Nevada state and others. A massive tunnel was excavated in Yucca Mountain but was never licensed and the site is now largely abandoned – to the frustration of the federal government and the nuclear industry, which has raised more than $41bn (£34bn) from a levy on consumer bills to pay for the repository and which must pay for heavy security at their temporary nuclear waste storage sites. “We need a high-level repository. We are holding waste now at about 121 sites across the US,” says Baker Elmore, director of federal programs at the Nuclear Energy Institute. “This costs the taxpayer $800m a year. We have 97 [nuclear] plants operating and the amount of waste is only going to grow. We are not allowing the science to play out here. There is $41bn in the government’s nuclear waste fund, and Yucca Mountain is scientifically sound. We want a decision. We are going to need more than one repository.” He is supported by the US energy secretary, Rick Perry. “We have a moral and national security obligation to come up with a long-term solution, finding the safest repositories available … we can no longer kick the can down the road,” he said at a Senate hearing in June 2017. Painfully slow Political and community opposition to plans has made progress painfully slow in most countries. In the UK, the government has offered communities money, but has been unable to persuade any local authority to host a permanent deep repository. Massive protests in France and Germany helped fuel the political rise of the Green party and have indefinitely delayed or stopped work on proposed repositories. Only Finland is close to completing a deep repository for high-level waste. In May, work started on an “encapsulation” plant where waste will be packed inside copper canisters that will be transferred into 400- to 450-metre deep underground tunnels. But doubt has been cast on the long-term safety of the canisters. “The problem is intractable,” says Paul Dorfman, founder of the Nuclear Consulting Group, made up of about 120 international academics and independent experts in the fields of radiation waste, nuclear policy and environmental risk. “The bitter reality is that there is no scientifically proven way of disposing of the existential problem of high- and intermediate-level waste. Some countries have built repositories, some plan them. “But given the huge technical uncertainties, if disposal does go ahead and anything goes wrong underground in the next millennia, then future generations risk profound widespread pollution.” Many people now doubt that a satisfactory final repository will ever be found. “Managing the nuclear legacy is not just a technical issue but a social one,” says Blowers. “The truth is that whatever efforts are made to bury and forget it, it will not go away. For the foreseeable future, the future is the safe and secure storage that is already in situ [at nuclear plants]. In the longer term, better options may materialise. “Given the timescales involved, there is no need to hurry. Society can and should take its time dealing with its nuclear legacy.” • This article originally appeared on Ensia"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2020/aug/29/covid-19-catastrophe","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2020-08-29T07:00:03Z","webTitle":"The experience of Covid-19 shows how easily catastrophe can befall our species | Raghu Karnad","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/29/covid-19-catastrophe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/29/covid-19-catastrophe","fields":{"headline":"The experience of Covid-19 shows how easily catastrophe can befall our species","bodyText":"Months after the end of the second world war, Albert Einstein gave an interview to urge Americans to imagine the third one. It was vital, he said, “to recognise that unless another war is prevented it is likely to bring destruction on a scale … even now hardly conceived, and that little civilisation would survive it.” In late 1947, the United States was still alone in wielding the atomic bomb. It might still have renounced its future use, and attempted to end proliferation and outlaw atomic weapons there and then. But the arms race would proceed headlong: soon the US and Soviet Union were both conducting thermonuclear tests. In 1954, the Castle Bravo test, carried out in the Bikini Atoll, produced an explosion a thousand times as powerful as the one over Hiroshima. The same year, the philosopher and pacifist Bertrand Russell began to draft an appeal to reason. His manifesto – which was also signed by 10 atomic scientists, nearly all Nobel Laureates, and Einstein – addressed itself to “members of the species Man, whose continued existence is in doubt”. They made a simple argument with a radical conclusion. Having learned to weaponise nuclear power, we could never unlearn it; disarmament might succeed, but we could not un-invent the bomb. Our command of science simply couldn’t coexist with a tendency to make war without – eventually, inevitably – wiping out our species. “Here, then, is the problem which we present to you … dreadful and inescapable: shall we put an end to the human race; or shall mankind renounce war?” To people alive today, the episode may seem quaint – a curio of the early cold war. The image of humanity in a ruined state is in everyone’s head now, but as a vision of the climate crisis, not of war. For most people in many countries, war seems a reduced and peripheral concern. For generations, we’ve been spared an experience of general, worldwide calamity, one that warps the horizon of our normality. Then came coronavirus. About 10 weeks into the global eruption of Covid-19, the notion began to spread that the virus might not be nature’s creation. Webs of paranoia are easily spun over our homebound, internet-fed imaginations. Naturally, Donald Trump was an early victim, but he wasn’t alone. TV networks in the second most populous country in the world went before him, as rightwing media in India fanned phobias of a “corona jihad” conducted by orthodox Muslims. In every society shocked and shuttered by the virus, some people have nursed theories that this much damage could only originate in human, presumably hostile, designs. Responsible voices in the scientific community and media have talked these theories down. That’s for the best. What’s not for the best, however, is remaining oblivious to what they knew in 1955: that science is arming us in new ways, at the risk of human society itself. We can reject malicious conspiracies about Covid-19, and still see in this catastrophe a mere illustration of what an engineered pathogen could do to us. The hazard we face from bioengineered agents is likely to be much greater than that of nuclear holocaust. In The Precipice: Existential Risk and the Future of Humanity, the Oxford University fellow Toby Ord meticulously accounts for various events, natural and anthropogenic, that pose “existential risk”. In his reckoning, the chance of nuclear war stands at 1/1,000 in the next 100 years, but the chance of “engineered pandemic” is 1/30 – the second-most likely of any catastrophe, beaten only by rogue AI. “We already have past examples of biological threats reaching extreme proportions,” Ord told me on the phone from Oxford, where he works at the university’s Future of Humanity Institute. “When we go beyond the natural risks and consider that people could engineer pathogens in order to have the exact properties to do us the most damage – that’s when it gets really scary.” An engineered virus could be developed at a far lower threshold of cost or scientific capability than a nuclear bomb. Gene-editing techniques are advancing with blistering speed, and most data is simply shared as academic material, with little of the oversight given to applied nuclear physics. Bioengineering breakthroughs, made in the most advanced labs a few years ago, are now replicated by undergraduates. This is great for research, but in terms of risk – in Ord’s phrase – “democratisation is proliferation”. “One has to make it clear you’re not suggesting the coronavirus is a bio-weapon,” Ord continues. “But it certainly shows the lower bound for what a major bio-weapon attack could do.” A bleak lesson of the 20th century is that general war legitimises any means, even those formerly deemed atrocious. (Throughout the 1930s, European powers repeatedly resolved to never use bomber aircraft.) If the catastrophic potential of science keeps increasing, the conditions for that potential to be realised must always retreat. We really do have to renounce war. Instead, since the Covid-19 crisis, many governments have doubled down on blame-games and brinkmanship. The world’s rival superpowers are trading denunciations, closing their consulates, and brushing up against each others’ fleets in the South China Sea. Hard-won arms-control treaties such as the New Start are being left to expire, instead of being expanded to include China. The two countries presumed most likely to resort to a nuclear exchange are India and Pakistan. A third of their weapons could kill roughly 100 million people directly and precipitate a global nuclear winter. On televised debates, we watch Indian and Pakistani spokespeople bellow threats to “wipe out” each other’s capitals. In 2020, bio-weapons are not our biggest problem. Thanks to Covid-19, though, they are the stick that has rolled out between our feet from the barrel of dynamite we forgot we were sitting on. The moral argument against future war stands on the same ground as the argument for fighting climate change. In Edward Said’s resonant phrase, the task before us is not to separate one struggle from another, but to connect them. There are radical paths we are preparing to take to save ourselves from climate disaster. These paths should also lead us away from the next war, and that gamble with humanity’s future. In previous decades, images from Hiroshima and Nagasaki made people around the world say never again to the bomb. For most people today, to whom the bomb is just an ironic symbol in the “mind-is-blown” emoji, our worst impressions of the Covid-19 pandemic could be a similar caution. Curfew, displacement and hunger around the world – wealth devastated, and the international grid of travel and trade shut down – deaths mounting senselessly without a shot being fired: Covid-19 is a terrible natural pandemic, but also a rehearsal of a kind of future war, one that mobilises not tanks or submarines but the frontiers of scientific research. “The atomic scientists, I think, have become convinced that they cannot arouse the American people to the truths of the atomic era by logic alone,” Einstein said in The Atlantic magazine. “There must be added that deep power of emotion which is a basic ingredient of religion. It is to be hoped that not only the churches but the schools, the colleges, and the leading organs of opinion will acquit themselves well of their unique responsibility in this regard.” We are called on to attempt a cultural, moral evolution away from war. We may be too embarrassed to say it, and risk sounding naive. But the atomic scientists were not embarrassed, knowing the real risk before us. •Raghu Karnad is a journalist and contributing editor at The Wire"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2019/dec/08/what-will-you-do-about-the-climate-crisis-the-parties-answer","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2019-12-08T12:58:56Z","webTitle":"What will you do about the climate crisis?

Is the climate crisis the biggest issue the UK faces as a nation? Conservatives: Yes, it is one of the biggest issues facing the world. Thanks to the efforts of successive governments, the UK has cut carbon emissions by more than any similar developed country. We have also already doubled our support for developing nations to tackle climate change. Greens: Absolutely. The science is clear: it is the biggest threat facing the UK and the world. Labour: Yes and this election is our last chance to tackle it. We’re already off course to meet our targets and radical and urgent action over the next five years is essential. Liberal Democrats: Yes, a Liberal Democrat government would solve Brexit on day one, so climate change would be the biggest issue. SNP: Scotland – like the rest of the world – faces a climate emergency. We have a moral responsibility to tackle climate change and will lead the way in showing how our society can transition to net zero. Does your party support the students striking from school and/or the Extinction Rebellion protests demanding urgent action on the climate crisis? Conservatives: We don’t support students losing out on their education, though we recognise and respect the passion that young people feel. We do not support illegal action that disrupts the lives of ordinary, hardworking people. Greens: We have supported the school strikers from day one. Young people will be most affected by the effects of climate chaos but don’t have a political voice or vote. [In Extinction Rebellion] a new generation of political activism has been born, and the Green party welcomes and supports that. Labour: Absolutely. This year saw the blossoming of a global movement calling on politicians to wake up. We have turned its demands into detailed, credible plans for real change. Lib Dems: Of course we support this action. It is deeply worrying that children are feeling the need to strike because they’re worried about their future. We are supportive of the aims of Extinction Rebellion and support their right to protest. But some of their actions have been counter-productive. SNP: We applaud the actions by school students in drawing attention to the need for greater urgency in tackling climate change. Will your government use public money to implement a national energy efficiency programme that upgrades millions of homes, reducing carbon emissions and bills? Conservatives: We will invest £6.3bn to improve the efficiency of 2.2 million disadvantaged homes. This will reduce their energy bills by as much as £750 a year. We will also spend £2.9bn levelling up the energy efficiency of our schools and hospitals. Greens: We will make energy efficiency a national infrastructure priority, and invest the money to upgrade a million homes a year to the highest modern standards [paid for from] general taxation. Labour: We have the biggest home upgrade programme since the second world war. We aim to upgrade every single home in the UK so that they are warm and energy efficient, bringing household bills down by an average of £417 per household per year by 2030. Low income households can access these upgrades for free with government grants. Better off households will be able to access zero interest loans. Lib Dems: Yes. We will invest £15bn over the next parliament to retrofit 26 million homes by 2030. This would save the average household £550 a year on energy bills. SNP: The Scottish government is already implementing a national energy efficiency programme with interest-free loans of up to £15,000 and heavy subsidies for low-income households. Will your government use planning law to actively support onshore wind and solar farms? Conservatives: Onshore wind capacity has increased by more than 200% since the Conservatives came into power, but it’s vital that new onshore developments have the support of local communities, who must have the final say over whether to accept new installations in their area. Greens: The UK has an abundance of the wind, tides, sun and rivers needed to be self-sufficient in energy. We will transform the planning system to support a massive increase in renewable generation. Our energy plan aims for 70% of the UK’s energy to be produced by wind power, with most of the remainder to be made up by other renewables, by the year 2030. Labour: We’re doing more than just changing the planning laws, we’re going to build them ourselves. We’ll build 2,000 new onshore wind turbines and enough solar panels to cover 22,000 football pitches. We’re not going to wait around for the market to pick up its act. Lib Dems: Yes. We will accelerate the deployment of renewable power, providing more funding, removing the Conservatives’ restrictions on solar and wind. We aim to reach at least 80% renewable electricity in the UK by 2030. SNP: We will be calling for reform of the UK support for renewables [including] allowing onshore wind and solar power to bid for “contracts for difference” support – the UK’s main renewables support mechanism. Will your government set a date for the end of new North Sea oil and gas licences? Conservatives: The oil and gas industry employs almost 300,000 people, of whom four in 10 work in Scotland. We believe the North Sea oil and gas industry has a long future ahead because it has a key role to play as we move to a net zero economy. We will support this transition in the next parliament with a transformational sector deal. Greens: 2024. Labour: North Sea production peaked in 1999, leaving oil and gas workers and their communities vulnerable. We will create a Just Transition Fund, with costs met through a tax on these corporations. We estimate these costs at around £11bn – which will cover a support package for nearly 37,000 oil and gas workers, the 126,000 people in jobs dependent on the sector, and their communities, to make the transition to a clean economy. Lib Dems: Our policies are focused on reducing demand for fossil fuels by investing in transforming power, heating and transport, rather than cutting domestic production, which would be likely to simply increase reliance on more polluting foreign producers. SNP: The SNP-led Scottish government has established a Just Transition Commission to advise on how to maximise the economic and social benefits of decarbonising Scotland, and manage the risks and challenges, so that we can move to a net-zero economy in a way that is fair for all. We will demand that 12% of the fund – at least £1bn over five years – will go to a Net Zero Industrial Strategy to help diversify the economies of oil hubs. Does your party think the UK needs more new nuclear power stations after Hinkley C and, if so, how will your government fund them? Conservatives: Another nuclear power station could provide much needed energy security during those lulls when renewables aren’t generating power. However, this must provide good value for money for billpayers and a Conservative government will look at the best options for delivering that. Greens: No. We will prohibit the construction of nuclear power stations. Renewables can be deployed faster, cheaper and with significantly less risk. Labour: Our priority is investing in and moving to a renewable and low-carbon energy mix. However, years of Tory inaction has left the UK dependent on nuclear. We will build new nuclear power needed for energy security. Lib Dems: No, nuclear power is too expensive. We should be concentrating our resources on renewables. SNP: No, the SNP oppose new nuclear power plants and prioritises investment on cleaner, cheaper forms of electricity generation. Will your government use a post-Brexit subsidy regime to support environmental schemes such as tree planting, soil and peat restoration and flood protection? Will that funding be at least £1bn a year, ie a third of the current EU CAP scheme? Conservatives: By getting Brexit done, we will be able to pass our major environment bill and focus on priorities such as a new scheme of rural payments that prioritises environmental enhancement and protection. We have already confirmed that a Conservative government will match current farm funding in every year of the next parliament but redirect it to environmental schemes. Greens: Whether we leave the EU or not, it is urgent to provide public funding for environmental improvements. It is a Brexiteer myth that we cannot achieve this while we are in the EU. Our manifesto includes £1.7bn per year for the following: peatland restoration; helping farmers transition to more environmentally friendly forms of land use and away from intensive livestock farming; replanting of hedgerows lost in the last 50 years; planting 700m new trees; deploying environmentally friendly flood management measures including soil restoration in uplands. Labour: Yes, assuming the final say of the British people is to leave the EU, we will maintain financial incentives or environmental schemes on our farmlands. It will definitely be more than one third of the current spend from CAP. Lib Dems: We oppose Brexit, but will reform CAP funding to support a “public money for public goods” approach, rewarding farmers for environmental schemes. SNP: We will press for an increase in new woodland creation, towards a target of 60m trees planted annually in the UK by 2025, with half in Scotland to help tackle the climate emergency and to support biodiversity and rural employment. Will your government give financial support specifically to rewilding projects to enable the recovery of wildlife? Conservatives: We will set aside £640m for a specific Nature for Climate fund. This will restore peatland and help us triple tree-planting rates. But we know that sometimes natural regeneration – rewilding – can lead to better outcomes both for nature and the climate. Greens: Yes. An ecological crisis is happening – we must tackle it by restoring, expanding and joining up the wild spaces nature needs to thrive. Labour: We will create 10 new national nature parks and rewild our 10 existing national parks in order to restore natural habitats such as woodland, grasslands, meadows, peatbogs and saltmarshes. We will also create “natural corridors” in the form of local parks, walking pathways, cycling lanes and canals. Lib Dems: Yes, we will work with farmers and land managers to support nature recovery. SNP: The SNP-led Scottish government has already taken steps in the rewilding of Scotland. We have successfully reintroduced white-tailed eagles to Scotland in recent decades and are in the process of reintroducing beavers. Will your government implement a policy to reduce red meat consumption in the UK? Conservatives: The meat that British farmers produce is already significantly less carbon-intensive than meat produced elsewhere in the world. We will back our farmers to match their own net zero by 2040 ambition with funding to develop new agri-tech to reduce emissions and farm in an even more environmentally friendly way. Greens: Yes. We will promote the benefits of healthy diets, based on locally and sustainably produced food, and “less but better” meat and dairy consumption. We will phase in a tax on meat and dairy products over the next 10 years, to reduce the methane produced by livestock. The revenues will help farmers transition to more sustainable farming methods. Labour: We will ask Public Health England to review dietary health guidelines in relation to meat and dairy consumption, in line with scientific and nutritional advice, and we will help our farmers to anticipate and manage any transitions arising from changing consumer demands. Lib Dems: No. Instead we will support farmers to adopt a more environmental method of farming to cut emissions and establish a national food strategy to promote sustainable food – including public procurement. SNP: The SNP-led Scottish government has set maximum limits for consumption of red processed meat in schools which is linked to an increased risk of cancer. Will your government stop the third runway at Heathrow and/or all airport expansion? Conservatives: Parliament has voted in principle to support a third runway at Heathrow, but it is a private sector project. Heathrow must demonstrate that it can meet its legal obligations for air quality and noise obligations. The scheme will receive no new public money. Greens: Yes. Airport expansion is totally incompatible with tackling the climate emergency. We will scrap plans for airport expansion at Heathrow and across the country. Labour: Any expansion of airports must pass our tests on air quality, noise pollution, climate change obligations and countrywide benefits. Lib Dems: Yes. SNP: Our MPs will closely consider any proposals brought forward by the UK government. Any transport proposals must seriously address the climate emergency. What date will your government set for the end of sales of new internal-combustion engine vehicles? Conservatives: We’ve set a date of 2040, and are consulting on whether we can bring this forward, but we want to do so in a way that takes into account the needs of small businesses and manufacturers. Greens: 2030 at the latest. Labour: 2030. Lib Dems: 2030. SNP: The Scottish government has pledged to phase out new petrol and diesel cars and vans across Scotland by 2032, eight years ahead of the UK government target. Will your party commit to greater funding for public transport, cycling and walking than for road building? Conservatives: We will spend more on public transport, walking and cycling than on roads. We spent £36.6bn on transport in England in 2018-19, of which £20.6bn was on public transport. Our ongoing capital commitments include more public transport than roads: £29bn for national roads, in addition to £7bn for local roads, will benefit public transport and cyclists. Greens: Yes. We will abandon all new road building schemes. Our “green new deal” for transport will invest in public transport, walking and cycling so wherever people live they are not forced to use a car, by spending £2.5bn a year on new cycleways and footpaths and making travelling by public transport cheaper than travelling by car, and providing new routes for electric coaches across the country. Labour: By improving public transport, Labour will help people to become less reliant on their cars. Labour will reinstate 3,000 municipal bus routes that have been cut under the Tories and give under-25s free bus travel. We’ll take rail into public ownership. We will increase the funding available for cycling and walking. Lib Dems: Yes, we’re committed to significant investment for buses and railways. We aim to spend 10% of the transport budget on walking and cycling by 2025, through both increased capital infrastructure spending and redeploying some of the road building budgets. SNP: We are committed to: investing over £500m in improved bus priority infrastructure to make bus travel the faster, greener option; reducing emissions from Scotland’s railways to zero by 2035; helping people with the cost of ultra-low emission vehicles. Does your party back clean air zones that charge or ban polluting vehicles in urban areas, which government research shows are the most effective policy to reduce air pollution? Conservatives: It’s important that measures that add costs to motorists are balanced by those that make it easier to choose cleaner options. That’s why we’ll invest £1bn to complete our fast-charging network to ensure you will always be within 30 miles of a rapid electric vehicle charger. Greens: We will civilise our streets by making Low Traffic Neighbourhoods, in which rat-running is blocked, the norm for residential areas and making 20mph the default speed limit. These changes would reduce traffic, carbon emissions and danger to people walking and cycling. Labour: We will introduce a new Clean Air Act, with a vehicle scrappage scheme and clean air zones, complying with World Health Organization limits for fine particles and nitrous oxides. Lib Dems: Yes and we will strengthen the powers of local authorities to do this. SNP: We pledged to create low emission zones in Scotland’s four biggest cities between 2018 and 2020. We will make up to £2.5m available to help commercial and private vehicle owners who face the greatest difficulties in preparing for the transition. The Committee on Climate Change says the UK is unprepared for the impacts of climate change. Will your government increase funding for adaptation and what policies will it introduce to prepare for the inevitable increases in flooding, heatwaves and summer water shortages? Conservatives: The impacts of climate change are being felt now, and the frequency and intensity of many extreme weather events are expected to increase. That’s why we’re going to invest an additional £4bn in flood defences over the next parliament. Greens: We will deploy environmentally friendly flood management measures to protect communities from flooding and change the planning system to prevent building on floodplains. We will protect our precious water supplies by enforcing stricter penalties for polluters and for water companies found to be extracting too much water. We will require water companies to enable transportation across the country. Labour: We will provide an extra £5.6bn in funding to improve flood defences and respond to the increased risk of flooding, prioritising areas at risk in north-west England, Yorkshire and the east Midlands. The prioritisation of short-term shareholder profits have prevented [privatised] water companies from preparing for water shortages. We’ll end this by bringing these companies into democratic control. Lib Dems: Yes, we will establish a £5bn flooding fund. This money will be used to support small community and council-led schemes to reduce upstream flooding, to improve flood defences and introduce high standards of flood resilience for buildings and infrastructure in high flood risk areas. SNP: Our MPs will demand the UK accelerates its action to meet Scotland’s climate change targets – the toughest legal targets in the world – of a 75% reduction in emissions by 2035, net zero carbon emissions no later than 2040 and net zero of all emissions by 2045. Will your government ensure that food, farming and environmental standards are not reduced after Brexit? Conservatives: Yes – and as we negotiate our new trade agreement with the EU next year, we will legislate in 2020 to ensure high standards of workers’ rights, environmental protection and consumer rights. In all of our future trade negotiations, we guarantee that we will not compromise on our high environmental protection, animal welfare and food standards. Greens: Remaining in the European Union is the best option for protecting our food, farming and environmental standards. Labour: We will secure a new Brexit deal that protects jobs, rights and the environment. We will dynamically align to current EU standards to ensure we don’t fall behind our EU neighbours. Lib Dems: Yes – by stopping Brexit SNP: We believe Scotland should remain in the EU. We will campaign to keep the EU’s food, farming and environmental standards in the UK. Some responses have been edited for length. The Brexit party did not provide answers to the questions, but directed people to its “contract with the people”. • This article was amended on 9 December 2019 to add text clarifying that the Green party supports both the school strikers and the Extinction Rebellion protests."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/sep/20/russia-ukraine-war-moscow-loses-full-control-of-luhansk-region-ukraine-to-dominate-agenda-at-un-summit-live-updates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-20T20:23:31Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war live: Putin’s address on ‘votes’ in occupied regions postponed, say Russian media – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/sep/20/russia-ukraine-war-moscow-loses-full-control-of-luhansk-region-ukraine-to-dominate-agenda-at-un-summit-live-updates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/sep/20/russia-ukraine-war-moscow-loses-full-control-of-luhansk-region-ukraine-to-dominate-agenda-at-un-summit-live-updates","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war live: Putin’s address on ‘votes’ in occupied regions postponed, say Russian media – as it happened","bodyText":"That’s it for the Ukraine Live Blog today. Here is a reminder of what has happened so far: Putin postponed a planned address to the Russian nation today to tomorrow morning, reported Russian media. The planned speech was going to cover new annexations of Ukrainian territory. The proxy Russian authorities in four occupied areas of Ukraine – Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia – have all announced on Tuesday their intentions to hold referendums between 23-27 September on joining the Russian Federation. The White House rejected Russia’s plans to hold referenda in parts of Ukraine, adding that Moscow may be making the move to recruit troops in those areas after suffering extensive losses on the battlefield. Several world leaders have said they will not recognize any referenda or new annexations of Ukrainian territory, with French president Emmanuel Macron calling the plan a “parody”. Thank you and good night! Other world leaders have condemned the planned referenda from Russian-occupied Ukrainian territories about joining the Russian nation. Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau called the referenda “unacceptable”, adding that Canada would never recognize any such territories as part of Russia, reported Reuters. “Canada denounces Russia’s planned ‘referendums’ in occupied regions of Ukraine. We will never recognize them,” posted Trudeau to Twitter. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell also said that the EU strongly condemns Russia’s plans to hold referenda, reported Reuters. “Russia, its political leadership, and all those involved in these ‘referenda’ and other violations of international law in Ukraine will be held accountable, and additional restrictive measures against Russia would be considered,” Borrell said. Here’s more analysis from the Guardian’s Andrew Roth on if Vladimir Putin is willing to risk a nuclear war versus admitting defeat in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine: Vladimir Putin has backed himself into a corner in Ukraine. And true to form, the Russian leader is ready to escalate, perhaps up to the brink of nuclear war, rather than admit defeat. Seven months after Putin launched his invasion, Russian troops have been driven back in the Kharkiv region, and Ukrainian forces are advancing in Luhansk and squeezing his troops and supply lines in Kherson. It is not impossible that Russia could lose territories that it has held since 2014 if Putin’s forces cannot stop Ukraine’s counteroffensive. Facing humiliation, Putin has issued a new threat: holding “referenda” in the regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson, which could lead to them being annexed by Russia by early next week. Vladimir Putin’s big speech on new annexations of Ukrainian territory has been postponed until tomorrow morning, Russian media are reporting. Putin’s televised address to the Russian public has reportedly been rescheduled to 8AM Moscow time. Forbes Russia citing two sources in the Kremlin administration said the speech would be broadcast “when the Far East wakes up.” It isn’t clear why the speech was postponed. Analysts have suggested that the speech may also serve to announce a partial mobilisation in Russia. Pro-Kremlin pundits have told their readers to go to bed. “Tomorrow!” posted TV presenter Vladimir Soloviev. Biden will nominate diplomat Lynne Tracy as the US ambassador to Russia, announced the White House today, reported Reuters. Tracy currently serves as U.S. ambassador to Armenia. The U.S. ambassador post in Russia has been vacant since Sept. 4, when envoy John Sullivan concluded his tenure there amid soaring bilateral tensions due to Moscow’s war in Ukraine. US president Joe Biden will speak tomorrow at the United Nations General Assembly against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, saying that the invasion violates the UN’s 1945 charter, reports Reuters. On Wednesday, Biden will first meet with UK prime minister Liz Truss and then join in on a summit about collecting pledges to help nations battle diseases. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan has said that Wednesday’s speech will not be used to argue that Russia should be removed as a member of the UN Security Council, where it's one of five permanent members. Sullivan said Biden will urge all nations to recognize that Russia’s war against Ukraine is a violation of the U.N.’s 1945 charter. In other news, Turkish lenders have suspended the use of the Russian payment system Mir, says a senior US administration official, with other banks soon to follow. A senior U.S. administration official on Tuesday said steps Turkish lenders Isbank and Denizbank took to suspend the use of Russian payment system Mir make a lot of sense, and added that the United States expects more banks will cut off Mir over sanctions risk. “The steps these banks took make a lot of sense. Cutting off Mir is one of the best ways to protect a bank from the sanctions risk that comes from doing business with Russia. We expect more banks to cut off Mir because they don*t want to risk being on the wrong side of the coalition*s sanctions,” the official said on condition of anonymity. We are currently waiting on Vladimir Putin to address the Russian nation. In the meantime, international leaders are chiming in on recognizing referendums from Russian-occupied Ukrainian territories about joining the Russian nation. French president Emmanuel Macron has said that the international community will not recognize such referendums, calling the plans “a parody” and “cynical”. “If the Donbas referendum idea wasn’t so tragic it would be funny,” Macron told reporters in New York, reported Reuters. “I think what was announced by Russia is a parody,” Macon said. “This is cynicism, and obviously it won’t be recognized by the international community.” Similarly, Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said that Turkey will also not recognize the results of the referendums, reported NEXTA. Here is a round-up of today’s main headlines: The proxy Russian authorities in four occupied areas of Ukraine – Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia – have all announced on Tuesday their intentions to hold referendums between 23-27 September on joining the Russian Federation. The sudden rush to hold a vote comes as Ukraine’s counteroffensive has reclaimed territory in the east of the country, including a small symbolic toehold in the Luhansk region, which had been totally under the control of Russian proxies. Any referendums on joining Russia in Russian-occupied Ukrainian territories would destroy any remaining window for talks between Kyiv and Moscow, Ukrainian publication Liga.net cited the Ukrainian president’s office spokesman as saying on Tuesday. “Without the referendums, there is still the smallest chance for a diplomatic solution. After the referendums - no,” Liga.net quoted Serhiy Nykyforov as saying. The White House rejected Russia’s plans to hold referenda in parts of Ukraine and said Moscow may be making the move to recruit troops in those areas after suffering extensive losses on the battlefield. Jake Sullivan, President Joe Biden’s national security adviser, called the referenda an affront to principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity. With Germany’s gas storage facilities now at just over 90% capacity, Robert Habeck, the economy minister, has said Germany now stands “a good chance” of getting through the winter. Germany is ahead of its goal to have the subterranean stores 95% full by the start of November. Russian president Vladimir Putin has condemned what he described as US efforts to preserve its global domination, saying they are doomed to fail. Speaking while receiving credentials from foreign ambassadors to Moscow, Putin said: “The objective development toward a multi-polar world faces resistance of those who try to preserve their hegemony in global affairs and control everything - Latin America, Europe, Asia and Africa.” Ukraine has recaptured a village close to the eastern city of Lysychansk, in a small but symbolic victory that means Russia no longer has full control of the Luhansk region, one of Russian president Vladimir Putin’s key war aims. Luhansk’s governor, Serhiy Haidai, said Ukraine’s armed forces were in “complete control” of Bilohorivka. “It’s a suburb of Lysychansk. Soon we will drive these scumbags out of there with a broom,” he said. “Step by step, centimetre by centimetre, we will liberate our entire land from the invaders.” The pace of Ukrainian forces’ advance in the north-east had thrown Russian forces into a “panic”, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said in his nightly address. Zelenskiy said he was now focused on “speed” in liberated areas. “The speed at which our troops are moving. The speed in restoring normal life,” he said. Ukrainian forensic experts have so far exhumed 146 bodies, mostly of civilians, at the mass burial site near Izium in eastern Ukraine, the regional governor said on Monday. Oleh Synehubov, governor of the Kharkiv region, said the exhumed bodies included two children. The Kremlin has denied allegations that Russian forces had committed war crimes in Ukraine’s Kharkiv province. The pro-Russian separatist self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) has said 10 civilians were killed and 15 wounded overnight by shelling from Ukrainian forces on the territory that the DPR occupies. Officials of the similarly self-proclaimed separatist Luhansk People’s Republic (LPR) have informed the Russian news agency Tass that seven people were killed, including three children, in the village of Krasnorichenske, which it occupies. Ukraine’s armed forces have sunk a barge carrying Russian troops and equipment across the Dnieper River near Nova Kakhovka in the Kherson region, the Kyiv Independent reports. Security fears have almost certainly led Russia’s Black Sea Fleet to relocate its Kilo-class submarines from Sevastopol in Crimea to Novorossiysk in southern Russia, the UK Ministry of Defence says in its latest intelligence briefing on the war. That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, for today. My colleague Gloria Oladipo will be along shortly to continue bringing you all the latest news lines from Russia’s war on Ukraine. Well, it’s 6.20pm UK time and still no sign of Vladimir Putin arriving to give his address to the Russian nation. The wait goes on, it seems. Meanwhile, Joe Biden is heading for the United Nations summit in New York “with the wind at his back”, and will deliver a firm rebuke of Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, national security adviser Jake Sullivan is telling reporters at the White House. He’s speaking at the daily press briefing and outlining what the president will be talking about in his address to the UN general assembly on Wednesday morning, as well as taking a dig at world leaders who won’t be there: We’re making historic investments at home; our alliances are stronger than they’ve been in modern memory; our robust, united support for Ukraine has helped the Ukrainians push back against Russian aggression; and we’re leading the world in response to the most significant transnational challenges that the world faces from global health to global food security to global supply chains to tackling the climate crisis. Meanwhile, our competitors are facing increasingly strong headwinds, and neither President Xi [Jinping of China] nor [Russian] President [Vladimir] Putin are even showing up to this global gathering. For more on this, see our US politics blog here. The Russian president Vladimir Putin will be giving an address at 6pm UK time this evening, when he expected to address today’s news that parts of Ukraine held by Russian troops will hold referendums on joining Russia. We will bring you all the news lines from that as it happens. The White House rejected Russia’s plans to hold referenda in parts of Ukraine and said Moscow may be making the move to recruit troops in those areas after suffering extensive losses on the battlefield. Jake Sullivan, President Joe Biden’s national security adviser, called the referenda an affront to principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity. He said Biden, at his speech on Wednesday at the United Nations General Assembly, will issue a “firm rebuke” to Russia for its war against Ukraine. Any referendums on joining Russia in Russian-occupied Ukrainian territories would destroy any remaining window for talks between Kyiv and Moscow, Ukrainian publication Liga.net cited the Ukrainian president’s office spokesman as saying on Tuesday. “Without the referendums, there is still the smallest chance for a diplomatic solution. After the referendums - no,” Liga.net quoted Serhiy Nykyforov as saying. He made the comments in response to Russian-installed officials in four occupied Ukrainian regions announcing plans for referendums over the next week on formally joining Russia, Reuters reported. The inmates of penal colony No 8, in the Tambov region 300 miles south of Moscow, rushed to their cell windows when they heard the sound of a helicopter approaching on a late afternoon in July. “No one ever uses a chopper to get down here. We were curious what the big occasion was,” recalled Ivan, one of the inmates. Half an hour later, he and the others were ordered to report to the prison’s main square where two heavily guarded men were waiting. “We couldn’t believe our eyes, he would really come all the way to visit us,” said Ivan, who is halfway through a 23-year sentence for murder and, like other inmates interviewed, asked to use a pseudonym out of concerns for his safety. “But there he was standing in front of us: Prigozhin, in the flesh, urging us to join the Wagner private military group and fight in Ukraine.” Four Russian-occupied regions in Ukraine have said they are planning to hold “referendums” on joining the Russian Federation in a series of coordinated announcements that could indicate the Kremlin has made a decision to formally annexe the territories. Moscow may be betting that a formal annexation would help halt Russian territorial losses, after a successful Ukrainian counteroffensive that has reclaimed large portions of territory in Kharkiv region. The occupied Donetsk and Luhansk regions have said they are ready to hold “polls”, which will be universally viewed as rigged, as soon as this week, with announcements also made in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. Some Russian media have reported that Vladimir Putin may deliver a speech this evening on a potential annexation. As Ukrainian troops now begin making advances in the Luhansk region, Russia may be worried that it can’t win on the battlefield and threaten a potential escalation, including a formal declaration of war or even a nuclear attack, by claiming to defend its own territory. “Everything that’s happening today is an absolutely unequivocal ultimatum to Ukraine and the West,” wrote Tatiana Stanovaya, an expert on Kremlin politics and founder of R.Politik. “Either Ukraine retreats or there will be nuclear war.” “To guarantee ‘victory’, Putin is ready to hold referendums immediately in order to obtain the right (in his understanding) to use nuclear weapons to defend Russian territory.” With Germany’s gas storage facilities now at just over 90% capacity, Robert Habeck, the economy minister has said Germany now stands “a good chance” of getting through the winter. Germany is ahead of its goal to have the subterranean stores 95% full by the start of November. On the sidelines of a visit to Lubmin in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, where building work has started on a floating platform for LNG facilities which are due to open in January, Habeck said: If we succeed in saving gas, and if we’re lucky with the weather, then we have a good chance of getting through the winter. What Habeck means, in short, is if the winter is harsh, the storage facilities may not be capable of compensating for the higher usage of gas. Last year, Germany used around 999 terawatt hours (TWh) of gas. The storage facilities are capable of storing around a quarter to 28% of that amount. Around 220 TWh is currently available. But a very cold January for example, like Germany experienced last year, could consume half of the available reserves. On Tuesday the embattled Habeck who has come under fierce criticism in recent weeks for his energy policies, voiced doubt that his plans for a gas levy - to be paid by gas consumers to compensate gas suppliers that have had to buy in alternative sources of gas after Russia slowed down then cut off its supplies completely - were constitutionally viable. His proposal had prompted a huge backlash over concerns that companies that had profited from the energy price surge might benefit from the levy. The government’s plans to nationalise the gas provider Uniper, which were confirmed on Tuesday afternoon, have also further called the sense or fairness of such a levy into doubt. The Guardian’s Shaun Walker has tweeted that whether intentional or not, the announcements of referendums in Russian-held parts of the Ukraine will result in escalation of the conflict. He said: The proxy Russian authorities in four occupied areas of Ukraine – Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia – have all announced on Tuesday their intentions to hold referendums between 23-27 September on joining the Russian Federation. The sudden rush to hold a vote comes as Ukraine’s counteroffensive has reclaimed territory in the east of the country, including a small symbolic toehold in the Luhansk region, which had been totally under the control of Russian proxies. Doubts have been cast on how effectively the occupying authorities will be able to organise referendums at such short notice, although preparations were previously being carried out. According to Russian news agency RIA, in a direct appeal to Russian President Vladimir Putin, the self-proclaimed leader of the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic Denis Pushilin said: “I ask you to consider the issue of joining the Donetsk People’s Republic into the Russian Federation as soon as possible in the event of a positive decision on the results of the referendum, which we have no doubts about.” Some Russian media outlets have reported that Putin may address the Russian nation later today on the topic, although this has not been confirmed by the Kremlin. The move comes on the same day that Russia’s parliament, the Duma, voted to toughen punishments for desertion and insubordination in times of military mobilisation. The news of a flurry of announcements that the proxy-Russian authorities in occupied areas of Ukraine will all be trying to hold referendums this weekend about joining the Russian Federation does not appear to have gone down well with the Russian stock market. Reuters reports that stocks plunged to their lowest in a month as moves in Moscow reignited martial law fears with new legislation, and the plans to hold referendums in Ukraine sped forwards apace. Russia’s parliament on Tuesday approved a bill to toughen punishments for a host of crimes such as desertion, damage to military property and insubordination if they were committed during military mobilisation or combat situations. “Indices are clearly collapsing amid fears around the risks of mobilisation and martial law,” Tinkoff Investments analyst Kirill Komarov told Reuters, adding that Tuesday’s collapse would likely be the rouble-based MOEX index’s sharpest drop since June 30. My colleague Shaun Walker points out that there may be some issues with the planned referendums at the weekend. The RIA Novosti news agency is now also reporting that the occupied Ukrainian territories of Donetsk and Luhansk will hold referendums on joining the Russian Federation from 23 to 27 September. Its report quotes the self-proclaimed leader of the Donetsk People’s Republic Denis Pushilin, and says: The long-suffering people of Donbas have earned the right to be part of Russia, which they have always considered their homeland, Pushilin said in an address to Vladimir Putin. “I ask you to consider the issue of joining the Donetsk People’s Republic into the Russian Federation as soon as possible in the event of a positive decision on the results of the referendum, which we have no doubts about,” the message says. According to the DPR authorities, 9,044 residents of the republic, including 120 children, were killed during the hostilities. The figures given by RIA have not been independently verified. The Donetsk People’s Republic and the Luhansk People’s Republic are not recognised as legitimate authorities by any other UN member states apart from Russia, Syria and North Korea. If you want some background reading on the issue of a possible referendum in the occupied Kherson region of Ukraine, a month ago Shaun Walker and Pjotr Sauer were able to conduct a series of telephone interviews with people there. At the time they wrote: Residents remain unsure about what the next few months might bring: a swift Ukrainian counteroffensive to regain control, a protracted battle that turns the city to rubble, or Russia carrying out its sham referendum and annexing the territory. You can read more of their article from August here: ‘A referendum is not right’: occupied Kherson looks to uncertain future Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba has responded to the hurried calls to hold a series of referendums in occupied territories in eastern and southern Ukraine to join the Russian Federation. He has tweeted: Sham “referendums” will not change anything. Neither will any hybrid “mobilisation”. Russia has been and remains an aggressor illegally occupying parts of Ukrainian land. Ukraine has every right to liberate its territories and will keep liberating them whatever Russia has to say. A destroyed bridge across Siverskyi-Donets river in the recently retaken area of Izium, Ukraine. The Russian-controlled part of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region may stage a referendum to join Russia in the coming days, the RIA Novosti news agency reported, citing a local Russian-installed official. It comes as Russia’s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said it was up to the people living in separatist-controlled areas of Ukraine if they wanted to hold referendums on joining Russia. “From the very beginning ... we’ve been saying that the peoples of the respective territories should decide their fate,” Lavrov said on state TV when asked about several coordinated moves by Russian-backed separatists in Ukraine on Tuesday to stage votes on joining Russia. Proxy authorities in the self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic (LPR) will hold a referendum on joining Russia between 23 and 27 September, the TASS news agency reported on Tuesday. The Russian-backed separatist parliament had passed a law outlining the details of the proposed vote, though the document made no mention of a date for the vote, Reuters reported. The Kremlin has yet to comment on the prospect of votes to incorporate these regions into Russia. It previously said the votes were a matter for local Russian-installed officials and people living in the regions. Russian-installed officials in the Kherson region of Ukraine have said they have decided to hold a referendum on joining Russia and have urged the Kremlin to give its permission as soon as possible, the separatist head of the region said on Tuesday. In a post on the Telegram messaging app, Volodymyr Saldo, the Russian-appointed head of Kherson, said he hoped Kherson would become “a part of Russia, a fully fledged subject of a united country”, Reuters reported. Russian forces control around 95% of Ukraine’s Kherson territory in the south of the country. Saldo did not name a date for the proposed vote. Officials in parts of Ukraine controlled by Russian forces, including the two breakaway Russian-backed regions of Donbas – the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics (DPR and LPR) – have stepped up preparations for long-discussed votes to join Russia this week in a coordinated move. Saldo said Kherson joining Russia would “secure our region” and be a “triumph of historical justice”. “I am sure that the Russian leadership will accept the results of the referendum,” he added. The Kremlin has repeatedly said the issue is a matter for the local Russian-installed officials and citizens of the regions to decide. Saldo’s remarks echoed those made by Kremlin ally and former president Dmitry Medvedev earlier on Tuesday in which he called for the Kremlin to let the separatists join Russia. Shortly after Saldo’s announcement about plans for a vote in Kherson, the head of Russia’s parliament said he would support the regions joining Russia. “Today, we need to support the republics with which we have signed mutual assistance agreements,” Russia’s state Duma speaker Vyacheslav Volodin said, referring to agreements signed between Moscow and the DPR and LPR which paved the way for the Kremlin to dispatch tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine in February. Russian president Vladimir Putin has condemned what he described as US efforts to preserve its global domination, saying they are doomed to fail. Speaking while receiving credentials from foreign ambassadors to Moscow, Putin said: “The objective development toward a multi-polar world faces resistance of those who try to preserve their hegemony in global affairs and control everything - Latin America, Europe, Asia and Africa.” He added that “the hegemony has succeeded in doing so for quite a long time, but it can’t go on forever... regardless of the developments in Ukraine”. He has repeatedly cast his decision to send troops into Ukraine as a response to alleged western encroachment on Russia’s vital security interests, the Associated Press reported. The Russian leader said western sanctions against Moscow over its action in Ukraine were part of efforts by the US and its allies to strengthen their positions but claimed they have backfired against their organisers and also damaged poor countries. Ukraine has recaptured a village close to the eastern city of Lysychansk, in a small but symbolic victory that means Russia no longer has full control of the Luhansk region, one of Russian president Vladimir Putin’s key war aims. Luhansk’s governor, Serhiy Haidai, said Ukraine’s armed forces were in “complete control” of Bilohorivka. “It’s a suburb of Lysychansk. Soon we will drive these scumbags out of there with a broom,” he said. “Step by step, centimetre by centimetre, we will liberate our entire land from the invaders.” The pace of Ukrainian forces’ advance in the north-east had thrown Russian forces into a “panic”, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said in his nightly address. Zelenskiy said he was now focused on “speed” in liberated areas. “The speed at which our troops are moving. The speed in restoring normal life,” he said. Ukrainian forensic experts have so far exhumed 146 bodies, mostly of civilians, at the mass burial site near Izium in eastern Ukraine, the regional governor said on Monday. Oleh Synehubov, governor of the Kharkiv region, said the exhumed bodies included two children. The Kremlin has denied allegations that Russian forces had committed war crimes in Ukraine’s Kharkiv province. The pro-Russian separatist self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) has said 10 civilians were killed and 15 wounded overnight by shelling from Ukrainian forces on the territory that the DPR occupies. Officials of the similarly self-proclaimed separatist Luhansk People’s Republic (LPR) have informed the Russian news agency Tass that seven people were killed, including three children, in the village of Krasnorichenske, which it occupies. Ukraine’s armed forces have sunk a barge carrying Russian troops and equipment across the Dnieper River near Nova Kakhovka in the Kherson region, the Kyiv Independent reports. Security fears have almost certainly led Russia’s Black Sea Fleet to relocate its Kilo-class submarines from Sevastopol in Crimea to Novorossiysk in southern Russia, the UK Ministry of Defence says in its latest intelligence briefing on the war. The pro-Russian separatist “public council” of the occupied Kherson region in Ukraine appealed Tuesday to the Russian-installed regional leader Vladimir Saldo to hold a referendum on joining the Russian federation without delay. It said “the need for such a step was caused, among other things, by acts of terror by the Ukrainian authorities and Nato.” It follows similar moves in the Donbas on Monday, where Denis Pushilin, self-appointed head of the DPR, called on his fellow separatist leader in Luhansk to combine efforts toward preparing a referendum on joining Russia. “Our actions should be synchronised,” Pushilin said in a video posted to social media on Monday. Dmitry Medvedev, the hawkish long-term ally of Vladimir Putin, on Tuesday backed calls for referendums in occupied areas, saying that bringing them into the Russian Federation would mean “the geopolitical transformation in the world will become irreversible. Encroachment on the territory of Russia is a crime, the commission of which allows you to use all the forces of self-defence.” British prime minister Liz Truss is expected to vow to match the UK’s spending on military support to Ukraine next year at the same level as this year when she speaks at the UN general assembly. Truss told reporters as she travelled to New York: “Ukraine’s victories in recent weeks have been inspirational. My message to the people of Ukraine is this: the UK will continue to be right behind you every step of the way. Your security is our security.” Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has told PBS in the US in an interview that all the land invaded by Russia should be returned to Ukraine, including Crimea, which was annexed by Putin’s forces in 2014. He said “If a peace is going to be established in Ukraine, of course, the returning of the land that was invaded will become really important.” Erdoğan also repeated Turkey’s objections to Sweden joining Nato, saying “Sweden has been a cradle for terrorism and the terrorists have infiltrated all the way into their parliaments. And, in Stockholm, we see terrorists are demonstrating all the time. And they’re attacking the innocent Turkish descendants. We have given all the evidence relevant to these developments to our Swedish interlocutors.” Hungary’s foreign minister said Tuesday the European Union should not consider new sanctions against Russia as that would only deepen the energy supply crisis and hurt Europe. A US defence official has told CNN that the possibility of the US providing tanks to Ukraine is “absolutely on the table” but wouldn’t happen immediately because of issues with training, maintenance and sustainment. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later on. Tom Ambrose will be here shortly to take you through the next few hours of our coverage. Russia’s RIA Novosti news agency is reporting that “the public council of the Kherson region” in occupied Ukraine has appealed to the Russian-installed regional leader Vladimir Saldo to hold a referendum on joining the Russian federation without delay. RIA reports: The Public Council emphasised that the need for such a step was caused, among other things, by acts of terror by the Ukrainian authorities and Nato. The authors of the appeal are sure that the inhabitants of the region will support the idea of returning to Russia. They added that this would secure the region and allow historical justice to be restored. Kherson overwhelmingly voted to join an independent Ukraine in 1991 rather than remain part of the unravelling Soviet Union. In his interview with PBS NewsHour, Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was very vocal in his country’s continued opposition to the expansion of Nato to include Finland, but most particularly Sweden. He said: Here especially, Sweden has been a cradle for terrorism and the terrorists have infiltrated all the way into their parliaments. And, in Stockholm, we see terrorists are demonstrating all the time. The banners, the poster of the leader of the terrorist organisations abound. They are demonstrating. They’re throwing slogans. And they’re attacking the innocent Turkish descendants in Stockholm. And we have given all the evidence relevant to these developments to our Swedish interlocutors. Finland, on the other hand, they’re not like Sweden. They’re a bit more calm, and they have more control over the developments. But Sweden is not like that. They’re always using certain reasons. They’re always using certain excuses. They always talk about the constitution. And, as the reigning principle of the constitution, they value the freedom of expression. And, in return, I say terrorism has nothing to do with the freedom of expression. And the Turkish Parliament is the eventual decision-maker. Ukraine has recaptured a village close to the eastern city of Lysychansk, in a small but symbolic victory that means Russia no longer has full control of the Luhansk region, one of Vladimir Putin’s key war aims. Video footage shared on Telegram showed Ukrainian soldiers patrolling on foot down a ruined street as their counteroffensive continues to force Russian solders to flee previously occupied territories. Dmitry Medvedev, the hawkish long-term ally of Vladimir Putin, has posted to Telegram this morning suggesting that the self-proclaimed separatist regions of eastern Ukraine should hold referendums as soon as possible to join the Russian Federation. He said: “Referendums in the Donbas are essential, not only for the systematic protection of residents of the LPR, DPR and other liberated territories, but also for the restoration of historic justice.” He argues that incorporating the occupied areas of Ukraine into Russia would change the dynamic of the war, writing: “After their implementation and the acceptance of new territories into Russia, the geopolitical transformation in the world will become irreversible. Encroachment on the territory of Russia is a crime, the commission of which allows you to use all the forces of self-defence. This is why these referendums are so feared in Kyiv and the west. This is why they need to be carried out.” Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia’s security council, is referring here to concerns that should referendums be staged and produce a “yes” vote for areas like Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia joining Russia, that would in effect make any attempts to take back Ukrainian territory a direct attack on Russia itself. Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has said that all the land invaded by Russia should be returned to Ukraine, including the Crimea, which was annexed by Vladimir Putin’s forces in 2014. Overnight PBS NewsHour published a full transcript of its interview with Turkey’s president, in which he said: “If a peace is going to be established in Ukraine, of course, the returning of the land that was invaded will become really important. This is what is expected. This is what is wanted. Putin has taken certain steps. We have taken certain steps. The lands which were invaded will be returned to Ukraine.” Pressed specifically on the issue of Crimea, Erdoğan replied: “Since 2014, we have been talking to my dear friend Putin about this, and this is what we have requested from him. We asked him to return Crimea to its rightful owners … unfortunately no step has been taken forward.” Erdoğan declined to say who he thought had the upper hand in the war, saying: “As a leader, I’m not willing to consider this. All we want to do and what we want to see is to end this battle with peace, whether it be Putin, whether it be Zelenskiy, I have always requested and recommended this. This is a conflict that ended up in casualties. The people are dying, and nobody will be winning at the end of the day.” He also said he had discussed the conduct of the war directly with Putin, telling Judy Woodruff: “In Uzbekistan, I got together with President Putin, and we had very extensive discussions with him. And he is actually showing me that he’s willing to end this as soon as possible. That was my impression, because the way things are going right now are quite problematic; 200 hostages will be exchanged upon an agreement between the parties. I think a significant step will be taken forward.” During the interview he said “no invasion can be justified”, and remained diplomatic when asked if Putin had made a miscalculation by staging the invasion. Erdoğan said: “No leader in the aftermath would say that it was a mistake. Nobody will say, yes, I made a mistake. The same thing can be applied to Ukraine as well. Zelenskiy, do you think when he was moving forward, does he feel he made a mistake? The leaders, when they take a path, they will find it very difficult to go back. It’s very difficult for the leaders to go back.” The pro-Russian separatist self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) in occupied eastern Ukraine has issued its daily bulletin on Telegram. In it, the DPR claims that 12 of the settlements it occupies were fired upon by Ukrainian forces. It claims that “33 housing construction and nine civil infrastructure facilities were damaged”, and gives casualty figures of 10 civilians killed and 15 wounded. The claims have not been verified. The DPR is recognised as a legitimate authority by only three UN member states: Russia, Syria and North Korea. British prime minister Liz Truss is expected to vow to match the UK’s spending on military support to Ukraine next year at the same level as this year when she speaks at the UN general assembly. The UK has spent £2.3bn on military aid to Ukraine so far in 2022, making it one of the leading sources of finance for Ukraine’s attempt to repel the latest invasion launched by Russia on 24 February. Truss told reporters as she travelled to New York: “Ukraine’s victories in recent weeks have been inspirational. Time and time again these brave people have defied the doubters and showed what they can do when given the military, economic and political support they need. My message to the people of Ukraine is this: the UK will continue to be right behind you every step of the way. Your security is our security.” The prime minister was also critical of Russia’s actions over energy supplies and concerned over energy dependence, telling the media: “By turning off the taps of the Nord Stream gas pipeline, [Russian president Vladimir] Putin has consigned millions of people in Europe to a colder and more difficult winter. Too many lives – in Ukraine, in Europe and around the world – are being manipulated by a dependence on Russian energy. We need to work together to end this once and for all.” Truss is also expected to met Joe Biden while she is in the US, and said her “number one” focus in talks with the US president on Wednesday would be global security, especially working with the US and European partners to deal with the Russian aggression in Ukraine. Officials of the self-proclaimed separatist Luhansk People’s Republic (LPR) have informed the Russian news agency Tass that seven people were killed, including three children, in the village of Krasnorichenske, which it occupies. The claims have not been independently verified. Russia, Syria and North Korea are the only UN member states to recognise the LPR as a legitimate authority in eastern Ukraine. Hungary’s foreign minister has said the European Union should not consider new sanctions against Russia as that would only deepen the energy supply crisis and hurt Europe. “The EU should stop mentioning an eighth package of sanctions, should stop flagging measures that would only further deepen the energy supply crisis,” Reuters reports Peter Szijjarto said in his statement. Serhai Haidai, Ukraine’s governor of Luhansk, has posted a status update to Telegram. In it he points out that anyone accepting jobs with the pro-Russian separatist authorities in the Donbas are only doing so on a short-term basis because “everyone already understands that the armed forces are close”. He goes on to say that “during the past day, the airforce hit 24 areas of concentration of enemy manpower and military equipment, four positions of anti-aircraft missile systems and one ammunition depot. In addition, our air defence units destroyed a Su-25 aircraft, a guided air missile and three enemy UAVs in various directions.” The claims have not been independently verified.

Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine sentenced two employees of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to 13 years in jail on treason charges, according to Russian news agencies. Agence France-Presse reports: In April, authorities in Luhansk announced the arrest of two OSCE staffers Dmitry Shabanov and Maxim Petrov for alleged espionage. “The judges found Dmitry Shabanov guilty … and sentenced him to 13 years in prison,” the RIA Novosti news agency reported, quoting the supreme court of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic. A few hours later, the court pronounced the same sentence on Petrov. The OSCE “unequivocally” condemned the sentences as “totally unacceptable so-called ‘legal proceedings’”. OSCE secretary general Helga Maria Schmid on Monday demanded their immediate release as well as that of another unnamed colleague being held. A US defence official has told CNN that the possibility of the US providing tanks to Ukraine is “absolutely on the table”, but wouldn’t happen immediately because of issues with training, maintenance and sustainment. “We’re looking at the entirety of the Ukrainian armed forces and considering for the future what capabilities they will need and how the US and our allies will be able to support Ukraine in building out those capabilities,” said the official on a background call with reporters. In case you missed it, here is our report on Ukrainian forces recapturing a village close to the eastern city of Lysychansk, a small but symbolic victory that means Russia no longer has full control of the Luhansk region – one of Vladimir Putin’s key war aims. Urgent calls by Russian-backed authorities in the occupied regions of Luhansk and Donetsk for referendums on becoming part of Russia show that Ukraine’s counteroffensive is causing panic among proxy forces and some Kremlin decision-makers, the Institute for the Study of War has said in its latest report. The thinktank also said the counteroffensive was reducing morale in Russian units previously considered elite, with intercepted documents showing Russian soldiers making repeated pleas to be dismissed due to “persistent physical and moral fatigue”. Shattered buildings, captured Russian equipment and the grim work of examining the mass burial site near Izium – these are some of the latest images from Ukraine. A top Russian security official declared during a visit to China that the Kremlin considers beefing up ties with Beijing as a top policy goal, AP reports. Nikolai Patrushev, secretary of the national security council chaired by Russian President Vladimir Putin, described the “strengthening of comprehensive partnership and strategic cooperation with Beijing as an unconditional priority of Russia’s foreign policy”. Patrushev is one of Putin’s closest associates. Speaking during a meeting with Guo Shengkun, a top official of China’s Communist party, he said “in the current conditions, our countries must show even greater readiness for mutual support and development of cooperation.” Patrushev’s office said in a terse statement after the talks in the Chinese city of Nanping that the parties agreed to “expand information exchanges on countering extremism and foreign attempts to undermine the constitutional order of both countries in order to derail independent policies of Russia and China serving their national interests.” With the UN to hold its first in-person general debate since the start of the pandemic in New York this week, the Guardian’s world affairs editor Julian Borger and diplomatic editor Patrick Wintour have prepared this preview. The UN general assembly summit this week will be dominated by a struggle – between the US and its allies on one side and Russia on the other – for global support over the fate of Ukraine, as the global south fights to stop the conflict from overshadowing the existential threats of famine and the climate crisis. With a return to fully in-person general debate, presidents and prime ministers will be converging on New York, many of them direct from London, where the diplomacy got underway on the sidelines of the Queen’s funeral. Russia is currently in retreat on the battlefield and in the contest for global hearts and minds over Ukraine’s fate. The general assembly voted 101-7 with 19 abstentions to allow Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy to deliver a prerecorded video address, granting him an exemption from the requirement that speakers should appear in person. India, a longstanding Moscow ally which has tended to abstain in votes on Ukraine, voted in Zelenskiy’s favor. The vote was on the same day that India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, publicly scolded Vladimir Putin, telling him “today’s time is not a time for war” when they made a joint appearance at a regional Asia summit in Uzbekistan. Putin said he was aware of Indian “concerns”, echoing what he had said the day before about China. The weeklong session of United Nations general assembly meetings and leaders’ speeches begins as mass graves are being discovered after the Russian retreat from the Ukrainian town of Izium. You can read the full story here: Security fears have almost certainly led Russia’s Black Sea Fleet to relocate its Kilo-class submarines from Sevastopol in Crimea to Novorossiysk in southern Russia, the UK Ministry of Defence says in its latest intelligence briefing on the war. The move comes as Ukraine’s long-range strike capacity grows, and undermines one of Russia’s key objectives in annexing Crimea in 2014. Ukraine’s armed forces have sunk a barge carrying Russian troops and equipment across the Dnieper River near Nova Kakhovka in the Kherson region, the Kyiv Independent reports. In a statement on Facebook, Ukraine’s military said: “Attempts to build a crossing failed to withstand fire from Ukrainian forces and were halted.” After Ukraine’s recapture of the Kharkiv region, new details of the Russian takeover are emerging. Luke Harding and Isobel Koshiw travelled to Shevchenkove to speak to locals about their time under Russian occupation. Until last week, a portrait of Vladimir Putin hung on the wall of the mayor’s office in the town of Shevchenkove. There was a Russian flag. Around a cabinet table, a pro-Kremlin “leader”, Andrey Strezhko, held meetings with colleagues. There was a lot to discuss. One topic: a referendum on joining Russia. Another: a new autumn curriculum for Shevchenkove’s two schools, minus anything Ukrainian. Strezhko’s ambitious plans were never realised. On 8 September, Ukraine’s armed forces launched a surprise counteroffensive. They swiftly recaptured a swathe of territory in the north-eastern Kharkiv region, including Shevchenkove. Most residents greeted the soldiers with hugs and kisses. Strezhko disappeared. He is believed to have fled across the Russian border, along with other collaborators. You can read the full report here: Britain’s prime minister, Liz Truss, will tell world leaders this week that the UK will next year match or exceed the £2.3bn (US$2.63bn) it committed to Ukraine’s war effort against Russia in 2022, the Financial Times has reported. Truss, making her first trip overseas as PM, will address the UN general assembly on Wednesday. Speaking ahead of the trip, Truss vowed to the people of Ukraine: “The UK will continue to be right behind you every step of the way.” Ukraine’s stunningly successful counteroffensive caught many commentators off guard, after months of predictions that the war had settled into an indefinite stalemate. Orysia Lutsevych, head of Chatham House’s Ukraine Forum, asks why experts keep underestimating Ukraine, and overestimating Russia. The war in Ukraine will be the most important issue at the UN general assembly in New York this week, EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell says. “The war in Ukraine is not just a war in Ukraine,” Borrell said on Monday. “The Ukrainians are fighting, they are being bombed with missiles; and the rest of the world is being affected by the prices increase on energy, on food, by growing insecurity and high interest rates.” Among other issues, UN representatives will discuss “how to counter the Russian narrative that tries to convince people around the world that this problem is being caused by our sanctions, when in fact this is a consequence of the war itself,” he added. Welcome back to our live coverage of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. At 7.30am Kyiv time, these are the latest developments. Ukraine has recaptured a village close to the eastern city of Lysychansk, in a small but symbolic victory that means Russia no longer has full control of the Luhansk region, one of Russian president Vladimir Putin’s key war aims. Luhansk’s governor, Serhiy Haidai, said Ukraine’s armed forces were in “complete control” of Bilohorivka. “It’s a suburb of Lysychansk. Soon we will drive these scumbags out of there with a broom,” he said. “Step by step, centimetre by centimetre, we will liberate our entire land from the invaders.” Ukrainian forensic experts have so far exhumed 146 bodies, mostly of civilians, at the mass burial site near Izium in eastern Ukraine, the regional governor said on Monday. Oleh Synehubov, governor of the Kharkiv region, said the exhumed bodies included two children. The Kremlin has denied allegations that Russian forces had committed war crimes in Ukraine’s Kharkiv province. The leaders of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic were beginning to panic, Haidai claimed. There have been numerous reports of snatch squads detaining men on the street and drafting them into the army, while mobile communications and the internet have been jammed to prevent people from learning about Moscow’s military setbacks, he claimed. The leader of the Moscow-backed administration in Donbas has called for urgent referendums on the region becoming part of Russia. Denis Pushilin, head of the Moscow-based separatist administration in Donetsk, called on his fellow separatist leader in Luhansk to combine efforts toward preparing a referendum on joining Russia. “Our actions should be synchronised,” Pushilin said in a video posted to social media on Monday. The pace of Ukrainian forces’ advance the north-east had thrown Russian forces into a “panic”, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said in his nightly address. Zelenskiy said he was now focused on “speed” in liberated areas. “The speed at which our troops are moving. The speed in restoring normal life,” he said. Russian troops struck the Pivdennoukrainsk nuclear power plant in Ukraine’s southern Mykolaiv region early on Monday but its reactors have not been damaged and are working normally, Ukraine’s state nuclear company Energoatom said. A blast took place 300 metres away from the reactors and damaged power plant buildings shortly after midnight, Energoatom said in a statement. The attack also damaged a nearby hydroelectric power plant and transmission lines. Ukrainian officials say 200 Russian soldiers died in a strike on Sunday when a missile hit a former bus shelter where they were based, in the frontline city of Svatove. According to the Institute for the Study of War, Russia has failed to send reinforcements. It is now under pressure and vulnerable to a further counteroffensive, the thinktank said. Ukraine’s armed forces said troops had crossed the Oskil River over the weekend, marking another important milestone for the counteroffensive in the north-eastern Kharkiv region. The river flows south into the Siversky Donets, which snakes through the Donbas, the main focus of Russia’s invasion. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine may cause long-term grain prices to rise by 7% and drive up greenhouse gas emissions if production in other parts of the world expand to meet any shortfalls, a study published in Nature Food found. Russia and Ukraine together export about 28% of the world’s wheat supply. A court in rebel-held Luhansk has sentenced two employees of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to 13 years in prison on treason charges. OSCE chairman Zbigniew Rau condemned the “unjustifiable” detention of the mission’s members since the outbreak of the war, calling it “nothing but pure political theatre … inhumane and repugnant”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2020/mar/17/centrica-replaces-chairman-ousts-outgoing-ceo-british-gas","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2020-03-17T13:23:12Z","webTitle":"Centrica replaces chairman and ousts outgoing CEO","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/17/centrica-replaces-chairman-ousts-outgoing-ceo-british-gas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2020/mar/17/centrica-replaces-chairman-ousts-outgoing-ceo-british-gas","fields":{"headline":"Centrica replaces chairman and ousts outgoing CEO","bodyText":"The owner of British Gas has replaced its chairman and ousted its outgoing chief executive with immediate effect amid deepening financial woes. Centrica has appointed its chief financial officer, Chris O’Shea, as the interim chief executive while its new chairman, Scott Wheway, hunts for a permanent replacement. Wheway replaces Charles Berry, who is stepping down from the board after taking medical leave last month. Centrica’s outgoing chief, Iain Conn, had expected to remain in his role until a permanent replacement was found. He agreed to leave the company last summer as it swung to a loss for the first half of 2019 and slashed shareholder payouts. The decision to hasten his exit comes weeks after Conn revealed a £1bn loss for the full financial year, and the lowest ever revenues from the British Gas business. It marks the end of a difficult five-year tenure for Conn in which the supplier struggled against rising competition in the energy market and a government cap on prices. The new leadership team is expected to face a difficult financial situation after the collapse of global oil prices and ongoing market gloom caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Those challenges have already pushed the market value of the biggest UK energy supplier to its lowest levels since Centrica was formed in 1997. Wheway said: “I’m acutely aware that I’m taking this role at a time when we need to navigate our way through the current volatility caused by the impact of coronavirus. Protecting our employees and customers is a priority for us, particularly those who are vulnerable.” He said Centrica would remain focused on “structural simplification”, improving its efficiency and growing its customer-facing businesses. “I will immediately be concentrating on completing the search for a CEO for Centrica, which includes both internal and external candidates,” he said. Centrica was forced to write off £476m against its North Sea oil and gas business, Spirit Energy, last year after oil prices fell to an average of $64.36 (£53.17) a barrel from an average of $71.34 a barrel in 2018. In recent weeks oil prices have plunged, and remained at a four-year low of just below $30 a barrel on Tuesday. The drop threatens to derail Centrica’s plans to sell the North Sea business as part of its financial turnaround plan. The company had expected to receive bids for its 69% stake in Spirit Energy by the end of this month, but an industry source said it would not be possible to determine its value during the current market volatility and the bidding “would most likely be delayed”. Centrica is also in talks with a consortium of investors to sell its stake in the UK’s nuclear power reactors, a process which could also be delayed by the macroeconomic impact of Covid-19 and ongoing technical trouble at two of the reactors. The share price of the FTSE 100 energy firm – which is supported by an army of small shareholders – has tumbled to below 40p, the lowest price in more than 20 years and around one tenth of its value in 2013. Around 1.5 million individuals bought shares in British Gas for 135p when it was first privatised in the late 1980s after the “Tell Sid” campaign. About 600,000 individuals continue to hold shares in Centrica, which became the supplier’s parent company a decade later. The company has been considered a takeover target by industry analysts for years because of the steady decline of its share price, and its latest financial woes have reignited concerns over its long-term future. Wheway also thanked Conn for his “continued commitment and resilience in the face of unprecedented challenges during his tenure as CEO … The board wishes Iain well and thanks him for his contribution.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/mar/02/ukraine-news-russia-war-kyiv-kharkiv-russian-invasion-vladimir-putin-joe-biden-latest-live-updates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-03T05:00:08Z","webTitle":"ICC begins collecting evidence of war crimes; more talks to begin – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/mar/02/ukraine-news-russia-war-kyiv-kharkiv-russian-invasion-vladimir-putin-joe-biden-latest-live-updates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/mar/02/ukraine-news-russia-war-kyiv-kharkiv-russian-invasion-vladimir-putin-joe-biden-latest-live-updates","fields":{"headline":"ICC begins collecting evidence of war crimes; more talks to begin – as it happened","bodyText":"This blog is closing now but you can keep on top of developments at our new blog here: Russia’s central bank has imposed a 30% commission on foreign currency purchases by individuals on currency exchanges, brokers told Reuters, citing a letter from the regulator. The central bank did not immediately reply to the news agency to a request for comment. Heartbreaking images have emerged of Ukrainians fleeing their country en route to Poland. More than one million people have fled Ukraine since Russian forces invaded the country last week, the head of the United Nations refugee agency has said. Many have made the journey by bus. Here is a quick re-cap of what we know on day eight of the Russia-Ukraine war: The international criminal court (ICC) has confirmed it is opening an investigation into possible war crimes in Ukraine and begun collecting evidence. The ICC process was sped up after 38 countries formally referred reports of atrocities to it, the largest referral the court has ever received. Russia has claimed to have captured the strategically important southern city of Kherson on the Black Sea. US intelligence and Ukrainian officials have disputed the claim. In a Facebook post, Kherson’s mayor, Igor Kolykhaiev, said “there were armed visitors in the city council”. and Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said:“We’re not in a position to call it either way. It appears to us that the Ukrainians are certainly fighting over that town.” The strategically important Sea of Azov port city of Mariupol is reportedly surrounded by Russian troops. “We cannot even take the wounded from the streets, from apartments, since the shelling does not stop,” its mayor said. The Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, has come under more heavy shelling as Russian forces step up their offensive and move forces closer towards the capital in an apparent attempt to encircle it. Police in Moscow detained two women and five children holding a poster outside the Ukraine embassy that said “No to war”. Police allegedly threatened to strip the women of custody of the children. In St Petersburg, Yelena Osipova, an activist said to have survived the infamous wartime siege of Leningrad was detained for protesting against the war. Russian paratroopers landed in Ukraine’s second city, Kharkiv, following several days of bombardment that has killed or wounded dozens of civilians. Four more people died on Wednesday, local authorities said, adding the city was still under their control. More than 350 Ukrainian civilians have been killed and more than 2,000 injured, according to Ukraine’s emergency service. Hundreds of structures including transport facilities, hospitals, kindergartens and homes have been destroyed, it said. Ukraine claimed nearly 7,000 Russian troops had been killed in the first six days of Moscow’s invasion. Russia’s defence ministry said 498 Russian soldiers had died in Ukraine since the start of its campaign, its first statement on casualties. The UN general assembly voted overwhelmingly to deplore Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and called for the immediate withdrawal of its forces. On Wednesday, 141 of the 193 member states voted for the resolution, 35 abstained and five – Russia, Belarus, Syria, North Korea and Eritrea – voted against. A second round of talks is reportedly to get under way on Thursday. A Russian negotiator said a ceasefire was on the agenda, but Ukraine has said Moscow’s demands are unacceptable and Russia must stop bombing Ukrainian cities before any progress can be expected. Police in Poland warned that fake reports of violent crimes being committed by people fleeing Ukraine are circulating on social media after Polish nationalists attacked and abused groups of African, south Asian and Middle Eastern people who had crossed the border. The Russian Federal Security Service leaked information that alerted Ukraine to an assassination plot against president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, according to the cyber-hacking collective Anonymous. In a recently published tweet, the group said: Russian FSB leaked information alerted Ukraine to assassination plot against President @ZelenskyyUa. Now, we can expect an internal power struggle within the Kremlin to overthrow the Putin regime. In the meantime, let’s continue with the attacks,” the tweet read. Anonymous also claimed responsibility for taking down the Russian Space Agency website for a second time. The United States has accused Russia of launching a “full war on media freedom and the truth” by blocking independent news outlets and preventing Russians from hearing news of the invasion of Ukraine. The US State Department said in a statement as reported by Reuters: Russia’s government is also throttling Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram platforms that tens of millions of Russia’s citizens rely on to access independent information and opinions.” Russians also used social media to connect to each other and the outside world, it added. The agency called on Putin and the Russian government to immediately “cease this bloodshed” and withdraw troops from Ukraine. Ukrainian authorities are assuring citizens that any Russian military equipment they seize won’t need to be declared for tax purposes. “Have you captured a Russian tank or armoured personnel carrier and are worried about how to declare it? Keep calm and continue to defend the motherland!” Ukraine’s National Agency for the Protection against Corruption (NAPC) said, according to the Ukraine arm of the Interfax news service. The agency went on to explain there was “no need to declare the captured Russian tanks and other equipment, because the cost of this ... does not exceed 100 living wages (UAH248,100) ($8,298).” Australian police are investigating a suspicious package that was delivered to the Russian embassy in Canberra. Police and Hazmat crews were called to the embassy just after 10am on Thursday and cordoned off the area around the embassy. The ABC has reported that someone sent white powder in an envelope to the Russian embassy. In a statement ACT policing said: About 10.05am this morning, ACT Policing and ACT emergency services were called to a suspicious package incident at the Russian Embassy in Griffith. The contents of the package are currently being assessed. A cordon is in place and the public is urged to avoid the area until further notice. The embassy had been site of protests in recent days, following Russia’s decision to invade Ukraine last week. Volodymyr Ksienich, 22, has returned to Ukraine to join the defence of Kyiv. He tells the Guardian’s Michael Safi how his life changed forever after last week’s Russian invasion Ksienich decided to leave his job working for an NGO in Warsaw to return to his Ukrainian homeland in its hour of crisis. He describes how he and his father joined a territorial support unit in Kyiv where he has been learning to operate an automatic rifle, spending nights in the woods preparing to repel a Russian attack. He says he has no ill will towards ordinary Russians but that he will not shirk from his duty if he is forced to defend himself. And he is calling on Europe to maintain the pressure on Vladimir Putin. Listen to this fascinating report below. The US Treasury Secretary added that sanctions imposed last Sunday and Monday have so far restricted 80% of the Russian banking sector’s assets and “immobilised” about half of the Russian central bank’s assets, according to remarks cited by Reuters news agency. The rouble, which has lost about a third of its value since the start of the year, touched a fresh record low of 110 to the dollar in Moscow on Wednesday. The former chair of the US Federal Reserve said she knew there were concerns about members of Russia’s elite using cryptocurrencies as a possible means to evade sanctions, but noted there were anti-money laundering laws in place to prevent that from happening. The Treasury will continue to “go after oligarchs or Russian elites who are key to President Putin’s corrupt power,” she said. Washington is preparing a sanctions package targeting more Russian oligarchs as well as their companies and assets, two sources familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. The United States will address potential gaps in tough sanctions imposed on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Wednesday, adding the measures would “continue to bite.” Yellen said financial sanctions on the Russian central bank, commercial banks and members of the country’s wealthy elite were having a significant impact, as demonstrated by the rouble’s sharp fall, Reuters reports. After visiting Chicago’s Ukrainian Village neighbourhood, Yellen spoke at the University of Illinois-Chicago: Russia is increasingly an economic island. We will continue to look at how the sanctions work and whether there are leakages and we have the possibility to address them.” Asked whether sanctions to curb Russia’s oil and gas exports could follow, she said “nothing is off the table,” but added that the United States had not taken this step to spare Americans, Europeans and other people around the world from “punishing consequences.” Russian troops are in the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson after forcing their way into the council building, the mayor said in an update late last night. According to the New York Times, the city northwest of the Crimean peninsula, has been captured by Russians. The city’s mayor, and US intelligence have contested that it has fully been overtaken. In a Facebook post written about 10pm on Wednesday, Kherson’s mayor, Igor Kolykhaiev, said: There were armed visitors in the city council today. My team and I are peaceful people, we had no weapons or aggression on our side. We don’t have Ukrainian Armed Forces in the city, only civilians and people who want to LIVE here! The developments follow a day of conflicting claims over whether Moscow had made its first major gain by taking over a significant Ukrainian city. Kolykhaiev indicated he negotiated with the invading troops. I made no promises to them. I just have nothing to promise. I am only interested in the normal life of our city! I just asked not to shoot people. Other restrictions imposed on the city include aa curfew from 8pm until 6am with cars transporting food, medicines and other necessities permitted to enter the city. Public transport is set to restart soon and pedestrians are being told to “walk one by one, maximum two’. “The military will not be provoked. Stop at the first demand. They do not conflict,” Kolykhaiev said. We have shown that we are working to secure the city and are trying to eliminate the consequences of the invasion. So far this is how it is. Ukrainian flag above us. And to keep it the same, these requirements must be met.” Earlier, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said: “We’re not in a position to call it either way. It appears to us that the Ukrainians are certainly fighting over that town.” A British pub landlord has arrived in Ukraine with a minibus of aid after a 1,000-mile (1,600km) journey from the UK, the BBC reports. Tom Littledyke, a former Royal Marine, set off from Dorset in south-west England on Monday before dropping supplies in Poland and then driving over the border to Lviv in western Ukraine. He is now using his 16-seater minibus to ferry people from the city’s train station back to the Polish border. Japan will accept Ukrainian refugees forced to flee their homes by the Russian invasion, the prime minister, Fumio Kishida, has said. The move is being seen as a break with Japan’s reluctance to accept refugees and asylum seekers - it approves just a few dozen applications a year - with Kishida describing the offer as a “demonstration of solidarity with the Ukrainian people at such a crucial moment”. It is not clear how many Ukrainians would consider taking refuge in Japan or how long they would be permitted to stay. Kishida, speaking to reporters after a call with the Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said those with relatives or friends in Japan would be given priority. “But we will not stop there and will respond [to other applications] from a humanitarian perspective,” he said. “The Ukrainian situation is tense, and refugees are growing in large numbers. We will make preparations to cope with this situation as soon as possible.” Ukrainian refugees would not be counted among the 5,000 people, including returning citizens, permitted to enter Japan daily under its Covid-19 border restrictions. In 2020, Japan accepted just 47 refugees and 44 people on humanitarian grounds out of nearly 4,000 applicants. Rights groups have long accused Tokyo of doing too little to help those fleeing conflict. Seven military personnel died after their helicopter crashed in eastern Romania near the Black Sea while searching for a missing fighter jet and its pilot, according to Ukraine’s ministry of defence. The IAR 330-Puma helicopter crashed in the area of Gura Dobrogei, 11km (7 miles) from the airfield on Wednesday, killing all seven people aboard, Agence France-Presse reports. It was searching for a MiG 21 LanceR, shortly after the fighter jet lost radio contact with the control tower during an air patrol mission and disappeared from the radar. “Search and rescue operations for the pilot of the MiG 21 LanceR aircraft are still ongoing,” a statement from the defence ministry said. Authorities are still investigating the cause of the helicopter crash. The helicopter pilot had reported adverse weather conditions and had been ordered to return to base, according to the ministry. “It is premature to discuss possible causes. Certainly, there were unfavourable weather conditions, but we can’t comment now,” spokesman General Constantin Spanu said on local television. “We have two commissions of inquiry set up. Our focus is on the search and rescue operation.” More than one million people have fled Ukraine since Russian forces invaded the country last week, the head of the United Nations refugee agency has said. Filippo Grandi said in a post over Twitter on Thursday: In just seven days we have witnessed the exodus of one million refugees from Ukraine to neighbouring countries. For many millions more, inside Ukraine, it’s time for guns to fall silent, so that life-saving humanitarian assistance can be provided.” Four Russian fighter jets briefly entered Swedish territory over the Baltic Sea on Wednesday, the Swedish Armed Forces said, sparking a swift condemnation from Sweden’s defence minister. Sweden’s Armed Forces said in a statement: On 2 March, four Russian fighter aircraft violated Swedish airspace. The Swedish air force conducted an operation with JAS 39 Gripen aircraft of the rapid readiness unit, which documented and photographed the incident. Two Russian SU27 and two SU24 fighter jets briefly entered Swedish airspace east of the Swedish island of Gotland in the Baltic Sea, the military said. Air Force Commander Edström said: With the current situation as backdrop, we take this incident very seriously. Russia’s conduct is unprofessional and irresponsible.” The flight was also picked up on FlightRadar, according to a live flight tracking update. US secretary of defence Lloyd Austin has warned against any rhetoric about the employment of nuclear weapons. In an interview with NBC on Wednesday, Austin was asked if he has seen any actions backing up President Vladimir Putin’s recent statements regarding Russia’s nuclear weapons. Any rhetoric about the employment of nuclear weapons is dangerous, and I think we should avoid that if at all possible. It creates the climate, it creates the conditions for gross miscalculations, and we don’t want to see that happen. Putin placed his strategic forces, including nuclear weapons, on a heightened state of alert over the weekend. Explosions are being reported in Kyiv in the early hours of Thursday following Russian airstrikes. At least four explosions were reported in Ukraine’s capital city around 3am on Thursday. Ukraine’s state special communications service also issued an alarm just before 3am, writing: “Air alarm, Kyiv!” Two blasts reportedly went off in the city centre, followed by two more near a metro station. Air raid sirens have been heard wailing. In an update posted to his Facebook page late last night, city mayor Vitali Klitschko thanked his citizens for their endurance and reminded people to stay at home or in shelters. “In the city, in some areas in the yards, several shells got in,” Klitschko said, adding some people were injured in the blasts as cars caught fire. “Fighting took place next to Kyiv - Bucha, Irpin, Gostomel. The enemy is trying to break into the capital,” he added. The Biden administration is considering ways to reduce US consumption of Russian oil to punish Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine, White House Deputy National Security Adviser Daleep Singh said during an interview with CNN on Wednesday. “We are looking at ways to cut US consumption of Russian oil while still maintaining the global supply of energy,” Singh said. Ukrainians working at western tech companies are banding together to help their besieged homeland, aiming to knock down disinformation websites, encourage Russians to turn against their government and speed delivery of medical supplies, Reuters reports. They are seeking, through email campaigns and online petitions, to persuade firms such as internet security company Cloudflare Inc, Alphabet Inc’s Google and Amazon.com Inc to do more to counter Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “Companies should try to isolate Russia as much as possible, as soon as possible,” said Olexiy Oryeshko, a staff software engineer at Google and a Ukrainian American. “Sanctions are not enough.” He was one of nine tech activists interviewed by Reuters who are of Ukrainian heritage or are Ukrainian immigrants and are responding to a call by Kyiv to form a volunteer “IT army”. Many companies have severed Russian ties due to new government trade curbs, but the activists are demanding more. They are appealing to cybersecurity companies in particular, asking them to drop Russian clients, especially publishers of what they say is disinformation. If that happens, the publishers would be more vulnerable to online attacks. Footage has emerged on social media showing a group of children detained by Moscow police after demonstrating against the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In a video posted to Facebook by Alexandra Arkhipova, a young girl is seen in tears holding a woman’s hand from behind bars. Thousands of people in cities across Russia have been defying police threats and staging protests against the invasion of Ukraine. Watch the video below. More information has come to light regarding reports from senior Chinese officials who allegedly spoke with Russian officials regarding a Ukraine invasion. Senior Chinese officials told senior Russian officials in early February not to invade Ukraine before the end of the Winter Olympics in Beijing, the New York Times reported, quoting Biden administration officials and a European official who cited a western intelligence report. The New York Times said the intelligence report indicated senior Chinese officials had some level of knowledge about Russia’s plans or intentions to invade Ukraine before Moscow launched the operation last week. A source familiar with the matter confirmed to Reuters that China had made the request but declined to provide details. The source declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter. “The claims mentioned in the relevant reports are speculations without any basis, and are intended to blame-shift and smear China,” said Liu Pengyu, a spokesman for the Chinese embassy in Washington. Russian police have also reportedly detained a well-known survivor of the Siege of Leningrad, Yelena Osipova, at an anti-war protest in St Petersburg. Video of Osipova’s arrest, which has so far been viewed more than 3.7million times, shows two officers removing the 77-year-old artist and activist from the crowd as hundreds of others condemn the officers. Thousands of people in cities across Russia have been defying police threats and staging protests against the invasion of Ukraine. Authorities have a low tolerance for demonstrations and marches, and attending them can have serious consequences including fines, arrests and even imprisonment Police in Moscow detained two women and five children who wanted to lay flowers at the Ukrainian embassy. Photographs of their detention showed the children holding a poster saying “No to War.” The children, aged 7 to 11, were held with their mothers in a police van before being taken to a police station. They were released hours later, according to anthropologist Alexandra Arkhipova. Arkhipova said that the two women detained were Ekaterina Zavizion and Olga Alter along with Liza, 11, Gosha, 11, Matvey, 9, David, 7, and Sofya, 7. The anthropologist, who works at the Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration, wrote on Facebook: “None of what’s happened is holding up in my head.” Russia has been turfed out of the indexes used by many fund managers to decide where to invest after provider MSCI declared the country “uninvestable”. The decision is likely to result in the wholesale dumping of Russian shares by western investors. Many have already pledged to sell out of Russia following the invasion of Ukraine, but the process has been made more difficult because the Moscow stock exchange has been closed all week. In a statement, MSCI said the decision followed consultation with institutional investors and will take effect from next Wednesday. During the consultation, MSCI received feedback from a large number of global market participants, including asset owners, asset managers, broker dealers, and exchanges with an overwhelming majority confirming that the Russian equity market is currently uninvestable and that Russian securities should be removed from the MSCI Emerging Markets Indexes. Consultation participants highlighted several recent negative developments that led to a material deterioration in the accessibility of the Russian equity market to international institutional investors, to such an extent that it does not meet the Market Accessibility requirements for Emerging Markets classification as per the MSCI Market Classification Framework.” MSCI said it would maintain a standalone index of the Russian market. Netflix has paused all future Russian projects and acquisitions as a result of the ongoing invasion of Ukraine. According to Variety, the streamer is “assessing the impact of current events”, which has led to four Russian original series being indefinitely paused. Zato, a crime series set after the fall of the Soviet Union, directed by the Belarus-born director Darya Zhuk, was already in production but has now been put on hold. Netflix also has another three series in the pipeline in Russia, including Anna K, based on Anna Karenina. The service launched in the country just over a year ago and is believed to have about 1 million subscribers. Earlier this week, the company confirmed it would refuse to broadcast Russian state propaganda, in the face of a law that just came into effect. It requires streaming services with more than 100,000 daily users to carry 20 major Russian federal television channels, many of which broadcast Kremlin propaganda. Hello I’m Samantha Lock back with you as we unpack all the latest developments in Putin’s war against Ukraine. French president Emmanuel Macron has delivered a message to the Russian people in Russian. Today we stand side by side with all Russians who do not want this unworthy war to be waged on their behalf, courageously defend peace in the spirit of responsibility, and declare this both in Russia and abroad. I applaud the courage of the Ukrainian people who are resisting under fire. On behalf of the French, I address to President Zelenskiy the fraternal support of France. He is now the face of honour, freedom and courage.” It is 1:30 am in Ukraine. Here’s where we stand right now: The Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, has come under more heavy shelling as Russian forces step up their offensive and move forces closer towards the capital in an apparent attempt to encircle it. Russian paratroopers landed in Ukraine’s second city, Kharkiv, following several days of bombardment that has killed or wounded dozens of civilians. Four more people died on Wednesday, local authorities said, adding the city was still under their control. Russia has claimed to have captured the strategically important southern city of Kherson on the Black Sea. US intelligence and Ukrainian officials have provided alightly different explanations of what would be the first large city that Russian forces have overtaken. The strategically important Sea of Azov port city of Mariupol is also reportedly surrounded by Russian troops. “We cannot even take the wounded from the streets, from apartments, since the shelling does not stop,” its mayor said. More than 350 Ukrainian civilians have been killed and more than 2,000 injured, according to Ukraine’s emergency service. Hundreds of structures including transport facilities, hospitals, kindergartens and homes have been destroyed, it said. Ukraine claimed nearly 7,000 Russian troops had been killed in the first six days of Moscow’s invasion and the Kremlin would not take his country with bombs and airstrikes. Russia’s defence ministry said 498 Russian soldiers had died in Ukraine since the start of its campaign, its first statement on casualties. The UN general assembly voted overwhelmingly to deplore Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and called for the immediate withdrawal of its forces. 141 of the 193 member states voted for the resolution, 35 abstained and five – Russia, Belarus, Syria, North Korea and Eritrea – voted against. A second round of talks is reportedly to get under way on Thursday.

Police in Poland warned that fake reports of violent crimes being committed by people fleeing Ukraine are circulating on social media after Polish nationalists attacked and abused groups of African, south Asian and Middle Eastern people who had crossed the border last night. The International Criminal Court (ICC) has confirmed that it is opening an investigation into the situation in Ukraine. This, after 39 countries have formally referred reports of atrocities committed in Ukraine to the ICC. For any tips and feedback please contact me through Twitter or at samantha.lock@theguardian.com Yelena Osipova, a 77-year-old artist and activist, was marched away by a group of police while she protested against the war in Ukraine in St Petersburg. Thousands of people in cities across Russia have been defying police threats and staging protests against the invasion of Ukraine. Authorities have a low tolerance for demonstrations and marches, and attending them can have serious consequences including fines, arrests and even imprisonment We’re continuing to follow developments in Kherson. According to the New York Times, the city northwest of the Crimean peninsula, has been captured by Russians. The city’s mayor, and US intelligence have contested that it has fully been overtaken. In a Facebook post, Kherson’s mayor said that “there were armed visitors in the city council”. “I made no promises to them. i just have nothing to promise. I am only interested in the normal life of our city! I just asked not to shoot people,” he said. Most recently, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said:“We’re not in a position to call it either way. It appears to us that the Ukrainians are certainly fighting over that town.” The International Criminal Court has confirmed that it is opening an investigation into the situation in Ukraine. In a statement, ICC Prosecutor, Karim AA Khan QC writes: On 28 February, I announced my decision to seek authorisation to open an investigation into the Situation in Ukraine, on the basis of my Office’s earlier conclusions arising from its preliminary examination, and encompassing any new alleged crimes falling within the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court (“ICC” or “the Court”). In the same statement, I indicated that active investigations by my Office would be significantly expedited if a State Party to the Rome Statute (the “Statute”) were to refer the situation to my Office, as provided in article 14 of the Statute... I have notified the ICC Presidency a few moments ago of my decision to immediately proceed with active investigations in the Situation. Our work in the collection of evidence has now commenced. In total, 39 ICC states have referred atrocities for investigation. The US has delivered hundreds of stinger missiles to Ukraine as part of the $350m aid package the Biden administration announced last week, according to NBC News. Congressional officials told NBC that the US had delivered more than 200 of the missiles on Monday: The package also includes Javelin anti-tank missiles and ammunition, both of which the Ukrainian government has said they need to fight off advancing Russian military. Stinger missiles can be used to shoot down aircraft. During the Cold War, the U.S. government secretly supplied Afghan resistance fighters with stingers to shoot down Russian helicopters over Afghanistan. Germany announced last weekend that they are sending 500 stinger missiles to Ukraine, as well. Earlier, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, announced more sanctions on Russia, this time targeting the defence industry as well as widening restrictions on hi-tech exports to Belarus. “In total, 22 Russian defense-related entities will be designated, including companies that make combat aircraft, infantry fighting vehicles, missiles, unmanned aerial vehicles, electronic warfare systems - the very systems now being used to assault the Ukrainian people, abuse human rights, violate international humanitarian law,” said Blinken. “We’re also imposing export controls on Belarus to hold the Lukashenko regime accountable for being a co-belligerent in President Putin’s war of choice. We will choke off Belarus’s ability to import key technologies,” added Blinken. John Kirby, the Pentagon spokesman, has been talking to reporters about the US decision to put off a test launch of a Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile. “We did not take this decision lightly, but instead to demonstrate that we are a responsible nuclear power,” Kirby said. “We’d certainly like to see Moscow reciprocate by taking the temperature down on rhetoric about nuclear posture.” Kirby also confirmed that US and allied weapons are continuing to be delivered to the Ukrainians. “Security assistance continues to flow, not just from the United States but from many of our allies and partners, and as recently as even just the last 24 hours,” Kirby said. “We are making every effort to get as much security assistance as we can to the Ukrainians, as fast as we can.” On the stalling of the vast Russian military column that was heading towards Kyiv, Kirby offered three explanations, that the Russians are regrouping and reassessing their tactics, they are having logistics and supply difficulties and thirdly, Ukrainian resistance. The prized, 512-foot yacht of Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov has been seized by German officials today following sanctions imposed by the EU, reported Forbes’ Giacomo Tognini: Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov was sanctioned by the European Union on Monday. Two days later, Forbes has learned from three sources in the yacht industry that one of his prized possessions—the 512-foot yacht Dilbar, valued at nearly $600 million—has been seized by German authorities in the northern city of Hamburg. The ship has been in the Hamburg shipyards of German shipbuilding firm Blohm+Voss since late October for a refitting job. Sources who spoke to Forbes said that the German government froze the asset and that, likely as a result, Blohm+Voss employees who had been working on the yacht didn’t show up to work on Wednesday. Representatives for Blohm+Voss and Usmanov didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Usmanov purchased Dilbar in 2016 for a reported cost of $600 million from German shipbuilder Lürssen, which custom-built it for him over 52 months. The firm calls it “one of the most complex and challenging yachts ever built, in terms of both dimensions and technology.” At 15,917 tons, it’s the world’s largest motor yacht by gross tonnage, and is typically manned by a crew of 96 people. Dilbar boasts the largest swimming pool ever installed on a yacht as well as two helicopter pads, a sauna, a beauty salon, and a gym. Its plush interiors have more than 1,000 sofa cushions and it can host up to 24 people in 12 suites. Read the full article here (paywall). The United Nations human rights office confirmed today that 227 civilians have been killed and 525 injured in Ukraine from the start of the conflict through midnight 1 March, but believes the true toll is “considerably higher”, reported Reuters: “Most of these casualties were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and air strikes,” it said in a statement issued in Geneva a week after Russia’s invasion began. The U.N. human rights office said it believed that the true toll is “considerably higher”, especially in government-controlled territory in the last days, due to reporting delays in some areas where intensive hostilities have taken place. The UK and 37 other countries have formally referred reports of atrocities committed in Ukraine to the International Criminal Court (ICC). Under ICC rules, such a referral from member states means that the prosecutor does not have to get the approval of ICC judges before opening an investigation, speeding up the process. With 37 countries joining the UK, it is the largest referral in the history of the ICC. “Putin’s military machine is targeting civilians indiscriminately and tearing through towns across Ukraine,” said Britain’s foreign secretary Liz Truss in statement. “An investigation by the International Criminal Court into Russia’s barbaric acts is urgently needed and it is right that those responsible are held to account. The UK will work closely with allies to ensure justice is done.” UPDATE: The ICC prosecutor Karim Khan has actively begun an investigation into the war in Ukraine after a referral from the UK and allies. In a statement, he said: “I have notified the ICC presidency a few moments ago of my decision to immediately proceed with active investigations in the situation. Our work in the collection of evidence has now commenced.” The Russian Federation Council is set to hold an unscheduled meeting on Friday, leading to widespread speculation in Moscow that the country might impose martial law. The introduction of martial law would give the authorities sweeping powers to limit freedom of movement and freedom of speech. Martial law has been introduced in modern Russia. Tatyana Stanovaya, a prominent Russian political analyst and founder of R.Politik on Wednesday evening tweeted that introducing a martial law would be a “logical scenario.” “The proclamation of martial law will allow the authorities to introduce military censorship, to increase the secrecy of the state’s activities and the actions of local bodies.” With the introduction of martial law, the powers of elected bodies, local authorities and officials are automatically extended. The last time an unscheduled meeting of the Federation Council was called, the body approved President Vladimir Putin permission to use military force outside the country, two days prior to the country’s invasion of Ukraine on February 24th. The Federation Council said it will officially discuss on Friday a package of anti-crisis measures in response to Western sanctions. Over 6,500 Russians have so far been detained across Russia during anti-war protests, according to the independent monitoring site OVD-Info. Russia has also seen a widespread crackdown on its independent media since the start of the war. Yesterday, Russia’s prosecutor general ordered the country’s media watchdog to block the liberal Ekho Moskvy radio station and the last remaining opposition television channel Dozhd TV. The Duma is also set to meet on Friday to discuss a new law that would punish “spreading disinformation about the armed forces of the Russian Federation in any military conflicts” with up to 15 years in prison. China asked Russia not to invade Ukraine until after the 2022 winter olympics had concluded, revealing that Chinese officials had some knowledge of Putin’s plans for an invasion of Ukraine, reported the New York Times’s Edward Wong and Julian E. Barnes: A Western intelligence report said senior Chinese officials told senior Russian officials in early February not to invade Ukraine before the end of the Winter Olympics in Beijing, according to senior Biden administration officials and a European official. The report indicates that senior Chinese officials had some level of knowledge about Russia’s war plans or intentions before the invasion started last week. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia met with President Xi Jinping of China in Beijing on Feb. 4 before the opening ceremony of the Olympics. Moscow and Beijing issued a 5,000-word statement at the time declaring that their partnership had “no limits,” denouncing NATO enlargement and asserting that they would establish a new global order with true “democracy.” The intelligence on the exchange between the Chinese and Russian officials was classified. It was collected by a Western intelligence service and considered credible by officials reviewing it. Senior officials in the United States and allied governments passed it around as they discussed when Mr. Putin might attack Ukraine. However, different intelligence services had varying interpretations, and it is not clear how widely the information was shared. Read the full article here (paywall). Russia’s foreign ministry today denied reports that an American ambassador was expelled, reported Reuters. Moscow officials said they are currently working on a response following the US’ decision to remove 12 Russian diplomats at the United Nations mission, said RIA news, Reuters further reported. US officials previously said that the Russian diplomats “abused their privileges” by engaging in espionage that was harmful to national security, calling the expelled diplomats “intelligence operatives.” Here’s more context on an airstrike reported near Kyiv’s rail station today, from Reuters: A Russian air strike hit near Kyiv’s southern rail station on Wednesday where thousands of women and children are being evacuated, Ukraine’s state-run railway company Ukrzaliznytsya said in a statement. The station building suffered minor damage and the number of any casualties was not yet known, it said, adding trains were still operating. More on blasts heard in Kyiv: In an online post, interior ministry adviser Anton Herashchenko said that a large heating supply service may have been destroyed in a rocket strike near Kyiv’s rail station, possibly leaving parts of Kyiv without heat during freezing temperatures. Here’s video posted to social media of possible damage to the central heating supply: An update on meetings between the Ukrainian and Russian delegations: according to Ukraine president Zelenskiy’s office, Ukrainian delegates are currently on their way to a meeting with Russian delegates in Belovezhskaya Pushcha. A powerful explosion was heard near the central rail station of Kyiv today, said Ukraine’s interior ministry adviser Anton Herashchenko in an online post, reported Reuters. A Reuters witness in Kyiv also reported hearing the blast, noting that the explosion made the ground shake. From foreign correspondent Sara Firth: It is 9:07 pm in Ukraine. Here’s where we stand right now: The Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, has come under more heavy shelling as Russian forces step up their offensive and move forces closer towards the capital in an apparent attempt to encircle it. Russian paratroopers landed in Ukraine’s second city, Kharkiv, following several days of bombardment that has killed or wounded dozens of civilians. Four more people died on Wednesday, local authorities said, adding the city was still under their control. Authorities in the strategically important southern city of Kherson on the Black Sea have denied Russia’s claims that its forces have captured what would be their first large city of the invasion, saying only the port and train station have fallen. The strategically important Sea of Azov port city of Mariupol is also reportedly surrounded by Russian troops. “We cannot even take the wounded from the streets, from apartments, since the shelling does not stop,” its mayor said. More than 350 Ukrainian civilians have been killed and more than 2,000 injured, according to Ukraine’s emergency service. Hundreds of structures including transport facilities, hospitals, kindergartens and homes have been destroyed, it said. Ukraine claimed nearly 7,000 Russian troops had been killed in the first six days of Moscow’s invasion and the Kremlin would not take his country with bombs and airstrikes. Russia’s defence ministry said 498 Russian soldiers had died in Ukraine since the start of its campaign, its first statement on casualties. The UN general assembly voted overwhelmingly to deplore Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and called for the immediate withdrawal of its forces. 141 of the 193 member states voted for the resolution, 35 abstained and five – Russia, Belarus, Syria, North Korea and Eritrea – voted against. A second round of talks is reportedly to get under way on Thursday. A Russian negotiator said a ceasefire is on the agenda, but Ukraine has said Moscow’s demands are unacceptable and Russia must stop bombing Ukrainian cities before any progress can be expected. Police in Poland warned that fake reports of violent crimes being committed by people fleeing Ukraine are circulating on social media after Polish nationalists attacked and abused groups of African, south Asian and Middle Eastern people who had crossed the border last night. That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, for today as I hand over the blog to my colleague Gloria Oladipo who will continue to bring you all the developments on the crisis in Ukraine. Britain’s media watchdog Ofcom has launched a further 12 investigations into the news broadcaster RT and said it is considering whether the Russian-backed television channel should retain its licence. Ofcom’s latest decision brings the total number of probes into the “due impartiality” of programmes on the Russian state-controlled network to 27. The regulator said: We are very concerned by the volume of programmes on RT that are raising potential issues under the Broadcasting Code, and as we progress our investigations we are considering whether RT should retain a UK licence. Roman Abramovich has confirmed he has put Chelsea up for sale and has written off the £1.5bn of loans he has made to the club, Jacob Steinberg reports. The billionaires Hansjörg Wyss and Todd Boehly are part of a consortium trying to buy the Premier League team. Sources have said at least one other group is preparing to make an offer this week. There is a sense that a bidding war would help Abramovich maintain some form of leverage and the first move came when Wyss, a Swiss businessman, revealed that he had been invited to join a consortium aiming to own Chelsea. Abramovich confirmed his plans to sell in a statement on Wednesday evening and said net proceeds from the sale would be donated to a charitable foundation which would be “for the benefit of all victims of the war in Ukraine”. He said he would not be asking for the money he has loaned Chelsea since buying the club in 2003 to be repaid. Abramovich said: I have always taken decisions with the club’s best interest at heart. In the current situation, I have therefore taken the decision to sell the club, as I believe this is in the best interest of the club, the fans, the employees, as well as the club’s sponsors and partners. Ukraine’s ambassador to the UN, Sergiy Kyslytsya, compared the Russian leader Vladimir Putin with Adolf Hitler and urged the world to respond in a resolute and united manner when he spoke at an emergency special session of the UN general assembly on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Russian forces appear to have become more aggressive in their targeting of infrastructure inside the Ukrainian capital, a senior US defence official has said. Though there has been “no appreciable movement” of Russian forces advancing on Kyiv since yesterday, Russia has increased its “missiles and artillery targeting the city,” the official continued. We’ve observed, certainly as you have all observed, an increase in missiles and artillery that (is) targeting the city and this (increasing) aggressiveness in terms of just the iron that they’re lobbing into the city. Similarly, while Russian forces are assaulting Chernihiv and Kharkiv, there has been “no appreciable movement by the Russians to take either one”, the official said. However, Russian forces have made more progress in the south, the official said, noting that Russia claims their troops have taken control of the city of Kherson. Police in Poland have warned that fake reports of violent crimes being committed by people fleeing Ukraine are circulating on social media after Polish nationalists attacked and abused groups of African, south Asian and Middle Eastern people who had crossed the border last night, Lorenzo Tondo and Emmanuel Akinwotu have reported. Attackers dressed in black sought out groups of non-white refugees, mainly students who had just arrived in Poland at Przemyśl train station from cities in Ukraine after the Russian invasion. According to the police, three Indians were beaten up by a group of five men, leaving one of them hospitalised. Around 7pm, these men started to shout and yell against groups of African and Middle Eastern refugees who were outside the train station, Two Polish journalists from the press agency OKO, who first reported the incident, told the Guardian. They yelled at them: ‘Go back to the train station! Go back to your country.’ Police intervened and riot officers were deployed after groups of men arrived chanting “Przemyśl always Polish”. “I was with my friends, buying something to eat outside,” said Sara, 22, from Egypt, a student in Ukraine. These men came and started to harass a group of men from Nigeria. They wouldn’t let an African boy go inside a place to eat some food. Then they came towards us and yelled: ‘Go back to your country.’ Following the incident, police in Poland warned that groups linked to the far right are already spreading false information about alleged crimes committed by people from Africa and the Middle East fleeing war in Ukraine. More than 7,000 Russian troops have been killed since the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, according to Ukraine’s presidential adviser. Oleksiy Arestovich, a military adviser to president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said in a television briefing that hundreds of Russian servicemen have been taken prisoner, including senior officers. A Russian army commander was taken to Belarus after being severely wounded, Arestovich said. Thousands of people in cities across Russia have been defying police threats and staging protests against the invasion of Ukraine. Authorities have a low tolerance for demonstrations and marches, and attending them can have serious consequences, including fines, mass arrests and even imprisonment. Despite the crackdown, Apollinaria Oleinikova, along with her husband, Arshak Makichyan, and fellow protester Arina Adju have been attending anti-war rallies in Moscow and St Petersburg since the conflict began. As the death toll continues to rise, they say they feel like they have no choice but to publicly oppose the Kremlin and stand in solidarity with Ukraine. A Russian negotiator said a ceasefire is on the agenda in talks between Ukraine and Russia, AFP reports. Russia expects Ukrainian officials to arrive in Belarus for the next round of peace talks on Thursday morning, Russian news agencies cited Moscow’s negotiator Vladimir Medinsky as saying. The Russian army is providing a security corridor for the Ukrainian delegation, Russian state news agency Tass cited Medinsky as saying. Here’s more on the UN General Assembly’s vote condemning Russia’s invasion and calling for it immediately to pull all of its forces out of Ukraine. Alongside Russia, the countries that voted against the UN resolution were Belarus, North Korea, Eritrea and Syria. Thirty-five countries abstained in the vote, including China and India. The United Nations has voted overwhelmingly for a resolution deploring Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and called for the immediate withdrawal of its forces, in a global expression of outrage that highlighted Russia’s increasing isolation, Julian Borger writes. In an emergency session of the UN’s general assembly, 141 of the 193 member states voted for the resolution, 35 abstained and five voted against. The resolution, which was co-sponsored by 94 countries, said the UN “deplores in the strongest terms the aggression by the Russian Federation against Ukraine”. It demanded that “the Russian Federation immediately cease its use of force against Ukraine” and “immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw all of its military forces”. The resolution is not legally binding, but is an expression of the views of the UN membership, aimed at increasing pressure on Moscow and its ally, Belarus. On Friday, Russia was the sole vote against a similar resolution in the security council, but because Russia is one of the five powers with a veto, the resolution was not upheld, so Ukraine’s allies referred the matter to the general assembly. It is first time in 40 years, the security council has referred a crisis to the assembly and only the 11th time an emergency session of the UN general assembly has been called since 1950. It was summoned under a “uniting for peace” resolution, in which global threats are referred to the body “if the security council, because of lack of unanimity of the permanent members, fails to exercise its primary responsibility to act as required to maintain international peace and security”. Russia’s defence ministry said 498 Russian soldiers had been killed in Ukraine since the beginning of its invasion of Ukraine, Russian state news agency RIA is reporting. The ministry said 1,597 Russians have been wounded so far, according to Russian media reports. It marks the first time Moscow has released figures for casualties sustained during the invasion. Russia’s defence ministry also said that more than 2,870 Ukrainian soldiers and “nationalists” had been killed and about 3,700 wounded, according to Interfax. The Guardian cannot independently verify the Russian figures and there was no immediate comment from Ukraine The United Nations has voted overwhelmingly to deplore the Russian invasion of Ukraine “in the strongest possible terms”. The UN general assembly has approved a resolution demanding that Russia stop the war in Ukraine and withdraw all troops. The resolution won support from 141 votes and five voted against. There were 35 abstentions. Ukraine’s ambassador to the UN, Sergiy Kyslytsya, has compared the Russian leader Vladimir Putin to Hitler. Speaking at the UN, he said the Russian invasion of Ukraine was intended “to deprive Ukraine of the very right to exist”. “They have come to resolve the Ukrainian issue,” he said. Kyslytsya added: More than 80 years ago, another dictator tried to finally resolve the issue of another people. He failed when the world responded in a resolute and united manner. Ukraine’s ambassador to the United Nations says we are living through a “defining moment for our generation”. Sergiy Kyslytsya is speaking at the UN, where he called on member countries to step up to stop Russia. Our generation is the generation that was supposed by our predecessors to be saved from the scourge of war. That is why our predecessors created the United Nations. And yet today, it falls to us to save future generations. Viktoria, 32, describes the birth of her first child last Friday in a hospital underground shelter in Kyiv: It was the second day of the war. I was really nervous – we were hearing explosions. I was praying to meet my son. I started to clean everything in my house, preparing for the baby, and even when I started to feel the pain, I couldn’t believe I’d be giving birth during war. Me and my husband were afraid to drive to the hospital because of the explosions. First we had to spend about 30 minutes in a queue to get gas. Then we were riding through Kyiv and it was empty – I’d never seen such an empty city. We heard the sound of sirens. It was scary, like a movie, but I was trying to stay positive. When we arrived, all the lights were turned off because hospital staff were afraid about being bombed. My doctor met us and showed us to a very comfortable and colourful room. But two hours later we heard sirens. It was very loud. It was unreal to look through the window and see all the beautiful gothic architecture and hear the sirens. While I was pregnant I had taken yoga classes, prepared for gentle birth-giving, took courses. It wasn’t like this. The doctor said we needed to go to the bomb shelter. There was panic as people were rushing. I couldn’t even put my trousers on because it was too painful. When we entered the shelter we were shocked. It was built in Soviet times and wasn’t maintained, it was crumbling and very wet and cold. For us there was a small room without any doors, only a shower curtain that separated us from the main room with 50 people in it. There was no medical technology, just a gynaecological chair. I was trying to not even look over there and hoping to go back to the hospital soon. Then my waters broke. My doctor looked at me and said: “OK, we will do it here, it’s too dangerous to wait.” At that moment I wasn’t afraid. I trusted my doctor – the only thing on my mind was holding my son and ending the pain. The World Health Organization (WHO) is “deeply concerned” by reports of attacks on healthcare facilities in Ukraine, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. Ghebreyesus told a press conference that the WHO is working to verify the reports of “attacks on health facilities and health workers”, and said attacks on healthcare would be “in violation of international humanitarian law”. The sanctity and neutrality of healthcare, including of health workers, patient supplies, transport and facilities and the right to safe access to care must be respected and protected. The WHO confirmed a report last week in which a hospital came under attack from heavy weapons, killing four people and injuring 10, including six health workers, the WHO chief said. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has temporarily suspended a visa waiver for Ukrainian citizens, Reuters is reporting. Ukraine’s embassy in the capital Abu Dhabi announced the visa suspension on its Facebook page without providing a reason. An embassy official later confirmed the news. The UK’s speaker of the Commons, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, welcomed the Ukrainian ambassador to the UK, Vadym Prystaiko, to parliament on Wednesday. MPs clapped and cheered as they gave him a standing ovation, a highly unusual act in the Commons. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy had just finished an interview yesterday when he learned of the Russian strike on the TV tower in Kyiv, close to Babyn Yar, a memorial and burial place for 30,000 Jews killed by the Nazis. A Russian delegation is travelling to meet for talks with Ukrainian counterparts, Belarus’ Belta news agency is reporting. The location of the talks has not yet been confirmed. India is asking its nationals to leave Ukraine’s second-largest city of Kharkiv by Wednesday evening, based on information Indian authorities have received from Russia. The external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said Indian nationals had been advised to move to three safe zones nine miles away, the Associated Press reported. Bagchi declined to give details about what information New Delhi had received from Russia, which is invading Ukraine. Bagchi also said nearly 17,000 Indian nationals, mostly students, out of an estimated 20,000, have left Ukraine. India is trying to evacuate the rest to nearby countries. Keir Starmer has questioned why Roman Abramovich has not faced UK sanctions over the Russian invasion of Ukraine, as Boris Johnson appeared to accept a Labour offer to strengthen a new bill cracking down on illicit assets. At a prime minister’s questions that began with the rare sight of MPs standing in unison to applaud the Ukrainian ambassador, Vadym Prystaiko, who was watching from the public gallery, Starmer repeatedly called for tougher action against Russian oligarchs. Here is a round-up of some of the most poignant and heartbreaking images to have emerged from Putin’s invasion of Ukraine on Wednesday. Describing the health situation in the cities that are increasingly under besieged, Jarno Hubicht the World Health Organisation’s representative in Ukraine told the Guardian: We see that some cities now are getting isolated and we are getting reports that people don’t feel safe seek health care with health care workers under attack. This is moving very fast with the military offensive broadening and we are moving closer to a humanitarian crisis. What we are seeing in places where there are hostilities is health service provisions being moved to the shelters and basements. We don’t have a full picture but we are concerned about electricity provision, which is important to keep machines running, and oxygen and medicines for intensive care. Where the military offensive is ongoing there is also a question access to supplies and while some hospitals have supplies for one or two weeks, but some are already running out. It is also important to follow humanitarian law and protect health care workers. At the moment there are drivers who are scared go and get medicines and we have had reports of health workers under attack. Thousands of Ukrainians have volunteered to defend their country and to fight Russia’s invasion, with recruits including IT workers and builders taking part in basic training before setting off for battle. The volunteer centre in Lviv was packed on Wednesday with new soldiers who had signed up to join territorial defence units. Some were in military uniform. Others wore civilian clothes and baseball hats and carried shiny backpacks. They lined up for the first time in a street on Taras Shevchenko Avenue, named after Ukraine’s national poet. “Raise your hand if you have a car,” their new commander barked. The recruits divided into groups and introduced themselves. Around them snow fell. “History is happening right now. I don’t want to be on the sidelines,” Vitali, the 35-year-old boss of a Lviv startup said, speaking an assembly point. “I want to make history. Finally the world should know what is evil and what is good. We have the whole world’s support.” He added: “The main reason we are going to win is because of people.” What was his message for Vladimir Putin? “I don’t negotiate with terrorists,” he said. “He is going to die soon. His regime will fall into dust.” Vitali said he and his company’s 15 employees had begun weapons training five days before Russia’s attack. He had volunteered the day of the invasion. The recruits were going to learn combat first aid and other skills at an undisclosed location outside the city, he said. With Kharkiv and Kyiv under brutal bombardment and the Ukrainian army encircled in the city of Mariupol, volunteers from western Ukraine are being brought in as reinforcements. We have been hearing from Ukrainians on the frontline of the war, who have been facing relentless Russian attacks for days now. Oleksiy Demchenko, a 27-year old computer programmer in Kharkiv told the Guardian: Right now we are just trying to hold on. To tell the truth it’s hell. There are a lot airstrikes. They are hitting people’s houses, health facilities, the parks. I live in the centre of Kharkiv. We saw air strikes yesterday and we’re hiding in the bedroom because it’s the most secure place in house. The Russians came into the city a few days ago but the army destroyed them. Now they are hitting us from outside. Yesterday I wanted to go out to fill bottles with water but air strikes were killing people. We have some social services trying to help us with deliveries of food and water. I think their main goal is to break us psychologically because they want us to evacuate city. Its a terror tactic we saw in Chechnya and Afghanistan. But our army will protect us. People won’t surrender. Russian forces in Ukraine moved to tighten their siege of key cities, including the capital, Kyiv, and the southern port of Mariupol, as one mayor told residents he had been given an ultimatum to surrender or the city would be razed by shelling. At an outdoor meeting Artem Semenikhin, the mayor of Konotop, in the eastern Sumy region, told residents: “They have given us an ultimatum. If we start resisting, they’ll wipe out the town using artillery.” “If you are for it, we’ll fight,” Semenikhin is heard telling a crowd of residents. “Who votes to fight?” he shouts as residents shout back, insisting they will resist. Amid renewed heavy shelling, the mayor of Kharkiv, also in the country’s east, said he had no intention of surrendering. Russian forces have taken control of the area around Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, according to the UN’s nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi. In a statement, Grossi said Russian diplomats in Vienna informed the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that personnel have continued their work and that radiation levels “remain normal”. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is Europe’s largest power plant and has six out of Ukraine’s 15 nuclear energy reactors, according to the statement. There are reports of Ukrainian citizens blocking roads leading to the power plant, with video posted on social media showing Ukrainians building makeshift roadblocks near the city of Energodar, where the Zaporizhzhia plant is located. At least four people were killed and nine wounded after a fresh attack in Kharkiv this morning, the Ukrainian state emergency service said. There are reports that Russian missiles have once again hit the centre of Ukraine’s second largest city, striking an area close to the city council building. Kharkiv, a city of 1.5 million people, has been turned into a bombed-out wasteland of ruined buildings and debris after intense shelling and airstrikes by Russian forces. After an air strike on Wednesday morning, the roof of a police building in the centre of the city collapsed as it was engulfed in flames. The Ukrainian parliament said a school in Kharkiv had been hit by shelling. The Ukrainian port city of Mariupol is suffering mass casualties and a water outage as it defends itself from a nonstop onslaught by Russian forces, according to its mayor Vadym Boichenko. In a live broadcast on Ukrainian TV, Boichenko said: The enemy occupying forces of the Russian Federation have done everything to block the exit of civilians from the city of half a million people. Mariupol’s mayor said Russian forces had been “flattening us non-stop for 12 hours now”, the Interfax news agency reported. We cannot even take the wounded from the streets, from houses and apartments today, since the shelling does not stop. Talks between Ukraine and Russia will resume today, CNN is reporting, citing a Ukrainian presidential aide. The second round of talks is expected to involve the same representatives who attended the first round of talks on Monday. The aide told CNN: Now it’s official. The second round of talks between Ukraine and the occupier will take place today. The location of the talks has not yet been confirmed. On Monday, talks took place in Belarus, near the Belarus-Poland border. The basement of the maternity hospital in Ukraine’s coastal city of Mariupol transformed into a bomb shelter and nursery as Russian forces escalated their attacks on crowded urban areas Tuesday, Peter Beaumont writes. Workers bundled one newborn and carried him down flights of stairs to the basement, where a dimly lit room cramped with beds and cribs sheltered workers and patients. A similar scene unfolded in Kharkiv, where a maternity ward was moved into a bomb shelter. Mothers there rocked newborns in cradles amid mattresses piled against the windows for protection. More than 2,000 Ukrainian civilians have been killed since the Russian invasion, according to Ukraine’s emergency service. In a statement, it said hundreds of structures including transport facilities, hospitals, kindergartens and homes have been destroyed. Children, women and defence forces are losing their lives every hour. Romanian MEP Cristian Terhes has been at the crossing point between Romania and Ukraine at Sighetul Marmatiei where he witnessed people being helped on the Romanian side but signs of chaos on the opposite side of the border, Daniel Boffey writes. While the Romanian government and NGOs have capacity for those fleeing the war, people were being turned away on the Ukrainian side for not having documents to prove their nationality, he said, with Ukrainian border staff struggling with the numbers. Terhes told the Guardian: The Romanian people went beyond limits to organise themselves to properly receive the refugees from Ukraine, who were fleeing the war. The Romanians opened their homes, made their cars available for free transportation, provided food, sim cards and anything else needed for our neighbours, who are running to save their lives. The volunteers, NGOs and the authorities are working at full speed on the Romanian side to assist all the refugees that are crossing the border. The problem is a long delay on the Ukrainian side, as the personnel are overwhelmed and some people do not have the proper documentation to exit the country. I crossed over to Ukraine twice to help carry provisions from Romania and I was shocked by the length of the lines for those waiting to exit the country. All these people are welcomed in Romania and many Romanians are extremely eager to help these poor people in desperate situations. The photographs taken on 27 February shows a long line, with about 1,000 refugees waiting on the Ukrainian side. Most of them were women with children and elderly people, he said. EU sanctions against RT, formerly known as Russia Today, and Sputnik have been legally signed off clearing the way for national regulators across the bloc to remove them from media platforms, Lisa O’Carroll writes. As the information war escalates with Russian cracking down, EU officials insisted the move was not “censorship” and was not a sanction on journalists who may work for RT in the EU. An official said: The two entities are not classic media organisations. They are in the pro-Kremlin disinformation toolbox. They added: RT is on an official list of core organisations of strategic importance for Russia and Sputnik has been created by presidential decree. If you look at the words of the editor-in-chief of RT, you can see it is an instrument to conduct an information war against the whole western world. The Luxembourg satellite company SES confirmed it would be pulling the plug on RT once sanctions came into force, removing it from the Sky platform as well as other networks across the EU. Twitter has said it will be removing RT and Sputnik from its platform in line with EU sanctions. The French minister for digital economy, Cédric O, today criticised the tech giant for not reacting to events fast enough. He told French radio: Twitter is always, always the last one to react, and always the one not to do enough on [content] moderation. A spokesperson told Politico: We continue to advocate for a free and open internet, particularly in times of crisis. In the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson, the Russian army claims it has captured the city but its mayor says it is still held by Ukrainian forces. On Wednesday morning, Russia’s defence ministry said its troops had taken full control of Kherson, a provincial capital of around a quarter of a million people on the southern front. If the Russian army’s claims are true, then Kherson would be the first sizeable city in Ukraine to be taken by Russian forces so far. Heavy fighting had been reported overnight in the city, where the mayor said Russian forces had taken control of the railway station and the port by the early hours of Wednesday. Videos shared on social media show Russian military vehicles and soldiers patrolling the streets. The regional governor of Kherson said overnight that it was surrounded, under fire, and Russian troops were looting shops and pharmacies. An adviser to Ukraine’s president, Zelenskiy, Oleksiy Arestovych, said street fighting was going on in the port. He said on Wednesday morning: The city has not fallen, our side continues to defend. In a set of televised remarks, the Russian defence ministry spokesperson Igor Konashenkov said: The Russian divisions of the armed forces have taken the regional centre of Kherson under full control. He claimed public services and transport in Kherson were operating as usual, and that talks were under way between the Russian army and local authorities. But the city’s mayor, Igor Kolykhaiev, appeared to contradict the Russian army’s claims, saying that Kherson remained under Ukrainian control. Kolykhaiev said in a Facebook post: We are still Ukraine. Still firm. The mayor said he needed to find a way to “collect the (bodies of the) dead” and “restore electricity, gas, water and heating where they are damaged”, adding: But I warn you right away: to complete these tasks today means to perform a miracle. Cybersecurity experts have identified a second so-called “wiper” cyber-attack targeted at Ukraine, reports Dan Milmo. The warning from ESET research labs, a Slovakia-based cyber-security firm, comes after it flagged an initial salvo on 23 February, which it had dubbed HermeticWiper. Wiper attacks disable computers, the most notorious example being the 2017 NotPetya attack, attributed to Russia, which wreaked havoc across Ukraine and elsewhere by irretrievably encrypting computers. ESET said in a report on Tuesday that it had detected a second wiper attack against a Ukrainian governmental network, discovered on the day the offensive began on 24 February, that it has named IsaacWiper. It described it as “way less sophisticated” than HermeticWiper. However, ESET added in a blogpost that it had uncovered a “worm component”, dubbed HermeticWizard, that could be used to spread the HermeticWiper in local networks. NotPetya went viral and caused damage in 65 countries (the total cost of attack was estimated at $10bn). HermeticWiper’s initial impact appears was on hundreds of computers in at least five Ukrainian organisations and also hit computers in Latvia and Lithuania. ESET stresses that it has not pinned the blame for these attacks on any state or organisation yet. A second round of talks between Ukraine and Russia will take place later today, Russian state news agency Tass has reported, citing an aide to the Ukrainian presidential office. Earlier today, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters a Russian delegation will be “in place” on Wednesday for a new round of talks with Ukraine. In the second half of the day, closer to evening, our delegation will be in place to await Ukrainian negotiators. Asked about the location of the talks, Peskov replied: I won’t announce the place ahead of time. On Monday, talks between Ukrainian and Russian delegations took place in Belarus, not far from the Ukrainian border, but ended without a breakthrough. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy says he has “coordinated actions” with the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson. Hello, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong with you again as we unpack all the latest developments on the unfolding crisis in Ukraine. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. The time in Ukraine is 1.10pm. Here is a roundup from the news so far today: Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said nearly 6,000 Russians had been killed in the first six days of Moscow’s invasion, and that the Kremlin would not be able to take his country with bombs and airstrikes. Russian troops have reportedly landed in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second most populous city, according to the security service of Ukraine. Ukrainian authorities said Russian airborne troops landed at approximately 3am local time and engaged in heavy fighting with Ukrainian forces. Ukrainian authorities say a Russian missile strike at about 8.10am hit a police building and a university in Kharkiv this morning. Four more people were killed and nine wounded as a barrage of Russian air and rocket strikes pounded Kharkiv, the local emergency services and mayor Ihor Terekhov said. Overnight reports said a fire at a hospital in Kharkiv broke out. According to an alert issued just before 3am from Ukraine’s state special communications agency, Russian soldiers attacked a military medical clinical centre hospital in the city’s north. Russia is claiming to have seized Kherson on the Black Sea in southern Ukraine. However, this is unconfirmed as the city’s mayor has so far said only that Russian forces have taken control of the railway station and the port. Ukraine is set to receive more Stinger and Javelin missiles from abroad, as well as another shipment of Turkish drones, according to Ukrainian defence minister Oleksii Reznikov. The Kremlin said Russian officials were ready to hold a second round of talks with Ukraine on Wednesday but it was not clear if Ukrainian officials would turn up. European Union diplomats have approved new sanctions against Belarus for its supporting role in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the French presidency of the EU confirmed. EU diplomats have approved new sanctions against Belarusian people who are playing a role in the attacks to Ukraine, Reuters reported. The European Commission has proposed to grant temporary protection to people fleeing war in Ukraine, including a residence permit and access to employment and social welfare. China won’t join the US and European governments in imposing financial sanctions on Russia, the country’s bank regulator has announced. Russia cancelled an attempt to send four of its warships through Turkish waters into the Black Sea at Turkey’s request, Foreign minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu said, adding the decision was made before Ankara closed the straits over Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. The United Nations said that at least 136 civilians have been killed in the invasion, although the real number of people is likely to be much higher. Russia’s largest lender, Sberbank, is leaving the European market as its subsidiaries there face large cash outflows and threats to the safety of employees and property, the bank said on Wednesday. That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, until 2pm. My colleague Léonie Chao-Fong will be along shortly to continue bringing you all the latest news from Ukraine. Four more people were killed and nine wounded as a barrage of Russian air and rocket strikes pounded the north-eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv on Wednesday morning, the local emergency services and mayor Ihor Terekhov said. In an online video, the Reuters news agency report him as saying: Kharkiv is a Russian-speaking city. Every fourth person in Kharkiv has relatives in the Russian Federation. But the city’s attitude to Russia today is completely different to what it ever was before. We never expected this could happen: total destruction, annihilation, genocide against the Ukrainian people – this is unforgivable. China won’t join the US and European governments in imposing financial sanctions on Russia, the country’s bank regulator has announced. China is a major buyer of Russian oil and gas and the only major government that has refrained from criticising Moscow’s attack on Ukraine, the Associated Press reported. Beijing opposes the sanctions, said Guo Shuqing, the chairman of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission. Guo said at a news conference: We will not join such sanctions, and we will keep normal economic, trade and financial exchanges with all the relevant parties. We disapprove of the financial sanctions, particularly those launched unilaterally, because they don’t have much legal basis and will not have good effects. Pope Francis has asked people around the world to remember Ukrainians in underground shelters seeking protection from bombardments and thanked Poland for taking in the bulk of refugees from the war. Francis spoke at his weekly general audience on Ash Wednesday, which he has declared a day of prayer and fasting for peace in Ukraine, Reuters reported. After addressing Poles, the pope went off script to say that the Polish translator on the stage with him, Father Marek Viktor Gongalo, is Ukrainian. The pope said: His parents are now in underground shelters to protect themselves from the bombs in a place near Kyiv. By accompanying him, we accompany all the people who are suffering from the bombings, including his elderly parents and so many other elderly who are in underground shelters defending themselves. Let us remember these people in our hearts. Kyiv residents have been sheltering in metro stations and other underground sites at night, there are long lines for fuel, and some products are running out in shops. The Kremlin said Russian officials were ready to hold a second round of talks with Ukraine on Wednesday but it was not clear if Ukrainian officials would turn up. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said there was contradictory information regarding the talks, Reuters reported. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Tuesday that Russia must stop the bombing of Ukrainian cities before talks could take place. Peskov also said Moscow needed to formulate a harsh, thought-out and clear response against measures imposed on western countries to undermine the Russian economy. European Union diplomats have approved new sanctions against Belarus for its supporting role in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the French presidency of the EU confirmed. EU diplomats have approved new sanctions against Belarusian people who are playing a role in the attacks to Ukraine, Reuters reported. Sanctions will also hit “some economic sectors, and in particular timber, steel and potassium”, the statement said. An EU official said this week that one of the aims of the new sanctions against Minsk was to stop exports of any further Belarusian goods to the EU, on top of those already subject to sanctions previously imposed by the EU after the President Alexander Lukashenko crushed protests following elections in August 2020. Jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny has called on Russians to stage daily protests against Moscow’s military campaign in Ukraine, his spokesperson wrote on Twitter on Wednesday. “Alexei Navalny has called for people to go out and protest against the war every day at 19:00 and on weekends at 14:00. The main squares of your towns, wherever you are,” spokesperson Kira Yarmysh wrote. Navalny’s movement had previously called for a campaign of civil disobedience to protest against Russia’s invasion of its neighbour. Navalny, the most prominent opponent of President Vladimir Putin, was jailed last year after he returned to Russia from Germany following his recovery from what western laboratory tests established was an attempt to poison him with a nerve agent in Siberia. Russia denied carrying out such an attack. The UK defence secretary has once again ruled out a no-fly zone over Ukraine, saying it would be counter-productive. However, he warned there was a risk Vladimir Putin would start to “ruthlessly pummel” cities from the air. Ben Wallace rejected calls from Ukraine for a no-fly zone because it would “lead to a war against Russia across the whole of Europe”. He also said it would stop Ukrainian pilots being able to target Russia from the air, giving an advantage to Moscow, which has stronger ground troops and tanks. “If you had a no-fly zone in Ukraine, the overwhelming scale of the Russian army would be able to drive around with impunity, which it can’t at the moment,” the defence secretary told Sky News. Wallace said a convoy of Russian tanks heading towards Kyiv was moving so slowly because of logistical problems and low morale. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said nearly 6,000 Russians had been killed in the first six days of Moscow’s invasion, and that the Kremlin would not be able to take his country with bombs and airstrikes. In his latest speech, he also condemned a missile strike on Babyn Yar, a Holocaust memorial in Kyiv, saying: “It is beyond humanity.” Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak has told the Reuters news agency that holding more talks with Russia was under discussion and that a “substantial agenda” was needed. Asked about the date for a second round of talks since Russia invaded its neighbour last week, Podolyak said: It’s under discussion for now. A substantial agenda is needed. Russia has claimed that its forces had taken control of the first sizeable city on Wednesday, seizing Kherson in the south. Strategically located on the Dniepr river, the provincial capital would be the biggest city to fall to Russian forces so far. The southeast city of Mariupol had been under intense shelling since late Tuesday and was unable to evacuate wounded, according to its mayor. However, we are still awaiting confirmation from the Ukrainians about the current status of Kherson. The European Commission has proposed to grant temporary protection to people fleeing war in Ukraine, including a residence permit and access to employment and social welfare. Designed to deal with mass arrivals of displaced persons in the EU, the new legislation will provide the same level of protection in all member states. The proposal, which had been previously announced, will be discussed by EU interior ministers on Thursday, Reuters reported. Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine will become more brutal, British defence minister Ben Wallace said on Wednesday. “Anyone who thinks logically would not do what he (Putin) is doing, so we are going to see ... his brutality increase,” Wallace told LBC radio. “He doesn’t get his way, he surrounds cities, he ruthlessly bombards them at night ... and he will then eventually try and break them and move into the cities.” Russia cancelled an attempt to send four of its warships through Turkish waters into the Black Sea at Turkey’s request, Foreign minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlusaid, adding the decision was made before Ankara closed the straits over Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. Nato member Turkey borders Ukraine and Russia in the Black Sea and has good ties with both. On Monday, Ankara said it had closed its Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits under a 1936 pact, allowing it to curb some Russian vessels crossing. The pact exempts vessels returning to their bases. Çavuşoğlu told broadcaster Haberturk that Turkey had asked Russia not to send its ships through before it labelled Moscow’s invasion a “war” on Sunday, legally allowing it to curb passages under the Montreux convention. “Russia has said four of its ships would cross the straits on Feb 27-28, three of which are not registered to bases in the Black Sea,” Çavuşoğlu said. “We told Russia not to send these ships and Russia said the vessels would not cross the straits.” “Nobody should be offended by this, because the Montreux convention is valid today, yesterday and tomorrow, so we will implement it,” he said. Reuters reported earlier this week that at least four Russian ships – two destroyers, a frigate, and an intelligence vessel – were waiting on Turkey’s decision to cross from the Mediterranean. Two of them, a frigate and a destroyer, had asked to make the journey this week. The US “expressed appreciation” for Turkey’s move to close the straits. Ukraine’s ambassador to Ankara said Kyiv was grateful to Turkey for “meticulously” implementing the pact. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Wednesday nearly 6,000 Russians had been killed in the first six days of Moscow’s invasion, and that the Kremlin would not be able to take his country with bombs and airstrikes. Referring to Russia’s attack on Babyn Yar – the site of a second world war massacre of Jews by German occupation troops and Ukrainian auxiliaries – Zelenskiy said: This strike proves that for many people in Russia our Kyiv is absolutely foreign. They don’t know a thing about Kyiv, about our history. But they all have orders to erase our history, erase our country, erase us all. The British Ministry of Defence has published its latest intelligence report on the situation in Ukraine today. It says that while Russian forces have moved into the centre of Kherson in the south of the country, overall gains have been “limited” due to ongoing logistical issues and strong Ukrainian resistance. Heavy Russian artillery and airstrikes have continued to hit built-up areas, focused in the cities of Kharkiv, Kyiv, Mariupol and Chernihiv, in the past 24 hours, it says. The update adds that the number of civilians left displaced and forced to flee stands at about 660,000. I’m Tom Ambrose and I’ll be bringing you the latest updates from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine over the next few hours. It is 9.30am in Ukraine. Here’s where we stand right now: Russian troops have reportedly landed in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second most populous city, according to the Security Service of Ukraine. Ukrainian authorities said Russian airborne troops landed at approximately 3am local time and engaged in heavy fighting with Ukrainian forces. Ukrainian authorities say a Russian missile strike at about 8.10am hit a police building and a university in Kharkiv this morning. Overnight reports said a fire at a hospital in Kharkiv broke out. According to an alert issued just before 3am from Ukraine’s State Special Communications agency, Russian soldiers attacked a military medical clinical centre hospital in the city’s north. In Kherson on the Black Sea in southern Ukraine, Russian forces have taken control of the railway station and the port overnight, city mayor Igor Kolykhayev was quoted by local media, Agence France-Press reports. Ukraine is set to receive more Stinger and Javelin missiles from abroad, as well as another shipment of Turkish drones, according to Ukrainian defence minister Oleksii Reznikov. Germany is prepared should Russia stop exporting gas to the country, minister for the economy Robert Habeck has said. More than 450,000 people entered Poland from Ukraine since the Russian invasion began last Thursday, Poland’s deputy interior minister Pawel Szefernaker told private Radio Zet on Wednesday. The United Nations said that at least 136 civilians have been killed in the invasion, although the real number of people is likely much higher. At least 21 people have been killed and 112 wounded from shelling in Ukraine’s second most populous city, Kharkiv, the regional governor said. Russia’s largest lender, Sberbank, is leaving the European market as its subsidiaries there face large cash outflows and threats to the safety of employees and property, the bank said on Wednesday. Moscow’s stock market will stay closed for a third consecutive day on Wednesday, the Moscow Times reports. Russia president Vladimir Putin has signed a decree to prohibit Russians from leaving the country with more than $10,000 in foreign currency, Russia state media outlet Tass reports. US president Joe Biden delivered his first State of the Union address from Capitol Hill on Tuesday evening, commending the Ukrainian people’s resolve to fight and vowing that Putin must “pay a price” for his actions in Ukraine. The US will ban Russian flights from its airspace, US president Joe Biden confirmed. For an even more detailed update, you can read our earlier summary here. For any tips and feedback please contact me through Twitter or at samantha.lock@theguardian.com Ukrainian authorities say a Russian missile strike at about 8.10am this morning hit a police building and a university in Kharkiv. The State Service for Emergencies uploaded a series of photos showing firefighters and rescue teams battling a blaze billowing from the top of a large building. The strike also reportedly hit the state security service (SBU) building. Ukraine is set to receive more Stinger and Javelin missiles from abroad, as well as another shipment of Turkish drones, according to Ukrainian defence minister Oleksii Reznikov. In an update posted to his Facebook and Telegram accounts, Reznikov said: The amount of help we are receiving is increasing. The number of countries providing this assistance is growing. Even those for whom it was considered impossible are joining. More stingers and javelins to come.” Several western countries have pledged to supply Ukraine with weapons to fend off a Russian invasion. Germany is prepared should Russia stop exporting gas to the country, minister for the economy Robert Habeck has said. Asked by Deutschlandfunk radio what the government would do if Russia stops gas exports, Reuters reports Habeck replied: We are prepared for that. I can give the all-clear for the current winter and summer. For the next winter, we would take further measures. Habeck pointed to planned new legislation to ensure gas storage is full for winter. “So we are also taking precautions for the worst case, which has not happened yet because the Russians are delivering,” he said, adding that in a worse case scenario Berlin could keep “coal-fired power plants in reserve, maybe even keep them running”, but that it was committed to moving to renewables in the medium-term. A Royal Australian Air Force plane left for Europe today carrying military equipment and medical supplies, following prime minister Scott Morrison’s announcement that Australia will provide defensive military assistance to Ukraine. Morrison said on Sunday that Australia would provide weapons to Ukraine through Nato, supplementing nonlethal equipment and supplies. The joint operations command of the Australian military shared a snap of the plane taking off from the RAAF Base Richmond in New South Wales around 5.30pm AEST. More than 450,000 people entered Poland from Ukraine since the Russian invasion began last Thursday, Poland’s deputy interior minister Pawel Szefernaker told private Radio Zet on Wednesday. He added that the number of people entering Poland fell slightly on Tuesday to 98,000 from a record number of more than 100,000 on Monday. At least 21 people have been killed and 112 wounded from shelling in Ukraine’s second most populous city, Kharkiv, the regional governor has said. Overnight, Ukrainian defence positions were “constantly under the influence of enemy fire, aviation, jet artillery, and firearms,” Oleh Sinehubov said in an update on his official Facebook page this morning. Sinehubov said the northern and north-east sectors of the city were attacked, confirming an attack on a military hospital. As the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s defiance has made him a hero across the world. Guardian reporter Viv Groskop asks: Could his success as a politician lie in his years as an entertainer? When Zelenskiy was elected in April 2019, at the age of 41, the Russian commentator Sergey Parkhomenko said: “He is weak, he does not have a religion, he does not have a nationality.” It was meant as a criticism, even though all these reasons were precisely why people had voted for Zelenskiy. He is not intimidating. He does not come from a political background. He is a Russian speaker from the centre of the country. But, most of all, to Ukrainians, he was recognisable and he was funny. That nice guy off that TV show Servant of the People. You know, the one where the geeky history teacher becomes the president overnight. The Paddington voice guy. The United Nations has said that at least 136 civilians have been killed in the invasion, although the real number of people is likely much higher. As the human cost mounts, here are some details on some of the civilians who have perished. They include 10-year-old Polina, who was killed in Kyiv along with members of her family by alleged “Russian saboteurs”, and secondary school teachers Yelena Ivanova and Yelena Kudrin, who died during a shelling in Goldovka. Russia’s richest man, Alexei Mordashov, is now an EU sanctions target, Guardian reporter Joanna Partridge reports. He is the Russian oligarch who stepped in to keep travel firm Tui afloat, pumping in cash as international tourism came to a standstill during the pandemic. However, Alexei Mordashov – who owns a third of Europe’s biggest tour operator and is its largest single shareholder – may be becoming something of a liability for Tui, whose shares are listed in London, after the EU added him to its sanctions list on Monday night. While Mordashov has not been sanctioned in the UK, his business interests in the region will now be severely curtailed. Russia’s largest lender, Sberbank, is leaving the European market as its subsidiaries there face large cash outflows and threats to the safety of employees and property, the bank said on Wednesday. The bank said it was no longer able to supply liquidity to European subsidiaries, but its capital level and asset quality were sufficient to make payments to all depositors. In a statement, it said: In the current situation, Sberbank has decided to leave the European market. The group’s subsidiary banks have faced abnormal cash outflows and threats to the safety of its employees and branches.” Unprecedented steps by western nations to isolate Russia’s economy and financial system over its invasion of Ukraine include sanctions on its central bank and the exclusion of some of its lenders from global payments system Swift. On Monday, the European Central Bank (ECB) warned that Sberbank’s European arm faced closure after a run on its deposits sparked by the invasion backlash. Sberbank, which operates in Austria, Croatia, Germany and Hungary among other nations, had European assets worth 13 billion euros by 31 December 2020. It is 8am in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv as residents wake to the now-familiar sound of air raid sirens and an aftermath of destruction. Local media and journalists on the ground are reporting sounds of emergency warnings throughout the city, just hours after two Russian missiles struck the TV tower, killing five people and leaving five others injured as well as knocking out some access to news and broadcasts. Late in the evening more explosions were reported in residential neighbourhoods. The mood in the city, however, remains defiant. “Kyiv is bloodied but still standing,” one reporter said this morning. Meanwhile, Russian troops reportedly landed in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second largest city, overnight. Ukrainian authorities said at approximately 3am local time, Russian airborne troops landed and engaged in heavy fighting with Ukrainian forces. The city, with a population of about 1.5 million, had been encircled for days and saw at least six people killed when the region’s administrative building on Freedom Square was hit with what was believed to be a missile. Another 10 people were killed and 35 wounded by a series of missile strikes on homes and offices in the city on Tuesday. They included a long-range rocket fired at the city’s main regional administrative building, a symbol of Ukrainian statehood. In step with the recent outpouring of economic relief to Ukraine, Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen said on Wednesday that she, Vice President William Lai and Premier Su Tseng-chang will each donate one month’s salary to help with humanitarian relief efforts for Ukraine, Reuters reports. Ukraine’s besieged cities have come under more heavy bombardment after Russian commanders facing fierce resistance intensified their shelling of urban areas. Here is where Russian troops currently stand. Mobile-phone video shows wrecked residential buildings with no windows, and fallen trees and power lines, in the aftermath of strikes that killed at least 11 people in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second largest city on Monday. Kharkiv’s regional administration chief said artillery had pounded residential districts. The city has been the target of some of the worst aerial attacks since Ukraine was invaded by Russian forces. Moscow’s stock market will stay closed for the third consecutive day on Wednesday, the Moscow Times reports. Russian brokers have been ordered to reject sell orders from foreign investors when the market eventually reopens. Researchers are gathering evidence of possible Russian war crimes in Ukraine. My colleague, Dan Sabbagh, reports that an ‘open-source intelligence community’ is already collecting and studying video and photo evidence that Russia’s military is committing war crimes with deadly attacks on civilians and the use of cluster munitions. Eliot Higgins, the founder of the investigative journalism site Bellingcat, said there was evidence of Russia causing “civilian harm”, including through the use of “cluster bombs in civilian areas”, from credible video and stills of the conflict. Footage of an attack on a car park in Kharkiv on Monday, described by a Bellingcat researcher as a cluster bomb strike, shows residents walking in a nearby park just as the sequence of bombs go off. The area appears to be residential. Dashcam footage, assessed by Russia’s Conflict Intelligence Team to have been shot in Kharkiv, is thought to show a cluster bomb landing in a road last Friday. The driver makes a hasty U-turn as explosions rain around the car. Given the lack of aircraft noise, the bomb was probably fired by a Russian Grad rocket system, the researchers conclude. Twitter will comply with the European Union’s sanctions on Russian state-affiliated media RT and Sputnik when the EU order takes effect, the social network said on Tuesday. “The European Union (EU) sanctions will likely legally require us to withhold certain content in EU member states,” a Twitter spokesperson said in an emailed statement to Reuters. “We intend to comply with the order when it goes into effect.” Outside the EU, Twitter would continue to focus on reducing the visibility of content from these outlets as well as labelling it. The United Nations General Assembly is set to reprimand Russia on Wednesday over its invasion of Ukraine and demand that Moscow stop fighting and withdraw its military forces, a move that aims to diplomatically isolate Russia at the world body, Reuters reports. More reports are coming in following a fire at a hospital in Kharkiv overnight. According to an alert issued just before 3am from Ukraine’s State Special Communications agency, Russian soldiers attacked a military medical clinical centre hospital in the city’s north. Kharkiv region police chief Volodymyr Tymoshko told reporters on Wednesday that no Ukrainian troops were killed in the gun battle, the BBC reports. “Currently the situation near the hospital is under control, security has been strengthened,” he said, according to Ukrainian media. The Guardian has not been able to verify the latest reports out of Kharkiv but the city had been encircled by Russian forces for days. At least six people were reported to have been killed when the region’s administrative building on Freedom Square was hit with what was believed to be a missile. Russia president Vladimir Putin has signed a decree to prohibit Russians from leaving the country with more than $10,000 in foreign currency, Russia state media outlet TASS reports. Citing the decree, the news agency reported: The export of foreign currency cash and foreign currency instruments over $10,000 calculated based on the official exchange rate set by the Russian Central Bank on the day of export will be banned starting on March 2.” The move is an attempt to “ensure Russia’s financial stability” according to a statement from the Kremlin press office. It comes in response to the crippling sanctions western nations have imposed on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. US president Joe Biden delivered his first State of the Union address from Capitol Hill on Tuesday evening, commending the Ukrainian people’s resolve to fight and vowing that Putin must “pay a price” for his actions in Ukraine. Six days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. He met the Ukrainian people. From President Zelenskiy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland ... Throughout our history we’ve learned this lesson when dictators do not pay a price for their aggression they cause more chaos. They keep moving. Putin’s latest attack on Ukraine was premeditated and unprovoked. He rejected repeated efforts at diplomacy. He thought the west and Nato wouldn’t respond. And he thought he could divide us at home. Putin was wrong. We were ready. Here is what we did. We prepared extensively and carefully.” Biden then said the free world will hold the Russian president accountable. We are inflicting pain on Russia and supporting the people of Ukraine. Putin is now isolated from the world more than ever. Putin has unleashed violence and chaos. But while he may make gains on the battlefield – he will pay a continuing high price over the long run. When the history of this era is written Putin’s war on Ukraine will have left Russia weaker and the rest of the world stronger. In the battle between democracy and autocracy, democracies are rising to the moment, and the world is clearly choosing the side of peace and security. This is a real test. It’s going to take time. So let us continue to draw inspiration from the iron will of the Ukrainian people. Putin may circle Kyiv with tanks, but he will never gain the hearts and souls of the Ukrainian people. He will never extinguish their love of freedom. He will never weaken the resolve of the free world.” The United States will ban Russian flights from its airspace, US president Joe Biden has just confirmed. Tonight, I’m announcing that we will join our allies in closing off American airspace to all Russian flights, further isolating Russia and adding an additional squeeze on our economy.” The decision follows similar moves made by the European Union and Canada. The US Department of Transportation and Federal Aviation Administration said orders blocking Russian aircraft and airlines from entering and using all US airspace will be fully in effect by the end of Wednesday. The orders suspend operations of all aircraft owned, certified, operated, registered, chartered, leased, or controlled by, for, or for the benefit of, any Russia citizen. This includes passenger and cargo flights, and scheduled as well as charter flights that will “effectively closing US air space to all Russian commercial air carriers and other Russian civil aircraft,” the department said. Russian troops have reportedly landed in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second most populous city, according to the Security Service of Ukraine. Ukrainian authorities said at approximately 3am local time, Russian airborne troops landed and engaged in heavy fighting with Ukrainian forces. “A Russian landing party landed in Kharkiv,” an alert from Ukraine’s State Special Communications agency read just before 3am. The agency said the soldiers attacked the military medical clinical centre hospital, adding that a “battle broke out between the invaders and the Ukrainian defenders.” The city, with a population of about 1.5 million, has been encircled for days and saw at least six people killed when the region’s administrative building on Freedom Square was hit with what was believed to be a missile. The attack on Freedom Square — Ukraine’s largest plaza, and the nucleus of public life in the city — was seen by many Ukrainians as brazen evidence that the Russian invasion wasn’t just about hitting military targets but also about breaking their spirit. The bombardment blew out windows and walls of buildings that ring the massive square, which was piled high with debris and dust. “People are under the ruins. We have pulled out bodies,” said Yevhen Vasylenko, an emergency official. Zelenskiy pronounced the attack on the square “frank, undisguised terror” and a war crime. “This is state terrorism of the Russian Federation,” he said. In Kherson on the Black Sea in southern Ukraine, Russian forces have taken control of the railway station and the port overnight, city mayor Igor Kolykhayev was quoted by local media, Agence France-Press reports. Officials yesterday reported Russian checkpoints encircling the city. “The city is under shelling,” Kolykhayev wrote on his official Facebook page on Tuesday, adding that residential houses were burning and urging residents to stay off the streets. Hello, I’m Samantha Lock and welcome to our continuing live coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war. It is 6.30am in Kyiv where Ukrainians are battling to save their capital city after a six-day assault. Russian troops are believed to be getting closer. Here’s where we stand right now: Russian troops have reportedly landed in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second most populous city, according to the security service of Ukraine. Russian partatroopers reportedly landed at around 3am local time (1am GMT) and engaged in heavy fighting with Ukrainian forces. Kyiv and other cities in Ukraine are coming under more bombardment in the early hours of Wednesday morning as the Russian military steps up its offensive and moves forces closer towards the capital. Joe Biden’s used his State of the Union address to warn Vladimir Putin that he cannot divide the west and that dictators should “pay a price for their aggression”. He won a standing ovation for his praise of the Ukrainian resistance against what he called Russian “tyranny”. Biden also announced that the US is closing American airspace to all Russian flights, “further isolating Russia”. Four people have been killed after homes in the city of Zhytomyr west of Kyiv were hit by a cruise missile apparently aimed at a nearby airbase, Anton Gerashchenko, adviser to the interior minister, said on his Telegram channel. The southern cities of Kherson and Mariupol are likely now encircled by the Russians, according to the UK Ministry of Defence. Thousands of Ukrainians are trying to leave Kyiv, our correspondent in Kyiv reported, as Russia’s defence ministry warned residents to leave as it plans to strike targets in the Ukrainian capital. The UN says more than 680,000 people have already fled the country. The IMF and the World Bank have condemned the Russian action in Ukraine and the “horrifying” suffering of people there. The organisations pledged a $3bn package of support for the country. Apple has said it will pause all product sales in Russia while Boeing is suspending “major operations” in Moscow, as well as “parts, maintenance, and technical support services for Russian airlines”. Ford and the British carmaker Jaguar Land Rover have also suspended operations, along with Nike. Brent crude oil has soared 5.8% to $111.09 a barrel, its highest since 2014. The Russian rouble has fallen again in early trading on Wednesday to hit 109.2 to the dollar.

It’s tempting to say yes, as he serves up an election-year memoir that provides a veritable arsenal of ammunition for Democrats to hurl at the president between now and 3 November. As the title suggests, The Room Where it Happened supplies first-hand confirmation that everything Trump’s enemies have long said about him is true, from the trivial to the grave. Trump is comically ignorant. At one point, he asks his chief of staff if Finland is part of Russia and, at a Chequers meeting with Theresa May, he registers surprise on hearing that the UK is a nuclear power. The Trump Bolton describes is useless and incompetent, running a dysfunctional White House: one chapter is titled “Chaos as a way of life”. He’s also unhinged. Trump became obsessed with getting a CD of Elton John’s Rocket Man through to Kim Jong-un as a gift, even if that meant breaking US sanctions on North Korea. He thought “it would be ‘cool’ to invade Venezuela”. He told aides that journalists who refused to reveal their sources should be jailed or executed. The president’s most trenchant critics are often accused of hyperbole or hysteria, charged with “Trump derangement syndrome”. But this account, written not by some NPR liberal but by a Fox News hawk, confirms that we’re right to speak of the wickedness of Donald Trump. Perhaps the most damning of all of Bolton’s revelations is the blessing that the president gave to a truly appalling and continuing atrocity. At a G20 meeting in Osaka, China’s Xi Jinping explained to Trump why his country was “basically building concentration camps” in Xinjiang province for the internment of a million or more members of the largely Muslim Uighur minority. Bolton writes: “Trump said that Xi should go ahead with building the camps, which he thought was exactly the right thing to do.” Thanks to Bolton, we now have yet more evidence that the impeachment case tried against Trump earlier this year was rock solid – that he did indeed, as the first article of impeachment alleged, abuse his power for political gain. Bolton confirms the quid pro quo that should have seen Trump removed from office, whereby Trump refused to release $391m in congressionally mandated security assistance for Ukraine unless and until that country’s president promised to dig up, or manufacture, dirt on Joe Biden. What’s more, Bolton makes clear that Ukraine was no one-off. Urging foreign powers, including hostile ones, to intervene in US domestic politics is a Trump habit. Bolton recalls how the president began “pleading with Xi to ensure he’d win” in November, urging China to buy more US soybeans and wheat, in order to boost Trump in the crucial farm states. In return, Trump would lower trade tariffs on Chinese goods. Bolton has provided the proof that while Trump may pose as a strongman, he is a coward in the face of those he deems stronger. Bolton knew Trump wouldn’t have the steel to confront Vladimir Putin over Russian attempts to subvert US elections, so he set out the case on a piece of paper: that way, Trump would merely have to hand the paper to Putin to register US objections. But Trump wouldn’t even do that. Similarly, Bolton reveals that the US president promised to halt criminal cases against two companies, one Chinese and one Turkish, to placate Xi and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. This was “obstruction of justice as a way of life”, writes Bolton, born of Trump’s penchant for giving “personal favours to dictators he liked”. The campaign ads for Biden, currently leading Trump by 50% to 38% in the battleground states, almost write themselves. Some Democrats will feel grateful for that. And yet to read Bolton’s book is to feel ever more furious – not at Trump, whose vileness and venality have been visible from the start, but at Bolton. If he knew all this, if he saw all this up close, why didn’t he speak out earlier, when it could have made a difference? The question is sharpest in the context of impeachment. The Democrat-controlled House of Representatives asked Bolton, who had already quit the White House by then, to testify, but he refused. He wanted to be dragged to the witness table, forced to talk by a subpoena. That would have taken months of legal wrangling, time the Democrats calculated they did not have (probably rightly, as it turned out, given the coronavirus pandemic). And so, without Bolton, Democrats had to rely on secondhand witnesses, allowing Republicans to pretend the impeachment case rested on hearsay. He said he would testify to the Senate if it voted to call him, but the Republican majority in that body would never let that happen. So Bolton kept his secrets, spilling them instead for a $2m publishing deal. Incredibly, Bolton has the cheek to criticise the Democrats for their mishandling of impeachment, for failing to expose the wider pattern of Trump’s corrupt behaviour. Well, whose fault was that? He knew better than anyone the scale of the problem, but he did not speak out. Bolton is complaining that the fire department never put out the blaze next door, when it was he who refused to call 911. In this, Bolton has ample company. He stands with those senators who would not subpoena his testimony, and with all those Republicans who have acted as enablers of Trump from day one. They pose and preen as patriots, with the flag on their lapels and their constant invocations of national security, and yet when the republic faced a danger unlike any in its history, they failed to do their duty. John Bolton does not deserve Americans’ thanks. He deserves their scorn. • Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2020/jul/20/psycho-raab-confused-at-being-the-biggest-dove-in-the-commons-on-china","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2020-07-20T19:11:02Z","webTitle":"Psycho Raab confused at being the biggest dove in the Commons on China | John Crace","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jul/20/psycho-raab-confused-at-being-the-biggest-dove-in-the-commons-on-china","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2020/jul/20/psycho-raab-confused-at-being-the-biggest-dove-in-the-commons-on-china","fields":{"headline":"Psycho Raab confused at being the biggest dove in the Commons on China","bodyText":"Sometimes you just can’t win. Just a week after announcing he was barring Huawei from the UK’s 5G network by 2027 – the Chinese had apparently promised they wouldn’t do any spying in the next seven years – Dominic Raab was back in the Commons to make yet another ministerial statement. This time to indefinitely suspend the extradition treaty with Hong Kong and to impose an arms embargo on the territory. Try to think of it as “tough love”, the foreign secretary insisted. If we didn’t adore the Chinese so much and admire their progress this century then we wouldn’t be making such a fuss. But now we had such high expectations of them, it was only right that we submit China to the same level of scrutiny as we would any other country. Apart from the ones with appalling records of human rights abuses from which we made a small fortune flogging arms. Those could all be safely overlooked. “The UK is watching,” Raab said grandly, the vein in his neck throbbing with intent. Somehow he manages to look even more terrifying when he’s trying to sound reasonable than when he’s going full-on psycho. He had liaised on these sanctions with the UK’s Five Eyes partners and was hoping to achieve the same level of coordination with European allies. If only there was an organisation uniting 27 European countries that the UK could join, then it would have been a whole lot easier. Typical Europe. Never there when you really need it. Yet despite Raab’s best efforts to take a tough line with China, it still wasn’t enough to satisfy MPs from both sides of the house. Lisa Nandy, the shadow foreign secretary, damned him with faint praise. Dom had taken some decent first baby steps, the Labour MP said, but there was so much more he could have done. If the UK was so worried about Chinese involvement in sensitive areas affecting national security, then how come we were letting them build a couple of nuclear power stations for us? Raab stuck his fingers in his ears and pretended he hadn’t heard. Nandy was also surprised the government wasn’t more bothered about China’s treatment of the Uighur Muslims and wanted to know why Magnitsky sanctions had not been taken out against some known individual offenders. Raab ummed and ahhed. It was all very difficult. No one cared more about the persecution – genocide was a terribly ugly word – of an ethnic minority than him. However, you also had to remember that China was the world’s second most powerful economy and so for the time being he would prefer to give it the benefit of the doubt. But he was definitely keeping an eye on the situation. This rather set the tone for the rest of the session. Conservative Tom Tugendhat chalked up the sanctions as a win for the foreign affairs select committee, which he coincidentally chairs, and wondered if Raab might care to consider some of its other, more hawkish, recommendations in relation to China. Others weren’t quite so keen to credit Tugendhat as they rather fancied taking some of the plaudits for the hardening of the line themselves. But a consistent theme emerged. It wasn’t sinophobic to take action against China’s human rights abuses and to be concerned about the Uighurs: it was what any decent country would do. By the end, Raab appeared somewhat bemused. It’s not every day he is the biggest dove in the chamber and you could sense him longing to go berserk and impose any number of sanctions on the Chinese. Just as a matter of macho pride. But he just about held it together till the close, though you wouldn’t bet against a pile of corpses being found in the Thames tomorrow morning as Raab tries to exorcise his pent-up frustration. Recess can’t come too soon for Dom. The same could also be said for Matt Hancock, who was also forced into making a Commons statement following Boris Johnson’s rather optimistic Santa Claus press conference last week saying the UK would basically be back to normal in time for Christmas. Presumably the prime minister still hasn’t got round to reading the report from the Academy of Medical Sciences that suggested the country could be facing a further 120,000 deaths over the course of the winter. Mattbeth looked defeated from the start as he tried to channel Boris’s mindless optimism. The track-and-trace system was working brilliantly because it had managed to track down 180,000 while missing an equal number of contacts. Realising that was the only even vaguely good news on offer, Hancock tried to claim the early reported successes of the Oxford and Imperial vaccine trials as a triumph for the government, rather than for the scientists. “We have a plan and it is working,” he said, fooling no one but himself. There was a time when Jon Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, used to do his best to boost Hancock’s confidence by offering him emotional support from the dispatch box. “You’re doing really well Matt. Honestly.” But even Ashworth hasn’t been able to keep up that level of encouragement in the face of repeated government incompetence, and so this time he just let rip with a long dose of honesty. The track-and-trace numbers were crap. The app was non-existent. Local authorities weren’t getting the data they needed. The government had ignored Sage advice. The chief nursing officer had been silenced by the government for not giving the thumbs up to Dominic Cummings’ Durham safari. There was no plan in place other than waiting on a miracle of a vaccine appearing. Wasn’t it time to level with the public? Over the last few weeks, Mattbeth has been getting progressively more tetchy. He’s done his best but it hasn’t been good enough. And even his best efforts have been undermined by Boris. He knows the government has been found out yet cannot bring himself to admit it. Because if he did then he might need to ask himself why he doesn’t have the self-worth to resign. Instead, time and again he allows himself to be trampled on. Hancock couldn’t contain himself. Rather than answer the questions, he attacked Ashworth for no longer being supportive. Just like Boris, he now mistakes reasonable scrutiny for a personal attack. The MPs in the chamber kept their heads down, trying to avoid making eye contact with the health secretary. It’s never comfortable to watch a minister breaking down in public."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/nov/14/closing-nuclear-plants-risks-rise-in-greenhouse-gas-emissions-report-warns","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-11-14T11:00:03Z","webTitle":"Closing nuclear plants risks rise in greenhouse gas emissions, report warns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/14/closing-nuclear-plants-risks-rise-in-greenhouse-gas-emissions-report-warns","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/nov/14/closing-nuclear-plants-risks-rise-in-greenhouse-gas-emissions-report-warns","fields":{"headline":"Closing nuclear plants risks rise in greenhouse gas emissions, report warns","bodyText":"Looming climate breakdown is opening fresh divisions among environmentalists over nuclear energy, with a major advocacy group calling for struggling nuclear plants to be propped up to avoid losing their low-carbon power. Nuclear is the single largest source of low-carbon electricity in the US. But a third of nuclear plants are unprofitable or scheduled to close, risking a rise in greenhouse gas emissions if they are replaced by coal or natural gas, a major Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) report has found. US emissions could increase by as much as 6% if struggling plants are shuttered early, the report warns. This scenario has put pressure on many environmental groups to re-evaluate their intrinsic opposition to nuclear energy as a dangerous blight that must be eradicated. “We are running out of time to make the emissions reductions needed to avoid the worst impacts of the climate crisis,” said Steve Clemmer, director of energy research for the UCS climate and energy program. “Losing a low-carbon source of electricity like nuclear power is going to make decarbonization even harder than it already is. Nuclear has risks, it’s not a perfect technology, but there have to be trade-offs.” The US, like the rest of the world, faces a steep challenge to avoid the worst ravages of heatwaves, drought, extreme weather and flooding. The IPCC report states emissions must reach net zero by 2050 to avoid the most punishing climate change impacts, whereas the Trump administration is currently dismantling every major policy aimed at lowering emissions in the US. The US has an ageing fleet of nearly 100 reactors at 60 nuclear plants, with many nearing the ends of their expected lifetimes. Five plants have shut down since 2013, with a further five set to shutter over the next eight years. In total, a third of US nuclear power plants are set to close down or are unprofitable largely due to a major shift to cheaper natural gas. As nuclear provides more than half of the US’s low-carbon energy, this situation “raises serious concerns about our ability to achieve the deep cuts in carbon emissions needed to limit the worst impacts of climate change”, the UCS report states. Replacements for nuclear will vary across the country. The huge Diablo Canyon plant in California, for example, will probably spawn a surge in renewable energy when it shuts in 2025. But in other states, such as Ohio and Pennsylvania, weak clean energy policies and the abundance of natural gas mean the closure of nuclear plants will probably raise emissions. “Renewables can fill a lot of the gap but it’s a timing issue,” Clemmer said. “Over a long timeframe we can ramp up renewables and phase out coal, gas and nuclear generation but we don’t have that time. We have to cut half of all emissions by 2030, according to the IPCC. We can’t physically ramp up renewables fast enough.” Anti-nuclear campaigning has been a foundational shibboleth for groups such as Greenpeace, which has pointed to disasters such as Chernobyl in 1986 and Fukushima in 2011 as evidence that the sector should be shut down. While the UCS have never been militant opponents of nuclear power, Clemmer said “we are getting a bit more vocal” about the benefits of keeping plants open as the scale of the climate crisis has become clearer. Many opponents remain implacable, however. “Nuclear reactors are a bad bet for a climate strategy,” said Dr Gregory Jaczko, who was chairman of the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission during the Obama administration. “The Union of Concerned Scientist models don’t reflect the reality of the United States electricity market. Renewables are getting cheaper faster than expected and are in some cases the least expensive source of electricity.” Jaczko said new nuclear is a “financial boondoggle”, with investments better placed in solar or wind. “Employing nuclear for climate change is like Dorothy seeking the Wizard of Oz to get home,” he added. “It’s an expensive enticing mirage.” Clemmer said he agreed that new nuclear plants are enormously expensive but said there was a case for the US government to invest around $814m a year to keep existing unprofitable plants online, given the cleaner energy they provide. “Environmental groups may come round to this, but I’m just not sure,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/sep/16/russia-ukraine-war-zelenskiy-compares-scenes-in-izium-to-bucha-massacre-live-updates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-16T20:04:36Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: senior pro-Russian officials reported killed; Ukraine says mass grave found at Izium – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/sep/16/russia-ukraine-war-zelenskiy-compares-scenes-in-izium-to-bucha-massacre-live-updates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/sep/16/russia-ukraine-war-zelenskiy-compares-scenes-in-izium-to-bucha-massacre-live-updates","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: senior pro-Russian officials reported killed; Ukraine says mass grave found at Izium – as it happened","bodyText":"It’s just past 11pm in Kyiv. Here’s where things stand: UN member states voted Friday to make an exception to allow Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskiy to address next week’s General Assembly by video, despite Russian opposition. Of the 193 member states, 101 voted in favor of allowing Zelenskiy to “present a pre-recorded statement” instead of in-person as usually required. Seven members voted against the proposal, including Russia. Nineteen states abstained. Ninety-nine percent of exhumed bodies had signs of violent death, Ukraine’s regional administration head said Friday of the mass burial site discovered after Kyiv’s forces recaptured the east Ukrainian town of Izium. “Among the bodies that were exhumed today, 99 percent showed signs of violent death,” Oleg Synegubov, head of Kharkiv regional administration, said on social media. The European Union is “deeply shocked” at the discovery by Ukrainian officials of mass graves in the recaptured city of Izium, the bloc’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said Friday. “The European Union is deeply shocked by mass graves discovered by Ukrainian authorities,...” said Borrell. “We condemn these atrocities in the strongest possible terms. Ukrainian armed forces have hit four areas with Russian troops, according to the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The armed forces also targeted an unloading station, in turn preventing Russian forces from deploying additional reserves. UN member states voted Friday to make an exception to allow Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskiy to address next week’s General Assembly by video, despite Russian opposition. Of the 193 member states, 101 voted in favor of allowing Zelenskiy to “present a pre-recorded statement” instead of in-person as usually required. Seven members voted against the proposal, including Russia. Nineteen states abstained. From Tuesday, approximately 150 world leaders will address the General Assembly in New York. World leaders were allowed to speak by video in 2020 and in 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic, but this year the event has gone back to in-person and only those present can speak. More than 50 states, including the United States, France, South Korea and Turkey, submitted a proposal to make an exception for Zelenskiy. The text highlighted situations in which leaders “cannot participate in person in the meetings of the General Assembly for reasons beyond their control owing to ongoing foreign invasion, aggression, military hostilities.” Those in favor decided “that Ukraine may submit a pre-recorded statement of its Head of State” that will be played during the general debate. The decision noted, however, that the exception was not setting a precedent for future debates. An amendment introduced by Russia-ally Belarus that would have allowed all leaders prevented from coming to New York in person to send a pre-recorded message was rejected by 67 votes against, 23 for, and 27 abstentions. Ukraine’s address is scheduled for the afternoon of September 21, but changes are likely due to many leaders traveling to London for the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II on Monday. Ninety-nine percent of exhumed bodies had signs of violent death, Ukraine’s regional administration head said Friday of the mass burial site discovered after Kyiv’s forces recaptured the east Ukrainian town of Izium. “Among the bodies that were exhumed today, 99 percent showed signs of violent death,” Oleg Synegubov, head of Kharkiv regional administration, said on social media, Agence France-Presse reports. “There are several bodies with their hands tied behind their backs, and one person is buried with a rope around his neck,” he added. “Obviously, these people were tortured and executed.” Earlier Friday, AFP journalists saw that at least one of the bodies uncovered at the burial site in a forest outside Izium had bound hands. It was unclear, given the condition of the body, whether the victim was wearing civilian clothes or a military uniform. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy lashed out at Russia after officials began exhuming bodies from the site. “Russia leaves only death and suffering. Murderers. Torturers,” Zelensky said in a statement on social media, adding that children were among the more than 400 bodies discovered. The European Union is “deeply shocked” at the discovery by Ukrainian officials of mass graves in the recaptured city of Izium, the bloc’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said Friday, Agence France-Presse reports. “The European Union is deeply shocked by mass graves discovered by Ukrainian authorities,...” said Borrell. “We condemn these atrocities in the strongest possible terms. “Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine has been leaving a trail of blood and destruction across Ukraine,” he added. Borrell’s statement came after Ukrainian investigators uncovered hundreds of hastily buried bodies from a forest outside the city in the eastern Kharkiv region. Kyiv officials say they have counted 450 graves at the mass burial site and found 10 alleged “torture centres” after the Kharkiv region was recaptured from Russian invaders. “Thousands of civilians have been already murdered, many more tortured, harassed, sexually assaulted, kidnapped, or forcibly displaced,” said Borrell, adding, “Russia, its political leadership, and all those involved in the ongoing violations of international law and international humanitarian law in Ukraine will be held accountable.” Ukrainian armed forces have hit four areas with Russian troops, according to the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, the Kyiv Independent reports. The armed forces also targeted an unloading station, in turn preventing Russian forces from deploying additional reserves. Russia has accused Ukraine of carrying out targeted strikes in the cities of Kherson and Luhansk against top local officials who have been collaborating with Moscow. At least five Himars missiles crashed into the central administration building in Kherson, which Russian troops have occupied since March after arriving from Crimea. Video from the scene showed smoke pouring out of the complex and debris. On the other side of the country, in the eastern city of Luhansk, a pro-Russian prosecutor died together with his deputy when their office was blown up. The cause of the explosion was not immediately clear. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s senior adviser, Mikhailo Podolyak, said Ukraine was not behind Friday’s mysterious explosion in Luhansk. Further south, the Russian-backed separatist authority in Berdiansk was also blaming Kyiv for the “double murder” of the deputy head of the military civil administration, and his wife, who headed the city’s territorial election commission for the referendum. Also in the the southern Zaporizhzhia oblast, there were reports on Friday of a “powerful explosion” in the Russian-occupied Melitopol, said Ivan Fedorov, mayor of Melitopol. “I hope the Russian fascists have suffered losses, among their personnel and equipment. Awaiting good news from the armed forces of Ukraine,” he said. Up north, investigators continue the daunting task of exhuming the mass grave site discovered at the recently liberated city of Izium in the Kharkiv region. Zelenskiy has responded emotionally today, condemning Russia as “murderers” and “torturers”. Meanwhile, the exact circumstances surrounding the deaths of those buried at the grave site are still unclear. While Oleg Synegubov, the regional governor, said that about 99% of the bodies exhumed showed signs of a violent deaths, authorities said that violence could have also been from shelling or airstrikes – not the torture and beatings that many feared after what authorities discovered in Bucha and other previously liberated territories. However, Synegubov said exhumers have also already uncovered several bodies with their hands tied behind their backs, and one person “with a rope around his neck.” Dmytro Lubinets, the Ukrainian parliament commissioner for human rights, described finding an entire family, killed in an airstrike, buried together – young parents in their 30s, a 6-year-old daughter, and grandparents. Russian president Vladimir Putin made his first public comment since his troops were forced to withdraw from the territories they held in the north-east, a move that has prompted unusually strong public criticism from Russian military commentators. He claimed that he invaded Ukraine because the West wanted to break up Russia. He grinned when he was asked about Ukraine’s recent military success. “Let’s see how it develops, how it ends up,” he said. Putin said nothing has changed with the ultimate goal of Moscow’s “special military operation” in Ukraine, which was to capture the Donbas. The US department of defence announced today that it was providing an additional $600m security assistance to Ukraine to meet the country’s “critical security and defence needs”. In total, the Biden administration has committed about $15.8n in security assistance to Ukraine – $15.1bn since the beginning of Russian invasion on 24 February. Since 2014, the US has committed about $17.9bn in security assistance to Ukraine. Switzerland on Friday aligned itself with the European Union in suspending a 2009 agreement easing rules for Russian citizens to enter the Alpine country. “The suspension of the agreement does not mean a general visa freeze for Russians but rather they will need to use the ordinary visa procedure to enter Switzerland,” the country’s federal council said in a statement. The EU took a similar step earlier, suspending a visa facilitation deal with Russia but stopping short of a wider via ban in response to Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. Russian president Vladimir Putin on Friday brushed off Ukraine’s recent military success in recapturing the Kharkiv region, saying Russia was gradually taking control of new areas of the country, Reuters is reporting. Speaking after a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation in the Uzbek city of Samarkand, he said that the plan of the “special military operation” that is the Russian invasion of Ukraine “is not subject to adjustment”. “The General Staff considers one thing important, another thing secondary - but the main task remains unchanged, and it is being implemented,” Putin said. “The main goal is the liberation of the entire territory of Donbas.” The Donbas is an area comprised of two largely Russian-speaking provinces of eastern Ukraine - Luhansk, which is now fully under the control of Russian and Russian-backed separatist forces, and Donetsk, which they partially control. Right now, Russia currently occupies about a fifth of Ukraine in all, including much of the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson provinces in the south, in addition to Crimea, which it seized in 2014 and considers part of Russia. On Friday, the Russian-backed separatist governments in cities in these regions blamed Kyiv for at least three attacks that resulted in the deaths of at least five individuals working for the Russian-backed entities. At the same time, however, Moscow has struck back at Ukraine’s recent military success in liberating occupied territory by shelling civilian infrastructure, including several hydraulic structures in Kryvyi Rih, the hometown of Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, which led to flooding and evacuations. “Recently, the Russian armed forces have inflicted a couple of sensitive blows. Let’s assume they’re a warning,” Putin said. When questioned about Ukraine’s dramatic counter-offensive, Putin responded with a grin. “The Kyiv authorities announced that they have launched and are conducting an active counter-offensive operation. Well, let’s see how it develops, how it ends up,” Putin said. This was Putin’s first public comment since his troops were forced to withdraw from the territories they held in the north-east, a move that has prompted unusually strong public criticism from Russian military commentators. Putin added, “If the situation continues to develop like this, then the response will be more serious.” The people of Ukraine and the world “deserve to know how exactly those buried in the forest near Izium have died”, Marie Struthers, Amnesty International’s director for Eastern Europe and Central Asia said in a statement today. “For every unlawful killing or other war crime, there must be justice and reparation for victims and their families and a fair trial and accountability for suspected perpetrators,” Struthers said. Since Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February, Amnesty International has documented a number of violations of humanitarian law by Russian forces, including unlawful attacks on civilians, residential buildings and civilian infrastructure, unlawful killings and other war crimes. “Those who commit or order crimes under international law should remember: there is no statute of limitation, and justice will catch up with them,” Struthers said. “To ensure justice and reparation for victims, trials of those suspected of war crimes must adhere to international standards for fair trial.” At the mass grave site in Izium, about 99% of the bodies exhumed today showed signs of a violent death, said Oleg Synegubov, the regional governor, on Telegram. “This is bloody, brutal terror,” he said. Synegubov described how many of the graves weren’t even marked with names – just with numbers. While authorities said some of those buried at the grave site had likely been killed by shelling and airstrikes, investigators have prepared themselves for the worst, after the discoveries of dead civilians bearing signs of torture in Bucha and other previously occupied territories. Synegubov said that today, exhumers uncovered several bodies with their hands tied behind their backs, and one person “with a rope around his neck.” “Obviously, these people were tortured and executed,” he said “There are also children among the buried.” Investigators will conduct forensic examinations on the exhumed bodies. “After the identities of the dead have been identified, all of them will be buried with due respect,” Synegubov said. “Each death will be investigated and will become evidence of Russia’s war crimes in international courts.” Investigators and exhumers are still hard at work at the mass grave site discovered at Izium, one of the many recently liberated villages in the Kharkiv region. Dmytro Lubinets, the Ukrainian parliament commissioner for human rights, described finding an entire family, killed in an airstrike, buried together. “This is a young family,” he wrote on Telegram. “The father was born in 1988, the wife was born in 1991, their little daughter was born in 2016, and their parents. We have testimonies from local people that they all died as a result of an airstrike carried out by planes of the military army of the Russian Federation. There are many, many similar cases.” Lubinets said investigators have also exhumed the bodies of Ukrainian army servicemen, who were killed at close range, with their hands tied. “This is the genocide of the Ukrainian nation,” Lubinets said. “These are the murders of our children, our women, our men, and this is the civilian population.” Russian president Vladimir Putin on Friday said he sent Russian forces into Ukraine in February in response to the West wanting to break up Russia, Reuters is reporting. Putin was speaking at a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation. Discussing the war publicly for the first time since Ukraine’s dramatic counter-offensive ousted Russian troops from the Kharkiv region last week, Putin threatened continued strikes on Ukrainian infrastructure, and said: “We will see how (Ukraine’s counteroffensive) ends.” The US department of defence announced today that it was providing an additional $600m security assistance to Ukraine to meet the country’s “critical security and defence needs”. According to the defence department, this package will include: Additional ammunition for high mobility artillery rocket systems (HIMARS) 36,000 105mm artillery rounds 1,000 precision-guided 155mm artillery rounds Four counter-artillery radars Four trucks and eight trailers to transport heavy equipment Counter-unmanned aerial Systems Mine-clearing equipment Claymore anti-personnel munitions Demolition munitions and equipment Small arms and ammunition Night-vision devices, cold weather gear, and other field equipment In total, the Biden administration has committed about $15.8n in security assistance to Ukraine – $15.1bn since the beginning of Russian invasion on 24 February. Since 2014, the US has committed about $17.9bn in security assistance to Ukraine. Warning: graphic images Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy posted images today of bodies exhumed from the mass grave site discovered at Izium, condemning Russia as “murderers” and “torturers”. Investigators have prepared themselves for the worst here in Izium, one of the recently liberated territories in the Kharkiv region, after the discoveries of dead civilians bearing signs of torture in Bucha and other previously occupied territories. Oleg Synegubov, the regional governor, said some of the more than 440 bodies buried in a forest near the north-eastern city also had their hands tied behind their backs, an indicator that some of those buried at this site may not have just died in shelling and airstrikes as previously thought. “The whole world should see this,” Zelenskiy wrote on Telegram. “A world in which there should be no cruelty and terrorism. But all this is there. And its name is Russia.” He continued: More than 400 bodies were found at the mass burial site in Izium. With signs of torture, children, those killed as a result of missile attacks, warriors of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Russia leaves only death and suffering. Murderers. Torturers. Deprived of everything human. You won’t run away. You won’t hide. Retribution will be justly dreadful. For every Ukrainian, for every tortured soul. The water of the Inhulets river turned red two days after Russian missiles struck hydraulic structures in Kryvyi Rih in a targeted attack on the infrastructure of Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s hometown. It’s unclear why the river changed colours following the attack, which caused the river level to rise by five metres, flooding parts of the city and prompting evacuation. But beyond the flooding, the residents of this region relied on those water facilities for their clean water, and temporarily lost access to their tap water. Oleksandr Vilkul, the head of the Kryvyi Rih military administration, said on Telegram Friday that “the city’s water supply has been stabilised”. Switzerland on Friday aligned itself with the European Union in suspending a 2009 agreement easing rules for Russian citizens to enter the Alpine country. “The suspension of the agreement does not mean a general visa freeze for Russians but rather they will need to use the ordinary visa procedure to enter Switzerland,” the country’s federal council said in a statement. The EU took a similar step earlier, suspending a visa facilitation deal with Russia but stopping short of a wider via ban in response to Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. “Switzerland has every interest in contributing to a common and uniform visa policy at the European level,” said the government in a media release. “Otherwise, it would risk being faced with an increase in the number of visa applications submitted to its representations abroad by Russian nationals seeking to circumvent EU decisions.” There were reports on Friday of a “powerful explosion” in the Russian-occupied Melitopol, a city in the southern Zaporizhzhia oblast, said Ivan Fedorov, mayor of Melitopol. This comes on the heels of attacks in Kherson and Luhansk that killed at least three individuals who were working for the Russian-backed separatist authorities – in additional to the Berdiansk killings of a deputy administrator and his wife, who headed the city’s territorial election commission for the referendum to join Russia. The Russian-backed separatist authorities in all these regions have laid the blame squarely on Kyiv for all these attacks, but Ukraine has yet to claim responsibility. While details remain scant in the Melitopol explosion, Federov was optimistic on Telegram. “We are waiting for good news,” he wrote. Reuters has just sent an advisory to say that it is withdrawing the story it reported earlier, and which we carried in this live blog, that bodies had been found with rope around their necks in Izium. The advisory note reads “This story is being withdrawn because Reuters reporters did not see the bodies with rope around their necks.” We are awaiting further clarification. Luke Harding is in Kharkiv for the Guardian, and this is his latest report: Russia has accused Ukraine of carrying out targeted strikes in the cities of Kherson and Luhansk against top local officials who have been collaborating with Moscow. At least five Himars missiles crashed into the central administration building in Kherson, which Russian troops have occupied since March after arriving from Crimea. Video from the scene showed smoke pouring out of the complex and debris. On the other side of the country, in the eastern city of Luhansk, a pro-Russian prosecutor died together with his deputy when their office was blown up. The cause of the explosion was not immediately clear. The Kremlin news agency Itar-Tass said Sergey Gorenko died at the scene. He was prosecutor general for the so-called Luhansk People’s Republic, a puppet regime established by Russia in 2014. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s senior adviser, Mikhailo Podolyak, said Ukraine was not behind Friday’s mysterious explosion in Luhansk. It was caused by an internal mafia dispute, or was an attempt to get rid of witnesses, he suggested. “Elimination of so-called ‘LNR prosecutor general’ and his deputy should be considered as showdowns of local organised criminal groups that could not share looted property before a large-scale escape,” Podolyak posted on Twitter. He added: “Or as Russian Federation’s purge of witnesses to war crimes. Investigation will show …” The twin attacks are likely to unnerve Russia’s local proxies in Ukraine. The Kremlin had been planning to stage referendums in Kherson and the neighbouring Zaporizhzhia region, as well as in Donetsk and Luhansk, which Moscow has effectively part-controlled for eight years. But these state-building measures, in which occupied areas would be folded into Russia, have been dropped as a result of military defeats. Ukraine’s armed forces have recaptured almost all of the Kharkiv region in a stunning counter-offensive. Read more of Luke Harding’s report from Kharkiv: Russia accuses Ukraine of targeting pro-Moscow officials Reuters has a quick snap to report that Russian President Vladimir Putin apparently told India’s Narendra Modi that he wanted the conflict in Ukraine to end as soon as possible, but that Ukraine was set on achieving its objectives on the battlefield, according to an Indian TV translation of Putin’s comments at a bilateral meeting. Earlier today, Estonia’s prime minister, Kaja Kallas, urged people “don’t look away” from the images emerging from liberated Ukrainian cities like Izium. She said “This is the face of Russian occupation: towns and cities turned into mass graves. Ukraine has used our military aid with skill and determination. Ukraine can win if we keep supporting them.” This is Martin Belam here with you for the next hour or so. You can reach me at martin.belam@theguardian.com • This post was amended on 16 September 2022 after initially erroneously describing Kaja Kallas as Finland’s prime minister. Finland’s prime minister is Sanna Marin. Multiple bodies have been found in the Izium mass grave site. While authorities said some had been killed by shelling and airstrikes, investigators have prepared themselves for the worst, after the discoveries of dead civilians bearing signs of torture in Bucha and other previously occupied territories. The prosecutor general of the Russian-backed separatist authority in the Luhansk oblast and his deputy were both killed by a bomb blast at their offices on Friday. Local officials of the Russian-backed separatist authority were already blaming Kyiv for the deaths of Sergey Gorenko and Ekaterina Steglenko. More than 360km (224 miles) south, the Russian-backed separatist authority in Berdiansk was also blaming Kyiv for the “double murder” of the deputy head of the military civil administration, and his wife, who headed the city’s territorial election commission for the referendum. Ukraine has not taken responsibility for these four killings, nor the earlier attack in Kherson that left at least one dead and several injured – and that the Russian-backed authority there is also blaming Kyiv for. The prosecutor general’s office of Ukraine has released new figures for children killed and injured since Russia invaded the country on 24 February. The largest number of casualties involving children have come out of the Donetsk oblast in the south-east, which Ukrainian intelligence believes Russia is still focused on occupying fully. This post was edited at 3pm BST on 16 September after a clarification from Reuters news agency. See this post for further details Ukrainian police and forensic experts were helping to exhume the bodies at the site in Izium marked by wooden crosses where authorities said they had found a mass grave containing more than 440 bodies. While authorities said some had been killed by shelling and airstrikes, investigators have prepared themselves for the worst, after the discoveries of slain civilians bearing signs of torture in Bucha and other previously occupied territories. This post was edited at 3pm BST on 16 September after a clarification from Reuters news agency. See this post for further details In the past few hours, at least five Russian-installed officials have been killed in Russian-occupied territory through the south of Ukraine, hundreds of kilometres from each other in Luhansk, in Kherson and in Berdiansk. The Russian-backed separatist authorities blame Kyiv for these deaths. Ukraine has not claimed responsibility for any of these attacks. The Russian-backed separatist authority in Berdiansk has on Friday accused Kyiv of killing the deputy head of military civil administration, and his wife, who headed the city’s territorial election commission for the referendum to join Russia, the city administration said on Telegram. The city administration did not provide details for how Oleg Boyko and his wife, Lyudmila Boyko, were killed in their garage in Berdiansk, which is located in the Zaporizhzhia oblast in the south of Ukraine. But the city administration described the killings as a “double murder”. “This terrible crime will not go unpunished and unanswered,” the post reads. One day ago, with Ukrainian forces quickly closing in, Leonid Pasechnik, the leader of the Russian-backed separatist authority in the Luhansk oblast, addressed concerns, insisting repeatedly that “there is no reason to panic”. Today, a bomb set off at administrative offices killed the Moscow-installed prosecutor general, Sergey Gorenko, and his deputy. “‘There is no reason to panic’, well well …” Serhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk oblast, posted on Telegram yesterday. “Luhansk oblast is coming home and it is inevitable!” The prosecutor general’s office of Ukraine has released new figures for children killed and injured since Russia invaded the country on 24 February. The largest number of casualties involving children have come out of the Donetsk oblast in the south-east, which Ukrainian intelligence believes Russia is still focused on occupying fully. The prosecutor general of the Russian-backed separatist authority in the Luhansk oblast and his deputy were both killed by a bomb blast at their offices on Friday, Reuters is reporting. Sergei Gorenko “died from his injuries as a result of an explosion at his office,” a spokesperson for the emergency services said, according to the Russian news agency Interfax. A colonel in the separatist Luhansk interior ministry told the state-run TASS news agency that Gorenko’s deputy had also been killed. Russian agencies quoted emergency services and local officials as saying the blast had been caused by a bomb. Russian state media is reporting that the Sergey Gorenko, the prosecutor general of the pro-Russian separatist authority in the Luhansk oblast, was killed today in a bombing at his office. The prosecutor general of the pro-Russian separatist authorities in the Luhansk oblast in eastern Ukraine was killed by a bomb at his office on Friday, the Russian Interfax news agency is reporting. Unverified video footage appears to show damage to the building that houses the prosecutor’s office there. More to come. Prosecutors, police officers and journalists are heading to Izium after authorities there said they had found a mass grave containing more than 440 bodies. Some of the people had been killed by shelling and airstrikes, authorities said. Serhiy Bolvinov, the chief police investigator for Kharkiv province, said that forensic investigations would be carried out on every body in the grave, which was reportedly located in woods near the city. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy likened the discovery to what happened in Bucha, on the outskirts of Kyiv, saying in his Thursday night video address: “Russia is leaving death behind it everywhere and must be held responsible. The necessary procedures have already begun there. More information – clear, verifiable information – should be available tomorrow.” Andriy Yermak, presidential chief of staff in Ukraine, accused Russia of being “a murderer country, a state sponsor of terrorism.” Russian news agencies are reporting that Ukraine struck at administrative buildings in the centre of occupied Kherson in the south of the country. The RIA Novosti agency says that at least one person was killed and another was injured as a result of the strike. Unverified video footage has emerged on social media which appears to show damage to the buildings and at least one body. In a statement Kherson’s Russian-appointed local administration said a meeting was taking place of city and district officials when the explosion happened. Ukraine regards all those collaborating with the Russians as traitors. Natalia Humeniuk, press spokesperson for Ukraine’s operational command in the south, declined to comment on the Russian reports. There are also unconfirmed reports and unverified video footage that appear to show that an explosion has struck the prosecutor’s office in occupied Luhansk. Iryna Vereshchuk, minister of reintegration of temporarily occupied territories, has said that Ukraine’s government has approved a draft law that will punish people for forcing Russian passports on to Ukrainian citizens. Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg has said that Ukraine’s counter-attack against Russian troops had been very effective, but warned nations should prepare for the long haul as this did not signal the beginning of the end of the war. He said “We need to understand that this is not the beginning of the end of the war, we need to be prepared for the long haul.” Germany has taken the German subsidiary of the Russian oil giant Rosneft under state control, putting three refineries into a trusteeship ahead of a partial European embargo on Russian oil at the end of the year. The federal network regulator will become the temporary trust manager of Rosneft Germany and its share of refineries in Schwedt, near Berlin, in Karlsruhe and in Vohburg, Bavaria, Germany’s ministry for economic affairs announced on Friday. The European Union chief, Ursula von der Leyen, said she wanted the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, to face the international criminal court over war crimes in Ukraine. “That Putin must lose this war and must face up to his actions, that is important to me,” she told the TV channel of German news outlet Bild on Thursday. Pope Francis said it was morally legitimate for countries to provide weapons to Ukraine to help it defend itself from Russian aggression. “This is a political decision which it can be moral, morally acceptable, if it is done under conditions of morality … Self-defence is not only licit but also an expression of love for the homeland,” he said. “Someone who does not defend oneself, who does not defend something, does not love it. Those who defend [something] love it.” Vladimir Putin thanked the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, for his “balanced” approach to the Ukraine crisis and blasted Washington’s “ugly” policies, at a meeting that followed the recent setbacks for Moscow on the battlefield. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later. Vivian Ho will be taking you through the next few hours of our coverage. As well as the reports of Ukrainian strikes on occupied Kherson, there are also as-yet-unconfirmed reports of an explosion in Luhansk that has targeted the pro-Russian separatist authorities there. Unverified video footage appears to show damage to the building that houses the prosecutor’s office there. More details soon … Nexta has republished footage from the RIA Novosti agency, whom they term “Russian propagandists”, which purports to show the aftermath of a strike in the centre of occupied Kherson on the buildings being used by the Russian-imposed authorities there. A spokesperson for the UN human rights office said it plans to send monitors to Izium, where authorities say they have found a mass grave containing 440 bodies. “They are aiming to go there to try to establish a bit more about what may have happened,” Reuters reports Liz Throssell told a Geneva press briefing, without giving a timeframe. She said she could not confirm if the bodies were contained in one mass grave or in a series of individual graves. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has posted to Telegram to praise Ukraine’s armed forces for pushing back Russia in Kharkiv, and accusing Russia again of war crimes. He writes: As of today, almost the entire region [of Kharkiv] is de-occupied. It was an unprecedented movement of our warriors – Ukrainians once again managed to do what many considered impossible. The Russian army has been in the Kharkiv region for more than five months. And during this time, the occupiers did not even try to do anything for the people. They only destroyed, only deprived, only took away. They left behind devastated villages, and in some of them there is not a single undamaged house. Russia cannot bring anything else except for genocide. Russia has repeatedly denied targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure since it invaded Ukraine in February in what it describes as a “special military operation”. Natalia Humeniuk, press spokesperson for Ukraine’s operational command in the south, declined to comment on Russian reports of a strike this morning on the main administration building in Kherson. The Moscow agency Ria Novosti said Ukraine had targeted it with Himars missiles. Local Telegram channels posted footage taken by Russian forces. It showed smoke billowing out of the city’s main government area, which includes the administration building and the appeals court. At least one body was visible on the street, as well as debris. In a statement, Kherson’s Russian-appointed local administration said a meeting was taking place of city and district officials when the explosion happened. Ukraine regards all those collaborating with the Russians as traitors. Russian troops have occupied Kherson since early March. Their position has become increasingly precarious after Ukraine destroyed four bridges connecting the city with the bulk of Russia’s forces on the opposite bank of the Dnipro River. Russia’s Tass news agency is reporting that there have been explosions in the centre of the occupied city of Kherson. The RIA Novosti agency has a similar report. It says: At least one person was killed and another was injured as a result of the strike of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on the centre of Kherson by Himars missiles. At least five shells fell near the regional administration. Ekaterina Gubareva, deputy head of the military-civilian administration of the region told RIA Novosti one of the missiles hit the building of the Military Administration. There are video clips being posted to social media and by RIA Novosti which appear to show damage to the buildings, at least one body, and a person with injuries. The location and time that the video was taken has not been verified. Lorenzo Tondo is in Ukraine for the Guardian: Prosecutors, police officers and journalists are heading to Izium after authorities there said they had found a mass grave containing more than 440 bodies. Some of the people had been killed by shelling and airstrikes, authorities said. Serhiy Bolvinov, the chief police investigator for Kharkiv province, told Sky News that forensic investigations would be carried out on every body in the grave, which was reportedly located in woods near the city. Izium was described as a second Mariupol when it was bombarded in March. Law enforcement agencies are trying to establish what happened during the seven months of Russian occupation and whether there were instances of torture and executions as well as deaths due to shelling. Iryna Vereshchuk, who is minister of reintegration of temporarily occupied territories, has posted to Telegram to say that Ukraine’s government has approved a draft law that will punish people for forcing Russian passports on to Ukrainian citizens. It sets prison terms of between 10 and 15 years for civil servants who have accepted Russian passports. The law also sets out punishment of eight to 12 years in prison for “forcing Ukrainian citizens to obtain a Russian passport” and for “creating conditions under which failure to obtain a Russian passport will reduce the rights of a citizen of Ukraine”. Here are some of the latest images we have ben sent over the newswires from Ukraine. These are the quotes that Sky News is carrying from Serhii Bolvinov, Ukraine’s chief police investigator for the Kharkiv region. He told reporters: I can say that there is one of the biggest burials in one liberated city, which contains more than 440 graves. Some 440 bodies were buried in one place. We know that some were shot dead, some died because of artillery fire, so-called mine explosion traumas. Some died because of airstrikes. Also we have information that a lot of bodies have not been not identified yet. So the reasons of death will be established during the investigations. Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg has said that Ukraine’s counter-attack against Russian troops had been very effective, but warned nations should prepare for the long haul as this did not signal the beginning of the end of the war. “It is of course extremely encouraging to see that Ukrainian armed forces have been able to take back territory and also strike behind Russian lines,” Reuters reports Stoltenberg told BBC radio. “At the same time, we need to understand that this is not the beginning of the end of the war, we need to be prepared for the long haul.” Here is our video report on the discovery of a mass burial site in Izium after it was recaptured from Russian forces. One of the Telegram channels of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) has issued overnight civilian casualty figures, claiming that three people have been killed and 12 people suffered injuries “of varying severity” by shelling from Ukrainian forces on territory that the DPR occupies. The claims have not been independently verified. The DPR is only recognised as a legitimate authority by three UN member states: Russia, Syria and North Korea. Overnight Andriy Yermak, presidential chief of staff in Ukraine, accused Russia of being “a murderer country, a state sponsor of terrorism.” Alongside a picture of simple wooden cross markers at the site in Izium, he posted: “A mass burial was found in Izium, Kharkiv region. Necessary procedures have already begun. All bodies will be exhumed and sent for forensic examination. Expect more information tomorrow.” Associated Press journalists yesterday saw a mass burial site in a forest outside recently-liberated Izium. Amid the trees were hundreds of graves with simple wooden crosses, most of them marked only with numbers. A larger grave bore a marker saying it contained the bodies of 17 Ukrainian soldiers. Investigators with metal detectors were scanning the site for any hidden explosives. Oleg Kotenko, an official with the Ukrainian ministry tasked with reintegrating occupied territories, said videos that Russian soldiers posted on social media indicated there were likely more than 17 bodies in the grave. “We haven’t counted them yet, but I think there are more than 25 or even 30,” he said. Izium resident Sergei Gorodko said that among the hundreds buried in individual graves were dozens of adults and children killed in a Russian airstrike on an apartment building. He said he pulled some of them out of the rubble “with my own hands”. Thousands of Russian troops fled Izium at the weekend. There was no immediate public comment from Russia. Ukraine has begun restoring electricity in recently liberated villages in Kharkiv oblast, the Kyiv Independent reports. The governor of Kharkiv oblast, Oleh Synyehubov, said that recently liberated settlements are beginning to regain electricity as power stations returned to Ukrainian control. Synyehubov said that some of the communities had been without power since the day after the Russian invasion in February. Taiwan has described ties between Russia and China as a threat to global peace, saying that the international community must resist the “expansion of authoritarianism”. When Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, met Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in Uzbekistan on Thursday, he reiterated Russia’s support for China’s claim over self-ruled Taiwan. In a statement, Taiwan’s foreign ministry said it “severely condemns Russia for following the Chinese Communist party’s authoritarian expansionist government to continue to make false statements at international venues that demean our country’s sovereignty. “(Russia) calls those who maintain peace and the status quo provocative, which highly demonstrates the harm caused by the alliance of Chinese and Russian authoritarian regimes on international peace, stability, democracy and freedom.” The US president, Joe Biden, will meet South African leader Cyril Ramaphosa at the White House on Friday for talks that will include Russia’s war in Ukraine, climate issues, trade and more, Associated Press reports. Ramaphosa is among African leaders who have maintained a neutral stance in the aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with South Africa abstaining from a UN vote condemning Russia’s actions and calling for a mediated settlement. South Africa’s international relations minister, Naledi Pandor, said Ramaphosa would emphasise the need for dialogue to find an end to the conflict during his meeting with Biden and in separate talks with vice-president Kamala Harris. The White House meeting comes after the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, visited South Africa last month, where he said the Biden administration sees Africa’s 54 nations as “equal partners” in tackling global problems. But the administration has been disappointed that South Africa and much of the continent have declined to follow the US in condemning the Russian invasion of Ukraine. A release from the German ministry for the economy has more details about move to place Rosneft Deutschland GmbH under trusteeship. Rosneft Germany accounts for around 12% of Germany’s oil processing capacity, making it one of the largest oil processing companies in Germany. The continuation of the business operations of the affected refineries was in danger due to the ownership of the companies. Central critical service providers such as suppliers, insurance companies, IT companies and banks, but also customers, were no longer willing to work with Rosneft. Further to that report on the German government assuming control of Rosneft’s German operation, state secretary Jörg Kukies has tweeted that move was “a further step to assuring our energy security”. Germany is taking control of Russian oil company Rosneft PJSC’s German unit, Bloomberg has reported. The federal network regulator will take over RN Refining &amp; Marketing GmbH and Rosneft Deutschland GmbH, which accounts for around 12% of Germany’s oil processing capacity, the economy ministry said Friday. Kremlin-linked military contractors the Wagner Group have been conducting an active recruiting campaign amongst Russian prisoners since at least July, according to the latest intelligence briefing from the UK Ministry of Defence. Russian military academies have also been shortening training periods for cadets, indicating “increasingly severe” shortages of junior officers and combat infantry. Russia has launched a national recruitment drive for fresh troops in the wake of its setbacks in the Kharkiv region of Ukraine, according to the latest report from the Institute for the Study of War. The institute said Russia had “almost certainly” drained a large portion of the forces originally stationed in former Soviet states, likely weakening its presence in those areas. The redeployments were notable in the context of renewed tensions between Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, the institute said, as hundreds of Russian troops have reportedly been withdrawn from bases in each country since the invasion began. The UN food chief says the world is facing “a global emergency of unprecedented magnitude,” with up to 345 million people at risk of starvation and 70 million pushed closer to starvation by the war in Ukraine. The Associated Press reports: David Beasley, executive director of the UN world food program, told the UN security council that the number of acutely food insecure people had doubled since the Covid-19 pandemic hit in 2020. “What was a wave of hunger is now a tsunami of hunger,” he said, pointing to rising conflict, the pandemic’s economic ripple effects, climate change, rising fuel prices and the war in Ukraine. Since Russia invaded its neighbour on 24 February Beasley said, soaring food, fuel and fertiliser costs have driven 70 million people closer to starvation. Despite the agreement in July allowing Ukrainian grain to be shipped from three Black Sea ports that had been blockaded by Russia and continuing efforts to get Russian fertilizer back to global markets, “there is a real and dangerous risk of multiple famines this year,” he said. The US defence department has announced details of the $600m in new military aid the White House approved for Ukraine on Thursday, Agence France-Presse reports. The package will include 37,000 artillery rounds, of which 1,000 will be precision-guided, and four counter-artillery radars, among other weapons and equipment. More ammunition will also be provided for the Himars rocket system, the Pentagon said, without specifying if that would include the long range missiles known as ATACMS that Kyiv has requested for months. Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February, the US has provided more than $15bn in military assistance to Kyiv. Kyrgyzstan’s border guard service has said that Tajik forces once again opened fire on several of its outposts, an escalation of tension between the Russian allies after a brief confrontation earlier this week, Reuters reports. Kyrgyz border guards were returning fire as clashes took place along the whole length of the border, the service said, adding that Tajik forces were using tanks, armoured personnel carriers, and mortars. In turn, Tajikistan accused Kyrgyz forces of shelling one of its outposts and seven villages with “heavy weaponry”. A civilian was killed and three injured, authorities in the Tajik city of Isfara said. The governors of Kyrgyz and Tajik provinces adjacent to the border were set to meet at a border crossing point and try to defuse the situation, Kyrgyz border guards set. Clashes over the poorly demarcated border between the two former Soviet republics are frequent, but usually de-escalate quickly, although last year they almost led to an all-out war. Both host Russian military bases and have close ties with Moscow, which urged a cession of hostilities this week. When Vladimir Putin met Xi Jinping for the first time since Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, the Russian president said he understood China’s “questions and concerns” about the war. It was a rare nod to tensions between the two states caused by the invasion, and the Russian leader seemed especially keen to curry favour with Xi, striking a conciliatory tone on a topic where he is often volatile and uncompromising. You can read our full report on the meeting here: Ukrainian authorities have found a mass burial site of more than 440 bodies in the eastern city of Izium that was recaptured from Russian forces, a regional police chief has said. Serhiy Bolvinov, the chief police investigator for Kharkiv region, told Sky News some of the people had been killed by shelling and airstrikes. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy likened the discovery to what happened in Bucha, on the outskirts of Kyiv, saying in a Thursday night video address: “Russia is leaving death behind it everywhere and must be held responsible.” “The necessary procedures have already begun there. More information – clear, verifiable information – should be available tomorrow,” he said. Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. These are the latest developments as of 7.30am, Kyiv time. Ukrainian authorities have found a mass burial site of more than 440 bodies in the eastern city of Izium that was recaptured from Russian forces, a regional police chief has said. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy likened the discovery to what happened in Bucha outside Kyiv early in the war, Reuters reported. “Russia is leaving death behind it everywhere and must be held responsible,” he said. The European Union chief, Ursula von der Leyen, said she wanted the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, to face the international criminal court over war crimes in Ukraine. “That Putin must lose this war and must face up to his actions, that is important to me,” she told the TV channel of German news outlet Bild on Thursday. Ukraine has lost nearly 15% of its grain storage capacity in the war, threatening its role as a key food supplier to the world, a report said. The US government-backed Conflict Observatory said Russians had seized 6.24m tonnes of food storage capacity, and another 2.25m tonnes of capacity in Ukrainian hands had been destroyed, Agence France-Presse reported. As a result, farmers were running out of room to store their output for shipment, which could discourage plantings for the next crop, especially winter wheat, the report said. Pope Francis said it was morally legitimate for countries to provide weapons to Ukraine to help it defend itself from Russian aggression. “This is a political decision which it can be moral, morally acceptable, if it is done under conditions of morality … Self-defence is not only licit but also an expression of love for the homeland,” he said. “Someone who does not defend oneself, who does not defend something, does not love it. Those who defend [something] love it.” Vladimir Putin thanked the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, for his “balanced” approach to the Ukraine crisis and blasted Washington’s “ugly” policies, at a meeting that followed a major setback for Moscow on the battlefield. Putin told his Chinese counterpart on Thursday: “We understand your questions and your concerns in this regard, and we certainly will offer a detailed explanation of our stand on this issue during today’s meeting, even though we already talked about it earlier.” Germany will supply Ukraine with additional armoured vehicles and rocket launch systems but will not provide the battle tanks that Kyiv has long asked for, says the German defence minister, Christine Lambrecht. She said on Thursday that Soviet-made BMP-1 infantry fighting vehicles would also “very quickly” head to Ukraine from Greece. The UN nuclear watchdog’s 35-nation board of governors passed a resolution demanding Russia end its occupation of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine, Reuters reports. Thursday’s resolution is the second on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine passed by the International Atomic Energy Agency’s board. The US president, Joe Biden, announced a new $600m arms package for Ukraine, according to a White House memo sent to the state department on Thursday. The US has imposed new sanctions on 22 Russian individuals and two Russian entities. The people include Maria Alexeyevna Lvova-Belova, Russia’s presidential commissioner for children’s rights, who has led Russia’s efforts to deport thousands of Ukrainian children to Russia and forced the adoption of Ukrainian children into Russian families. The entities include Task Force Rusich, a neo-Nazi paramilitary group that has participated in combat alongside Russia’s military in Ukraine. A Ukrainian volunteer medic captured by Russian forces during their deadly siege of Mariupol delivered devastating testimony before US lawmakers on Thursday, recounting her experiences of torture, death and terror. Yuliia Paievska, who was detained in the port city in March and held by Russian and pro-Russia forces for three months, spoke before the Helsinki commission, a government agency created in part to promote compliance with human rights internationally."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2020/may/22/running-out-of-things-to-talk-about-in-lockdown-youre-not-the-only-one","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2020-05-22T13:00:25Z","webTitle":"Running out of things to talk about in lockdown?

You're not the only one","bodyText":"‘We haven’t got enough control rods, that’s the problem.” Mr Z was trying to explain why our conversations just fizz, repetitively, getting more and more aerated about the same subject. I think, in the future, I am going to divide the box sets into ones that we are allowed to use for analogies and ones that we aren’t. Sure, make a metaphor out of Normal People, no problem. Loads of things are a bit like Marianne’s earrings. Chernobyl is a hard no: we just don’t understand nuclear power well enough. But hear the man out: “If you don’t have the control rods in the water …” “You’re sure it was water? I thought it was uranium …” “Whatever, you can’t control the fusion …” “Fusion, or fission?” “If you don’t have CONTROL RODS.” Are the control rods other people? Or are they theatres, cinemas, spoken-word events and the whole cornucopia of the cultural world? They are basically everything interesting that happens externally, without which conversation pings off the walls, like a rat that has been given ecstasy for research purposes. Control rods are the couple you went out for a pizza with, where one ordered a vegetarian one and the other ordered chorizo, only when the pizzas arrived, the chorizo was more appetising and the veggie-orderer just swiped it, and you happily kill an hour trying to place that on the spectrum of good and evil. Or the guy with one leg, who has a brandy every night outside a Portuguese cafe, and always looks incredibly happy, as if life has treated him really well. He’s a control rod. A film that wasn’t as good as everyone else said it was – sure, you can talk about TV if you like, or books, but part of the interest was always at the meta-level, beyond the artefact itself. What were the people who went to it trying to say about themselves, and what did it mean that they reacted to it the way they did? A minuscule breach of etiquette on a bus, a homeless guy who asks your name and says his sister is also called Zoe, and then you ask his name, and it turns out to be the same as your dad’s (Mark). These are the control rods of relationship fusion (or fission). Friendships are suffering the same vacuum right now: I don’t think I have ever asked so many people, so often, how they feel about things. How are you feeling about lockdown? How are you feeling about your family? Are you worried about your parents? How are you feeling about your sourdough? How are you feeling about the job that you’ve been made redundant from/furloughed from/realised wasn’t a real job after having attempted to do it from home? How are you feeling about your unprecedented and entirely unnecessary levels of fitness? We never used to talk about feelings; we used to talk about weird stuff that had happened. I have been reading so much complicated theorising about why Zoom is tiring. It’s some combination of tech (the refresh rate of the video feed leaves all the work for your brain to do to make sense of an often senseless image) and psyche (the dissonance between being with the person, and yet not with the person, heaps yet more unwanted work upon your poor noggin). I have something to add to this analysis: it’s exhausting, trying to do intimacy from a standing start. I don’t want to talk about how I feel, I want to bitch about other people. (I make an honourable exception for one friend: she tells me what she has bought online, and asks whether she should send it back. Currently, she has a wetsuit that is too small and two leftwing tea towels. I told her to keep all these items. And now, look, I am bitching about her, so we’re both happy.) Other people have found solace in the natural world. For me, this lacks the element of surprise. Ah, look; a heron, in our garden, trying to eat fish out of the pond. Oh my; a fox, also in the garden, trying to eat the rabbit. There are two cats fighting in a tree. When are you going to reverse my expectation, animals? Don’t get me started on plants. The children can still suck an argument out of their thumbs. Through two floors, I could hear the 10-year-old and one of the 12-year-olds fighting about whether dog years were a thing. “There is no dog sun,” said TJ, “so there is no such thing as a dog year.” H hit back. “If a 12-year-old died, that would be a tragedy. If you died, today, everybody – not me, I’d be pleased – everybody else would be devastated. It’s not sad when a 12-year-old dog dies because that dog is actually [unspeakably long pause – I’ll tell you what she hasn’t been doing, which is times tables] 84.” It is so perfect, I can hardly breathe; nobody can win, so the argument will never end. It is as if they have discovered perpetual motion. If they could only do it without hitting each other, it would be like watching an executive toy. • Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/live/2021/oct/19/uk-politics-live-boris-johnson-tories-labour-keir-starmer","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2021-10-19T16:19:19Z","webTitle":"UK politics: net zero strategy to support 440,000 jobs by 2030, says Greg Hands – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2021/oct/19/uk-politics-live-boris-johnson-tories-labour-keir-starmer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/live/2021/oct/19/uk-politics-live-boris-johnson-tories-labour-keir-starmer","fields":{"headline":"UK politics: net zero strategy to support 440,000 jobs by 2030, says Greg Hands – as it happened","bodyText":"That’s it from us for today. Thanks for following along. You can read the full story on the government’s net zero strategy here: • The UK government has set out its long-awaited strategy for reaching net zero emissions, with a plan ministers said would create up to 440,000 jobs and “unlock” £90bn in investment in the next decade, most of it from private sector companies. But experts and campaigners said the proposals did not go far enough and were under-funded, while the government would continue to support fossil fuels. The plan involves an expansion of electric vehicles, including increasing the network of charging points, and further growth of offshore wind, as well as investments in new technologies such as hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel and £120m towards at least one new nuclear power station. • The UK government has announced plans to launch a £400m package of investment alongside the US billionaire Bill Gates to boost the development of new green technologies. Boris Johnson said the deal would help power a “green industrial revolution” and develop emerging technologies that were currently too expensive to be commercially successful but were essential to hitting the government’s climate goals. Speaking at a Global Investment Summit at the Science Museum in London on Tuesday, the prime minister said the partnership would help develop UK technology related to carbon capture and storage, long-term battery life, jet zero (zero-carbon aviation) and green hydrogen technology. • Victims of the Troubles have received backing from political parties in Westminster as they continue their campaign against a proposed ban on future prosecutions related to the conflict. In July, the Government announced plans for a statute of limitations that would end all prosecutions for Troubles incidents up to April 1998, but a range of parties have now signed a pledge rejecting these proposals. Military veterans as well as ex-paramilitaries would be protected from prosecution under the measure. The proposals would also end all legacy inquests and civil actions related to the conflict. • Downing Street has confirmed that vaccine appointments for children will be bookable within weeks, as Boris Johnson said the UK still faced a “difficult winter” due to Covid and flu putting pressure on the NHS. After the latest daily number of new infections climbed to nearly 50,000, the prime minister’s spokesperson echoed concerns from the NHS England chief executive, Amanda Pritchard, that people needed to be reminded the virus was still circulating, to drive up vaccination rates even further. • Carrie Johnson needed her friend in her “childcare bubble” with Boris Johnson for extra support over Christmas because of the challenges of running the country and experiencing difficult pregnancies, a cabinet minister has claimed. It has been revealed that the Johnsons’ friend Nimco Ali, godmother to their son Wilfred, spent Christmas with the family at a time when lockdown restrictions in London prevented almost all household mixing. • Northern Ireland’s Public Prosecution Service has defended the decision to prosecute army veteran Dennis Hutchings over a Troubles shooting. The death of Hutchings from Covid-19 on Monday has reopened the controversy over legacy prosecutions that the government is proposing to end with new legislation. Hutchings, from Cawsand in Cornwall, denied the charges and had said he wanted to clear his name. Hutchings’ lawyer has said the proceedings contributed to his death. The UK has reported its highest number of Covid deaths for seven months, with 223 deaths recorded within 28 days of a positive test for the virus. The daily death rate, which has not been as high since 9 March, brought the weekly toll to 911, a near-15% rise on the week. A further 43,738 coronavirus cases were reported, down slightly on Monday’s figure, though daily hospitalisations continued to rise, reaching 921, up 10% on the week. After a bumpy September, confirmed cases have risen steadily in October with Covid rates soaring among largely unvaccinated secondary school school children, and infections spilling over into older, more vulnerable age groups. The spread of infections beyond younger people has driven up cases in those aged 50 and over, a trend that has started to push up hospitalisations and death rates. Facebook must “publish what they know” about the harm its platforms cause to children, the health secretary has demanded. Sajid Javid told MPs he was “astonished” to learn that an internal study by the tech giant found 17% of teenage girls said Instagram, owned by Facebook, made their eating disorders worse. He criticised the social media company for not sharing the study with parents, healthcare professionals and politicians, adding that it must “do the right thing” and publish information it holds. Facebook responded by saying it published “two full research decks” in September, with annotations added to provide greater context to it. Earlier this month, former Facebook data scientist Frances Haugen accused the business of being aware of apparent harm to some teenagers from Instagram and being dishonest in its public fight against hate and misinformation. Haugen has come forward with a wide-ranging condemnation of Facebook, with tens of thousands of pages of internal research documents she secretly copied before leaving her job in the company’s civic integrity unit. Facebook has said her allegations are misleading and claims there is no evidence to support the premise that it is the primary cause of social polarisation. The Government’s net zero strategy announced today lacks the policies and investment needed to repair our broken natural world both on land and at sea, at the pace and scale required, according to the Wildlife Trusts. The organisation, which is made up of 46 local Wildlife Trusts in the UK, said in a statement: We need to make much more space for nature to recover – and increase it to at least 30% by 2030. Also, the government must embed climate action – mitigation and adaptation – across every department and take urgent steps to stop carbon-emitting activities such as new road building, peat burning and damaging the seabed, which are absent from the strategy. What is more, the strategy relies on expensive innovation, built infrastructure, large-scale biomass crops and carbon capture and storage technologies that risk furthering the acute jeopardy facing our natural world. In other reaction, the author and activist Paul Mason criticises the strategy for its reliance on carbon capture technologies: Bin workers in Glasgow have confirmed that they will strike during the Cop26 climate conference, amid growing anxieties that the city’s summit arrangements are falling into chaos with threats of industrial action across services and transport. Glasgow city council urged the workers to reconsider causing disruption during a “busy and difficult time”, as the GMB union confirmed a week-long strike from 1 November, the first full day of the UN conference. With refuse, cleansing, school caretaker and catering roles affected, the local government body Cosla said it would “continue with constructive negotiations”. But transport unions have pledged similar walkouts, adding to the risk of global embarrassment as the world’s attention is focused on Glasgow in less than two weeks’ time. The RMT confirmed last week that members who work for ScotRail and Caledonian Sleeper will stage industrial action for the duration of Cop26, which is expected to attract thousands of visitors to Glasgow, as the result of a pay dispute that has caused disruption to Sunday services for months. The British government may have painted itself into a corner from which it cannot escape when it comes to its standoff with the EU over the Northern Ireland protocol, writes the the constitutional law expert, George Peretz QC, in a piece for Open Democracy. David Frost, the UK’s Brexit minister, warned last week there was a big gap between the EU and the UK negotiating positions as he entered talks with the European Commission over changes to the arrangements for trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Without an agreed solution soon, he told the Conservative party conference earlier this month, the UK will need to act, using the article 16 safeguard mechanism, “to address the impact the protocol is having on Northern Ireland”. Article 16 is an emergency brake in the Irish protocol, the agreement that left Northern Ireland in the EU’s single market and customs union to make Johnson’s Brexit model compatible with avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland. Peretz writes that article 16 is not the “get out of jail free” card that it is frequently said to be, adding: Article 16 is not a ‘rewrite the protocol as you feel like’ provision. Rather, it allows either side to take ‘appropriate’ measures, restricted in scope and duration to what is ‘strictly necessary’, to address ‘serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties that are likely to persist’ or ‘diversion of trade’. He concludes” The government, therefore, has little choice but to chase down the extent to which the commission’s proposals will resolve the current difficulties. It is only when it can mount a plausible case that these proposals cannot realistically be expected to resolve these difficulties that it could lawfully use article 16. There is almost a universal reject at Westminster of what is effectively a “de facto amnesty” under government plans to prevent future Troubles-related prosecutions, the Alliance party MP Stephen Farry has said, after families who lost loved ones went to parliament earlier today (See post at 14.26). He told the PA news agency. It is important that all parties in Westminster do stand in solidarity with victims, the victims that were represented here today but also the many thousands elsewhere across these islands whose voices haven’t been heard as well. There is almost universal rejection of what is a de facto amnesty that has been proposed by the UK government, and that simply can’t be allowed to stand. That will set the legacy process back many, many, many decades, essentially eliminate the hope for many people. Sinn Féin MP Michelle Gildernew was among those supporting the campaign opposing a proposed ban on future prosecutions related to the conflict. She told PA: It was very heartening to hear all the parties today in a consensus that this legislation and Boris Johnson’s proposals are absolutely wrong and should never ever go through. It really is shameful that this Conservative government are trying to deny the victims of violence the truth and justice and (knowing) what actually happened to their loved ones. Police had to step in earlier to form a circle around Michael Gove, the secretary of state for levelling up, housing and communities, after anti-vaccine protesters spotted him on the street in London. Noting that the incident comes at a particularly concerning time for MPs’ security, Paul Brand of ITV News retweeted footage from another account of the moment the protesters spotted Gove. Shayan Sardarizadeh, who investigates online disinformation for the BBC, tweeted that the protesters appeared to have come from a group calling itself Official Voice, who had turned up outside the office of the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation in London. Jim Pickard of the FT tweets footage from another angle here Downing Street has confirmed that vaccine appointments for children will be bookable within weeks, as Boris Johnson said the UK still faced a “difficult winter” due to Covid and flu putting pressure on the NHS. After the latest daily number of new infections climbed to nearly 50,000, the prime minister’s spokesperson echoed concerns from the NHS England chief executive, Amanda Pritchard, that people needed to be reminded the virus was still circulating, to drive up vaccination rates even further. “I think we absolutely want to get that message out,” the spokesperson said on Tuesday, adding that there was no reason yet for the government to dust off its “plan B” of winter measures for England because hospitalisations and deaths remained “broadly flat”. He defended the rollout of jabs for 12- to 15-year-olds, which has been accused of progressing too slowly, and confirmed that the programme would be extended beyond schools. Doses will be able to be administered at vaccination sites, and parents and guardians of eligible children will receive a text or letter shortly inviting them to use the national booking service or ring 119 to book an appointment. After a cabinet meeting held at the Science Museum on Tuesday, Johnson’s spokesperson said: “The prime minister stressed that our autumn and winter plan continues to keep the virus under control and that case rates and hospital admissions remain broadly flat.” Carrie Johnson needed her friend in her “childcare bubble” with Boris Johnson for extra support over Christmas because of the challenges of running the country and experiencing difficult pregnancies, a cabinet minister has claimed. It has been revealed that the Johnsons’ friend Nimco Ali, godmother to their son Wilfred, spent Christmas with the family at a time when lockdown restrictions in London prevented almost all household mixing. On Tuesday the international trade secretary, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, hinted that the family had needed extra support at that time. Johnson, who is now expecting her second child, revealed she had a miscarriage at the start of this year, meaning she is likely to have been pregnant over the festive period. Wilfred was eight months old at the time and No 10 has said Ali was part of their childcare bubble, which allowed some limited mixing. Pressed on whether a family would have needed additional childcare over Christmas, Trevelyan said: “It’s hard enough for the rest of us; when you’re having to run a country as well and have the challenges of difficult pregnancies, having a supportive friend to be there in your bubble is absolutely the right thing to do.” The claims first emerged in a report in Harper’s magazine that said Ali “spent Christmas with the couple at No 10 despite pandemic restrictions on holiday gatherings”. Reading through the prime minister’s foreword in the government’s net zero strategy and there are a couple of eye-catching lines that have a particularly Johnsonian feel. In particular, there’s the promise that the strategy can be achieved without giving up flying abroad or driving cars: For years, going green was inextricably bound up with a sense that we have to sacrifice the things we love. But this strategy shows how we can build back greener without so much as a hair shirt in sight. In 2050, we will still be driving cars, flying planes and heating our homes, but our cars will be electric gliding silently around our cities, our planes will be zero emission allowing us to fly guilt-free, and our homes will be heated by cheap reliable power drawn from the winds of the North Sea. A campaign against the British government’s proposed ban on future prosecutions related to the conflict is being stepped up by families who lost loved ones during the Troubles. Raymond McCord, whose son was murdered by loyalist paramilitaries in north Belfast in 1997, said a meeting held in the Houses of Parliament on Wednesday “couldn’t have went better”. He told PA Media: “There was no way it could have went better. Total support from every political party at Westminster except the Tories.” Describing the meeting, McCord, who was joined by other bereaved campaigners, said: “Each victim spoke about the murder of their family member or family members.” He said the nine people who travelled to Westminster to meet MPs had lost 15 family members between them. McCord referenced the murder of MP Sir David Amess, saying: “We all sympathise with the family, but there’s no way Boris Johnson would take a gamble and insult that family the way he’s insulted our families by saying we’re going to let the terrorists walk free.” All criminal prosecutions relating to the Troubles and future attempts to take civil actions would be blocked under the government plans that have united Northern Ireland’s parties in opposition. The proposals, which are also opposed by the Irish government, were announced in July by Brandon Lewis, the Northern Ireland secretary, who told MPs it was a “painful truth” that criminal investigations were unlikely to deliver successful outcomes. As well as criticism from the opposition and green campaigners, there was also this mixed view of the government’s strategy from Myles Allen, a professor of geosystem science at the University of Oxford, who told the Guardian’s environment correspondent, Fiona Harvey: We have to stop fossil fuels from causing global warming before the world stops using fossil fuels. Finally, the government seems to be acknowledging this obvious fact and belatedly investing in safe and permanent disposal of carbon dioxide so we can stop dumping it into the atmosphere. Depressingly, however, they still assume it can be done by subsidising carbon capture and a reformed emission trading system. It won’t: taxpayers’ money won’t last forever and by the time emission permits become expensive enough to make carbon capture worthwhile, it’ll be too little, too late. We have to make safe carbon dioxide disposal a licensing requirement for the continued extraction and import of fossil fuels. He added that “outsiders” with as diverse views as the Onward thinktank and the all-party parliamentary group on net zero understand this. “It’s a shame the civil service just don’t want to know.” Today’s new heat and buildings strategy suggests that while the PM is very keen on the green agenda, he doesn’t want to deter the public with coercion, writes the i’s chief political commentator, Paul Waugh, In a snap verdict on today’s strategy papers from the government, he writes that it is why there is only a “target” for phasing out gas boilers, not a legal requirement on consumers. He adds: In fact, it’s business that is really in the firing line once more. The most striking feature of today’s raft of new announcements of a net zero strategy and other measures (unveiled by energy minister Greg Hands) was that the government will mandate the car industry to sell required numbers of wholly electric models per year. The Treasury has published its own net zero review, alongside the strategy published by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, which says “the costs of global inaction significantly outweigh the costs of action” to tackle the climate crisis. But it adds “as with all economic transitions, ultimately the costs and benefits of the transition will pass through to households through the labour market, prices and asset values”. The review says it was not possible to forecast how individual household finances would be hit over the course of a 30-year transition to net zero greenhouse gas emissions. But the Treasury review did highlight the impact on the public finances: There will be demands on public spending, but the biggest impact comes from the erosion of tax revenues from fossil fuel-related activity. Governments “may need to consider changes to existing taxes and new sources of revenue” rather than relying on increased borrowing, the review says. Responding to the net zero announcement in the House of Commons, the shadow energy secretary, Ed Miliband, said: The plan falls short on delivery, and while there is modest short-term investment, there is nothing like the commitment we believe is required. And we know why. Miliband quoted reports from the weekend that a source in the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said the Treasury was emphasising the short-term risks rather than long-term needs. He continued: The chancellor’s fingerprints are all over these documents and not in a good way. So we’ve waited months for the heat and buildings strategy – it is a massive letdown. Miliband questioned if the plan would meet the goals set in the sixth carbon budget for 2035. He added: Isn’t the truth that despite hundreds of pages of plans, strategies and hot air, there is a still a chasm with this government between the rhetoric and the reality? My fear is this plan will not deliver the fair, prosperous transition we need equal to the scale of the emergency we face. The energy minister, Greg Hands, has told the House of Commons that switching to cleaner sources of energy will reduce Britain’s reliance on fossil fuels and will “bring down costs down the line”. He told MPs: This plan is our best route, overcoming current challenges as well. The current price spikes in gas show the need to rapidly reduce our reliance on volatile imported fossil fuels. Detailing the government’s strategy to phase out fossil fuels over the next 30 years and the net zero strategy, Hands said: We are now setting up the Industrial Decarbonisation and Hydrogen Revenue Support Scheme to fund these business models and enable the first commercial-scale deployment of low carbon hydrogen production and industrial carbon capture. He went on: We will be a global leader in developing and deploying the green technologies of the future. The strategy announces a £1.5bn fund to support net zero innovation projects, which provides funding for low carbon technologies across the areas of the Prime Minister’s 10-point plan. Hands said the government had published its Heat and Building Strategy that sets out plans to significantly cut carbon emissions from the UK’s 30m homes and workplaces, through measures such as grants of up to £5000 towards the cost of heat pumps. Greg Hands, the minister of state at the Department for Business, Energy &amp; Industrial Strategy, has been making a statement in the House of Commons, unveiling the Government’s net zero strategy. Here are some highlights from his opening remarks: This is not just an environmental transition, it represents an important economic change too. He added: We will fully embrace this new green industrial revolution helping the UK to level up as we build back better and get to the front of the global race to go green. We need to capitalise on this to ensure British industries and workers benefit. I can therefore announce that the strategy will support up to 440,000 jobs across sectors and across all parts of the UK in 2030. The minister continued: There’ll be more specialists in low carbon fuels in Northern Ireland and low carbon hydrogen in Sheffield. Electric vehicle battery production in the north East of England, engineers in Wales, green finance in London and offshore wind technicians in Scotland. This strategy will harness the power of the private sector, giving businesses and industry the certainty they need to invest and grow in the UK to make the UK home to new ambitious projects. The policies and spending brought forward in the strategy along with regulations will leverage up to £90 billion of private investment by 2030 levelling up our former industrial heartlands. And finally on greenhouse gas removals, the strategy pledges: New, highly skilled, jobs in our industrial heartlands. Start to mobilise additional public and private investment of around £20bn, in line with our 2037 delivery pathway. An ambition to deploy at least 5 MtCO2 (metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent) per year of engineered GGRs (green gas removals) by 2030. On natural resources, the strategy pledges: New employment opportunities across the UK. Afforestation in England could support up to 1,900 jobs in 2024 and 2,000 jobs in 2030. Start to mobilise additional public and private investment of approximately £30bn, in line with our 2037 delivery pathway. Treble woodland creation rates in England, contributing to the UK’s overall target of increasing planting rates to 30,000 hectares a year by the end of this parliament. On transport, the strategy pledges: Support for up to 22,000 jobs in 2024 and up to 74,000 jobs in 2030. Start to mobilise additional public and private investment of around £220bn, in line with our 2037 delivery pathway. Remove all road emissions at the tailpipe and kickstart zero emissions international travel. On industry, the strategy pledges • Economic hubs for green jobs in line with our ambition to capture 20-30 MtCO2 a year by 2030. • “Future-proofing” for industrial sectors, and the communities they employ through a £315m Industrial Energy Transformation Fund (IETF), (£289m for England, Wales and Northern Ireland, £26m for Scotland). • Incentives for cost-effective abatement in industry at a pace and scale which the government says is required to deliver net zero. On fuel supply and hydrogen, the strategy pledges: • Extra support for a Industrial Decarbonisation and Hydrogen Revenue Support (IDHRS) scheme to fund the UK’s new hydrogen and industrial carbon capture business models. • The government will be providing up to £140m to establish the scheme, including up to £100m to award contracts of up to 250MW of electrolytic hydrogen production capacity in 2023 with further allocation in 2024. • The introduction of a new climate compatibility checkpoint for future licensing on the UK Continental Shelf and regulating the oil and gas sector in a way that minimises greenhouse gases through the revised Oil and Gas Authority strategy On power the government’s net zero strategy pledges: • By 2035 it aims for the UK to powered entirely by clean electricity, subject to security of supply. • There will be a final investment decision on a large-scale nuclear plant by the end of this Parliament, and the launch a new £120m Future Nuclear Enabling Fund, retaining options for future nuclear technologies, including Small Modular Reactors, with a number of potential sites including Wylfa in North Wales. • There will be 40GW of offshore wind by 2030, with more onshore, solar, and other renewables – with a new approach to onshore and offshore electricity networks to incorporate new low carbon generation. • A move towards 1GW of floating offshore wind by 2030 to put us at the forefront of this new technology that can utilise our North and Celtic Seas – backed by £380m overall funding for our world-leading offshore wind sector • The deployment of new flexibility measures including storage to help smooth out future price spikes. The government’s policy paper, Net Zero Strategy: Build Back Greener, has just gone online on the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy website. Responding to the government’s net zero strategy announcement, Labour’s Ed Miliband said the plans fell disappointingly short on delivery and were nothing like what was required. They were a a massive let-down, he said, adding that emissions from buildings were higher than in 2015. The biggest single difference that could be made would be a street by street retrofit of housing. He criticised Hands for failing to even mention nuclear in his statement and asked for the government to say what its position on new nuclear was. “The failure to invest does not just affect whether this transition is fair for consumers but also workers in existing industries. Take steel. it will cost £6bn for the steel industry to get to net zero in the next 15 years ... but there is nothing for steel in this document.” The same was true of investment in new industries such as hydrogen. There was a global race in these industries and the UK was not powering ahead, he added. Decisive action is needed if Britain is to meet its net zero goals, MPs have been told by Greg Hands, the minister of state for business, energy and clean growth. Speaking in the Commons chamber, he is laying out details of the government’s net zero strategy and the buildings strategy. The government aims to meet a target of net zero by 2050. “It’s not just an environmental transition ... it represents an important industrial change too,” he said, adding that the strategy will support up to 440,000 jobs in 2030 across the UK. We have a live feed of Hands’ presentation here ahead of the Cop26 summit in Glasgow. This is not just an environmental transition, it represents an important economic change too. We will fully embrace this new green industrial revolution helping the UK to level up as we build back better and get to the front of the global race to go green. We need to capitalise on this to ensure British industries and workers benefit. I can therefore announce that the strategy will support up to 440,000 jobs across sectors and across all parts of the UK in 2030. The former health secretary Matt Hancock has appeared on the government back benches during questions for his successor, Sajid Javid. Congratulating Javid, he encouraged authorities to use pop-up vaccination centres such as one in a Brent mosque in north London to ensure people could get a Covid booster. The Tory MP and former veterans minister Johnny Mercer has tweeted that he is “devastated by the death of my dear friend” after Dennis Hutchings, a military veteran who was being prosecuted over a Troubles shooting, died from Covid-19 on Monday. Mercer, who accompanied Hutchings to court on several days of the trial, said he “remains fiercely proud of him”. Hutchings died at the Mater hospital on Monday while in Belfast for the trial. Boris Johnson told his cabinet that he believes the Covid-19 plan is keeping the virus under control but reiterated that ministers “must put all our energies into our vaccination programmes”. After ministers met in the Science Museum, the prime minister’s official spokesperson said: The prime minister stressed that our autumn and winter plan continues to keep the virus under control and that case rates and hospital admissions remain broadly flat. He re-emphasised that we must put all our energies into our vaccination programmes. The spokesperson added that the government was keeping a close eye on a Covid-19 variant, AY4.2, but insisted there was no evidence it spreads more easily. “There’s no evidence to suggest that this variant ... the AY4.2 one ... is more easily spread. There’s no evidence for that but as you would expect we’re monitoring it closely and won’t hesitate to take action if necessary,” they added. Leicestershire police were guilty of a “serious and inexcusable failure” to properly investigate allegations of child sexual abuse against the late Labour peer, Lord Greville Janner, according to a damning report. The investigation, by the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse (IICSA), into the handling of allegations against Janner, found that a failure by police to submit statements by two anonymised witnesses in 2002 to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) may have been the result of “complacency, incompetence or undue deference to a prominent public figure”. It criticises a “culture of disbelief” at Leicestershire police at the time. The inquiry panel, led by the the IICSA chair, Prof Alexis Jay, said: “The police investigation in Operation Magnolia insufficiently investigated JA-A19 and JA-A6’s complaints. “The police were too quick to dismiss JA-A19 as someone who lacked credibility, and put too little emphasis on looking for evidence that might support his allegations. “JA-A6’s complaint was shut down without any proper investigations being carried out. The decision not to submit JA-A19 and JA-A6’s statements about Lord Janner to the CPS was a significant and unjustifiable failing.” The family of John Pat Cunningham have responded following the death of army veteran Dennis Hutchings from Covid-19 on Monday. Hutchings, who had denied killing 27-year-old Cunningham in 1974, was three days into his trial in Belfast when he contracted the virus. He had kidney disease and was on dialysis. In a statement, the Cunningham family said they wished to acknowledge that this was a difficult time for the Hutchings family, adding they should be given time to grieve. “When the time is judged appropriate, the family will respond in more detail to the issues surrounding the prosecution of Dennis Hutchings,” they said. Serious questions need to be raised about the prosecution of the 80-year-old, the Democratic Unionist party said today. There is a “critical” need to speed up boosters and the vaccination of teenagers, a leading member of the UK government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) has warned. Prof Neil Ferguson, an epidemiologist at Imperial College London, was speaking this morning as cases in the UK are at their highest level for almost three months, with the seven-day average standing at 44,145 cases per day. Registered deaths involving Covid-19 in England and Wales have fallen for the second week in a row and by the largest proportion since May, according to new figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) today. Some 666 deaths registered in the week ending 8 October mentioned the disease on the death certificate. This was down 15% – the largest week-on-week fall since the week ending 21 May, when the figure fell by 29%. Nevertheless, case numbers and hospital admissions and deaths are rising, though vaccines are still working well overall to prevent severe disease. Ferguson suggested this morning that teenagers should be given two doses of a jab to block infection and transmission. Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Ferguson, whose data was instrumental to the UK going into lockdown in March 2020, said the UK had higher Covid cases than other countries for a number of reasons. First of all, we have lower functional immunity in our population than most other western European countries and that’s for two reasons. Partly, we were very successful in getting vaccination rolled out early and we know that gradually immunity wanes over time after you’ve had that second dose, so how early we were means we are a bit more vulnerable. Second, we relied more on the AstraZeneca vaccine and, while that protects very well against very severe outcomes of Covid, it protects slightly less well than Pfizer against infection and transmission, particularly in the face of the Delta variant. Hugo Gye, the political editor at the i and a tireless conveyor of Covid-19 statistics on Twitter, has an interesting thread in which he suggests the roll-out of booster jabs is not going too badly: A man arrested on suspicion of sending a death threat to the Labour MP Chris Bryant has been released on bail. The 76-year-old, from Pontycymer, Bridgend, was taken in for questioning after a report was made by the 59-year-old politician on 16 October. Bryant told PA Media that he called police after receiving a death threat via email. It happened soon after the Conservative MP, Sir David Amess, was stabbed to death at a constituency surgery in Essex. A South Wales police spokeswoman said: “A 76-year-old man from Pontycymer, Bridgend, who was arrested on suspicion of malicious communications has been released on police bail.” A cabinet minister has said she once received a threat to burn down her house with her children inside, as MPs’ safety comes under question following the killing of Sir David Amess. The international trade secretary, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, told LBC Radio that an individual was arrested over the “ghastly” threat. In the wake of the death of the Southend West MP in a suspected terror attack, politicians have been sharing some of the abuse they have been subjected to while in office. Trevelyan told the radio station: The online trolling that I’ve had, I’ve had a certain amount, I’ve had to have someone arrested who was threatening to burn down my house when my children were in it. These things are ghastly and entirely wrong, and our police forces work incredibly hard to support us as parliamentarians and to protect our families, but we are going to keep looking at that. The MP for Berwick-upon-Tweed in Northumberland did not provide further details as to when the threat occurred or the outcome of the arrest. The justice secretary, Dominic Raab, has spoken of having received at least three threats on “life and limb” in the past two years, with the latest being of an acid attack. The Scottish government has confirmed that secondary school pupils should continue to wear face coverings in school after the October half-term break. Staff in primary and secondary schools will also still wear coverings in communal areas or when moving around school buildings. The Scottish government said that while the chief medical officer has advised that there are encouraging signs, “a more cautious approach” would allow more time for 12- to 15-year-olds to take up vaccinations. Confirming that school mitigations will remain in place, Scotland’s education secretary, Shirley-Anne Somerville, also urged continued vigilance to protect pupils and staff. She said: In recent weeks we have seen the previous sharp decline in Covid-19 case numbers starting to level off, and that is why we have decided to adopt a cautious approach and maintain safety mitigations in school for the time-being. Progress with vaccinating 12-15 year olds has been remarkable and is already over 40%. However, this was only rolled out a few weeks ago and allowing further time will mean that that encouraging figure rises even higher. The decision is based on advice from senior clinicians and takes account of the most recent data, she added, and case rates would be monitored on a weekly basis, “with a view to lifting restrictions at earliest possible time. Trade union representatives of teachers in Scotland have welcomed the decision. Children could be forced to wear masks in schools across England again as part of the government’s back-up plan if the country’s Covid situation deteriorates significantly, the UK government’s education secretary admitted earlier this month. Nadhim Zahawi confirmed it was one of the contingencies the government had planned for, but signalled his opposition to reinstating “bubbles” that separated students into groups and enforced isolation if one person tested positive for coronavirus. Boris Johnson and the Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates have announced a £400m partnership to boost green investment to tackle the climate crisis. This morning, the prime minister told the Global Investment Summit at the Science Museum in London that the government had committed £200m, withGates matching the figure. In a subsequent statement, Gates said: Our partnership with the United Kingdom will accelerate the deployment of these critical climate solutions, helping to make them more affordable and accessible. In order to achieve net-zero emissions, we need to reduce the costs of clean technologies so they can compete with and replace the high-emitting products we use today – I call this difference in price the green premium. Billed by Downing Street as “a move to drive investment into the next generation of ground-breaking clean energy technologies”, the partnership is between the UK government and Breakthrough Energy Catalyst, a project Gates launched earlier this year aimed at financing, producing and buying new solutions for a zero-carbon economy. Northern Ireland’s Public Prosecution Service has defended the decision to prosecute army veteran Dennis Hutchings over a Troubles shooting. The death of Hutchings from Covid-19 on Monday has reopened the controversy over legacy prosecutions that the government is proposing to end with new legislation. Hutchings, from Cawsand in Cornwall, denied the charges and had said he wanted to clear his name. In the face of criticism, including from unionist politicians, Northern Ireland’s deputy director of public prosecutions, Michael Agnew, said the decision to prosecute Hutchings for attempted murder was taken after an impartial and independent application of the test for prosecution. The test requires a consideration of whether the available evidence provides a reasonable prospect of conviction and, if it does, whether prosecution is in the public interest. Whilst a review of a previous no prosecution decision does not require the existence of new evidence, the police investigation in this case resulted in a file being submitted to the PPS which included certain evidence not previously available. In the course of proceedings, he added, there were rulings by high court judges that the evidence was sufficient to put Hutchings on trial and also that the proceedings were not an abuse of process. Agnew said the PPS recognised the “concerns in some quarters” in relation to the decision to bring the prosecution. He added: We would like to offer our deepest sympathies to the family and friends of Mr Hutchings, and acknowledge their painful loss. However, where a charge is as serious as attempted murder, it will generally be in the public interest to prosecute. Our thoughts are also with the family of John Pat Cunningham who have waited for many decades in the hope of seeing due process take its course. Earlier this month, the former soldier’s lawyers said he had taken a case alleging a breach of the Human Rights Act to the European court of human rights in Strasbourg on the grounds that military veterans had been subjected to discriminatory treatment. A cross-party group of more than 137 parliamentarians, including 117 MPs, have called on parliament’s pension fund to disinvest from Chinese companies accused of complicity in gross human rights violations or institutions linked to the Chinese state. The signatories included the late Conservative MP Sir David Amess, in one of his last political acts before his death on Friday. Others include Lisa Nandy, the shadow foreign secretary, and the former Conservative cabinet ministers Liam Fox, Iain Duncan Smith and Norman Tebbit. It was also signed by, among others, the Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson, Layla Moran, and the shadow foreign affairs minister, Stephen Kinnock. The letter to the fund’s trustees follows research by the rights group Hong Kong Watch which found the Parliamentary Contributory Pension Fund had £2.9m invested in the Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba and £900,000 in technology group Tencent, as well as investments in China Construction Bank and Sinopec, the chemical and oil firm. The Road Haulage Association (RHA) has told MPs that the shortage of lorry drivers and resultant disruption is “not visibly getting better” despite government measures aimed at alleviating the issue. Duncan Buchanan, the RHA’s director of policy, told the business, energy and industrial strategy committee: “Things are very challenged at the moment. “There are widespread shortages of lorry drivers, which are leading to delays and frustrated trips. “Among our members we are still getting reports that this hasn’t eased at all. “Things are not visibly getting better at this stage and I know there are a number of measures that have been put in place – stepping up training, stepping up tests – but on the ground that isn’t having much of an effect.” It is “imperative” that the aviation sector recovers from the coronavirus pandemic in 2022, according to the transport secretary, Grant Shapps. The minister acknowledged that “Covid is far from over”, and stated that the presence of variants of the virus in a number of countries “remains a concern”. But he insisted that “considerable progress” has been made this year, and described the recent relaxation of the UK’s travel rules as “a clear sign that we are well on the way to recovery”. Speaking at the Airport Operators Association’s annual conference, Shapps said: “Global travel next year is predicted to grow significantly, coming after the worst two years on record. That will provide some welcome relief.” Gas boilers could be banned in future but the government believes the market should drive changes to home heating systems, the cabinet minister Anne-Marie Trevelyan has said, amid criticism of the limited grants system for heat pumps. Ministers had been under pressure to set a date to ban the installation of new gas boilers in existing homes, but on Tuesday announced the installation of low-carbon heat pumps would be encouraged with a grant system of £5,000 for up to 90,000 homes in England and Wales. The grant would make the installation a similar cost to a new gas boiler, but green campaigners have said the move would expand the greener system to a minuscule proportion of homes and does not set a date for a full ban. Speaking on Tuesday as the government launched its heat and buildings strategy, one of a number of announcements made ahead of the Cop26 summit in Glasgow, Trevelyan hinted the installation of new gas boilers would be banned in the future. “In the short term, yes, of course this is a voluntary scheme … There will be a point at which that changes but, yes, for now that’s the case,” she told Sky News. The international trade secretary said she believed the market would eventually change to make the greener switch more affordable. “At the moment we’re encouraging the market to drive those changes,” she told the BBC. Serious questions need to be raised about the prosecution of an 80-year-old army veteran over a fatal shooting during Northern Ireland’s troubles, the leader of the Democratic Unionist party has said, following the death of the former soldier from Covid on Monday evening. Dennis Hutchings, who had denied killing 27-year-old John Pat Cunningham in 1974, was three days into his trial in Belfast when he contracted the virus. He had kidney disease and was on dialysis. The DUP leader, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, said: “There now stands serious questions around those who made the decision that Dennis should stand trial once more. He was honourable. He wanted to clear his name again but was dragged to a court and hounded until his death. “This is a sad indictment on those who want to rewrite history but also demands serious questions of the Public Prosecution Service about how this trial was deemed to be in the public interest.” Hutchings’ death has reopened the controversy over legacy prosecutions that the government is proposing to end with new legislation. British households will be £1,000 worse off next year from a cost of living squeeze created by rising energy prices and shortages of workers and supplies caused by Covid and Brexit, a leading thinktank has warned. The Resolution Foundation said higher levels of inflation would weigh down workers’ earnings next year, contributing to a hit to the average household income in Britain at a time when the government is cutting benefits and raising taxes. It said the average household disposable income, after adjusting for inflation, would be about 2% lower by the end of 2022 relative to forecasts made in March by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), before the surge in shop and energy bill prices. Although the OBR had predicted that household disposable income would rise in 2022, the Resolution Foundation said soaring inflation would mean households would have £1,000 less than originally forecast. “Higher inflation reduces the amount of goods and services that households are able to afford, eroding the real value of incomes,” it said. While Boris Johnson has clearly been in his element this morning – presiding over promises for major projects and pledges to unleash the forces of the market – campaigners and the opposition have been warning that the initial announcements around the government’s green agenda lack ambition. Labour condemned government plans for £5,000 grants to allow people to install home heat pumps and other low-carbon boiler replacements as part of a wider heat and buildings strategy as “more of Boris Johnson’s hot air”, without sufficient substance. Details for the scheme, to be formally set out on Tuesday alongside the government’s net-zero strategy, include £450m committed towards grants to replace boilers, with a pledge that the fund will mean heat pumps should cost no more than boilers to install or run. More widely, the heat and buildings strategy contains a commitment to funding totalling £3.9bn to decarbonise buildings and how they are heated, with a confirmed 2035 target for all new heating systems in UK homes to be energy-efficient. With the crucial Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow starting in a fortnight, the business and energy secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, said recent gas price rises “have highlighted the need to double down on our efforts to reduce Britain’s reliance on fossil fuels and move away from gas boilers over the coming decade”. However, some environmental groups said more urgent action was needed. Caroline Jones, of Greenpeace UK, said efforts to decarbonise housing were being hampered by “unambitious policies and inadequate funding”. She said: “More money must be provided to rapidly increase the number of homeowners switching to heat pumps over the next few years, with full costs covered for families on low incomes.” Johnson also told the Global Investment Summit the Covid-19 crisis showed how governments and the private sector must work together to tackle global problems – a lesson that should be applied to the fight against climate change. The prime minister said: I can deploy billions – with the approval of the Chancellor, obviously – but you in this room, you can deploy trillions. He said there was $24tn (£17.4tn) represented in the room at the Science Museum summit in London. I want to say to each and every one of those dollars, you are very welcome to the UK and you have come to the right place at the right time. Setting out his agenda for a “green industrial revolution”, Johnson indicated that hydrogen technology would play a major role. The government will set out its net zero strategy for greenhouse gas emissions later on Tuesday. Boris Johnson has said “the market is going green” as he urged investors to put their cash into British efforts to develop cleaner technology. The prime minister, addressing the government’s Global Investment Summit, channelled the spirit of Michael Douglas’s character [below] from the film Wall Street as he told business chiefs: To adapt Gordon Gekko – who may or may not be a hero of anybody in this room – green is good, green is right, green works. Ahead of the Cop26 climate change summit, Johnson told the gathering in London’s Science Museum it “must be the moment when government joins hands with the private sector” and international organisations to create the drive the market for green technology. We should be using this moment, collectively as governments, to leverage in the trillions of the market, creating the country platforms that will not only tackle climate change but deliver green jobs and green growth around the world. Johnson also told the summit that the UK had a responsibility to lead the world in decarbonising because as the first nation to industrialise, “we were the first to knit the deadly tea cosy of C02 that is now driving climate change”. Setting out the UK’s ambitions for hydrogen, Johnson said it was “part of the solution”. To drive a digger or a truck or to hurl a massive passenger plane down a runway, you need what Jeremy Clarkson used to call ‘grunt’ - I think there may be a technical term for it - but ‘grunt’. Hydrogen provides that grunt, so we are making big bets on hydrogen, we are making bets on solar and hydro, and, yes - of course - on nuclear as well, for our baseload. Good morning on a day when the the UK government is setting out details of what Boris Johnson has described in an interview as a “big bet” on wind power. Johnson is also announcing £9.7bn of new overseas investment in the UK, creating 30,000 additional jobs, at a major business summit on Tuesday, Downing Street has said. Ministers have meanwhile unveiled plans for £5,000 grants to allow people in England and Wales to install home heat pumps and other low-carbon boiler replacements as part of a wider heat and buildings strategy that some campaigners warned lacked sufficient ambition and funding. Labour also condemned the plans as “more of Boris Johnson’s hot air”, without sufficient substance. It’s expected to be a policy heavy day in which we’ll hear more about the government’s plans for new nuclear power plants, carbon capture technology and storage schemes, as well as new targets for manufacturers to produce electric cars. Johnson said in an interview with Bloomberg: We are making a big bet on wind power, on hydrogen, on electric vehicles, on gigafactories, on carbon capture and storage, all those things... Obviously, the green bet comes in a shade of blue. Johnson added that the government would be setting out the regulatory framework “to encourage the private sector to come in, in the way that they are ...” Here is just some of the agenda today: • 9.35 am Boris Johnson speaks at a Global Investment Summit, alongside business leaders including Bill Gates. • 10.15 am Cabinet to meet at the Science Museum. • 10.45 am Industry bodies including the Road Haulage Association and British Chambers of Commerce give evidence to the Commons business, energy and industrial strategy committee on supply chain issues. •11.30 am Troubles victims hold Westminster event calling for the rejection of UK government’s plan for a statute of limitations on future Troubles prosecutions. •Noon Department for Education to publish latest pupil attendance figures. •1.00 pm Institute for Government panel event to discuss the forthcoming spending review. •1.30 pm Attorney general Suella Braverman to address the Public Law Project annual conference. •2.45 pm DCMS minister Julia Lopez to give evidence to the Lords Communications and Digital Committee on the future of Channel 4. Alongside this, Westminster is still reeling from the killing of the Conservative MP Sir David Amess, as he continues to be remembered, and a debate about the security and accessibility of MPs continues.

After four months during which the pandemic has plunged the economy into a recession, this was not a message to fill boardrooms with joy. To the surprise of many in diplomatic circles, Boris Johnson had offered up to 3 million British national (overseas) passport holders in Hong Kong a path to UK citizenship, following the passing of China’s draconian state security laws covering the region. Liu responded by hosting an online conference to press home Beijing’s anger at Britain’s apparently firm stance on Hong Kong. Highlighting the potential ban on the telecoms equipment provider Huawei from the UK’s 5G network, he warned of “consequences” if the UK’s attitude to China became hostile. Rana Mitter, director of the China Centre at the University of Oxford, fears that sanctions could quickly follow. “The implication is that Chinese firms will be discouraged from investing in key [UK] infrastructure projects such as nuclear power and HS2,” he says. Until now, the UK government has maintained a pragmatic view of claims against Xi Jinping’s administration of excessive authoritarianism. China is the sixth most valuable destination for British exports, making the world’s second-largest economy a crucial destination for the UK’s goods and services. It is the third-largest export market for British goods (excluding services), with items worth £25.8bn sold there last year, which is more than 7% of total UK shipments, and over double what Britain sold to China in 2012. Some of Britain’s largest manufacturers are dependent on maintaining access to Chinese markets, among them the carmaker Jaguar Land Rover. The Chinese market accounted for 25-30% of JLR’s global sales in recent years, but over the past two months made up 50%, with dealerships open there while largely closed in Europe and North America. In addition, London is a major trading centre for the Chinese currency, the yuan; British pharmaceutical firms have close research links with their Chinese counterparts; and Huawei is poised to build a £1bn research centre near Cambridge. Beijing’s status as a major trading partner weighs heavily on ministers as they consider how to respond to a succession of charges against the communist government of abuses of human rights, media bias and business ethics, and not just in Hong Kong. The treatment of the Uighur community in the north-west of the country is an issue of growing concern as reports trickle out of widespread human rights abuses, including the separation and internment of families that refuse to be “re-educated”. Complaints against China’s state television channel over its coverage of protests in Hong Kong were upheld by the UK regulator, Ofcom, which said it was minded to sanction CGTN, the English-language rolling news channel owned by the Chinese government, for a “serious failure of compliance”. These criticisms lie behind the creation of a China research group within the Conservative party, headed by the MP and prominent Beijing critic Tom Tugendhat. Adding to the pressure on ministers, the former MI6 chief Sir John Sawers said last week he had changed his mind about the UK’s ability to use Huawei components without jeopardising national security. Writing in the Financial Times, Sawers argued that a US boycott of the company was a crucial turning point, as it had forced many of Huawei’s suppliers to cut ties with the company. Without these reputable suppliers on board, there was little hope of telling if Huawei was a benign contractor or acting as a spy agency for Beijing, he said. Leslie Vinjamuri, an international relations expert at Chatham House, says the UK is now in a tight spot: “When you see China taking such a tough line, it feels as if something has fundamentally changed.” She sees it as an inevitability that the UK will be drawn into the global power play between the US, China and the EU that could result in pressure on commerce and retaliatory measures. Australia’s government has already suffered this fate. It called for an examination of the way Covid-19 spread from Wuhan in central China to the rest of the world, only to be told by Beijing that there would an 80% tariff on Australian barley and a suspension of some beef imports. Chinese students and tourists were warned against travelling to the “racist” country. Nigel Driffield, a trade expert at Warwick Business School, says if Beijing is riled, UK-owned factories in China could be brought to a halt by a simple health and safety inspection. In 2012, a dispute with Japan over islands in the South China Sea escalated into the state-sanctioned looting and burning of Japanese factories on the mainland. Ever since then, major Japanese companies have operated a one-plus-one policy of replicating in other countries all their factories in China. Oxford University’s Mitter is optimistic that commercial and trade relations will continue, arguing that the profit motive is important to China, especially when its own economy remains depressed. “The bottom line is still likely to be whether Chinese firms can make a profit or not,” he says. “China is a pragmatic actor when it comes to its own interests. When there have been diplomatic spats in the past, which has happened on several occasions, there is no correlation with UK/China trade, which has continued to increase year on year.” Mitter cites e-commerce firms such as Alibaba, which want to break out of the east Asia market to challenge behemoths eBay and Amazon. They need the support of the UK to break the US stranglehold on e-commerce. A straight fight over Hong Kong is likely to undermine those collaborative efforts. However, it remains to be seen whether Johnson will risk Beijing’s wrath. Close ties • In 1999, China was the UK’s 26th largest export market and 15th largest source of imports. By 2018, it had risen to sixth largest and fourth largest respectively. • In 2019, the UK’s single largest import from China was telecoms equipment, valued at £6bn.

The parent company of Britain’s biggest energy supplier delivered its worst financial results since 2015, reporting a pre-tax loss of £1.1bn for last year, from a £575m profit in 2018. Profits generated by British Gas fell by 71% to £137m, the lowest levels in the supplier’s history, and shares slumped to a 22-year low. Centrica’s outgoing chief executive, Iain Conn, complained that the government’s energy price cap had created an “unsustainable” market, and said it was “very difficult to find anyone who is making money”. Analysts warned that the company’s profits would remain under pressure until it was able to sell off its fossil fuel and nuclear power businesses, which cost Centrica over £800m last year. Shares in the company – which has an army of small shareholders – tumbled more than 17% to around 70p, compared with almost 300p a share when Conn took over as chief executive in early 2015, raising the risk that Centrica may soon tumble out of the FTSE 100. At their peak, in 2013, they were changing hands at more than 400p. Conn brushed off the “simplistic reaction” of the market and said the energy firm was “demonstrating momentum as we enter 2020”. British Gas lost 286,000 customers from its energy supply business last year, which is half the decline rate of the year before, and a quarter of the decline rate of 2017, Conn said. The business gained 78,000 customers for “energy services” such as boiler repair contracts. However, the energy price cap cost the company about £300m last year. The government-imposed price cap limits the amount that suppliers can charge customers who use default energy tariffs to buy their gas or electricity. The embattled energy company also reported a £1.7bn financial blow after writing down the value of its fossil fuel and nuclear businesses, which it hopes to sell by the end of the year, and from covering the costs of its recent corporate restructuring. The company reported an impairment charge of £476m against its North Sea oil and gas business, Spirit Energy, and a £372m impairment on its stake in the Dungeness B and Hunterston B nuclear plants, which have suffered outages over the past year. Conn confirmed that Centrica was in talks with a consortium of investors that may be willing to buy part of its 20% stake in the UK’s nuclear reactor fleet. It hopes to sell off its share in the ageing reactors by the end of the year, but problems at two of the older plants have raised doubts. The company is also trying to sell Spirit Energy. The company also reported an exceptional cost of £356m for restructuring the business, which has included thousands of redundancies in recent years. Conn is leaving the company later this year after a torrid five-year tenure marked by the company’s sliding share price, and heavy customer losses from British Gas. Centrica has yet to announce a replacement for Conn, who is expected to step down after the company’s annual investor meeting in May. The company is also temporarily without a permanent chairman after Charles Berry began a leave of absence earlier this week due to a medical condition. Centrica said it expected Berry to return to his duties shortly."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2021/sep/16/australia-news-live-nuclear-submarine-us-uk-france-covid-nsw-victoria-morrison","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2021-09-16T08:49:38Z","webTitle":"China issues submarine warning; Queensland passes voluntary assisted dying laws – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2021/sep/16/australia-news-live-nuclear-submarine-us-uk-france-covid-nsw-victoria-morrison","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2021/sep/16/australia-news-live-nuclear-submarine-us-uk-france-covid-nsw-victoria-morrison","fields":{"headline":"China issues submarine warning; Queensland passes voluntary assisted dying laws – as it happened","bodyText":"That brings today’s blog to an end. But first, here are today’s biggest headlines: Australia announced a trilateral partnership with the US and UK, known as Aukus, which will deliver a nuclear-powered submarine fleet for Australia. Beijing responded to the announcement, calling it a case of “extremely irresponsible” double standards. New South Wales recorded 1,351 new local Covid-19 cases and 12 Covid-related deaths. The regional towns of Albury and Lismore were plunged back into lockdown at 6pm tonight after recording positive cases. Victoria recorded 514 new Covid-19 cases, only 148 were linked. Despite this, premier Daniel Andrews announced a very modest easing of some restrictions: from 11.59pm on Friday you’ll be allowed to travel up to 10km from your home, and outdoor picnics will be allowed with one other person regardless of vaccination status, and five adults from two households if you’re fully vaccinated. ACT recorded 15 new local cases, only five of which were in isolation for their entire infectious period. Unemployment has fallen slightly from 4.6% to 4.5%, despite the number of people employed and hours worked dropping. Queensland parliament passed laws that will allow voluntary assisted dying for people with a terminal illness, with an overwhelming majority of MPs voting in favour (60-29). Australia’s immigration minister, Alex Hawke, has advised the federal circuit court he intends to grant three members of the Murugappan family another three-month bridging visa next week. Thank you so much to everyone reading for joining us. This is Justine Landis-Hanley, signing off. China’s foreign ministry has warned that Australia, the US and the UK may end up hurting their own interests, after the three countries unveiled a new defence cooperation pact. The agreement – which includes a plan to help Australia acquire nuclear-powered submarines – was criticised by the Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian. According to a translation aired by ABC News, Zhao said the US and UK’s decision to export highly sensitive nuclear-powered submarine technology to Australia was a case of “extremely irresponsible” double standards. Australia is a non-nuclear weapon state party to the NPT [non-proliferation treaty] and a party to the nuclear weapon-free zone in the Southern Pacific. Now it is importing nuclear-powered submarine technology with strategic military value. The international community, including neighbouring countries, have risen to question its commitment to nuclear non-proliferation. China will closely monitor the situation. Zhao said the three countries “should abandon the obsolete Cold War zero sum mentality and narrow-minded geopolitical concepts and respect regional people’s aspiration and do more that is conducive to regional peace and stability and development, otherwise they will only end up hurting their own interests”. Queensland has passed laws that will allow voluntary assisted dying for people with a terminal illness, with an overwhelming majority of MPs voting in favour. The state – often perceived as Australia’s most socially conservative – becomes the fifth Australian jurisdiction to allow voluntary euthanasia. The state parliament voted 60-29 in favour, despite a fierce campaign by faith-based groups and attempts by opponents to introduce amendments that would have imposed barriers to access the new scheme. Voluntary assisted dying (VAD) will be restricted to people with an advanced and progressive condition that causes intolerable suffering and was expected to cause death within a year. The person must have decision-making capacity and would have to be separately and independently assessed by two doctors. They would then be required to make three separate requests over at least nine days. The laws also allow doctors and healthcare providers to conscientiously object. Faith-based organisations that run hospitals and aged care homes had argued for stronger rights to object, which would have acted to prevent some residents from accessing VAD. In the end – after 56 separate amendments were tabled and rejected – the laws passed as drafted by the state’s independent law reform commission. The conscience vote largely split along party lines; most Labor MPs were in favour, most from the LNP voted against. Campaigners were pleased with the healthy majority, which they said would discourage future attempts to wind back the VAD scheme. Debate in parliament was particularly emotional; supporters and opponents each shared personal stories to outline their positions. Nine News is reporting that a man has allegedly crashed through the Queensland-NSW border checkpoint. We are seeking more information on this. The news day is slowly winding down, but by far the biggest story was the announcement that Australia has entered a new pact with the US and the UK to acquire nuclear-powered submarines. This means that Australia is scrapping a $90bn submarine deal it had with France that had been plagued by delays, cost blowouts and disputes over local industry involvement. For more information about the new pact, or the deal it is replacing, check out this fantastic article from Katharine Murphy and Daniel Hurst: For anyone else who read my last post about Queensland’s new system for monitoring those doing home quarantine and was also stressed about whether you are allowed to nap, a Twitter user wrote into me with an answer. A Guardian reader has written to me and made a very good point about Queensland’s new system for making sure that people are complying with at-home quarantine orders. To recap: the system will randomly send a message to individuals quarantining at least once a day while at home quarantine, with a hyperlink that they will have to open and respond to within 10 minutes. It will allow authorities to identify if they are away from home. The reader pointed out that this might be able to track whether someone in quarantine has left their home, but it won’t be able to tell whether that person has a visitor over (which they aren’t supposed to). I also have a pressing question: does this mean that you aren’t going to be allowed to take naps in quarantine? What if you don’t respond within 10 minutes because you were having a cheeky afternoon snooze? It’s hasn’t been a great day for some of Australia’s politicians on the world stage. This morning, the US president Joe Biden appeared to briefly forget prime minister Scott Morrison’s name, referring to him as “that fella down under”. Awkward. Now there is footage of defence minister Peter Dutton not knowing how to do an elbow bump with his South Korean counterpart. Dutton was in Seoul this week for high-level talks. The South Korean defence minister Suh Wook went to give Peter Dutton a Covid-safe elbow bump, but Dutton instead – seeing the minister’s fist – balled up his hand for a first bump. Dutton was then shown how to do an elbow bump. He looked confused. It was very awkward. See for yourself: Patricia Karvelas has also asked Michael Sukkar about the nuclear-powered submarine deal announced as part of the historic trilateral Aukus partnership announced today. Karvelas: How much will it cost the government to break the contract for the French-built variety? Sukkar: Those will be determined in coming weeks and months. ... There will be a cost to the decision. The cost will mean we are in a much better position from a defence capability perspective. Karvelas: But it’s still a huge waste of taxpayer money, isn’t it? Is this really value for money? Sukkar: I disagree. Obviously, the environment is very different. The access to technology the US is providing us has only been given or provided by the US in one other case, and that was to the UK in 1958. We are now getting access to that same technology, which will underpin our capability in the Australian Navy into the future and there is no doubt we end up with a far superior defence capability and that’s, in the end, the decision that has to be taken, particularly given the environment in the Indo-Pacific that we now see, and what we are going to see in future decades. The assistant treasurer and minister for housing, Michael Sukkar, is speaking on ABC’s Afternoon Briefing right now about the 0.1% drop in unemployment in August. Patricia Karvelas: Australia’s unemployment rate fell 0.1% to 4.5% in August, the reverse of what many had feared. How confident are you that we have avoided a rise in unemployment? Sukkar: Patricia, the headline data is very clear around the unemployment rate, that is at its lowest level since 2008. But Sukkar acknowledged that 146,000 jobs were lost, according to the ABS, and there was a large fall in the participation rate. Sukkar: If you look over successive months, the headline read has shown an underlying strength in the economy. I don’t think any Australian would be surprised to see that hours worked dropped and participation has dropped in light of lockdowns and very, very harsh and difficult lockdowns throughout really the whole eastern seaboard from New South Wales, ACT and Victoria. I don’t think it’s surprising but what has surprised in the upside is the headline unemployment rate being at its lowest level since 2008. I think it gives us all the indication of the underlying strength in the Australian economy and our ability to come out on the other side of lockdowns and the pandemic in reasonably good shape, certainly much better shape than most other comparable economies, and that’s really because of the significant ... support and other measures put in place throughout the pandemic to support small business and Australians through what’s a very difficult time. Hello! Just a reminder that you can send me stories/tips/memes and tweets to me via Twitter @justinel_h Religious schools in Victoria will be banned from discriminating against staff on the basis of their sexuality, gender identity or marital status, under legislation to be introduced by the state government later this year. Religious schools in Victoria currently have the power to sack or refuse to hire LGBTIQ+ people on the basis of their sexuality or gender identity, and marital status. The Victorian attorney general, Jaclyn Symes, said the changes were being made to ease the fears some teachers and employees at religious schools had of being outed to their employers, and losing their job. Queensland authorities have introduced a new system to ensure people are fulfilling their home quarantine requirements. Queensland health minster Yvette D’Ath said that the new system sends a random message to individuals quarantining a least once a day, while they are in home quarantine. “The message will have a hyperlink that requires individuals to open and respond within 10 minutes,” she explained. “It specifically allows authorities to identify if anybody is away from the approved residence.” The Royal Australasian College of Surgeons has released a statement supporting mandatory Covid-19 vaccines for the entire healthcare workforce, whether they work in clinical or non-clinical settings. As the highly contagious Delta variant drives a new surge of cases, vaccination is an ethical obligation and a necessary step for all healthcare workers to protect themselves, their colleagues, and the community they treat,” RACS president Dr Sally Langley said. “Where personal circumstances mean it is not possible to be vaccinated, individual healthcare workers should seek medical advice to ensure that they remain adequately protected.” Langley added that “during a Covid surge, surgeons should limit their movement between hospitals where possible and convert as many consultations to telehealth as possible dependent on clinical safety”. Victorian premier Daniel Andrews announced some small changes to lockdown restrictions today, including that picnics are back on. Up to two unvaccinated people from different households, or five vaccinated people from two households, will be allowed to have a picnic in the park from 11.59pm on Friday (but also, the curfew is still in place, so don’t go on a picnic as soon as the clock strikes midnight tomorrow night). The announcement has revealed a bit of a funny loophole, though. While you will be able to go on a picnic, you are still not allowed to remove your mask to drink alcohol in public (a rule that was introduced to stop people from going on outdoor pub crawls). When questioned about this, Andrews said that he would have to come back to reporters on the matter. The Asylum Seeker Resource Centre’s Footscray site has reportedly closed to all staff, volunteers and members today after a positive Covid-19 case attended on Tuesday (14 September). It’s unknown at this stage whether it is a tier one or tier two site. Peter Dutton is at the Pentagon for the the Australia–US Ministerial Consultations (AUSMIN), the principal forum for bilateral consultations with the United States. Immigration minister Alex Hawke has advised the federal circuit court he intends to grant three members of the Murugappan family another three-month bridging visa next week, after fears the family may end up back in detention when their current visas expire. Hawke announced on 23 June he had granted three-month bridging visas to Nades, Priya, and Kopika as it would allow them to live in community detention Perth while the youngest daughter, Tharnicaa, continued to receive medical treatment after being evacuated from Christmas Island, and while her legal matters were still ongoing. Their visas are due to expire on Wednesday next week, and there was concern among the supporters of the family that without valid visas, the family could be put back into immigration detention or removed from Australia. The case in the federal circuit court on Thursday centres around procedural fairness on a decision made by Hawke at the same time to prevent them from applying for visas. Barrister for the federal government, Stephen Lloyd, told the court Hawke was prepared to make an undertaking that, subject to any adverse events, he would grant another three-month bridging visa to Nades, Priya, and Kopika at a meeting next week. The hearing continues. Former Labor prime minister Paul Keating has released a statement sharing his thoughts on Australia’s trilateral partnership with the US and UK to provide nuclear-powered submarines. “This arrangement would witness a further dramatic loss of Australian sovereignty, as material dependency on the United States robbed Australia of any freedom or choice in any engagement Australia deemed appropriate,” Keating wrote. Some updates from today’s ACT daily Covid-19 press conference: Of the 15 new cases, only five were in quarantine, and at least eight were in the community while infectious Chief minister Andrew Barr said that it was too early for authorities to ease restrictions. “Our vaccination rates are not yet high enough to allow a significant increase in movement,” he said. Barr also announced a new package for the community sector and vulnerable Canberrans that will be included in the ACT budget, to be handed down on 6 October. The package includes: $8 million for specialist homelessness services, given the rise in demand for those services during this recent outbreak $4 million to community organisations to help pay their staff and cover those costs for the organisations that are very often not-for-profit. $2.2 million for mental health support and preventative services for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Canberrans Our friends at AAP have reported that unemployment has fallen slightly, despite the number of people employed and hours work dropping. The number of people employed in Australia slumped by 146,000 in August as a result of a number of coronavirus lockdowns across the country, wiping out the jobs gains seen since April. However, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said the unemployment rate eased to 4.5% from 4.6%, when economists had expected it to rise to five per cent. “The fall in the unemployment rate reflects a large fall in participation during the recent lockdowns, rather than a strengthening in labour market conditions,” ABS head of labour statistics Bjorn Jarvis said. He said the latest data covered the first two weeks of August, which included the continued lockdown in NSW, new lockdowns in Victoria, Queensland and the ACT, and a series of changes in restrictions in other parts of the country. The participation rate of those in work or seeking employment fell from 66% to 65.2%, while hours worked in all jobs in the month fell by 3.7 points, or 66 million hours. BIS Oxford Economics chief economist Sarah Hunter said the fallout from the NSW lockdown and the structure of the Covid-19 disaster payments has significantly distorted the labour market data. She said the unemployment fall is not an accurate reflection of the health of the economy. “With the economy in lockdown, those workers who are currently unable to work and not actively seeking a job are classified as not being in the labour force,” Dr Hunter said. Also those receiving support payments in NSW, Victoria and the ACT are currently not required to look for a job, which has led to a further decline in the unemployment count. In better news for the ACT, though, 79.3% have received their first dose, 54.5% have received their second dose! This brings the total number of active cases to 241. In Ballarat, additional testing centres have been set up to support the community, Weimar says. This includes a testing site at Victoria Park on Military Drive, which will be open until 8pm tonight. Weimar says there are six active cases that authorities are aware of in Ballarat. One of them is an unlinked case that “has been infectious since last Tuesday and has had a number of exposures across Ballarat”. They are in a different part of the city and they may help us explain some of the waste water detects we’ve been seeing in the last few days. More exposure sites will be coming on stream during the course of today and again, we’ll be doing the work with him and his contacts to establish any other further exposures. Victoria’s Covid commander, Jeroen Weimar, has provided further information about today’s 514 new cases. There are three new cases in Ballarat, and seven more in regional Australia. Of those seven are four cases in Mitchell Shire, one in Murrindindi, and two in greater Geelong. All are primary close contacts and as such, authorities are confident that the current isolation protocols for the cases are sufficient. In terms of the rest of the cases in metro Melbourne, Weimar said “we have a very similar geographic spread we’ve seen over the last couple of weeks”. So over 61% of the cases are in the northern suburbs. So 317 cases across suburbs like Craigieburn, Roxborough Park and Glenroy. Around a quarter of the new cases are in the western suburbs, including Altona North and Deer Park. We have 46 cases in the south-east in Dandenong, Keysborough and Clyde North, and that does represent a significant increase in the southwestern suburbs where we’re getting more concerned and we have 14 cases in the eastern suburbs, including Doncaster and Donvale. There are three further cases we’re trying to nail down where they are. And we’ll update those in the release. Daniel Andrews is announcing an extra special treat for regional Victorians (excluding Ballarat). Gyms and pools can reopen excluding spas, saunas and steam rooms, with density limits in place, from 11:59pm tomorrow night. Hydrotherapy can go ahead, and tour buses can also operate with limits in place. Andrews: We have more cases today but we have a very high test and vaccine number. We said we wanted to do a million jabs in five weeks. We beat that. We have done that ahead of time. Thank you to every Victorian who has been part of that. We said when we got to 70% first dose there’ll be modest but meaningful things. That’s what we are announcing today. Doubling the distance from your home, doubling the time you can spend out of your home. And the notion of this outdoor social interaction, the thing so many people have talked to me about, craving, seeing those they’re closest to, getting out and about in a safe way engaged with others beyond their household. You’d like to do more, but we have more cases today than we have had for a very long time. We have more people in hospital than we have had for a very long time and we have to balance this out. We’re not 70% double dose but single dose. There is a big difference with that. Further announcements on the roadmap out of lockdown will be made on Sunday. Changes are also being made in Victoria for the construction sector, with first doses of vaccines to be mandatory by September 23. There have been ongoing concerns over transmission occurring across worksites and tea-rooms: Daniel Andrews: Construction workers statewide will need to show evidence to their employer that they have had at least a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine by 11:59pm on 23 September. Basically, construction workers have a week to get – if they’ve not already got a first dose – to go and get a first dose of any of the vaccines that are available. And they will need to demonstrate to their employer that they have done that. We have seen too many cases in construction ... the first dose by next Thursday is mandatory. That is required. No debates entered into. If you’ve got health reasons fair enough but people need to go and get vaccinated. That is not a choice that anyone should make. They should put their safety and the safety of the community first and go and get their first dose. Now, on from that, and I know this will be – there’ll be significant impact on this but we have seen many seeding events and transmission events that relate to construction, Ballarat is essentially one of those examples. But from 11:59pm tomorrow night, construction workers will no longer be able to cross back and forth over the metropolitan regional boundary. That is a challenge, I know, but we’re seeing far too many events and even people who have Covid safety at the front of their mind, if you’re travelling back and forth from metropolitan Melbourne into the regions and back again, then the virus will hitch a ride. That’s exactly what has happened and we have seen not only what’s happening in Ballarat but we have seen it in a number of other regional communities. More announcements for metropolitan Melbourne and regional Victoria are coming in thick and fast! From 11.59pm tomorrow: Two people will be able to train outdoors with a personal trainer. Skate parks and outdoor communal exercise will be open. Child minding for school-aged children at home will be extended for households with one authorised worker. Up to five people will be able to attend an entertainment venue or physical recreation facility for the purposes of broadcast of a performance, class or concert. Real estate inspections will resume by appointment only. The property would need to be vacant at the time of the inspection. The agent will stay outside, the prospective tenants or those seeking to purchase the home they will be able to move through the home and inspect it. From 11.59pm on Friday night, there will now be six reasons to leave the home in metropolitan Melbourne, and time permitted outside will double from two hours to four. The distance to travel from the home will also double from 5km to 10km. Premier Daniel Andrews says now the state has (almost) tipped over its 70% first-dose vaccination target, outdoor picnics will be allowed with one other person regardless of vaccination status, and five adults from two households if you’re fully vaccinated: We know this is what the community is craving, the notion of being able to see people they love and care for, the notion of being able to visit with other people that has to be done safely. That’s why the chief health officer has recommended and cabinet has endorsed that for this new category of outdoor social interaction, one person may meet with another person not from their household for a picnic or another outdoor activity regardless of whether they are vaccinated. Those who are fully vaccinated can meet in a group of up to five adults plus their dependents from as many as two households. If you’re not vaccinated or only have one dose, you can as a group of two go outside and have that social interaction outdoors. If you’re fully vaccinated that number goes from two to five but it is a maximum of two household. We will see from 11:59pm tomorrow night, into the weekend, groups of people outside enjoying each other’s company in a safe way. Those three steps are in line with what we had spoken about being able to deliver. In fact, they’re beyond what we had indicated we would deliver a couple of weeks ago. We’re not overselling it. They are modest changes but they are significant and I’m sure people will avail themselves of those options, options that have been not safe and been denied to the community over many weeks now. Back to Victoria: Andrews is providing an update on vaccinations. He says at some point today, the state will reach its 70% first vaccination dose target. There were 41,758 jabs administered yesterday: So I think it’s now our second highest day ever, so a really significant day, another day of almost 42,000 jabs. That’s in state hubs there. There will have been other vaccinations administered in other parts of the system. In conjunction with our GPs, and pharmacy, we are doing more first doses than any other state or territory across our country. That is - speaks to this notion of there’s not hesitancy out there. People are very keen to get vaccinated because I think the vast majority of Victorians know that’s how we keep each other safe and it’s how we get the place open and it’s how we get back to normal. There are appointments available today, as I stand here right now. AstraZeneca and Pfizer appointments, please go online and book one and then turn up. Get your jab, then a second dose and be absolutely at the centre of us opening up and keeping people safe and well. 69.2% of Victorians aged between 16 and over, they have been first dosed, that is to say 69.2% of Victorians have received a first dose of the eligible dough that means tonight and into tomorrow we will tip over that 70% first dose mark. The fact of the matter is somewhere across the state today someone will get the first dose and they will be - they will tip us over that 70% mark. That’s fantastic. Albanese has also asked the Labor be included in further consultation around the deal, given that the federal government will be going to election within the next nine months, and “there will be an 18-month period of further consultation and processes in order to move forward and to finalise any future arrangements. And I have suggested, as a mark of good faith to the Prime Minister this morning, that we establish a joint mechanism between the Government and Opposition senior members so that we have oversight of this process... And I commit as well to, if the Government agrees, to set up an appropriate process that, if elected prime minister, I would include the then opposition leader and appropriate people in such a forum going forward. Back to Canberra, Anthony Albanese has given three conditions that need to be met for Labor to support nuclear-powered submarines. Labor has three conditions for the support of nuclear-powered submarines, which we have sought assurance on. Firstly, that there be no requirement of a domestic civil nuclear industry. Secondly, that there be no acquisition of nuclear weapons. And, thirdly, that this agreement would be compatible with the non-proliferation treaty. All of those conditions, I believe, can be met. A number of changes are being announced today regarding Victoria’s lockdown. Here’s a summary from the premier, but don’t worry – we will break this down soon. Back to Albanese! The Victorian premier Daniel Andrews is speaking now, confirming there have been 514 new local Covid-19 cases detected overnight, 148 of which are currently linked to ongoing outbreaks. It brings active cases across the state to 4,370. There have been three new cases in Ballarat since the local government area entered lockdown overnight, bringing the total number of active cases to six, with more cases expected to be detected in the coming days. There are 182 people currently being treated in hospital, including 51 in intensive care and 29 on a ventilator. Of yesterday’s hospitalisations, 87% were not vaccinated, 12% were partially vaccinated and one person was fully vaccinated. Meanwhile, in Victoria, Daniel Andrews is providing today’s Covid-19 update (I’d hoped that since they are from the same party, Albo and Andrews would have coordinated the timing for this a bit better). Thankfully we have Caitlin Cassidy following the Victorian announcement! Albanese says the Labor party will be pursuing the government for transparency around the cost of the existing future submarine program, as well as this latest announcement. And we will be pursuing transparency from the government about exactly what the cost of this is. We know that the cost up to now has been up to $4 billion. We know there are contracts in place already that will be breached. And we know there will be substantial compensation costs payable. And Australian taxpayers are entitled to know, given that under this Government they began with arrangements with Japan, then arrangements with France, and now we have these arrangements with the United States and potentially the UK as well. We need to know the full cost of the abandonment of the existing program, but we also need to know what the cost of the proposed program would be. What the precise time frame is, given that the proposal is that the new submarines would not be in the water until 2040. What are the proposals for job creation? And, in particular, where those jobs will be located. How we maximise Australian procurement in this process, and Australian jobs. What are the skills that will be required? And how do we ensure that those skills can be provided by Australians? The opposition leader Anthony Albanese is speaking in Canberra about the Aukus trilateral deal to provide Australia with nuclear-powered submarines, announced today. He has started by criticising the “mismanagement” of Australia’s existing future submarine program. The first thing to say about today is that we are concerned at the mismanagement of the future submarine project that has occurred. After eight years, three prime ministers, six defence ministers, and billions of dollars of sunken costs in this program ... this is the most expensive example of something that has characterised this government. Its ability to promise but its inability to deliver. This government has stood up for years, in parliament, in the community, continually saying that everything was on track. ‘We’re on track in terms of jobs, we’re on track in terms of delivering defence capability.’ And now we have, with today’s announcement, beginning at the beginning, after considerable costs. Thank you so much to the brilliant Matilda Boseley! Hello everyone, Justine Landis-Hanley here. We should be hearing from Victorian premier Daniel Andrews soon with today’s Covid update. There are reports doing the rounds (circulating on Twitter) that Andrews is going to announce slightly eased restrictions today, now that more than 70% of the state population are at least half vaccinated. Think 10km travel radius, extra time for exercise, maybe picnics. The federal opposition leader Anthony Albanese is also scheduled to speak any minute about the Aukus submarines deal. OK, with that marathon of a morning over I might leave you for the day and let the wonderful Justine Landis-Hanley handle the opposition’s response to the submarine news (Albo will be up soon) and the Victorian Covid-19 press conference. Wish her luck! I’ll see you all tomorrow! Guardian Australia’s Katharine Murphy is out there in the trenches today, asking Morrison the following. Do we expect an enhanced US presence in the region in the time frame between now and when these submarines will be delivered? Morrison: These are matters that we are directly discussing with the United States and with United Kingdom. They’re also matters we’re discussing with the French and I hope we continue to discuss those matters with the French. You can expect to see Australia working with more and more partners but particularly with the United States and the United Kingdom as a result of this arrangement to ensure we’re addressing our strategic needs here in the region and for those to be done carefully and to be done in accordance with all the usual protocols and protections that you’d expect. Morrison has been asked how much money was wasted on the French submarine program. He doesn’t agree with the word “wasted”, he prefers “invested”, but anyway, turns out we wasted a whopping $2.4bn. Morrison: We’ve invested $2.4bn in the attack class program and I say all of that investment, I believe, has further built our capability and that is consistent with the decision that was taken back in 2016 for all the right reasons to protect Australia’s national security interests and has served that purpose. Investing in your defence capabilities is always a good idea for Australia and so that has been a good investment for Australia’s capability. When it comes to the delivery of this program, I indicated that we anticipate being able to commence build this year and the first of those submarines would be in the water, we believe, before the end of next decade and all partners will be working to ensure that that is achieved at a date as soon as is possible to achieve. That is important, not just for us, I remind – this is not just about a partnership serving Australia’s interests, this is a partnership that is serving the joint interests of the United States and the United Kingdom. So this is a capability that combines with this. So there is a great motivation and incentive for all three of us to get on with this and to get it done as quickly and effectively and always paramountly as safely as possible. That is what we will do. NSW press conference: The deputy premier John Barilaro is asked about the unemployment rate in NSW, which has, unsurprisingly, ticked up as the state’s lockdown has continued. More than 100,000 more people lost employment during the month. Mum and dad business owners have borne the brunt of this pandemic. Barilaro promises that the government is focused on getting businesses back to work. He’s also asked about the roadmap and what happens in NSW when 80% are vaccinated. He says there is an 80% plan that is in draft form and still being finished. In the next couple weeks we say more about unvaccinated people, major events and what Christmas looks like. Morrison has been asked about former prime minister Paul Keating’s comments this morning that Australia is playing a risky game trusting the US’s military capacity, given their recent defeat in Afghanistan, as Kabul fell to the Taliban in a number of days. I don’t share prime minister Keating’s view, and I prefer to be in the company of John Curtin and Robert Menzies when it comes this issue and John Howard. This has come from both sides of politics on both sides of the Pacific and this has always been a project that has gone well beyond any partisan issues I think in either country, and that is welcomed. Everyone’s entitled to their view of these issues. The former Labor* prime minister is entitled to his views and be respected for those views but those are not views my government shares. My government shares the view that is grounded in the decision of Curtin and Menzies which has always understood that our relationship with the United States is a forever relationship**. It is a relationship that has served our peace and security interests for a very, very long time and will forever into the future. What I’m excited about with this relationship is it brings together the third partner in what has been the most longstanding relationships for Australia, with the United Kingdom. There is also a very unique relationship there and this formalises that to a whole new level when it comes to defence and security and diplomatic relations. I welcome that and I think most Australians will. But one of the reasons the three of us come together is we respect democracy and we respect freedom and the diverse views that are there. *Oooft, pulling out the “Labor” card early, I see! **Sip Reporter: White House officials have briefed ... the nuclear submarines will allow Australia to play a much higher level in the Indo-Pacific defence and augment the US’s ability to have a more proactive military presence in the region? Is that the case? Should Australians expect more military action against China and what purpose might be served in terms of the security threat rather than against China? What impact do you think this will have in the South China Sea as well? Morrison: Australia will continue to engage with our partners in the region as we have for a long time. Clearly the Aukus partnership enables us with the capabilities that it will deliver to Australia and to our partners will enable us to do that even better than we are now. What that does is contribute stability in the region. It actually contributes to a secure Indo-Pacific, and it delivers I think a more free and open Indo-Pacific, whether that’s in the South China Sea or anywhere else. See, that is our purpose. Our purpose is to promote a free and open Indo-Pacific and we join with everybody who is seeking that purpose. A reporter has asked Morrison if we will be getting the British or US-made nuclear subs, as well as what the expected price tag will be. But Morrison says we don’t yet know: I’ll ask the secretary of defence to add to my answer. What we have agreed to do as the first initiative of Aukus is to put in place this 12-18 month program of finding the most effective pathway to delivering the submarine fleet for Australia. Reporter: So it could be either? Morrison: We haven’t determined the specific vessel that we will be building. But that will be done through the rather significant and comprehensive program assessment that will be done with our partners over the next 12-18 months. That will also inform the costs that relate to this and they are yet to be determined. NSW press conference: Hazzard has been asked whether he has sympathy for Jon-Bernard Kairouz, the TikToker turned anti lockdown activist who has now contracted Covid-19. Kairouz gained fame for accurately predicting the daily case numbers in NSW, prompting an investigation on whether they were being leaked from NSW Health. A long pause, then this: I have sympathy for anyone with Covid because it is a very serious disease. Morrison says he can’t see increased trade sanctions from China “corresponding with what Australia has done”. Reporter: Are you prepared for more economic trade sanctions from China in response to this and are you seeking a meeting with president Xi to explain what this is all about? Morrison: That engagement has already commenced with China as it has with many countries in the region including Quad partners in Japan and India. I spoke to Narendra Modi and the Japanese prime minister last night. I spoke to [New Zealand] prime minister Ardern, I’ll be having further calls today as we talk through those issues and engagement with China. There’s an open invitation for president Xi to discuss other matters. That has always been there. Australia is open to discuss issues important to the Indo-Pacific. I believe and hope we share the same objective of a peaceful Indo-Pacific where the sovereignty and independence of nations is understood and respected and enables their citizens to flourish. That’s what we all want. It is not an uncommon thing for countries to take decisions in their own strategic interests and build up their defence capabilities. China makes the same decisions as does other countries within our region. I don’t think that should be seen as necessarily extraordinary or in the terms that you suggested. Any response that was along the lines that you suggested I couldn’t see as that corresponding with what Australia has done. Now let’s hear from General Angus Campbell, who is just barely veiling how obviously the whole submarine deal was precipitated by the rise of China’s power in the region. Our strategic environment has deteriorated. Our key strategic documents speak of this. That challenging environment is becoming more challenging and is set to do so into the future at an accelerated pace*. This decision is very welcome in terms of the development of the Australian defence forces for its structure and its forced posture, and particularly that a long view potential of the Aukus agreement and the wide range of advanced technologies the three nations will work together to build on and to develop for the security and stability of our own nations, and indeed of our region. The Australian Defence Force and the Department of Defence have a wide range now of work to do through this 12-18 month period. But as the secretary has emphasised, the commitment to our obligations under the non-proliferation treaty are absolute. Our determination to safely and appropriately understand, develop and employ these capabilities is the total commitment of our organisation in that regard. And we look forward to the continuing development of Australian defence and security capabilities suited for our nation. *Oooft! Australia’s secretary of defence Greg Moriarty is up: I reassure you and the government and the Australian people of defence’s absolute commitment to the highest international standards of nuclear safety and security. We are also committed to our non-proliferation treaty obligations. Our international partners demand that of us, and we are determined to be able to meet those standards. It’s an enormous amount of work we will be doing in the coming 18 months ... The task force will look at issues such as the industrial pathway, the weapons suite ... the skilling and workforce needs that we will have not just in defence but broadly in the Australian defence industry. We’ll be looking at that full range of infrastructure needs, what we need to do in terms of developing future capabilities to be able to build, operate and sustain these capabilities to give Australia that sovereign capability. Morrison closed his statement by celebrating Australia reaching an important vaccine milestone: I will note on another matter today we will hit 70% of the country aged over 16 who have had their first dose. That 70% double dose and 80% double dose mark is within plain sight. Keep going Australia. Still in NSW: Gale is asked whether the latest result of 1,351 cases – up on the daily numbers this week but down from the peak of the week before – indicates that NSW’s outbreak of Covid-19 has peaked. She hedges: I hope we have peaked but we are being conservative. We may yet see an increase. She said the future trajectory of cases in NSW was in the hands of its citizens and whether we continue to abide by the stay at home orders. In NSW, deputy chief health officer Dr Marriane Gale has been asked about the lockdown of the Redfern towers, a major public housing complex in inner Sydney. Twelve people have tested positive for Covid out of the 630 residents. Gale says there has been a lot of outreach prior to this outbreak and two-thirds of the residents have had at least one dose of vaccine. She said there were 330 tests yesterday, and there were teams on site offering advice on how to safely self-isolate, including providing masks, cleaning products, food and social support. Residents who could not safely isolate were being offered opportunities to move, she said. Back to the NSW Covid press conference: Hazzard has been asked why some LGAs remain in lockdown and some are not in lockdown when the rate of infection is about the same. He explained that NSW Health looks at other factors including the amount of movement between areas and that unfortunately the department has not recommended the release of any of the LGAs of concern. The prime minister has offered a semi-apology to the French president Emmanuel Macron, after ditching our $90 billion submarine deal with the country. Morrison: As noted we will not be continuing with the attack class submarine program and have advised Naval Group and the government of France and President Macron of that decision. I want to stress that France remains an incredibly important partner in the Pacific. There is few if any other country around the world that understands the importance of the Pacific and has been as committed to the Pacific as France. These are matters that President Macron and I have discussed on many occasions. We share a deep passion for our Pacific family and a deep commitment to them, and I look forward and I hope to see us continue once we move past what is obviously a very difficult and disappointing decision for France. I understand that. I respect it. But as a prime minister, I must make decisions that are in Australia’s national security I know that France would do the same. And I know ultimately that will be understood. Morrison says the submarines will not be the only advances Australia’s defence makes, with funding being funnelled towards missile capacity and a promise that military funding will only go up. This is not the only thing we have to do. Our investment in defence will only increase in the future. The lift will only go up, it won’t come back down. We will have to do more. We have invested more as a government. We have increased our defence spending as a share of our economy to over 2% ahead of time, and we will have to keep pressing forward. Not just to meet these significant commitments we’re entering into to develop this nuclear submarine capability, but the many other capabilities that will be necessary. To ensure we keep Australians safe and we have a stable and secure region for the future. Today I’m announcing in addition to the acquisitions announced as part of the 2024 structure plan, that we will be enhancing our long range strike capability including hawk and tomahawk cruise missiles and extended missile range for the our capabilities. And others can speak further to those. These capabilities will be counted with our planned life of type extension of Australia’s Collins class submarine fleet. Which remains I stress one of the most capable conventional submarines in the world and will enhance our ability to deter and respond to potential security challenges during the transition to a fleet of nuclear-powered submarines. Scott Morrison really wants the international community to know that Australia is not trying to become a global nuclear power. I stress again, this is about propulsion. This is not about acquiring nuclear weapons. Australia has no interest in that. No plans for it, no policy for it, no contemplation of it. It’s not on our agenda. And we will continue to meet all of our obligations under the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, as our partners in this exercise will also do. Morrison says Australia does not need domestic nuclear power capability in order to run the new generation of nuclear submarines we are buying. The developments that have occurred since 2016 do now make a nuclear-powered submarine fleet a feasible option for Australia, which is what I first tasked the secretary of defence to inquire into. We now have the support and expertise of the United States and the United Kingdom. Next-generation nuclear-powered submarines will use reactors that do not need refuelling during the life of the boat. A civil nuclear power capability here in Australia is not required to pursue this new capability. But there have also been game-changing developments in the strategic circumstances of our region*, which continue to accelerate at a pace even not envisaged as little as five years ago. Contractual gates were build into the attack class project, necessarily. Those gates were there for a reason. Decisions have to be made before you proceed through those gates, and so, as we were looking towards that next gate, we have decided not to enter through it as part of the attack class program but instead now to pursue this path which gives us a far greater capability to meet the strategic needs. *Once again, he is talking about China, if you didn’t know. Morrison has confirmed that this new deal does in fact mean the death of the $90 billion French attack submarine project. He says it is not a “change of mind, it’s a change of need”. As our first major initiative, it is, as we have announced today, for Australia to achieve a nuclear-powered submarine fleet. Not a nuclear-armed, a nuclear-powered. And to commence that build here in Australia in Adelaide within the decade. Nuclear submarines have clear advantages. Greater endurance, they’re faster, they have greater power, greater stealth, more carrying capacity. These make nuclear submarines the desired substantial capability enhancement that Australia has needed. It helps us to build regional resilience as part of this first initiative. It is the first time this technology has ever been made available to Australia. And indeed one other country has only been given access to this technology back in the late ‘50s, the United Kingdom from the United States. This is a one-off, as the president in Washington has made very clear. This is a very special arrangement. And a very important one for Australia. Australia was not in a position, at the time we took the decision back in 2016, to build and operate a nuclear-powered submarine. That wasn’t on the table. It wasn’t on the table for a range of reasons, so the decision we have made to not continue with the attack class submarine and to go down this path is not a change of mind, it’s a change of need. The goal has remained the same. And Australians would expect me as prime minister to ensure that we have the best possible capability to keep them safe. And to be unhindered in pursuing that as best as I possibly can. And that is what I have done. Morrison: This forever partnership* that we have announced today is the single greatest initiative to achieve these goals since the Anzus alliance itself. It is the single largest step we have been able to take to advance our defence capabilities in this country, not just at this point but for the future. It has been some time in the making, it is true to say. These types of forever partnerships don’t happen overnight. It has been the product of great patience, of great determination, of a deep relationship forged between our nations and, indeed, the personal-level working relationships that we have been able to forge between leaders, between ministers, between our systems over an even longer period of time, led, of course, by the chief of the defence force and the secretary of defence, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the many missions they have been involved in around the world but particularly in these countries, particularly in these countries. It is a forever partnership that has been diligently pursued by my government to enhance cooperation, to deepen our integration, to position Australia in the best and strongest way possible and to contribute to the stability and security of our region that will benefit all in our region, no exceptions. *Take a sip of coffee every time Morrison says “forever partnership”. Morrison says the agreement with the US and UK is a “forever partnership for a new time between the oldest and most trusted of friends”: The relatively benign environment we have enjoyed in many decades in our region is behind us. We have entered, no doubt a new era*, with new challenges** for Australia and for our partners and friends and countries right across our region. This challenge will require more of us in Australia and all of us who share a common vision about peace and stability and security in our region, so all nations can enjoy the fellowship of our region, the trade and the opportunities for our peoples, so they can realise what they want for their countries, just as we want for our country. That’s what we seek. That’s what Australians and our friends have always sought. Today, I announce a new partnership, a new agreement that I describe as a forever partnership a forever partnership for a new time between the oldest and most trusted of friends, a forever partnership that will enable Australia to protect our national security interests***, to keep Australians safe. And to work with our partners across the region to achieve the stability and security of our region. *Of a more powerful China **China ***From China This is the first time the press has had the chance to interrogate the submarine deal as this morning’s press conference did not have time for questions. Okay wow! Things are moving quickly. The prime minister Scott Morrison has stepped up now to talk to the press about that massive nuclear-powered submarine news this morning. When asked for more details on the Lismore case Barilaro confirmed a school campus has been caught up in the potential outbreak. We know a parent returned back to Lismore with their child. It was an exposure in a school environment as well. There are issues there and we don’t know what that exposure looks like so we’ve made the right and appropriate decision to lock down Lismore. There are concerns for other, newly freed regional areas that have recorded cases in the last day. Reporter: A case has been confirmed in Glen Innes. How likely is it that you will lock down that region later this afternoon? Barilaro: We work with the advice from health and we have updates to this morning and the Glen Innes case that’s been notified overnight post the 8pm reporting period, we’ll work with the local health team when we have further information. It’s no different to cases in Albury, that were identified yesterday and Liz more was last night. We’ll do that in a measured way before a knee-jerk reaction about locking down an area. Here is John Barilaro with the good news for some regional NSW towns who will be coming out of lockdown, although will still live under considerable restrictions: Barilaro: On a weekly basis we will be evaluating other local government areas of regional and rural New South Wales that come out of lockdown, out of restrictions and today can I can announce a further 12 local government areas in regional and rural New South Wales. Those areas are Bega Valley, Blayney, bogan, Cabonne, Dungog, Forbes, Muswellbrook, Narrabri, Parkes, Singleton, Snowy Monaro and the Upper Hunter shire LGAs. Good news for those communities today. Remain vigilant. Get tested if you have an onset of symptoms. Please minimise mobility, as much as possible. NSW deputy chief health officer Dr Marianne Gale is giving details about why Albury and Lismore must return to lockdown. We have two cases in Albury, where we are unsure of the source of those infections. There are possible links to Sydney. However, that is under investigation by the local public health teams. Those people appear unrelated to each other. There are a number of exposure sites in the Albury area and those issues are being worked through by the local team so I’d ask everybody living in the Albury area to please be vigilant for systems and come forward for testing. In terms of Lismore, we report one case in Lismore, again with a possible link to Sydney and again with exposures in the community around Lismore, so for residents of Lismore, again, we ask you to please monitor for symptoms, pay attention to the public health advice and come forward for testing promptly. Before we get to that though, here is Hazzard with the breakdown of all the regional NSW cases for today. There are 44 new cases reported in the Illawarra. That brings the total in that particular local health district now to 502 cases. Twenty-one cases are from the Wollongong local government area, 20 cases are from the Shellharbour local government area, two cases are from the Kiama local government area, and one case is from the Shoalhaven local government area. In western New South Wales, there have been 27 new cases reported to 8pm last night. And this brings the total to 1,004 cases in that area. Dubbo had 12 cases. Bathurst had six, Walgett and the general region had six, Burke had two and Wellington had one. In the far west of the state, there were two further cases in Broken Hill. In the Hunter, there were 16 new cases across the Hunter-New England local health district. This brings the total to 367 since 5 August. Of those 16 new cases, six are from Lake Macquarie local government area, five are from Newcastle local government area, three are from Cessnock local government area, one is from Gunnedah local government area and one is from Port Stephens. On the Central Coast, there were also more cases – 23 new cases have been reported in that area and that brings the total in that local health district to 312 cases. In the southern New South Wales area, there have been three new cases. One of those cases was in Yass, one in Bomberra and one in Queanbeyan. In the Southern Highlands, there have been two new cases. It’s worth noting that the deputy NSW premier John Barilaro is expected to step up soon to announce other local government areas that will be coming out of lockdown today as well. The Albury lockdown is made particularly complicated as the city is only half of the wider Albury-Wodonga community, which straddles the NSW-Victorian border. Wodonga, part of regional Victoria, is not currently in lockdown. Hazzard: Can I also say that in Albury, that area is principally managed through the Victorian health system, of course, the Albury-Wodonga system, but New South Wales Health will establish some additional pop-ups for testing in that area and there are a range of opportunities for vaccinations in that area, including GPs and also the service that is operated through the Albury-Wodonga service. But we’ll be doing everything we can to make sure that people do have access to vaccinations. The NSW health minister Brad Hazzard has confirmed that two regional NSW LGAs will be plunged back into lockdown after positive cases were recorded there. There are two areas that unfortunately will have to go into lockdown. One is the local government area of Lismore. And one is the local government area of Albury. Suffice to say there have been positive cases in both areas. Can I say that I express my sadness to the local community that have been free of that for a little while, they have to go back into lockdown, but it is for your safety and the community’s safety more broadly. That lockdown will occur from 6pm today. [The] health [department] has made a decision that the period of lockdown initially will be seven days. The reason for that is to try and get a handle on what exactly is going on in the local areas. In the normal course, more often than not, health determines it will be 14 days but at this case, looking at the issues, health has determined that seven days will be appropriate but I’m just warning the community that it may be longer. The Greens have asked a parliamentary committee to compel Christian Porter to provide more information about the blind trust that partly paid his legal fees in his defamation case against the ABC. The party’s deputy leader Larissa Waters has written to the privileges committee and attorney general’s department asking “if it could compel Mr Porter to provide the identity of the contributor/s to the blind trust, and the amount/s donated”. The Greens argue further information about the donors is needed to determine if they have to register under the foreign influence transparency scheme. Waters wrote: It is in the interests of transparency and good governance to ensure that the public are aware of who has contributed to Mr Porter’s considerable legal fees and ensure a member of cabinet is not under threat of undue influence. On Tuesday Porter revealed in an update to his register of interests that “a blind trust known as the Legal Services Trust” had paid part of the fees for the now discontinued defamation case against the ABC. The former attorney general did not disclose the trustees or the source of the funds, claiming that as a potential beneficiary he had “no access to information about the conduct and funding of the trust”. It is not known how much the trust contributed. A spokesperson for Porter said he had “undertaken disclosure in accordance with the requirements of the register and consistent with previous members’ disclosure of circumstances where the costs of personal legal matters have been mitigated by contributions or reductions in fees”. Hazzard: There are now more than 15,000 people with Covid-19 who are being cared for in our New South Wales health system. The majority of those, over 90%, are being cared for in the community, at home generally, and some are in the New South Wales Health special accommodation. Hazzard: Across New South Wales, 80.1% of the over-16 population has received a first dose of Covid-19 vaccine and 48.5% of the entire community over 16 are fully vaccinated. I want to thank the community for coming out in such strong numbers to be vaccinated because there are almost 8.5 million people in New South Wales that have had vaccines administered to them. Supporters of the Murugappan family from Biloela are concerned if a federal circuit court does not allow three of the family’s members to reapply for a bridging visa, they face being returned to immigration detention or deported to Sri Lanka. Before the family were put into community detention in Perth earlier this year, Nades, Priya and Kopika were given bridging visas in June last year. If those expire on Wednesday next week, supporters say the three face the possibility of being returned to immigration detention or removed from Australia. The case before the federal circuit court on Thursday does not cover the youngest daughter, Tharnicaa, who currently has a brief before the immigration minister, Alex Hawke, to consider her case. The argument before the court is that when the government decided to “lower the bar” to prevent the family from reapplying for the visa, the family were denied procedural fairness. The court heard this morning that submissions on the decision made by the family’s lawyers were sent at 5.35pm AEST, and a brief was provided to the minister at 6.58pm, and decision was made at 7.20pm on the same day. The government is arguing that the submissions should have been in by 5pm, while lawyers acting for the family argue it was unclear when the submissions were due, and it was unfair that the department rushed to a decision without first checking whether a submission had been made. The hearing continues. Here is a look at today’s NSW case numbers on the outbreak graph. Here are the details of those 12 Covid-19 deaths from NSW from the state’s health department: A man in his 60s from western Sydney died at Northern Beaches Hospital. A man in his 60s from south-western Sydney died at Northern Beaches Hospital. A woman in her 80s from western Sydney died at Westmead Hospital. A woman in her 80s from south-western Sydney died at Concord Hospital. A woman in her 60s from south-eastern Sydney died at Prince of Wales Hospital. A man in his 40s from western Sydney died at Nepean Hospital. A woman in her 80s from western Sydney died at Westmead Hospital. A woman in her 70s from western Sydney died at Nepean Hospital. A man in his 70s from south-western Sydney died at Campbelltown Hospital. A woman in her 60s from south-western Sydney died at home. A man in his 50s from western Sydney died at Westmead Hospital. The NSW health minister Brad Hazzard is speaking now, and has confirmed the state has recorded 1,351 local covid-19 cases. Sadly, again, 12 people infected with Covid-19 have died. We will also be hearing from the ACT leaders at 11.45am (AEST) and we still don’t have a time for the Victorian press conference. FYI, we are just standing by for the NSW press conference now. Everyone who is still playing the morning coffee game with me, take a massive sip, for the Queensland premier has made her most baffling graphic design choice yet. Now I’m straying into the territory of opinion here, but this is what I dislike the most: 1. Totally hate “jab army” as a slogan. 2. Why the emoji? 3. WHY THE CUSTOM TATTOO?! A little blog treat to keep you going this morning. Here is the defence minister Peter Dutton not knowing how to do an elbow bump! The competition watchdog says it is concerned about the planned takeover of pork producer Rivalea by Australia’s biggest meat and food processing company, JBS. In a statement released on Thursday, the deputy chair of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, Mick Keogh, said: “The ACCC’s preliminary view is that while JBS and Rivalea do not compete closely, the proposed acquisition may give rise to vertical integration concerns.” You can read more about the Batista brothers behind JBS and their battle for domination in the world of meat (and fish!) in this piece we published last month: The ACCC’s concerns centre on Rivalea’s Diamond Valley Pork abattoir, which currently provides a service killing pigs for third parties, and the fact JBS owns smallgoods company Primo. Keogh said: We are concerned that JBS’ existing interests may give it the incentive to restrict access to service kills at the Diamond Valley Pork abattoir, as well as frustrating access to fresh pork for its downstream rivals in smallgoods production and pork wholesaling. Our concern is not limited to JBS potentially denying access to processing facilities, it’s also about the price and terms on which access would be provided. The ACCC is seeking submissions from interested parties until the end of the month. The New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern has confirmed that Australian submarines developed under the new Aukus defence pact will be banned from New Zealand waters, under the country’s longstanding nuclear-free policy. Ardern released a statement on the Aukus alliance: New Zealand’s position in relation to the prohibition of nuclear powered vessels in our waters remains unchanged. Since the 1980s, New Zealand has had a strict policy keeping its territorial sea, land and airspace as nuclear-free zones. The policy, made partly in solidarity with pacific islands suffering the fallout of nuclear testing, created a rift with the United States, which suspended its obligations to New Zealand under the Anzus treaty. The prime minister also said the new arrangement “in no way changes our security and intelligence ties with these three countries, as well as Canada”. New Zealand is first and foremost a nation of the Pacific and we view foreign policy developments through the lens of what is in the best interest of the region. We welcome the increased engagement of the UK and US in the region and reiterate our collective objective needs to be the delivery of peace and stability and the preservation of the international rules based system. Australia, the US and UK announced the new trilateral security partnership on Wednesday. Aimed at confronting China, it will include helping Australia to build nuclear-powered submarines. New Zealand and Canada – two of the Five Eyes security partners – were notably absent. I’ll bring you more on this in a second but it seems the New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern plans to ban Australia’s future nuclear-powered submarines from the country’s waters. Now, this isn’t totally surprising though as New Zealand has banned all nuclear-powered vessels from entering its waters since the 198os. Heads up, there are some new exposure sites in northern NSW. Keating says Australia would find itself “hostage to any such ... gambit” between between China and the US: It has to be remembered that China is a continental power and the United States is a naval power. And that the United States supply chain to East Asia would broadly need to span the whole Pacific from its base in San Diego and other places along the American west coast. Australia, by the announced commitments, would find itself hostage to any such a gambit. There is no doubt about the Liberals: 240 years after we departed from Britain, we are back there with Boris Johnson, trying to find our security in Asia through London. Such is the continual failure of the Liberal party to have any faith in Australia’s capacity, but more particularly, the rights to its own independence and freedom of action. When the detail of these arrangements is more clear I will have more to say. Here is a bit more from former prime minister Paul Keating, who has slammed the Australian submarine deal with the US and UK. Keating suggests the US would have no hope of winning a war against China given its recent failures in Afghanistan. This arrangement would witness a further dramatic loss of Australian sovereignty, as material dependency on the United States robbed Australia of any freedom or choice in any engagement Australia may deem appropriate. Australia has had great difficulty in running a bunch of Australian built conventional submarines – imagine the difficulty in moving to sophisticated nuclear submarines, their maintenance and operational complexity. And all this at a time when United States reliability and resolution around its strategic commitments and military engagements are under question. If the United States military with all its might could not beat a bunch of Taliban rebels with AK47 rifles in pickup trucks, what chance would it have in a full-blown war against China, not only the biggest state in the world but the commander and occupant of the largest landmass in Asia? When it comes to conflict, particularly among great powers, land beats water every time. Ooft, yep, the former prime minister Paul Keating isn’t happy about the new submarine deal either: The announced agreement between the United States, Britain and Australia... will amount to a lock-in of Australian military equipment and thereby forces, with those of the United State with only one underlying objective: The ability to act collectively in any military engagement by the United state again China. You can read this lengthy statement below: The former Australian foreign affairs minister and NSW premier, Bob Carr, is calling for a full inquiry into the botched French submarine deal, questioning the government’s ability to pull off the even more complicated nuclear project. I mentioned before that the French company tasked with manufacturing the submarines for Australia, Naval Group, was pretty darn annoyed that they were getting sidelined by this new deal. Here is the company’s full statement: Naval Group takes note of the decision of the Australian authorities to acquire a fleet of nuclear submarines in collaboration with the United States and the United Kingdom. The Commonwealth decided not to proceed with the next phase of the program. This is a major disappointment for Naval Group, which was offering Australia a regionally superior conventional submarine with exceptional performances. Naval Group was also offering Australia a sovereign submarine capability making unrivalled commitments in terms of technology transfer, jobs and local content. For five years, Naval Group teams, both in France and in Australia, as well as our partners, have given their best and Naval Group has delivered on all its commitments. The analysis of the consequences of this sovereign Australian decision will be conducted with the Commonwealth of Australia in the coming days. More from Ballarat: Queensland has reported one new local case in home quarantine. Seems it’s a student from St Thomas More college, connected with the Sunnybank cluster, which is generally considered to be under control. The state also had two cases in hotel quarantine. If there wasn’t enough going on, SpaceX has just launched four amateur astronauts into space. Some footage from Cape Canaveral, Florida: In other news, Queensland is set to legalise voluntary assisted dying today, AAP’s Marty Silk reports. Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk’s bill will allow people suffering a disease, illness or medical condition that is advanced, progressive and terminal to access to voluntary assisted dying from next year. Their condition must be expected to cause death within a year, they must have decision-making capacity and proceed without coercion. At least 59 of the state’s 93 MPs are indicating they will vote in support of the bill. Deputy premier Steven Miles says the laws will ease pain and suffering: For me, I do not know if the loved ones I have seen suffer at the end of their lives would have wanted access to voluntary assisted dying. I would like them to have known they had a choice. Most Labor MPs, the two Greens MPs and independent Sandy Bolton support the VAD bill, while most Liberal National Party MPs, three Katter’s Australian party MPs and One Nation MP Stephen Andrew oppose it. LNP leader David Crisafulli and his deputy David Janetzki oppose the bill on principle but submitted 54 amendments, which they said would improve safeguards for conscientious objectors and reporting processes. Labor MPs Linus Power, Bart Mellish and Joe Kelly will also cross the floor. Meanwhile, at least eight LNP MPs said they would vote in support of the bill, stating their strong belief in individual freedom and agency. The final vote on the VAD bill is set to be held on Thursday after MPs vote on Janetzki’s 54 proposed amendments. The scheme will operate from January 2023, meaning Queensland will became the fifth jurisdiction in Australia to legalise euthanasia. France has released a formal statement about Australia’s decision to withdraw from its French submarine contract in light of the new Aukus pact. French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian and armed forces minister Florence Parly say the decision removes France from a partnership with Australia in the strategically important region: It is a decision contrary to the letter and the spirit of the cooperation which prevailed between France and Australia … The American choice which leads to the pushing aside of an ally and European partner like France from a structuring partnership with Australia, at a time when we are facing unprecedented challenges in the Indo-Pacific region … marks an absence of consistency that France can only observe and regret. Le Drian and Parly’s statement adds that the “regrettable decision” is a “loud and clear” signal that Europe needs to pursue “strategic autonomy”: There is no other credible way to defend our interests and values in the world, including the Indo-Pacific. South Australia’s premier Steven Marshall has weighed in on the new submarine deal. He says SA will play a “key role”: The Alfred hospital emergency department has been listed as a tier-one exposure site: We are expecting to hear from NSW health minister Brad Hazzard at the 11am press conference today. It doesn’t seem likely that the premier will make an appearance: The regional Victorian city of Ballarat has recorded six cases overnight, according to local news. The city was plunged into lockdown yesterday after four new cases were detected in the region. Testing is being also being ramped up in the area to combat the cluster, with thousands of additional vaccine doses diverted its way. Oh! Today was also a testing record in Victoria! By way of background, yesterday Victorian premier Daniel Andrews said the state was at 68.3% vaccination and was on track to hit 70% today. The government has previously pledged to give Melburnians more freedoms, including an extra hour of exercise and an expanded travel limit, once 70% of those eligible have received their first dose. This was initially forecast to happen on 23 September but the state’s soaring vaccination rate has brought the date forward. The ABC is reporting that Victorian officials may be considering easing restrictions slightly further now that the state has reached the milestone of 70% of the over-16 population receiving at least one dose of a Covid vaccine: Adam Bandt is going hard on this whole “floating Chernobyls” thing this morning: Federal senator for SA Rex Patrick says today’s nuclear submarine deal “must be subject to rigorous parliamentary review”, as domestic political reactions to the landmark announcement start to trickle in. Here is what he had to say: In these circumstances, the Senate foreign affairs, defence and trade references committee should open an immediate inquiry to ensure that all the angles, including alternative conventionally powered submarine procurement options, are fully explored and understood ... I’ve been a strong critic of the French submarine deal. The delays and cost overruns are huge and unacceptable. But we have to be careful we don’t move from one massive procurement disaster into something else that hasn’t been thought through properly ... Prime minister Morrison has indicated that these new nuclear-powered vessels will be built in Adelaide. It is unclear whether this would involve manufacturing or just assembly of pre-manufactured modules supplied from the US or UK. Either way, there would be nuclear reactors sitting on hard-stands at Osborne and moored in the Port River. Acquiring, operating and maintaining a nuclear submarine fleet without a domestic nuclear power industry is a challenge that must not be underestimated. Never fear, Josh Nicholas is here with the Victorian case number graph. Actually, maybe do fear a little – I really don’t like the look of that gradient. Scott Morrison REALLY wants you to know that we are not trying to get our hands on nuclear weapons: Victoria’s numbers are in and the state case recorded 514 new local cases of Covid-19. Only 148 have been linked to known outbreaks. The department’s tweet does not mention any Covid-19 deaths today. The Greens leader says it is concerning that there were no discussions about nuclear safety during this morning’s trilateral press conference. Both literally and geopolitically. Adam Bandt: I also do think that it is attempting to gain a beachhead for a nuclear industry in Australia, which we know has been something that the Coalition, many people in the Coalition have been pushing for, for some period of time. But at the end of the day, the prime minister needs to explain – what will happen if there’s an accident with a nuclear reactor now in the heart of one of our major cities? How many people in Brisbane, Adelaide or Perth will die as a result of it? What is going to happen if there is a problem with one of the nuclear reactors? And today we’ve heard nothing about the safety. Adam Bandt says it’s dangerous to be provoking nuclear-capable China at this time: Well, these will be floating Chernobyls in the heart of our major cities. And it will increase tensions in our region at a time when Australia, as a middle power, should be taking an independent course and doing everything that we can to de-escalate conflict in the region. We know that China has got nuclear capabilities and we should be doing everything we can to avoid a nuclear conflict in our region because Australia will suffer. And instead we are aligning ourselves with a policy of escalation, and the prime minister has very clearly said that he sees this in cold war terms. And the cold war ended up in an arms race that almost ended up in nuclear annihilation. We cannot go back there. We should be de-escalating. And instead this takes us in the opposite direction. Federal Greens leader Adam Bandt says the nuclear submarine deal is the “worst security decision in decades”. He is speaking to ABC News Breakfast now – his words have a distinct ‘I practised this in the mirror before I came on TV’ energy: It’s a dangerous decision that will make Australia less safe by putting floating Chernobyls in the heart of our major city, increasing the risk of nuclear war in our region, and putting Australia right in the firing line. It’s a terrible decision. It’s one of the worst security decisions in decades. The Greens will fight it tooth and nail and we hope that Labor joins us in fighting it, because if Labor opposes it as well as the Greens, it will be dead in the water. Naval Group has released a statement to AFP, France24 reports, expressing “great disappointment” over the new pact: The Commonwealth of Australia did not wish to initiate the next phase of the program, which is a great disappointment for Naval Group, who offered Australia a conventional submarine of regional superiority with exceptional performance. The new submarine deal seems popular with the UK’s Conservative party: Business owners vowing to ignore the NSW government’s push to require people to be fully vaccinated to enter shops, bars or restaurants are unlikely to find the law on their side, an expert says. The premier said the government would “need to seek legal advice”, saying it was in “uncharted territory”. But experts have said the government would be on solid ground in its attempts to mandate vaccinations for certain freedoms. While the NSW government is facing legal challenges to some of its public health orders, including rules requiring police officers and healthcare workers to be vaccinated, Dr Ron Levy, an associate professor at the Australian National University’s college of law, said the legal prospects for people opposed to vaccine mandates was “quite poor”. You can read the full report below: Naval Group – formerly DCNS, the French shipbuilder previously awarded submarine contract – is yet to comment on the new alliance and Australia’s ditching of the $90bn agreement. But an unnamed senior official from France’s ministry of armed forces has weighed in on the “unofficial reason” – “American entryism”. Speaking to Le Parisien today, the official denounced the Biden administration for “making life difficult” (or “soaping the plank”, if you prefer a literal translation), and strong-arming the contract away from the French. Another “expert on the matter” told the publication there’s also a risk of a ripple effect on other contracts, including with India and Brazil. “We will have to communicate and reassure … [that] this is not a technical failure but a geopolitical decision.” A wealthy Pentecostal church was handed $660,000 in jobkeeper payments and later posted a 3,620% increase in profit and a $1.2m increase in revenue. Hope Unlimited church, a global church that began on the New South Wales Central Coast, revealed in filings to the charity regulator that it posted a $1.6m profit last year while receiving $660,000 in jobkeeper payments. The result was a huge increase to the $43,355 profit it posted in 2019. Revenues for the church also grew throughout the pandemic’s first year, increasing from $2.8m in 2019 to $4m in 2020. The church is led by Mark and Darlene Zschech, a well-known Christian singer, who spent 25 years alongside Brian and Bobbie Houston at Hillsong, before breaking away to form a new church. You can read the full report below: Well, Morrison, Johnson and Biden wouldn’t say it, but former Australian prime minister Tony Abbott doesn’t seem to have any qualms in naming China when discussing the submarine deal: This is a historic and important decision made by the Australian government ... Important because it acknowledges the scale of the strategic challenge from China and declares that Australia will play our part in meeting it. So how is France taking the news that our $90bn submarine partnership might be out the window? Well, the former French ambassador to the United States isn’t mincing his words, saying the US and UK have “stabbed her [France] in the back”. Just ducking over to Covid-19 news for a second: the regional Victorian town of Ballarat has been plunged back into lockdown just days after opening up, after two positive cases were recorded yesterday. Oooft! Here is a fairly cruel reading of the “fella down under” line from Joe Biden: Here is the full written statement about the deal, if you are so inclined: South Australian Labor is keen to iron out the details of how exactly these submarines are expected to be built: If you want to get all the background on this watershed deal, check out Julian Borger’s story below: Joe Biden is once again stressing that the US and UK aren’t handing over nuclear weapons to Australia: As a key project under Aukus, we are launching consultations with Australia with the acquisition of conventionally armed, nuclear-powered submarines for its navy. Conventionally armed. I want to be exceedingly clear about this. We’re not talking about nuclear-armed submarines. These are conventionally armed submarines powered by nuclear reactors. This technology is proven and safe. In the United States and UK, we have been operating nuclear-powered submarines for decades. I have asked Secretary Austin of the Department of Defence to lead this effort for the US government in close collaboration with the Department of Energy and the Department of State. Our governments will now launch an 18-month consultation period to determine every element of this program, from workforce to training requirements, to production timelines, to safeguards and non-proliferation measures, and to nuclear stewardship and safety to ensure full compliance with each of our nation’ commitments under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. We’ll all undertake this effort in a way that reflects the longstanding leadership in global non-proliferation and vigorous verification standards, in partnership, in consultation with the International Atomic Energy Agency. So I want to thank the prime minister, prime minister Morrison and prime minister Johnson, for their friendship. But most importantly for their leadership and partnership as we undertake this new phase of the security cooperation. And the United States will also continue to work with Asean and the Quad, as stated earlier. The five treaty allies in the Indo-Pacific, as well as allies around the world to have a free and open Indo-Pacific. And build a future of peace and prosperity for all of the people of the region. We’re joining together, where partnerships are getting stronger. This is what you’re about. I want to thank you all and I look forward to seeing both of you in person very soon, I hope. Thank you. OK! Here is the big-name speaker at this press conference, Joe Biden. And he starts off folksy as ever: Thank you, Boris, and I want to thank that fella down under! Thank you very much, pal! Appreciate it, Mr prime minister! ... Our nations and our brave fighting forces have stood shoulder-to-shoulder for literally more than 100 years through the trench fighting in world war one, the island hopping in world war two during the frigid heat in North Korea and the scourging heat of the Persian Gulf. Australia and the United Kingdom have long been capable and faithful partners and we’re even closer today. Today, we’re taking another historic step to deepen and formalise cooperation among all three of our nations because we all recognise the imperative of ensuring peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific over the long term. We need to be able to address both the current strategic environment in the region and how it may evolve. Because the future of each of our nation, and indeed, the world, depends on a free and open Indo-Pacific, enduring and flourishing in the decades ahead. This is about investing in our greatest source of strength, our alliances, and updating them to better meet the threats of today and tomorrow. It’s about connecting America’s existing allies and partners in new ways and amplifying our ability to collaborate – recognising that there is no regional divide separating the interests of our Atlantic and Pacific partners. UK prime minister Boris Johnson: We will have a new opportunity to reinforce Britain’s place at the leading edge of science and technology – strengthening our national expertise and perhaps, most significantly, the UK, Australia and the US will be joined even more closely together, reflecting the measure of trust between us, the depths of our friendship and the enduring strength of our shared values of freedom and democracy. Only a handful of countries possess nuclear-powered submarines. And it is a momentous decision for any nation to acquire this formidable capability. And perhaps, equally momentous for any other state to come to its aid. But Australia is one of our oldest friends, a kindred nation and a fellow democracy and a natural partner in this enterprise. Now, the UK will embark on this project alongside our allies, making the world safer and generating jobs across our United Kingdom. Thank you. Over to you, Mr President. Speaking of the UK prime minister, here is Boris Johnson with his section of the virtual press conference. And he has confirmed this new Australian submarine deal will still take “decades”: I am delighted to join President Biden and prime minister Morrison to announce that the United Kingdom, Australia and the United States are creating a new trilateral defence partnership known as Aukus, with the aim of working hand in glove to preserve security and stability in the Indo-Pacific. We’re opening a new chapter in our friendship and the first task of this partnership will be to help Australia acquire a fleet of nuclear-powered submarines, emphasising, of course, that the submarines in question will be powered by nuclear reactors – not armed with nuclear weapons. And our work will be fully in line with our non-proliferation obligations. This will be one of the most complex and technically demanding projects in the world. Lasting for decades and requiring the most advanced technology. It will draw on the expertise that the UK has acquired over generations dating back to the launch of the Royal Navy’s first nuclear submarine over 60 years ago. And together, with the other opportunities from Aukus, creating hundreds of highly skilled jobs across the United Kingdom, including in Scotland, the north of England and the Midlands, taking forward this government’s driving purpose of levelling up across the whole country. The prime minister is making it abundantly clear that we are not trying to acquire nuclear weapons with this deal. Scott Morrison: But let me be clear – Australia is not seeking to establish nuclear weapons or establish a civil nuclear capability. And we will continue to meet all of our nuclear non-proliferation obligations. Australia has a long history of defence cooperation with the United States and the United Kingdom. For more than a century, we have stood together for the cause of freedom, motivated by the beliefs we share. Sustained by the bonds of friendship we have forged. Enabled by the sacrifice of those who have gone before us and inspired by our shared hope for those who will follow us. And so, today, friends, we recommit ourselves to this cause and a new Aukus vision. He then pauses awkwardly for a few seconds while we wait for the live stream to cut to the UK prime minister. Scott Morrison has announced the new trilateral defence group named Aukus, and Australia’s intention to acquire nuclear-powered submarines: So Aukus is born, a new trilateral relationship between Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States. Aukus – a partnership where our technology, our scientists, our industry, our defence forces, are all working together to deliver a safer and more secure region that ultimately benefits all. Aukus will also enhance our contribution to our growing network of partnerships in the Indo-Pacific region. Anzus, our friends, the Quad, Five Eyes countries and, of course, our dear Pacific family. The first major initiative of Aukus will be to deliver a nuclear-powered fleet for Australia. Over the next 18 months, we will work together to seek to determine the best way forward to achieve this. This will include an intense examination of what we need to do to exercise our nuclear stewardship responsibilities here in Australia. We intend to build these submarines in Adelaide, Australia, in close cooperation with the United Kingdom and the United States. Scott Morrison is up now and, although he isn’t saying it outright, it’s pretty clear this deal has a lot to do with China’s newfound influence in the Indo-Pacific area: Good morning from Australia. I am very pleased to join two great friends of freedom out of Australia. Prime minister Johnson and President Biden. Today we join our nations in the next-generation partnership, built on a strong foundation of proven trust. We have always seen the world through a similar lens. We have always believed in a world that favours freedom, that respects human dignity – the rule of law, the independence of sovereign states and the peaceful fellowship of nations. And while we’ve always looked to each other to do what we believe is right, we have never left each other. Always together – never alone. Our world is becoming more complex, especially here in our region – the Indo-Pacific. This affects us all. The future of the Indo-Pacific will impact all our futures. To meet these challenges, to help deliver the security and stability our region needs, we must now take our partnership to a new level. A partnership that seeks to engage – not to exclude. To contribute, not take. And to enable and empower – not to control or coerce. That announcement has started with a rather strange video with a disembodied woman’s voice heralding the the alliance between Australia, the UK and the US: United by vast oceans across three continents. Peace, and in times of need. Guided by the enduring ideals we share. Democracy, resilience, innovation, diversity. Our three nations commit to strengthening our global partnership to get to work for the freedom and safety of our people. For peace and stability of the Indo-Pacific, and for the good of the world. Good morning everyone, it’s Matilda Boseley here and let’s dive right in (literally) because there is some big submarine news breaking right now. Prime minister Scott Morrison is expected to appear with US president Joe Biden and UK prime minister Boris Johnson shortly to make a global security announcement that will likely lead to Australia massively upgrading its submarine fleet, and taking it into the elite nuclear class. The leaders are expected to speak at 7am AEST at a virtual event where it’s understood they will announce the establishment of a new international security alliance that, according to US news outlet Politico, will be known as Aukus – and will allow the three countries to share technology covering cyber security, artificial intelligence, underwater systems and long-range strike capabilities. Australia will reportedly get access to UK and US technology to build a new fleet of nuclear-powered submarines, which would make us only the seventh country in the world to field submarines propelled by nuclear reactors. This has also raised speculation we will ditch our $90bn submarine deal with France. (In 2016 the federal government tapped French shipbuilder Naval Group to build 12 new Attack-class submarines under a $90bn program, but this deal has been plagued by delays, cost blowouts and disputes.) So far, we know Australian federal cabinet ministers were summoned to a secret meeting in Canberra yesterday, and opposition leader Anthony Albanese was also briefed. Morrison is due to travel to Washington next week for a meeting of the Quad alliance of the US, India, Japan and Australia. We will bring you all the Covid-19 updates as they unfold today, but for now, we wait for Morrison and Biden to make their appearance."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/nov/02/summers-could-be-entirely-powered-by-clean-energy-by-2050","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-11-02T06:01:22Z","webTitle":"Summers could be entirely powered by clean energy by 2050","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/02/summers-could-be-entirely-powered-by-clean-energy-by-2050","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/nov/02/summers-could-be-entirely-powered-by-clean-energy-by-2050","fields":{"headline":"Summers could be entirely powered by clean energy by 2050","bodyText":"British summers could be entirely powered without fossil fuels by the middle of the century without breaking the economics of the energy market, according to a report. But while wind, solar and nuclear power would provide nearly 91% of the country’s electricity by then, up from about 50% today, gas power stations are still expected to be needed during winters. Analysts at Aurora Energy Research looked at how the wholesale power market would cope if the UK meets its target of slashing carbon emissions 80% by 2050. They found that the price of power would drop to nearly zero between April and October because of lower demand and the glut of electricity coming from solar panels and windfarms. But energy firms would still have a viable business model because the other half of the year prices would hit around £70 per megawatt hour, higher than today’s annual average of £50-60 per MWh. “Reaching a high renewables scenario can deliver Great Britain’s climate change targets without breaking the wholesale market,” said Weijie Mak, a co-author of the report. However, he said if the country adopted a tougher approach of reducing emissions to zero, as ministers recently asked experts to consider, that would break the market because prices would go too low for companies. The report paints a picture of a world where the appetite for electricity has increased by two-thirds on today’s demand, because of the rise of electric cars and switching from gas boilers to electric heating. But because of higher demand and lower solar output in winter, gas power plants would still be needed to fill in the gaps between November and February. Their owners would need an additional payment during winter for being ready to provide backup power when needed, to make the economics work. The explosive growth of renewables in the past eight years has already dampened power prices by about £4 per MWh. But Aurora said that effect could be as much as £40 per MWh by 2050. Whether that translates through to a cut in energy bills remains to be seen, said Richard Howard, head of research at Aurora. While the wholesale part of a bill would certainly fall, other components such as backup power payments, renewables subsidies and network costs could rise."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/dec/06/korean-energy-firm-kepco-rescue-moorside-nuclear-power-project","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-06T14:45:32Z","webTitle":"Korean energy firm rescues UK's Moorside nuclear power project","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/06/korean-energy-firm-kepco-rescue-moorside-nuclear-power-project","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/dec/06/korean-energy-firm-kepco-rescue-moorside-nuclear-power-project","fields":{"headline":"Korean energy firm rescues UK's Moorside nuclear power project","bodyText":"A state-owned South Korean energy firm is to take over construction of a troubled nuclear power station planned in north-west England, in a significant boost for the UK government’s nuclear ambitions. Kepco has been declared the preferred bidder for the NuGeneration consortium, which looked doomed earlier this year after the Japanese owner Toshiba was hit by writedowns and the eventual bankruptcy of its US nuclear subsidiary. The plan to build reactors at Moorside in Cumbria suffered a further blow when France’s Engie also pulled out and forced Toshiba to buy its $138.5m (£103.5m) stake. Kepco has emerged as the winner in a two-horse race between state-owned nuclear firms eyeing expansion overseas. The Korean group beat off competition from China General Nuclear (CGN), which has a £6bn stake in the reactors that France’s EDF is building at Hinkley Point and is working to build its own nuclear plant in Essex. Kepco and CGN are both looking to the UK after nuclear plant construction orders dried up globally in the wake of the 2011 Fukushima disaster. Greg Clark, the business secretary, met Korean government ministers recently to discuss the NuGen deal, with insiders describing the talks as productive. The government is understood to have given the Koreans assurances that the UK is committed to a fleet of new nuclear plants, a plan that has been criticised in the face of the falling cost of renewables. Sources said it was Kepco’s track record of building its reactors in the United Arab Emirates on time and on budget that helped it clinch the deal. Ministers, unions and the industry will cheer the outcome, which secures jobs and low-carbon power supplies that were at risk. But the new ownership and technology mean the plant will come online several years later than 2025, when electricity generation was originally due. Toshiba had cleared the painstaking, four- to five-year regulatory process of getting its reactor approved by UK authorities, a process Kepco will have to start from scratch. Kepco is understood to be planning to fit two of its APR-1400 reactors on the site, which would have a combined capacity of up to 3GW, similar to the 3.2GW for Hinkley Point C. As well as having to clear regulatory hurdles, the Koreans are also likely to have to negotiate with the government for a guaranteed price for power from the Moorside plant. That process took EDF several years for Hinkley and resulted in a contract that ensures the French will get £92.50 per megawatt hour, or around twice the wholesale price, for 35 years. The UK’s spending watchdog has called the project “risky and expensive”. The price of state support for offshore windfarms has since dropped to a record low of £62.14 per MWh on average, leading one top German energy firm to say nuclear can no longer compete on price. A source close to the NuGen project said they accepted that whatever price the Koreans secured with the government, it would have to be “significantly below” what was agreed for Hinkley. While the sale of NuGen from Toshiba to Kepco is not signed off yet, insiders described the selection of the South Korean company as a preferred bidder as a “major milestone” in the process. Minister are expected to use a nuclear conference on Thursday to announce a sector deal for the industry, as part of the government’s industrial strategy. The government is likely to say it will look into ways of reducing the costs of financing new-build nuclear projects and confirm funding for a new generation of mini nuclear power plants, known as small modular reactors. In return, the industry will promise to cut the costs of cleaning up old nuclear plants by a fifth and slash the costs of building new nuclear power stations by 20%-30% over a decade."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/live/2021/oct/26/uk-politics-live-public-sector-pay-rises-inflation","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2021-10-26T16:06:03Z","webTitle":"UK politics: Owen Paterson rejects report saying he broke lobbying rules – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2021/oct/26/uk-politics-live-public-sector-pay-rises-inflation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/live/2021/oct/26/uk-politics-live-public-sector-pay-rises-inflation","fields":{"headline":"UK politics: Owen Paterson rejects report saying he broke lobbying rules – as it happened","bodyText":"The Tory MP Owen Paterson faces a 30-day suspension from the House of Commons for an “egregious” breach of lobbying rules, raising the possibility he could lose his seat if enough constituents trigger a byelection. Paterson has strongly reject the Commons standards committee’s findings, and claimed the inquiry into the accusations against him contributed to his wife taking her life last year. (See 2.24pm.) Plans to take tougher action against water companies for pumping sewage into rivers and the sea will once again be opposed by the government, Downing Street has announced. Peers are debating the environment bill, and later today they are expected to debate a new amendment from the crossbencher, the Duke of Wellington, who tabled the original proposal to protect rivers from raw sewage that was controversially voted down by MPs. Wellington’s latest amendment says water companies should “take all reasonable steps to ensure untreated sewage is not discharged from storm overflows into inland &amp; coastal waters”. Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, has told MPs that he does not think Nato was militarily defeated in Afghanistan. Instead there was a failure of political resolve, he told the Commons defence committee. He said: I don’t think that we were defeated. Our resolve was found wanting, I would say, rather than defeated Nato were there to enable a political campaign and I think that is what failed. The military were there to put in place the security environment in order to try and deliver that. When that is withdrawn, that is when you find out whether your political campaign has worked. What was we discovered is it didn’t work. It was the western resolve and the western narrative or political foundations they had laid failed. There are a lot of searching questions there for all of us. That’s all from me for today. But our coronavirus coverage continues on our global live blog. These are from Nick Triggle, the BBC’s health correspondent, on the DHSC saying the asymptomatic testing of pupils will continue at least until January. (See 4.02pm.) The Climate Change Committee, an independent government advisory body, has published its assessment (pdf) of the government’s net zero strategy published last week. It describes it as “an ambitious and comprehensive strategy that marks a significant step forward for UK climate policy, setting a globally leading benchmark to take to Cop26”. But it says for the strategy to succeed some “key issues will need to be resolved quickly”, including delivery mechanisms in agriculture. In evidence to the Commons science committee this morning, Prof Lucy Chappell, chief scientific adviser to the Department of Health and Social Care, said the government wanted the testing of asymptomatic pupils in schools, as well as pupils with symptoms, to continue at least until January. Beyond that, people were considering how long asymptomatic testing should continue, she said. She told the committee: I would like to think that in five years’ time we won’t all be lateral flow testing. There’s a stretchable point between those five years clearly. Between now and January, it’s clear that we’ve committed to testing. We are then reconsidering where we go beyond January, beyond spring. Chappell was speaking after Prof Sir Andrew Pollard, head of the Oxford Vaccine Group, told the same committee that he thought there should be a move away from the testing of asymptomatic pupils. Giving evidence to the Commons environment committee, Graeme Dear, chair of the British Poultry Council, said there was likely to be a shortage of UK-produced turkeys at Christmas because of labour shortages. He said: We have been given access through the seasonal workers scheme for up to 5,500 but that finishes on December 31. We would have loved to have known about that in June, and therefore could have placed enough turkeys for a full Christmas. We will do our utmost to make sure that Christmas is as normal as it can be, but there is a likelihood that there will be a shortage – had we known back in June or July that would have been fixed. Around 90% of our shortages are in the processing plants, and the irony is that we may find ourselves having to import turkey from France and Poland for a British Christmas, probably with some of the very workers we trained and left to go back to their homelands. Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, has announced details of government plans to change the way nuclear power stations are financed. Following a recommendation from the National Audit Office, the government will replace the existing Contracts for Difference funding mechanism with the Regulated Asset Base model. The RAB model, also used to fund projects like the Thames Tideway tunnel and Heathrow Terminal 5, means investors start receiving returns more quickly. But Kwarteng also claims it could save consumers £30bn for every new large-scale power station. The amount of farm produce being wasted because there are not enough workers available to harvest it is “completely inexcusable”, MPs have been told. Tom Bradshaw, vice-president of the National Farmers’ Union, told the Commons environment committee that almost a quarter of this year’s daffodil crop was wasted as it could not be picked. He went on: The food waste we are seeing at a farm level, whether courgettes, apples going unpicked, autumn raspberries not being picked at the moment and tragic culls going on in the pig sector, is completely inexcusable. It is within the gift of this government to put solutions in place which will mean that this doesn’t happen next year, but that needs to happen urgently because the lack of confidence we’ve got across multiple sectors means investment plans are put on hold and many are mothballing facilities. We have glasshouses that should be growing tomatoes which are currently being mothballed because they don’t know if they will have the labour to pick them while energy costs are also spiralling and having an impact. Farmers were heavily reliant on seasonal workers from the EU before Brexit, and the UK’s departure from the EU has created a labour shortage, which has also been exacerbated by Covid. Sturgeon ended her statement by explaining the Covid arrangements for Cop26, which starts in Glasgow at the weekend. She said, as far as possible, steps have been taken to ensure delegates are vaccinated. People arriving from outside Britain and Ireland will have to show a negative test result, she said, and people arriving from red list countries will have to quarantine. She said people entering core Cop26 venues would have to do a lateral flow test every day, wear masks, and follow one-metre social distancing. And delegates would have to follow Scotland’s Covid rules in public spaces and on public transport, she said. Sturgeon says from 4am on Sunday people arriving in Scotland from abroad will have to take a lateral flow test, rather than a more expensive PCR test, on day two after their arrival. This will bring the Scottish rules into line with England’s. But if the lateral flow test is positive, people will need to have it confirmed with a PCR test. Sturgeon says the NHS is deliving the biggest ever winter vaccination programme. Covid boosters and flu vaccinations are being co-administered wherever possible, she says. She says that means some people might be getting their flu vaccine a bit later than usual. Sturgeon says today marks the latest point for a three-week review of regulations. But the cabinet decided this morning that no changes were needed, she says. She says the decline in cases has levelled off. In recent days there has been a slight increase. But Scotland currently has the lowest Covid rate of the four UK nations, she says. She says the NHS remains under significant pressure. There has been a slight change in the age distribution of people going to hospital, she says. More of them are older patients. She says a further £482m is being allocated to the NHS. This includes £120m for the test and protect programme, and £130m for the vaccination programme. Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, is giving a statement to Scottish parliament about Covid. She says there will be no immediate changes to the rules in force. She starts with the latest figures. There have been 2,262 new cases, she says, with 11.5% of tests being positive. She says there are 917 Covid patients in hospital – 15 more than yesterday. And there have been 20 further deaths. David Davis, the Conservative former Brexit secretary, has said he does not believe Owen Paterson received a fair hearing from the parliamentary investigation into the lobby accusations against him. In an interview with the BBC’s World at One Owen Paterson strongly rejected the findings of the Commons standards committee report saying he had broken parliamentary lobbying rules. (See 9.35am). He also claimed the manner in which the investigation against him was conducted contributed to his wife, Rose, taking her life last year. He told the programme: [There is] absolutely no doubt whatever in my mind that the manner in which this inquiry was conducted led to the extreme anguish which caused Rose to hang herself. I wasn’t spoken to for 17 months and during that time a number of letters were sent ... Paterson said he thought he had answered the initial allegations, but then subsquently, twice more, he received further letters, extending the accusations “way beyond” the original ones. He went on: And I remember very clearly the last weekend before Rose hanged herself, [her] really going to me in the kitchen, saying: ‘Don’t you realise,this inquiry is going to go on and on and on, until [the parliamentary commissioner for standards] finds some spurious reasons for finding you guilty. She is determined to catch you out. And then you’ll have to resign and I’ll have to resign and we’ll end our days in humiliation and disgrace.’ There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that the manner in which this inquiry has been conducted, in complete breach of the rules of natural justice, was a major factor in my wife’s decision to hang herself in June last year. Paterson said that, although the Commons rules ban lobbying on behalf of a paying client, there is an exception if an MP needs to raise a “serious wrong” with the authorities. He said this was the case for him because Randox, one of the companies he was working for, found 15% of random milk samples from supermarkets contained a carcinogenic antibiotic. Paterson has set out his objections to the report in full in a statement on his website. (The committee said that, although this exception covered one of the lobbying interventions by Paterson, it did not cover the others.) Prof Sir Andrew Pollard, head of the Oxford Vaccine Group that developed the AstraZeneca vaccine, told MPs this morning that some of the charts showing Covid cases in the UK to be far higher than in other European countries were misleading. In evidence to the Commons science committee, he said the figures partly reflected the fact that the UK is doing a lot more testing. He explained: If you look across western Europe, we have about 10 times more tests done each day than some other countries, this is per head of population. So we really have to always adjust by looking at the data ... we do have a lot of transmission at the moment, but it’s not right to say that those rates are really telling us something that we can compare internationally ... If you make the adjustment of cases in relation to the rates of testing, and look at test positivity, currently Germany has the highest test positivity rate in Europe. So I think when we look at these data it’s really important not to sort of bash the UK with a very high case rate, because actually it’s partly related to very high testing. I’m not trying to deny that there’s not plenty of transmission, because there is, but it’s the comparisons that are problematic. At the Downing Street lobby briefing the prime minister’s spokesperson also played down claims that its plan B for Covid could cost the economy up to £18bn. The figure comes from a leaked government assessment. (See 10.09am.) But the analysis was based on the premise of plan B being in force for five months, and the spokesperson said this was not government policy and “not something we’re planning to”. He went on: If it were to become the case, the plan B measures would allow venues to remain open and remain trading. We are confident the plan B measures taken as a package will help curb Covid cases while also striking that important balance of allowing parts of the economy to remain open that will otherwise face severe restrictions or even closure. In the Commons a few minutes ago, during the UQ on pre-budget announcements, Sir Desmond Swayne, a lockdown-sceptic Tory, asked why this plan B assessment had not been made public. Simon Clarke, the chief secretary to the Treasury, prompted loud laughter when he replied saying he could not talk about leaks. Yesterday the UK recorded 36,567 new coronavirus cases. As the government’s dashboard shows, the total number of cases in the week up to yesterday was just 2.2% up on the previous week. But the seven-day average figures on the “cases by date reported” graph, which only go up to Thursday, show cases falling. At the Downing Street lobby briefing the prime minister’s spokesman said it was too early to conclude that cases were plateauing. He said: It’s always encouraging when you see reductions like that and including, I believe, a levelling off of admissions. But it’s too early to draw full conclusions from the case rates and we would continue to urge the public to abide by the guidance as set out and those eligible to get booster doses. UPDATE: The figure for new cases on the UK’s dashboard yesterday did not include data from Wales. In the Commons Bridget Phillipson, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, is asking the Labour urgent question about budget measures that have been pre-announced. Before she started Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker, made a statement restating his opposition to the government briefing budget measures to the media in advance of the actual statement. He said he made this clear yesterday. But that did not stop the Treasury briefing out further budget announcements (the end of the public sector pay freeze), he said. He went on: If the government continues to treat this house in the discourteous manner, I will do everything in my power to ensure ministers are called here at the earliest opportunity to explain themselves ... This house will not be taken for granted. It is not right for everybody to be briefed. It is not more important to go on the news in the morning. It is more important to come here. As Speaker, Hoyle has the power to grant urgent questions every day, which require a minister to come to the Commons to respond. Simon Clarke, the chief secretary to the Treasury, is responding to the UQ. In his opening remarks he said that it was important for the government to explain its policies to the public and that most budget announcements, including the market sensitive ones, were not being unveiled until tomorrow. The UK government is facing fresh calls for funding to help secure Wales’s coal tips and avoid future disasters, PA Media reports. PA says: Mark Drakeford, the Welsh first minister, wants Boris Johnson to commit to long-term investment in coal tip safety which would “help communities who have already given so much”. It comes as a survey shows where the higher-risk tips are located, including 71 now revealed to be in the worst category. Wales has 2,456 identified tips, of which 327 are classified as higher risk, and these have been broken down into local authority area. It is estimated the cost of dealing with the disused coal tips over the next 15 years will be between £500m and £600m. Drakeford said: “These sites pre-date devolution. Our funding settlement does not recognise the substantial, long-term costs of remediating and repairing these sites. Tomorrow’s spending review is an opportunity for the UK government to use its financial powers to help communities who’ve given so much to Wales and the United Kingdom during the coal-mining years.” Teaching unions have welcomed the chancellor’s plans to end the public sector pay freeze, but say it is too little too late. The NASUWT teachers’ union claimed that teachers had already suffered 17% erosion to their pay over the last decade, while the NAHT school leaders’ union expressed concern about how a pay rise might be funded, warning that if schools were asked to foot the additional salary bill from existing budgets headteachers would be forced to make “heart-breaking decisions”. And Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, asked the government to honour its promise to raise teachers’ starting salaries to £30,000, a move which has also been delayed. “Over the past decade teacher pay has fallen in real terms, and this government has failed utterly to stem the tide of recently qualified teachers leaving the profession in their first five years, an exodus which can only serve to damage the education system,” he said. Labour has tabled an urgent question in the Commons on “all the provisions in the upcoming budget that have been made public in advance of the chancellor’s statement”. It will be heard at 12.30pm. In his LBC interview Paul Scully, who as well as being business minister is also minister for London, also criticised Sadiq Khan, the capital’s mayor, over his introduction of the ultra-low emission zone (Ulez). A massive expansion of the Ulez, which is intended to price the most pollutiing vehicles off the road, came into force on Monday. But when it was put to Scully that the Labour mayor should have delayed the Ulez expansion, because of the impact of the pandemic, the minister agreed. Scully, who represents Sutton and Cheam in south London, said: [Khan] should’ve delayed it. The mayor of London should have looked at the effect that it’s going to have on disabled people, for example, because the exemptions don’t cover all disabled people. He should be putting more money into a scrappage scheme because you need to give people alternatives. You can’t just suddenly bring a charge in when there’s no realistic alternative for a number of people. There are two reports out this morning suggesting that ministers are reluctant to implement their Covid plan B because they are worried about the impact on the economy. Plan B is set out in the winter Covid plan (pdf) published in September and it comprises four elements: warning the public of the increased risk (something which the government is arguably already doing); mandating vaccine passports for some settings; mandating face coverings in some settings; and possibly asking people to work from home. In his London Playbook briefing for Politico, Alex Wickham says leaked government papers say plan B could cost the economy up to £18bn. Wickham writes: An internal Treasury impact assessment seen by Playbook warned that moving to plan B would cost the economy between £11bn and £18bn in the period up until March 2022 — or more than £800m per week. The document warns the main hit will be on businesses as millions of people go back to working from home. WFH is envisaged to have a moderately positive impact on reducing transmission. And in the Daily Telegraph Ben Riley-Smith says an internal assessment by the culture department suggests vaccine passports would be costly and counterproductive. Riley-Smith reports: Vaccine passports could fuel the spread of Covid-19 by encouraging people to go to poorly ventilated pubs instead of large venues, the government’s own impact assessment has warned. The policy would also slash turnover for the organisers of events required to use vaccine passports, and necessitate the hiring of thousands of new stewards which may be hard to deliver, it was concluded. In an interview with LBC this morning Paul Scully, the business minister, was asked about the Playbook leak. He said he had only just been told about it, but he did suggest a move to plan B might stifle the recovery. Asked about plan B, he said: We don’t want to be stifling the recovery, so no sense that there’s anything at the moment that’s suggesting plan B is needed .... Although case numbers have gone up, hospitalisations haven’t gone up in the same proportion, so there is still a suggestion there that we weaken the link through the excellent vaccination programme and the booster programme. Owen Paterson, who served as Northern Ireland secretary and environment secretary when David Cameron was PM, repeatedly used his position as an MP to help two companies that were paying him, a report from the Commons standards committee says. The committee has described this as “an egregious case of paid advocacy” and recommended that Paterson should be suspended from the Commons for 30 days. Its recommendation is almost certain to be adopted by the Commons as a whole. The committee accepted that Paterson did not think he was doing anything wrong and that he thought his lobbying on behalf of the two companies he was working for - Randox, a clinical diagnostics company, and Lynn’s Country Foods, a processor and distributor of meat products - was in the public interest. But the report says he was still breaking Commons rules, which say MPs must not lobby on behalf of a paying client. Here are extracts from the report’s conclusion. Mr Paterson has an evident passion for dairy and farming matters, based on his undoubted expertise. We do not doubt that he sincerely believes that he has acted properly. Mr Paterson is clearly convinced in his own mind that there could be no conflict between his private interest and the public interest in his actions in this case. But it is this same conviction that meant that Mr Paterson failed to establish the proper boundaries between his private commercial work and his parliamentary activities, as set out in the guide to the gules. Mr Paterson told us multiple times in oral evidence before us that he was elected for his judgment, and that he judged that he was right to make the approaches he did. But no matter how far a member considers that the private interest of a paying client coincides with the public interest, the lobbying rules rightly prohibit members from initiating approaches or proceedings which could benefit that client. If such approaches were routinely permitted, the lobbying rules would be of little value. In failing to see the evident conflict of interest between his commercial work and his actions in this case, Mr Paterson has in turn convinced himself that he is the victim of an injustice in being investigated by the commissioner. That does not exculpate him. Being able to judge the difference between one’s private, personal interest and the public interest is at the very heart of public service and a senior member of the house with many years standing should be able to make that distinction more clearly ... This is an egregious case of paid advocacy. Previous instances have led to suspensions of 18 days, 30 days and six months. Each of Mr Paterson’s several instances of paid advocacy would merit a suspension of several days, but the fact that he has repeatedly failed to perceive his conflict of interest and used his privileged position as a member of parliament to secure benefits for two companies for whom he was a paid consultant, is even more concerning. He has brought the House into disrepute. We therefore recommend that Mr Paterson be suspended from the service of the House for 30 sitting days. Good morning. Tomorrow Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, will announce his combined budget and spending review, but the torrent of pre-announcements continues, and overnight the Treasury has said that Sunak will end the public sector pay freeze. Here is our overnight story by my colleagues Jessica Elgot and Rowena Mason. As the report explains, details are sketchy at this point. Sunak is not announcing pay awards for public sector workers – those will only come after the independent pay review bodies have made their recommendations, in the usual way – and ending the pay freeze for public sector workers (or some public sector workers – there were exemptions for the low paid, and for NHS staff) is not the same as awarding a real-terms increase (that would overshoot inflation). This was confirmed by Paul Scully, the business minister on Millbank duty for the government, who in interview this morning refused to commit to public sector workers getting a pay rise above inflation. Asked if the pay increases next year would be higher than inflation, he replied: That will be determined by the pay review bodies. The chancellor is keen to give people a rise. They will then take that into account as they look to what should be an appropriate rise for the public sector, given the public finances. I can’t pre-empt what they are going to do. We will see where we are come next April when the review bodies have reported. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Academics and officials from the Department of Health and Social Care give evidence to the Commons science committee about the UK’s ability to deal with global disease outbreaks. 9.30am: Prof David Cunningham, chair of the Association of Cancer Physicians, and other experts give evidence to the Commons health committee about cancer services. 11.30am: Downing Street holds its lobby briefing. 11.30am: Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, takes questions in the Commons. 2.30pm: Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, gives evidence to the Commons defence committee on the withdrawal from Afghanistan. 2.30pm: The NFU and other farming and food industry trade bodies give evidence to the Commons environment committee about labour shortages. 2.30pm: Lord Frost, the Brexit minister, gives evidence to the Lords European affairs committee. Afternoon: Peers debate Commons amendments to the environment bill, including the vote overturning a Lords bid to protect rivers from sewage. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include “Andrew” in it somewhere and I’m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can’t promise to do this for everyone.

No, wait, perhaps there is","bodyText":"Fair warning before we kick off this weekend. Increasingly, I’m reaching that stage of my professional life where I can be heard muttering, and sometimes shouting, I’m too bloody old for this. My long-suffering colleagues in the Canberra bureau of Guardian Australia have absorbed bouts of muttering and shouting over the past few weeks as various Nationals and some Liberals have lined up post-election to support a new inquiry into nuclear energy, as if this might be a light bulb moment. Just for the record, “I know, let’s look at nuclear” isn’t a new thought. Way back in the mists of time, when John Howard was the prime minister, and the same corporate and security interests that have been pushing governments to establish a nuclear industry in Australia for decades prevailed upon him to open the door, we had a nuclear inquiry. It was led by Ziggy Switkowski, the urbane former managing director of Telstra, and a well regarded nuclear physicist. The Switkowski inquiry was a really fascinating process, which I followed avidly. (I have no intention of apologising for that. Most of you already know that I am, and will always be, That Nerd.) I followed it with an open mind, because at the time it was being considered, nuclear energy was a technology worth countenancing for a couple of reasons. Renewables were yet to hit the point where firming was a viable thing, and nuclear power plants don’t produce carbon emissions. The climate science tells us emissions need to come down, and quickly, if we are to have any chance of avoiding the worst-case scenarios. Nuclear energy has several downsides, which we’ll certainly come to, but not producing carbon pollution is an upside. Apart from the abatement imperative, there was also a broader economic rationale for Australia looking at a nuclear industry. I’ll hand the microphone to John Howard now, because he laid out the main arguments more than a decade ago. “I’ve always maintained that holding the reserves of uranium that we do, it is foolish to see ourselves as simply an exporter of uranium,” Howard said when he set up the Switkowski process. “I think we should also look at the value-added process, which is principally enrichment, and we should also look at whether a nuclear power station in Australia would become economically feasible”. Having set up the valid reasons to look, here are the downsides. Anybody watching Chernobyl at present on their favoured streaming service doesn’t really need me to spell the worst scenario out. I’ll assume the risk of catastrophe is already well understood by most people. Inching back from the catastrophic to just plain difficult, there is also the problem of the radioactive waste nuclear generates, waste that has to be stored securely for thousands of years. Previous deliberative processes suggest Australians aren’t that keen on nuclear waste despite us having lots of open geologically stable territory to store it well away from human habitation. If you don’t believe me, ask Jay Weatherill. One more thing. If we are talking about the benefits associated with emissions reduction, we also need to factor in the energy-intensive processes associated with mining and processing uranium, and well as the carbon-intensive business of building power plants, although nuclear technologies, like all energy technologies, are evolving. So, to cut a long story short, nuclear is like most energy technologies. There are benefits and costs. Whether the technologies are deployed or not is an on-balance judgment for policymakers, and we the voters get to hold them accountable. When Switkowski was asked by Howard to weigh the evidence and report back, he concluded that Australia could establish a nuclear industry, and nuclear power plants could make a useful contribution to the country’s abatement task, but he said setting them up would take between 10 and 15 years. There was another clear finding. If nuclear power was to be economical compared with the alternatives, the government would need to implement a carbon price. Yes, that’s right, a price on pollution. It was that particular epiphany that led Howard to embrace emissions trading in the run-up to the 2007 election: the preceding Switkowski process, and the political pressure from Kevin Rudd declaring climate change the great moral challenge of our generation. Obviously that Switkowski advice is now more than a decade old, and things may have changed given there has been a revolution in the economics of energy. But the Australian Nuclear Association, a lobby group that advocates for nuclear science and technology, says the finding remains broadly current. It says nuclear power can provide cheap, reliable, carbon-free energy in Australia, but it would be cost-competitive with gas and coal generation only if pollution was priced. So now that we’ve put this picture together, what does it tell us? It tells us that members of the Coalition want to open the door to nuclear energy, which isn’t actually economical unless the Coalition implements the carbon price it has spent the entire post-Howard era resisting. You all remember that resistance, right? Malcolm Turnbull being thrown out of the Liberal leadership twice. Tony Abbott repealing the carbon price after the 2013 election. The resources minister Matt Canavan five minutes ago having a public swing at resources companies that advocate carbon pricing – they were thought criminals, one and all. All pretty strange. Perhaps “I know, let’s look at nuclear” reflects the fact that when it comes to climate and energy, the Coalition has now lost the ability to think in consecutive sentences. Perhaps when you’ve spent 10 years punching yourself and the country repeatedly in the head, eventually you succumb to disorientation. Perhaps this is just more time wasting. Perhaps there are some in the government who think pesky fine print, such as the need for a carbon price, can be bypassed by Scott Morrison building a nuclear power plant with his bare hands and several billions of taxpayer dollars. (How good is it?) Don’t laugh. This is entirely possible, given there are some in the show who think governments should build coal plants. The self-build approach would bypass the need to ruminate on whether the economics of a particular proposal stack up. George Christensen also strikes me as a bloke handy with a power drill and a nail gun. There’s one more perhaps – a happier perhaps in three parts. Perhaps this is the Coalition’s plan to execute a pivot on carbon pricing, just as Howard did in 2007. Perhaps an examination of nuclear energy will be the catalyst for the Coalition of 2019 to reconnect itself with the position it adopted in 2007 for entirely sensible reasons. Perhaps we should all cross our fingers on that one and not waste time fretting about the decade that has already been lost, or worry that the Coalition could stumble back to carbon pricing just at the moment Labor has chosen to abandon it. In any case, I’ll be watching with interest. • Katharine Murphy is Guardian Australia’s political editor"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2020/may/12/midnight-your-time-donmar-warehouse-diana-quick","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2020-05-12T13:12:47Z","webTitle":"Midnight Your Time: Diana Quick on motherhood and her 'empty nest' drama","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/may/12/midnight-your-time-donmar-warehouse-diana-quick","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2020/may/12/midnight-your-time-donmar-warehouse-diana-quick","fields":{"headline":"Midnight Your Time: Diana Quick on motherhood and her 'empty nest' drama","bodyText":"In early March, Diana Quick tripped on the strap of a bag and broke her kneecap. She was alone in north London and decided she’d be better off hunkering down in her countryside home after hearing murmurs of the Covid-19 lockdown. So later that month, “a friend drove me to Suffolk and left me here”. It means her lockdown began early but it has got easier. Her knee is on the mend, she has planted vegetables in the garden and she has been joined in Suffolk by her daughter, Mary Nighy, and her family. (Mary’s father is Bill Nighy, Quick’s former long-term partner.) “I feel privileged,” she says. “I have a large garden with the family and the dog around me. I have some friends who are on their own. I spoke to one and he said, ‘What I really want is a cuddle.’” It has been a surprisingly productive period, despite the knee brace and crutches. Quick plays the lead in a drama, streamed by the Donmar Warehouse this week, that chimes with our state of isolation. Midnight Your Time is a one-woman play by Adam Brace, about a retired lawyer who is at home and having a remote, one-way conversation with her daughter, in Palestine, through video messages. Quick first performed the role in 2011, directed by Michael Longhurst, now the artistic director of the Donmar. This time they have worked together remotely, with Quick using a webcam. The role has resonated with her: “As a mother, I relate in ways, having been through the empty-nest experience and also around saying, ‘Sorry, I’m in the wrong’ as a mother.” There are things to be learned from lockdown, she thinks, particularly when it comes to the climate. Quick has backed the Green Party (she endorsed Caroline Lucas’s parliamentary candidacy in the 2015 election) and thinks this period could, at best, inspire a long-term re-evaluation of the way we run the planet, as well as our own lives. She has been campaigning against proposed plans for a new nuclear power station at Sizewell, on the Suffolk coast. Quick comments on how the lockdown has enabled some people to slow down and appreciate nature. “And people who have been rushing around too much have maybe found that they can manage with a lot less than they thought they needed – or that they need different things.” Quick’s work as an actor has ranged far beyond her best-known role as Lady Julia Flyte, in the 1981 TV adaptation of Brideshead Revisited. Now 72, she was working on a new sci-fi Netflix show, The White Horse, when the pandemic brought a stop to filming, and was also adapting a Wilkie Collins novel, Jezebel’s Daughter. “It’s a rip-roaring tale with a very strong woman at its centre. It deals with care and madness and not locking people up but having them in society.” Her career started early – she was heavily involved in youth theatre by the age of 17 and became the first female president of the Oxford University Dramatic Society. Youth theatre gave her a head start, she says, and she performed alongside Terry Jones, Michael Palin and Annabel Leventon at Oxford. Motherhood came at the age of 37. “I was the main breadwinner when Mary was little. If work involved going away, only one of us [Quick or Bill Nighy] would go. Of course, this meant turning down some jobs, although Mary would probably say I was absent a lot. I had that usual thing of getting up early and going to bed late so that you’re frazzled.” Her generation of men, she adds, were not invested in doing the housework. “We had to ask. The effect for me was that I became ingenious at finding paid work so that I could then pay people to do the things that I didn’t have time do to.” She now has a grandchild, with another on the way. Being a grandmother is great, she says, “but not something I was longing for. I’ve been very happy being a mother, enjoying my daughter’s life as a grownup. When she told me she was pregnant for the first time, I thought I was too young to be a grandmother, although I wasn’t really.” Mary is also an actor and film-maker now, although Quick and Bill Nighy advised her not to follow in their footsteps. “We both said, ‘Only do it if you can’t not do it’ and ‘Don’t think it’ll be an easy ride.’” But Mary is, she says, “very gifted” and things worked out. “She’s doing amazingly well. She’s had a really good year of work and is back to having a baby again, but I also see that it’s a constant juggle.” Have things got easier for women in her industry? Quick has always been engaged with feminism and feels that the gains of second-wave feminism have led to improvements in the workplace, but there is still the Sisyphean struggle to fit motherhood into a career. “Female directors were a rarity when I started out and things have improved a lot, but many of the final choices are still being [made] by male executives. And there is still the same old problem of work-life balance when children come along. It continues to be a battle.” Midnight Your Time is on the Donmar Warehouse’s YouTube channel on 13 May at 7.30pm and then available for a week."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2020/jul/01/china-is-breaking-hong-kong-treaty-with-uk-says-boris-johnson","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2020-07-01T13:32:20Z","webTitle":"China is breaking Hong Kong treaty with UK, says Boris Johnson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jul/01/china-is-breaking-hong-kong-treaty-with-uk-says-boris-johnson","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2020/jul/01/china-is-breaking-hong-kong-treaty-with-uk-says-boris-johnson","fields":{"headline":"China is breaking Hong Kong treaty with UK, says Boris Johnson","bodyText":"Boris Johnson denounced China’s imposition of a security law on Hong Kong as a “clear and serious” violation of its treaty with Britain, vowing to introduce a bespoke five-year visa for as many as 2.9 million Hong Kong citizens with British national (overseas) status. Speaking at prime minister’s questions on Wednesday he said the law introduced by the Chinese government constituted a clear and serious breach of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, signed in 1984 and aimed at smoothing the transition when the territory was handed back to China in 1997. The UK believes Beijing’s move violates Hong Kong’s autonomy and is in direct conflict with the territory’s Basic Law, its mini-constitution. The law also threatens the freedoms and rights protected by the joint declaration. The prime minister said: “We have made clear that if China continued down this path we would introduce a new route to those with British national (overseas) status to enter the UK granting them limited leave to remain with the ability to live and work in the UK and thereafter to apply for citizenship, and that is precisely what we will do now.” The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, promised the UK would honour its commitment to the people of Hong Kong. “We will grant BN(O)s five years’ limited leave to remain, with the right to work or study. After these five years, they will be able to apply for settled status. “After further 12 months with settled status, they will be able to apply for citizenship.  This is a special, bespoke, set of arrangements developed for the unique circumstances we face,” Raab told MPs.  He added: “All those with BN(O) status will be eligible, as will their family dependants who are usually resident in Hong Kong. The Home Office will put in place a simple, streamlined, application process. There will be no quota on numbers.” Describing the Chinese moves as “a grave and deeply disturbing step”, he warned that China would erode trust “in its willingness to keep its word and live up to its promises”. But Raab set out no specific plans to sanction China either collectively or by punishing individual officials through new legislation due to be introduced by the Foreign Office this month after considerable delay. He said the legislation would be published before the recess and it would include the first designations, but did not specify if Chinese officials would be included. Raab instead pointed to a resolution passed by the UN Human Rights Council supported by 27 other countries condemning China, saying it was a foretaste of the alliance he was seeking to build. He said he was hopeful that other countries in south-east Asia would also offer asylum to Hong Kong citizens wanting to leave. The shadow foreign secretary, Lisa Nandy, welcomed the citizenship offer but pressed Raab to urge UK businesses in Hong Kong such as Standard Chartered not to be complicit in the repression. She also urged the government to ensure that the BN(O) offer did not become available only to the wealthy. BN(O) status is only available to those born before 1997, omitting many younger protesters. Nandy also called for an inquiry into the role of the Chinese mobile phone technology firm Huawei in the UK’s 5G network and in nuclear power. She said she feared the Treasury still regarded Chinese investment as “a central plank of the UK recovery and the government approach remains deeply confused”. Raab said it was a sobering day for Hong Kong, and pointed to signs that protesters were being arrested or threatened with arrest under the new legislation. He then detailed his analysis of how the legislation breached both the Basic Law and the joint declaration. He pointed out: “The imposition of this legislation by the government in Beijing, rather than it being left to Hong Kong’s own institutions, was in direct conflict with article 23 of China’s own Basic Law for Hong Kong … which affirms that Hong Kong should bring forward national security legislation on its own.” The Basic Law, he said, “only allows Beijing to directly impose laws in a very limited number of cases, such as for the purposes of defence and foreign affairs, or in exceptional circumstances in which the National People’s Congress declares a state of war or a state of emergency”. “None of those exceptions apply here.  Nor has the National People’s Congress sought to justify this law on any such basis.” He added that the legislation “contains a slew of measures that directly threaten the freedoms and rights protected by the joint declaration”, including the “potentially wide-ranging ability of the mainland authorities to take jurisdiction over certain cases, without any independent oversight, and to try those cases in the Chinese courts”. Raab said the measures “represent a flagrant assault on freedom of speech and freedom of assembly”. He highlighted extraterritorial clauses in the law that implied words spoken in the UK might be cause for arrest in Hong Kong. The laws gave Hong Kong’s chief executive, rather than the chief justice, the power to appoint judges to hear national security cases – “a move that clearly risks undermining the independence of Hong Kong’s judiciary”. He also condemned the establishment of a new Office for Safeguarding National Security in Hong Kong run by the mainland authorities. The office has wide-ranging powers directly intruding on the responsibility of the Hong Kong authorities to maintain public order. He said “China has broken its promise to the people of Hong Kong under its own laws.  China has breached its international obligations to the United Kingdom under the joint declaration. ”  Taking a restrained tone that may frustrate some backbenchers, he stressed: “We want a positive relationship with China. We recognise its growth, its stature and the powerful role it can play.”  He added: “It is precisely because we respect China as a leading member of the international community that we expect the Chinese government to meet its international obligations, and live up to its international responsibilities.” Hong Kong’s autonomy was guaranteed under the “one country, two systems” agreement enshrined in the 1984 joint declaration signed by the then Chinese premier, Zhao Ziyang, and British prime minister, Margaret Thatcher. The Foreign Office said: “There are 349,881 holders of BN(O) passports and the government estimates there are around 2.9m BN(O)s currently in Hong Kong. The scheme is for eligible BN(O) status holders and their immediate family dependants.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/apr/14/a-day-in-the-life-of-almost-every-vending-machine-in-the-world","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-14T05:00:06Z","webTitle":"A day in the life of (almost) every vending machine in the world","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/14/a-day-in-the-life-of-almost-every-vending-machine-in-the-world","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/apr/14/a-day-in-the-life-of-almost-every-vending-machine-in-the-world","fields":{"headline":"A day in the life of (almost) every vending machine in the world","bodyText":"A minute before midnight on 21 July 2021, as passengers staggered sleepily through Manchester airport, I stood wringing my hands in the glow of a vending machine that was seven feet tall, conspicuously branded with the name of its owner – BRODERICK – and positioned like a clever trap between arrivals and the taxi rank. Standard agonies. Sweet or savoury? Liquid or something to munch? I opted for Doritos, keying in a three-digit code and touching my card to the reader so that the packet moved jerkily forwards, propelled by a churning plastic spiral and tipped into the well of the machine. My Doritos landed with a thwap, a sound that always brings relief to the vending enthusiast, because there hasn’t been a mechanical miscue. Judged by the clock, which now read 12am, it was the UK’s first vending-machine sale of the day. Nine hours later, I was sitting in a spruce office in the Manchester suburb of Wythenshawe, drinking coffee with John “Johnny Brod” Broderick, the man who owned and operated that handsome airport machine. I’d had an idea to try to capture 24 hours in the life of vending machines. These weird, conspicuous objects! With their backs against the wall of everyday existence, they tempt out such a peculiar range of emotions, from relief to frustration, condescension to childish glee. For decades I’d been a steady and unquestioning patron. I figured that by spending some time in the closer company of the machines and their keepers, by immersing myself in their history, by looking to their future, I might get to the bottom of their enduring appeal. What made entrepreneurs from the Victorian age onwards want to hawk their goods in this way? What made generations of us buy? Johnny Brod seemed a good first person to ask. Freckle-tanned, portly and quick to laugh, Broderick has a playful exterior that conceals the fiery heart of a vending fundamentalist. He is a man so invested in the roboticised transmission of snacks that, come Halloween, Johnny Brod has been known to park a machine full of sweets in his driveway, letting any costumed local kids issue their demand for treats via prodded forefinger. With his brother Peter and his father, John Sr, he runs the vending empire Broderick’s Ltd, its 2,800 machines occupying some of the most sought-after corridors and crannies of the UK. The Broderick family sugar and sustain office workers, factory workers, students, gym goers, shoppers and schoolchildren. They pep up breaktimes in a nuclear power station. If you’ve ever wolfed a postpartum Snickers in the maternity ward at Chesterfield or Leeds General, or turned thirsty while waiting to fly out of Stansted or Birmingham airports, then you’ve almost certainly shopped, at one mechanical remove, with Johnny Brod. He thanks you. The coffee we drank that morning had trickled into cardboard cups from one of his own hot-beverage makers. Business had been hurt badly by Covid, he said. There had been one wretched day in the spring of 2020 when he awoke to find himself not the owner of the second-largest fleet of vending machines in the UK, but instead, of “timebombs. All these machines of ours in places we couldn’t access. All full of perishable food.” After enduring months of closed workplaces, abandoned airports and dead campuses, the Brodericks had lost millions on foregone Twirls and Mini Cheddars. Even so, Johnny Brod was bullish, insisting that the pandemic presented him with opportunities, too. As he led me on a tour of his Wythenshawe headquarters, I told him about my early hours purchase from a Broderick machine at the airport. Talk about a smooth transaction, I said. No snagging! I imagined he would be pleased to hear this, but he twitched his head in frustration, as if at a grave breach of etiquette. Vending people hated it, he explained to me, this unexamined expectation of mechanical failure. Modern machines contained many failsafes against botched vends. Despite this, the one time that Johnny Brod could remember his beloved industry trending on Twitter, a cruel joke had done the rounds. “About change being inevitable. Except from a vending machine.” Every one of his machines, he countered, was fitted with a contactless card reader. Since Covid, people didn’t want to touch anything they didn’t have to. Big change was sweeping through automated vending, and the first thing to go was small change. As cash sales tumbled in 2020 and 2021, and contactless sales climbed, the Brodericks had been the beneficiary of new and better information about their customers. Pre-Covid, not only did they have to go and fetch someone’s coppery quid, then count it – they didn’t even know whose quid it was. Now the tycoons of vending understood us better. Johnny Brod had released a smartphone app that tempted people with discounts in return for permission to track their vending habits. He led us into a control room that had large screens mounted on the walls and employees arranged Nasa-style, facing screens on which stationary dots and travelling arrows identified thousands of vending machines and the technicians who roved between them. We watched a live ticking record of the day’s sales activity, north to Aberdeen, south to the Isle of Wight. A couple of quick clicks on a technician’s computer and we were marvelling at the snacking history of a loyal, I would say fanatical, Broderick customer in Manchester, someone who must have been sourcing two full meals a day from behind glass. While Johnny Brod made a note to slip this customer a thank-you tenner via the app, I asked his team if they’d be able to find the record of my midnight Doritos. A few keyboard taps and there it was. The Doritos fell from their spiral at midnight, closely followed by a sachet of peanut M&amp;Ms, a stubby Mars and a bottle of water. What happened next in the wider world of these machines? I contacted a number of Johnny Brod’s competitors, outfits of all sizes, and asked them to share with me similar sales data for that day in July. I enlisted volunteers to help me track vending activity around the globe. Everywhere mouths watered, spirals turned. A world of people bent double, their hands patting blindly inside retrieval wells, claiming juice boxes, cola bottles, cereal bars, gum, whatever they’d bought, whatever they craved. * * * At 12.45am, a white-chocolate Twix dropped into the well of a machine in Blackfriars in London. At a taxi depot in Belfast, drivers on overnight standby thumbed in coins to buy keep-awake Cokes. Cans of sugar-free Tango slammed down in the surgeons’ staffroom at an Edinburgh hospital. Bottles of Mountain Dew, already long past expiry, turned another hour older inside a Covid-shuttered office in North Carolina. A Japanese accountant, several hours ahead of Europe and the US in a southern prefecture called Ehime, eyed the familiar choices in a cup-noodle machine by his desk. At 4.14am, UK time, a night owl in Newcastle bought Haribo. As the sun rose on Dundee, an employee at a packing factory turned the Perspex carousel of a chilled food machine, sliding back a sprung door, choosing for breakfast a shrink-wrapped sausage roll. At 7.31 am, on a train-station platform in Wakefield in West Yorkshire, a machine was tapped for Tango Orange as the first morning commuters came through. Wakefield is the birthplace of automated vending. This is where the world began its determined effort to uproot the salesperson from the sale. In the 1850s, an inventor here patented a “self-acting machine” for the dispensation of stamps. Later, in the 1880s, a cast-iron contraption shaped like a trident and painted post-box red, patented by the Sweetmeat Automatic Delivery Company of London, was the first machine to vend comestibles. Before the end of the century, beer and wine fountains became fashionable in Paris. In the US, gumball machines sprouted everywhere. British law dictated that tobacconists must close their doors at 8pm, so unattended cigarette dispensers were bolted to the pavements outside. As the social historian Kerry Segrave notes in her 2002 book, Vending Machines, the moment these “silent salesmen” appeared on the streets, they were viewed as fair game to be swindled. Tricking vending machines was called “slugging”, because you fed in cheap brass slugs instead of money. Hundreds of worthless metal lozenges advertising boot polish were found inside a single machine in south-west London in 1914. More than a century later, Johnny Brod told me that sluggers were still at large, only these days they tended to use counterfeit currency. He once had a shoebox full of recovered dud coins in his Wythenshawe office, but it was stolen during a break-in. Back in 1926, the battle against the cheats brought the Fry family into vending. And the Fry family changed the whole game. BE Fry was an inventor in St Louis, Missouri, who noted that the machines in his city were gullible enough to be fooled by cardboard circles. He came up with an improved coin-swallowing mechanism that would answer to nickels and dimes or nothing, he swore. By the 1940s, Fry’s family business, renamed National Vendors, was booming. National Vendors established many of the industry customs that hold sway today. Roving technicians on the roads. A sales team on the phones back at HQ, fighting off turf incursions from rivals, signing new sites to new contracts. Every vending machine is a battleground. Profits are ruthlessly haggled over. Competition for spots is intense. Broadly speaking, the vending game is built on deals between operators (who own machines and have the skills to install them, fix them, constantly fill them with fats and sugars) and site owners (who have the rights to advantageous pieces of land). Either a machine is placed on private property – say, a factory, where the site owner surrenders profits to the operator in return for keeping a workforce fed and present – or, a machine is placed somewhere public, inside a teeming airport, for instance. Here the site owner will expect a cut of each item sold, anywhere from 10% to 30%. Those midnight Doritos at Manchester airport cost me £1.10. Though Johnny Brod, the operator, would not say how much of a cut went to the site owner, Manchester Airports Group, he did acknowledge that he made 22p in profit per Doritos packet. (And that Manchester Airport Group made more.) We were discussing this in headquarters when his father, John Sr, wandered through the office, ready to reminisce about the old days. John Sr explained how he founded the business in the 1960s with a single National Vendors machine, imported from the US. He struck a deal to put it in the foyer of Macclesfield baths. Everything escalated from there. As the Broderick business grew, the family watched their rivals big and small start to eat each other. For the past 20 years or so, global vending has been dominated by corporations that have carved up the world into domains, buying and absorbing regional operators. The big fish in Japan is a vending company called Glory. In the US, it’s Crane. Europe is ruled by Selecta, founded in Zurich in 1957 and owned by the Swiss private-equity firm KKR since 2015. From its English outpost in Hemel Hempstead, Selecta bosses the UK market, with 80,000 machines scattered around hotels, transport hubs and petrol stations. On more than one occasion, Johnny Brod said, he’d received speculative phone calls from Selecta about the possibility of a buyout. But the Brodericks always told Selecta no. Unfinished business. As Johnny Brod explained to me in the Wythenshawe office, the post-pandemic world was one that needed feeding to an ever-greater degree by unmanned food stations. He had secretive concept sketches on his phone, and prototype machines behind a locked laboratory door at his headquarters, all part of a plan to help usher in a new vending age. I made him promise to show me the secret lab after lunch. * * * Lunchtime. In Belfast, that same day, Emmet Oppong walked into a taxi depot near his home carrying as many Cokes as he could handle. He also had pouches of midget gem sweets, massive Twix Xtras and three types of Wrigley’s gum. Weeks earlier, this 21-year-old business graduate had become the owner of a beige and somewhat time-ravaged vending machine that was, in fact, a little older than Oppong himself. He bought it from an online broker for £100 and had since spent about £500 trucking it around, renting storage space, pondering locations, till he found it a home among the taxi drivers. Oppong unlocked the machine’s front and began to feed in packets and cans. He was drawn to vending because he liked the idea of earning money while he slept, ate, studied, interviewed for other jobs, and in general applied his energies elsewhere. Ignoring for a moment the fierce battle for plots, the maintenance stresses, the logistical feats required to keep far-flung machines stocked and clean, at the core of any vendor’s ambition there is often a dream of becoming rich while doing better things. This dream is not always achievable. The second-, third-, fourth- and fifth-hand machines being sold online are a testament to the many dabblers who plunge in only to beat an eventual retreat. But Oppong was doing alright so far. A few more midget gems sold, a bit more gum, and soon he expected to break even on his £600 investment. Perhaps today. Before that summer, Oppong had never looked inside a vending machine or wondered how they functioned. Then he became the owner of a model called a SnackMart, which came to him wrapped in dusty cellophane, with alien interior workings. He spent a fortnight in a storage unit, stood before the machine with an owner’s manual in hand, trying to distinguish what from what. He learned that “spacers” were clamps that kept slender items, such as drinks cans, snug in their rack. “Product expellers” were slip-on tongues for the spirals that helped send puffier items such as crisps on their reluctant drops to the well. An evaporation unit above the door sucked in moisture and stopped the glass from steaming over. Though the outer facades of vending machines have become jazzier, and payment methods have modernised, the insides of most vending machines have barely changed in decades. Oppong followed certain fundamental laws of vending. He put his Twix Xtras and some Maltesers down on the bottom shelves, nearest the SnackMart’s fridge unit. Crisps were placed in the warmest part of the machine, up at the top. The midget gems could go anywhere, really, and today he decided to give them a try in primetime – halfway along, halfway up. In vending, this part of the job, as delicate as flower arrangement, is known as planogramming. How best to spread the wares? Fiona Chambers, who runs the vending company SV24-7 in the Scottish town of Alloa with her husband, Ian, puts much thought into planograms. She told me she likes two central spirals of KitKats, two of Twirls, these being her champion sellers. Declan Sewell, the young and ambitious CEO of a company called Decorum Vending in Portsmouth, will always, always put Snickers in the middle. Sewell told me he preferred to keep more colourfully packaged items on the fringes of his machines, to catch the eye and draw attention across his range. If the glass or Perspex window of a vending machine is like a canvas, these operators aimed to paint a picture of abundance. “You don’t want the customer saying, och, there’s nothing to choose from,” Chambers said. At the same time, margins being tightest for operators in the industry’s middle tier, she and Sewell couldn’t afford to fill their machines so generously that items expired before they were bought. Certain planogramming wheezes mitigated against this. Items put close to a button panel, Sewell insisted, sold quicker than items below or above. Chambers had read an academic study that claimed to prove options on the left outsold options on the right, at least in Europe and the US, because we read these machines how we read our books. Oppong closed the front of his SnackMart, locking it carefully. The names given to vending machines are reliably charming, sometimes hinting at their places of manufacture. Spain makes Mistrals. The US makes Cascades. Germans make Bistros! (exclamation mark included). Italian machines tend to be given musical names: Operas, Melodias, Sinfonias, Jazzes. There are machines out there called Shoppers, Shoppertrons, SuperStacks, NarrowStacks. There are Brios, Astros, Tangos, Sambas, Festivals, Visions. There are BevMaxes, Polyvends, Merchants – and SnackMarts, which were created by a British engineer called Richard Brinsley and his company Westomatic. “West”, for their west-of-England base, “omatic” because what do you think. I went to visit Brinsley one day at his workshop in Devon. In a part of one warehouse, malfunctioning SnackMarts were lined up for repair, while other, sadder machines, like a miserably rusted Kenco dispenser, were beyond salvation and awaited final destruction. Something of a pioneer when it came to vending English tea, Brinsley was the first to bring to market a machine that brewed from leaves, not powder, in the 1980s. He called that creation the Temprano, “because it was ahead of its time”, Brinsley told me. He led us into a part of the warehouse where a brand new hot-drinks dispenser was coming into being. “We’re going to call this one the Autorista,” he said, as he stood in front of a huge purple machine, the first in the world, according to Brinsley, that could prepare a coffee with real milk or real cream. “One of our electronics guys came up with the name,” he said, hitting a few buttons and automatically barista-ing out a cappuccino that contained fresh cow’s milk. Johnny Brod in Manchester, obsessional about new kit, had placed an order for the first 25 Autoristas that Brinsley could manufacture. In order for this latest innovation to be effective in the field, both men knew, an Autorista would have to be visited every 24 hours by a technician who knew how to clean its interior pipes and flush out the old milk and cream before it soured. If this was the future of unattended sales, I thought out loud, it was going to require a lot more human attention than in the past. But leaving the Autorista alone and full of spoiling dairy did not bear thinking about, Brinsley said. Over in Belfast, Oppong had the option of leaving his SnackMart to take care of itself for weeks at a time. Out of sheer enthusiasm, he had been visiting the taxi depot almost every day. He popped in mornings and nights, to feed in new stock and to pull out the coin tray, relishing the weight of the drivers’ one- and two-pound coins. Declan Sewell of Decorum Vending had rigged his own fleet with wifi units so that he could track his live sales by smartphone, refreshing for updates like a fan following the Saturday football. Fiona Chambers in Scotland relied on reports that came nightly by email. Oppong was still tracking profits with a pen and paper. He tallied the latest. Nearly there. * * * A few timezones west, the US awoke, its 7 million vending machines getting busier and busier as another working day began. An IT analyst in North Carolina, returning to his office for the first time since the start of the pandemic, decided to buy a Mountain Dew from the break-room machine. He noticed when it was too late that the bottle had expired 16 months earlier, in March 2020. “If I die,” the analyst tweeted, opening the Dew anyway, “just know I died doing what I love.” I got in touch with him. He survived. His drink was only a little flat. Vending machines do kill their human patrons every so often. A US study in 1998 recorded 37 deaths and 113 injuries over a 20-year period, which amounted to an average of 1.85 kills per annum. This statistic, never formally updated or corrected since, sometimes prompts the claim that vending machines are deadlier than sharks. In the 1980s, cans of drink were left for the taking on top of vending machines near Hiroshima in Japan. These cans had been deliberately laced with a potent herbicide. Twelve people died and their killer was never caught. Vending machines can be vessels for all manner of plots, ambitions and initiatives. In Glasgow, that same day in July, health officials unveiled a free-to-use dispenser of sterilised needles, an attempt to curb infections among the city’s drug users. At the same time, over in California, the porn actors Carmela Clutch and Kyle Mason debuted a film that had for its setting the patch of ground in front of a sex-toy dispenser. Carmela had her hand stuck in the flap. Kyle, as an arriving technician, caught a vibe. The scene developed from there. While I was in Manchester I read news reports about a civic effort in Nairobi to put sanitary-pad dispensers in schools. A similar scheme was announced for women’s restrooms in Tokyo, where, that same day, hundreds of journalists were flying in ahead of the Olympic Games. On arrival at Tokyo’s Olympic Village, international guests were offered the chance to buy locally apt souvenirs in a locally apt way, via robotic vend. If Wakefield is the literal birthplace of the automated sale, Japan is the spiritual home. There they vend umbrellas, ice-cream, fancy dress. In Nagasaki, there is a machine that sells the edible chrysalises of silkworms. You can vend fresh tomatoes in Kobe and, in Tatsuno, fresh oysters. In Osaka, during the summer of 2021, a Japanese airline had started selling tickets to mystery destinations from a machine that asked 5,000 yen, or £30, per turn. This concept was so popular that 10,000 tickets were sold by the end of 2021 and the airline put duplicate machines in Tokyo, Nagoya and Fukuoka. At the last formal count, conducted by a trade body in December 2020, there were 2.7m vending machines spread around Japan: one for every 46 citizens, the highest density anywhere. Affection for vending is so pronounced that a machine selling something unique may become the subject of fascination, even pilgrimage. On 21 July, while I was in Manchester with the Brodericks, and while Emmet Oppong was keeping a close eye on his Belfast machine, a Japanese accountant named Masaharu Mizota was coming to the end of his day in Ehime. Mizota had recently learned about an unusual, indeed, one-of-a-kind machine in Uchiko, a small town on the Oda River, and he daydreamed about taking a roadtrip to try it. Would it be crazy to drive for hours to Uchiko, just to push a coin into a slot and punch a few buttons? Vending machines have the power to beguile a certain type of person. As I am one of those types, wandering up to scuffed Perspex wherever it is to be found, often overpaying in this way for my Boosts or my ready salted crisps, I’ve spent a lot of time wondering about their hypnotic power. There is a logic that underpins the will to vend to other people. It’s that allure of passive income. The operator of a vending machine gets to experience the idle fancy of exhausted shopkeepers everywhere, selling their wares without getting up early in the morning, without necessarily getting up at all. But what is behind the will to be vended to? This is more complicated. I think it has something to do with the proffered combination of convenience, novelty and nostalgia. Mizota told me that he felt the culture of automated vending to be a part of his culture as a Japanese citizen. He was as willing to take a long journey to try out a novel machine as he would have been to visit a monument or a place of natural beauty. Mizota was eight hours ahead of me in the UK, almost ready to go to bed. Before he did so he checked his maps, figuring out a route for the morning. * * * In Manchester it was mid-afternoon. Leading me into a room at his headquarters that he called his concept lab, Johnny Brod waved an arm at a pair of unplugged prototypes. “My babies,” he called them. His actual children and even a couple of grandchildren happened to be visiting that day. If everything went according to plan, Johnny Brod said, these prototypes would secure his family’s fortune long into the future. He was nervous about me repeating specific details, lest his competitors gain a jump. But the gist of what Johnny Brod was plotting went as follows. Many workplace canteens, closed during the lockdowns of 2020 and 2021, had not reopened, or not at their former scale. For reasons of in-house virus management, employers were no longer so eager to have employees roam out at lunch to the nearest sandwich shop or supermarket. Those high-street retailers still wanted to reach a hungry workforce, however, and Johnny Brod hoped to become the bridge. He wanted to run new-wave machines of his own design inside offices and factories, as one-stop robotic canteens. There was a prototype up and running in the distribution centre of a well-known UK retailer, from which the Brodericks vended salad bowls, fruit bowls, “anything you’d see in a garage forecourt. Soon we’ll be diversifying into sushi. Crudités!” These manoeuvrings were part of a wider shift that had been taking place across the vending industry for a decade. Back in the early 2010s, innovators in the US came up with an alternative to the traditional spiral machines that they called micro-markets. Take out its turning coils, leave in the shelves, and a vending machine is essentially a transparent larder. What if customers could open the door of that larder and remove by hand whatever they could afford? Instead of being stocked with products of a uniform shape – products that could be relied on to move forward in the embrace of a spiral then fall in predictable ways – a machine could sell anything. Loose golf balls. Bikinis. A jeroboam of champagne. A curved banana. Over time, the tempting possibility of vending fresh fruit had frustrated the tinkerers like Johnny Brod, because fruit tends to create jams inside traditional machines, figuratively and sometimes literally. Micro-markets full of swipe-to-open larders and fridges began to open in offices, factories and prisons across the US. Sensitive shelves and CCTV cameras helped determine who had bought what. In Europe and the UK, Selecta opened about 150 micro-markets which, at least until the summer of 2021, were in workplaces not accessible to curious outsiders. That week in July 2021, however, Selecta had opened a micro-market for use by anybody in East Croydon train station in London. A small retail unit by the gates had been fitted with larders full of fruit tubs, wide-bottomed milkshakes, shallow nut trays, Jaffa Cakes in sealed blue parcels. Everything was left unattended, at the disposal of any passing customer with a credit card. For most of the morning on 21 July 2021, according to figures later provided to me by Selecta, the East Croydon micro-market went unused. Then, a canned latte, a ham-and-cheese croissant later, sales crept up. By mid-afternoon, as I stood in Johnny Brod’s lab, about 20 items were being removed from the London micro-market every hour. Hummus chips. Bircher muesli pots. Juices laced with ginseng. Johnny Brod was so unnerved by Selecta’s innovative leap, he’d sent a spy south. He checked and rechecked his phone, waiting to receive word from East Croydon. Next to his concept lab there was a large staff lounge, its walls lined with old, experimental Broderick’s machines, and we killed some time in there. A few of the old machines had no touchscreen. One had only touchscreen, its entire front replaced by a doorway-sized digital display. Johnny Brod had been among the first to embrace screens, back in 2011, an innovation that later became the industry norm. But his all-screen, only-screen model never took off; customers, it turned out, needed to see the object of their desire. Now this lone model stood as monument to noble failure in the Wythenshawe lounge. At last his phone buzzed and Johnny Brod read his spy’s report on the new micro-market. “It’s quite nice apparently,” he said, sounding forlorn. * * * At 5.51pm the snack machine in Blackfriars in London sold a porridge-to-go bar. At 6.04pm, a mango drink. It was one of those newer vending machines that could talk, and it spoke to customers with a robotic, feminine voice, advising, apologising. Another machine, many thousands of miles away, told prospective customers: “My name is James, I serve delicious snacks.” James was situated in an apartment block overlooking the Langat River in Malaysia. He had his own Twitter account. Spend any time immersed in the vending world and you start to see that these machines, insentient cumbersome things, are repositories for the most unlikely human notions and emotions. There was once a drinks dispenser in Singapore that had to be cuddled before it would unloose a can. That was a bid to teach us something about spontaneous acts of compassion, courtesy of Coca-Cola Incorporated. We bring our prejudices to these machines. We have ungracious feelings for them that they know nothing about; we anticipate their betrayal. There was once a Seinfeld episode dedicated to George Constanza’s furious efforts to secure a snagged Twix. When Johnny Brod lent a branded coffee-maker to the producers of the ITV drama Cold Feet, he was pained to see it malfunctioning for dramatic purposes. (“And our competitors love putting clips of that online.”) In one of my earliest London memories I am on an underground platform, watching a disgruntled man in a raincoat apply a handmade out-of-order sign to a Cadbury’s chocolate dispenser. He’d fed in his coin. But no Dairy Milk. I still remember his appalled expression, his wounded grace as he warned off others. This initial encounter did not prejudice me against the machines. Instead, I’ve always found them to emanate reassurance, particularly so during moments of dislocation: jetlagged layovers, late-night jobs, early starts. I first noticed their palliative effect at school, when we called it going venders (“You going venders?”) and when a visit to the machines meant a respite from classwork, junior lust, the bickering over which bands were best. One day a savvy pupil set himself up in competition with the school venders. He started to sell the same snacks, cheaper, from his backpack. I stayed loyal to the machines. They had inexhaustible patience, they let you ponder every option, walk up, walk away, malinger at the glass, wallow in a pre-purchase. I think what comforted me then, as now, was their height, their stuffedness, their immobility, their always-on-ness, their middle-of-the-night-ness, their there-til-the-end-ness. A decade ago, when my wife went into a long and intermittently frightening labour that lasted for days, my bleary walks to the hospital vending machines took on the character of therapy, necessary little trips out of chaos to find something sturdy, upright, understood. How right it felt that in Cormac McCarthy’s dystopian novel The Road, the last can of Coke in a ruined world had to be plucked from the innards of an old vending machine. So often they are a comfort of final resort, as anybody who has concocted a contingency meal in a budget hotel or a motorway service-station will know. They facilitate jokes, complaints, unhealthy diets, but the emotions these machines inspire are real. I know of at least one love story that has a vending machine as its core. Fiona Chambers of SV24-7 first met her husband, Ian, when she was a salesperson for a drinks firm. Ian was a buyer. “I’m not saying that we flirted, exactly,” she recalled, “but hey-ho. I sold him a shitload of Cokes.” The more time I spent with Johnny Brod, the more I saw how sincerely concerned he was for his fleet. He had a horror of unclean machines, having once inherited a second-hand BevMax that had spores of mould growing in its corners. He’d been known to clamber down on his belly in malls or on airport concourses, to peer under retrieval wells, dragging out chocolate wrappers, recovering abandoned flip-flops. His machines were like his pets or his zoo animals. He maintained them with fastidious care, and he couldn’t let me leave Manchester, he said, without taking me on safari to visit a prized specimen. Over in Leeds General, said Johnny Brod, he owned an absolute beauty by the benches in A&amp;E, a machine that was much used by fight-night drunks. “Insane on weekends … we can’t fill it fast enough.” And he loved his BevMaxes by the luggage belt in the local airport. “Because if that belt breaks down, I’ve got you trapped.” But the machine he wanted to show me was in Manchester’s Trafford Centre shopping mall. No gimmicks, no tricks, just a boss dispenser in a prime location, capable of slurping in thousands of pounds a month. He drove us over in an SUV. “There,” Johnny Brod whispered, signalling for us to halt on a concourse near a spotless, richly stocked BevMax. It loomed, looking tempting. “Wait,” he muttered. It was like watching a well-baited snare. He knew it wouldn’t take long. Soon a young shopper paused on her way through from clothes and jewellery, leaning in to ponder the choice. Water? Fanta Lemon? When she kept walking, I told Johnny Brod: tough luck. “Wait,” he repeated. And here she came, returning for water after all. Fanta, too. * * * In Belfast, that night, when Emmet Oppong looked in on his vending machine before bed, no midget gems had been sold. Crinkle-cut crisps had done better, and as usual every Coke he could fit inside was gone. Oppong clicked his pen and did some sums. As long as he wrote off the personal labour, he was satisfied his SnackMart had now paid for itself. He was newly in profit: a vending entrepreneur. Months later, in autumn 2021, and trading as Em Vending Solutions, Oppong would go on to triple the size of his operation, purchasing a pair of silvery machines covered in cartoony decals of Homer Simpson and the Tasmanian Devil, £750 the pair. As I came away from Manchester that night in July, I took with me a final image of Johnny Brod, expansionist-king of UK vending, owner of a thousands-strong fleet – standing in front of an empty slab of wall in the Trafford Centre. He took photographs. He noted nearby plug points. He couldn’t believe, he said, he hadn’t thought to put a vending machine there yet. The last time we spoke, in spring 2022, he was about to take delivery of his 25 Autoristas. He was considering an expansion into London Heathrow, “where they still have the same shit machines you saw in Love Actually, 20 years ago. And you can print that.” But back on that July night, at 8.08pm, a swimmer in Glasgow bought a bottle of energy drink from Fiona Chambers’s machine near a public pool. At 9.53pm, Declan Sewell’s chatty machine in Blackfriars sold a final peppermint Aero. A smoked-salmon sandwich and a Pepsi were bought for somebody’s dinner from East Croydon. Soon all this UK trade would slow, purchases continuing in the US, resuming again in waking Asia. It was nearly midnight in the UK when I arrived back in London from Manchester. As I had made the day’s first vend, I thought it would be neat if I made the day’s last vend, too. I wandered around St Pancras station, trying to find a just-so machine that would suit my appetite, as I provisioned and planogrammed ideal arrangements of confectionary and crisps in my head. After a day with the loquacious Johnny Brod, I was pleased by the knowledge that whatever vending machine I found, it would ask for no conversation. Zero civility. We would commune, if we communed at all, with a poked finger and the warm coins I had in my pocket. Perhaps this is at the heart of the machines’ unique appeal, a displaced misanthropy. Perhaps we transform our gratitude at not having to deal with one more human being today into tenderness for the SnackMarts and Shoppertrons and BevMaxes that feed us and reward us by a path of least resistance. Under a St Pancras escalator, a couple were dancing in front of an automated jukebox. On a concrete walkway beyond, a machine waited to vend foldable Brompton bikes. I checked the Google alerts on my phone, scrolling through social media, too, learning that a radio producer in Chicago had at that moment bought an attractive sugar-dusted ganache from a machine in a garage off Interstate 55. A cannabis-oil manufacturer had put a dispenser on top of a majestic sandstone mountain in Utah, to deliver balms to achey hikers. An animal sanctuary in Colorado was awarded a patent on a vending machine to be used exclusively by captive apes. “Come find me near the swimming pool,” tweeted James, the Malaysian vending machine, from his fourth-storey berth. In Japan, it was morning. The accountant Masaharu Mizota woke earlier than usual and climbed aboard his motorbike. He drove south, between mountains, crossing bridges, paying at tolls, following a map that was mounted on his handlebars. He pulled into sleepy Uchiko at about 7.30am and parked by the one-of-a-kind vending machine he’d read about. Of all the things to be sold from an ungainly glass-and-steel machine, it was selling pieces of fragile and beautiful origami. There were folded-paper sea creatures. Delicate flowers and birds and stars. After his long journey, Mizota fed in a 50-yen piece, about 30p, and ran a gloved finger over the buttons, trying to choose. • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, listen to our podcasts here and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2020/jan/07/renewables-beat-fossil-fuels-greenest-year-uk-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2020-01-07T00:01:44Z","webTitle":"Renewables beat fossil fuels on 137 days in greenest year for UK energy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/07/renewables-beat-fossil-fuels-greenest-year-uk-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2020/jan/07/renewables-beat-fossil-fuels-greenest-year-uk-energy","fields":{"headline":"Renewables beat fossil fuels on 137 days in greenest year for UK energy","bodyText":"Energy produced by the UK’s renewable sector outpaced fossil fuel plants on a record 137 days in 2019 to help the country’s energy system record its greenest year. The report by the Carbon Brief website found that renewable energy – from wind, solar, hydro and biomass projects – grew by 9% last year and was the UK’s largest electricity source in March, August, September and December. The rise of renewables helped drive generation from coal and gas plants down by 6% from the year before, and 50% lower from the start of the decade. Meanwhile, the number of coal-free days has accelerated from the first 24-hour period in 2017 to 21 days in 2018 and 83 days last year. The report’s findings come after National Grid confirmed that “low-carbon” electricity – including energy from renewables and nuclear plants – made up more than half the UK’s energy mix for the first time last year. Although the UK’s low-carbon electricity production doubled over the last 10 years and despite the 2019 record, growth slowed sharply in the last year of the decade because of a string of outages at the UK’s ageing nuclear power plants. Carbon Brief warned this could slow progress in the years ahead. Simon Evans, the author of Carbon Brief’s report, said: “Our analysis shows that rapid gains in decarbonising the power sector can’t be taken for granted and won’t just continue to magically happen forever. “The government’s seemingly ambitious target to roll out 40GW of offshore wind by 2030 won’t happen without policies to back it up – and it may not be enough on its own to meet UK climate goals, without contributions from onshore wind, solar or further new nuclear.” Audrey Gallacher, Energy UK’s interim chief executive, said the report was a “stark reminder” that the energy industry must go “much further and faster” to help meet the UK’s climate target. Britain has set a legally binding target to create a carbon-neutral economy by cutting emissions to net zero by 2050. This means the UK must only emit as much carbon as it is able to capture and store. The target will require a huge increase in low-carbon generation to help meet the UK’s rising need for clean electricity for transport and heating. However, the government’s delayed energy white paper is yet to emerge. “The amount of low-carbon power produced has doubled over the last decade but we need to go above and beyond that to keep pace with our climate change targets, especially with overall demand set to increase, rather than falling as it has done in recent years,” Gallacher said. “This underlines the urgency of increasing all forms of low-carbon generation – and why we need to see [the government’s] energy white paper as soon as possible, with action and policies that can enable the required investment and innovation to make this happen.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2020/jun/30/third-of-advertisers-may-boycott-facebook-in-hate-speech-revolt","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2020-06-30T15:15:25Z","webTitle":"Third of advertisers may boycott Facebook in hate speech revolt","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jun/30/third-of-advertisers-may-boycott-facebook-in-hate-speech-revolt","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2020/jun/30/third-of-advertisers-may-boycott-facebook-in-hate-speech-revolt","fields":{"headline":"Third of advertisers may boycott Facebook in hate speech revolt","bodyText":"Almost a third of advertisers are considering joining a month-long boycott of Facebook as the social network struggles to convince advertisers that it is doing enough to fight hate speech on its platform. The unprecedented corporate snub has been revealed in survey by the World Federation of Advertisers, whose big-spending members control nearly $100bn (£81bn) in spending. The survey showed that a third of the top 58 advertisers will, or are likely to, suspend advertising, while a further 40% are also considering doing so. On Monday, Ford and Adidas announced their intention to halt all advertising on the platform, joining corporations including Honda, Verizon, Diageo and Unilever. Others, including Starbucks and Coca-Cola, have paused all advertising on social media but stopped short of officially announcing support for the “Stop Hate for Profit” campaign, which is coordinating the Facebook boycott. The boycott is also spreading outside the US. On Tuesday, Britvic, the owner of drinks brands including Fruit Shoot and Robinsons, said it was suspending all advertising on Facebook platforms next month, and called on the social media platform “to take stronger actions against harmful content and misinformation on its platform”. VW said it was also joining the boycott, along with Honda Europe and Ford Europe. The French state-owned utility EDF, which owns EDF Energy and is the company behind the construction of the Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant, has also vetoed Facebook advertising. A Ford spokesman said: “We are pausing all US and European social media advertising for the next 30 days to re-evaluate our presence on these platforms. The existence of content that includes hate speech, violence and racial injustice on social platforms needs to be eradicated.” A Honda Europe spokesman added that the decision was “in alignment with our company’s values, which are grounded in human respect”. Confectionery group Mars said it was halting its social media advertising across all platforms until further notice. In a statement to the Guardian, the company said: “Social media platforms play an important role in society, but equally, they have a powerful role to play in stopping the spread of hate speech and misinformation. “There is no room for discrimination in a healthy society. Mars has a responsibility and an opportunity to make a meaningful and measurable difference in the fight against racism, hate, violence and discrimination – we expect all of the social media platform partners we work with to do the same.” Stephan Loerke, chief executive of the World Federation of Advertisers, told the Financial Times the advertising industry was starting to request big changes from social media platforms. “In all candour,” he said, “ it feels like a turning point.” In an internal post on Monday reported by Axios, Microsoft revealed it had suspended all US spending on Facebook platforms in May, and had since expanded the move globally. Like Starbucks, Microsoft has not publicly endorsed the wider campaign; in the internal messaging, its chief marketing officer, Chris Capossela, told colleagues: “Our experience tells us that the most impactful means to effect genuine, long-term change is through direct dialogue and meaningful action with our media partners, including the suspension of real marketing dollars.” The “Stop Hate for Profit” boycott is promoted by a coalition of US-based non-profits and calls for companies to suspend their spending on the platform for the month of July. However, many companies, including Microsoft, had already dropped their ad spend, while some, such as Unilever, have announced their intention to continue the boycott well past the end of July, until after the US election in November or beyond. Some advertisers are additionally motivated by a desire to preserve “brand safety”, objecting to their promotional material appearing next to inappropriate content. Capossela of Microsoft, for instance, cited “hate speech, pornography, terrorist content, etc”, as examples that concerned his company. Oil group BP told the Guardian it was also halting Facebook advertising in support of the Stop Hate for Profit campaign. A spokesperson said: “We believe it is critically important for all social media platforms to deploy improved controls to eliminate the distribution of content that is untrue, discriminatory, or intended to incite, raise fear, or fan hate.” Last week, the Guardian revealed how Facebook’s own policies against the organised conspiracy movement QAnon were not being enforced. More than 3 million users of some of the largest groups and pages are followers of the conspiracy, which spreads the gospel of the pseudonymous “Q”, who claims knowledge of a secret cabal of powerful paedophiles and sex traffickers conspiring to bring down the US president, Donald Trump. In an interview on the BBC’s Today programme on Tuesday, Facebook’s UK head, Steve Hatch, was questioned about the fact that, on the day protests over the killing of George Floyd began, the top post in the US called racially motivated policing a “myth”. “We have no tolerance on our platform for hate speech. Of course, it’s incredibly hard and upsetting to read that,” Hatch said, “but equally, whether it is directed at creating hate, and real world harm in particular … The way that we define real-world harm is if it’s going to create imminent risk to people.” Pressed on whether nationwide race riots qualified as “real-world harm”, Hatch said: “The debates that we see around all of these topics are extremely challenging and can be very very wide-ranging.” Hatch appeared on the programme to promote Facebook’s latest effort to tackle platform safety: a campaign running across Europe, the Middle East and Africa that encourages users to help “stamp out false news”. Facebook users should consider three questions when reading news on the platform, the company says: “Where’s it from?”, “What’s missing?” And “How did you feel?”. The intention is to promote reliable sources that tell the whole story, without skewing the narrative to encourage a heated emotional response. The campaign has already sparked further criticism for pushing the work of keeping Facebook safe on to users. “This campaign urges users of Facebook to ‘stop, think and check’,” said Nick Robinson on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “Why should Facebook’s users do something which a $500bn corporation refuses to do?” Despite some of the world’s biggest advertisers signing on to support the boycott, Facebook’s overall revenue is unlikely to have taken a significant hit. The company generates most of its income from the so-called “long tail” – smaller advertisers who make up in number what they lack in individual spending."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2020/aug/01/why-johnsons-tories-fell-for-a-tiny-sect-of-libertarian-provocateurs-rcp","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2020-08-01T05:00:33Z","webTitle":"Why Boris Johnson's Tories fell for a tiny sect of libertarian provocateurs | Andy Beckett","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/01/why-johnsons-tories-fell-for-a-tiny-sect-of-libertarian-provocateurs-rcp","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/01/why-johnsons-tories-fell-for-a-tiny-sect-of-libertarian-provocateurs-rcp","fields":{"headline":"Why Boris Johnson's Tories fell for a tiny sect of libertarian provocateurs","bodyText":"So much seems unusual about this Conservative government: its constant disruptiveness; its preference for rhetoric over functional policies; its mixture of brazen U-turns and cult-like discipline; its flirtations with the far right alongside leftwing-sounding plans to “level up”; its deadly reluctance to curtail small freedoms in a pandemic. It’s common to attribute some or all of these tendencies to the idiosyncrasies of Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings, or the effects of Brexit, or the rise of rightwing populism. But there is a less noticed and more surprising factor at work, too. Today’s Tory government has adopted some of the style, rhetoric and preoccupations of a defunct radical sect, the Revolutionary Communist party (RCP). The RCP was a tiny British party, founded in the 70s, officially disbanded in the late 90s. Despite its name, most of its stances were not communist or revolutionary but contrarian: it supported free speech for racists, and nuclear power; it attacked environmentalism and the NHS. Its most consistent impulse was to invoke an idealised working class, and claim it was actually being harmed by the supposed elites of the liberal left. A similar impulse has also driven the Johnson government, in particular its Brexit policy and the decisive capture in last year’s election of Labour’s “red wall”. This similarity is less surprising once you know that a former RCP member, Munira Mirza, is head of the Downing Street policy unit, and probably Johnson’s most important adviser after Cummings. In an article for Grazia magazine this year, Johnson called her “extraordinary”, “ruthless”, and one of “the five women who have shaped my life”. On Friday another RCP veteran, Claire Fox, was nominated for a peerage by the government. Other RCP veterans, such as Frank Furedi, Mick Hume and Brendan O’Neill, are fixtures in the Tory press and its associated journal, the Spectator. For decades they’ve also organised a profusion of post-RCP organisations, including the magazine Living Marxism (later LM), the website Spiked, and the Institute of Ideas (now the Academy of Ideas), which runs political and cultural conferences with extensive corporate sponsorship and well-known participants. Journalists have periodically probed the methods and motives of the ex-RCP network. Much less attention has been paid to why the Tory party and press have become so keen on them. What does the ascent of Mirza and her comrades tell us about modern Conservatism? For a long time, Britain wasn’t ready for the RCP’s kind of politics. During the 70s and 80s the Conservatives already had their own aggressive, populist creed – Thatcherism. Yet as it ran out of steam, and the calmer but blander Blair era began, broadcasters who wanted rightwing controversialists to “balance” their shows discovered the RCP diaspora. During the 90s and 00s, programmes such as Question Time and The Moral Maze came to depend on Fox in particular. The Tory press soon followed suit. They love to publish people from supposedly leftwing backgrounds who bash the left, and who use what seems like neutral logic to arrive at essentially rightwing conclusions. Both were RCP skills. Eventually Mirza was noticed by the Conservatives themselves. In 2005, with the party long out of power and desperate for new ideas, she was hired by the rightwing thinktank Policy Exchange, which had recently been founded by would-be Tory radicals including Michael Gove and Nick Boles. “I sort of adore and am fascinated by Munira,” Boles recently told the website ConservativeHome. In 2008 another opportunity opened up for her, when Johnson, who was close to Policy Exchange, was elected mayor of London. Without much of a plan about how to govern, he hired Mirza as an adviser, then promoted her to deputy mayor for education and culture. Former colleagues remember her as diligent and efficient – qualities Johnson lacks. Like Cummings, she revered modern technology and what he calls “normal voters”, and was keen to let people know she wasn’t a Conservative member. Yet beneath her measured manner and insistence that right and left were no longer meaningful categories, she appeared dogmatic in her dislike of liberal causes, such as multiculturalism, and leftwing institutions such as trade unions. In 2016, Johnson stepped down as mayor, but the RCP network found another illiberal phenomenon it could get behind: Brexit. Last year Fox was elected as a Brexit party MEP. Spiked regards remainers with the same insatiable fury as the rightwing tabloids – which is one reason why its writers can move so easily between the two. Last year, Mirza co-authored the Conservative manifesto. In its crude but effective repetitions, and its promises to “champion freedom of expression” and “unleash the country’s potential” by cutting red tape, there were clear echoes of the RCP network’s preoccupations and polemical style. When Conservatism is in a confrontational phase, as it is now, the relentlessness and conviction of ex-leftists can turn out to be very useful. Back in the 70s, one of Thatcher’s most valued advisers was a former Communist party activist, Alfred Sherman. Even Mirza’s personal biography fits neatly with the themes of current Toryism. She is a working-class northerner from Oldham. One of its constituencies has a small Labour majority – another potential “red wall” target for the Tories. Meanwhile her immigrant background and contrarian views on racism – in 2017 she wrote on Spiked that institutional racism was “a perception more than a reality” – made her just the right person, in the government’s view, to set up its new commission on racial inequalities. If its conclusions are complacent – and Johnson’s record on race makes that quite likely – her Pakistani ancestry will provide cover. Yet in other ways the relationship between the Tories and the RCP network has become trickier in recent months. Spiked hates the lockdown. “Cummings broke the lockdown?” wrote O’Neill recently. “Good. Welcome to the sensible minority, Dom.” Spiked also hates government campaigns against obesity, which it sees as state intrusion and “a war on the poor”. Covid-19 threatens to make such libertarian postures seem obsolete, or at least in need of adjustment. This week, one of the parts of northern England put back into partial lockdown was Mirza’s home town. Former colleagues predict she will try to soften such emergency measures. Johnson may be receptive. On Monday, he said his new anti-obesity drive would not be “excessively bossy or nannying”. Throughout the Covid-19 crisis, his emphasis on the “common sense” of individuals has echoed an argument often made on Spiked, that states should treat citizens as “grownups”. Yet if the crisis worsens again, or the government’s poll ratings resume their early summer fall, then Mirza and her comrades may learn a hard lesson about the Conservatives. They often seek help from outside the party. Their relationship with the RCP tells us that, as orthodox Conservative values such as support for free-market capitalism have lost their broad appeal, the Tories have become less and less squeamish about where this help comes from. But once these outside ideas and allies have been assimilated, or stop being useful, the Conservatives move on. From David Cameron’s coalition with the Liberal Democrats to Johnson’s more furtive dalliance with the RCP now, relationships with the Tories are not built to last. • Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2020/jun/10/olof-palme-murder-swedish-prosecutors-reveal-conclusions","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2020-06-10T13:31:07Z","webTitle":"Swedish prosecutors close Olof Palme murder inquiry after 34 years","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/10/olof-palme-murder-swedish-prosecutors-reveal-conclusions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2020/jun/10/olof-palme-murder-swedish-prosecutors-reveal-conclusions","fields":{"headline":"Swedish prosecutors close Olof Palme murder inquiry after 34 years","bodyText":"Swedish authorities have closed their 34-year investigation into the unsolved murder of prime minister Olof Palme, naming a graphic designer at an insurance company as the probable killer but saying he could not be prosecuted because he was now dead. “We can’t get around one person as the perpetrator: he is Stig Engström,” the chief prosecutor, Krister Petersson, who took over one of the world’s most infamous cold cases in 2017, told a new conference in Stockholm on Wednesday. Palme, 59, was shot in the back, at close range, at 11.21 pm on 28 February 1986 as he was walking home from a cinema in central Stockholm with his wife Lisbet. The assailant disappeared into a side street, prompting a huge but abortive manhunt and an investigation that has gripped Sweden for three decades. Known to Swedish media as “the Skandia man” because he was working late in the company’s building near the crime scene on the night of the murder, Engström was questioned several times by police at the time, but ruled out as a suspect. “Engström is deceased,” Petersson said. “Therefore I am not able to start proceedings or even interview him. That is why I decided to discontinue the investigation.” He said, however, he was “sure” of his conclusion. Palme’s son, Marten, told Swedish Radio he believed prosecutors had made the right call. “I think Engström is guilty. Given the current situation, I think it is reasonable to close the investigation,” he said. The killing, described by the Swedish prime minister, Stefan Löfven, as an “open wound”, has left a deep scar on a country that still prides itself on being peaceful and safe, prompting many to say Sweden “lost its innocence” that day. Löfven said on Wednesday he hoped the decision “would allow this wound to heal”. A petty criminal was convicted of the murder in July 1989 but acquitted on appeal, clearing the field for a multitude of conspiracy theories involving shadowy forces ranging from the South African security services to rogue Swedish police with far-right sympathies, the Kurdish separatists of the PKK and the CIA. Hans Melander, the chief investigator, said that over the years the case had generated more than 22,000 leads and files occupying 250 metres of shelves. More than 10,000 people had been questioned since 1986, he said, and 134 had claimed responsibility for the murder. The murder weapon was never recovered despite police testing 788 revolvers over the years, Melander said, adding that the marks on the two 357 Magnum bullets found at the scene – one that killed Palme, and a second that injured his wife, who died in 2018 – were so faint “we can’t even prove they were fired by the same gun”. But with no possibility of any conclusive new forensic evidence, he said, a new team of investigators appointed in 2016 began an exhaustive review of the circumstantial evidence, including witness statements, and found “one person stood out”. Engström, whose death in 2000 was reported as a possible suicide and who was 52 at the time of the murder, had a military background, experienced alcohol and money problems, and was a member of a shooting club, Petersson said. “He was also part of a circle that was very strongly critical of Olof Palme and his politics,” he added. Several witnesses gave descriptions that matched Engström, Petersson said, stating his rough height and noting variously that the fleeing killer was dressed in a long jacket or coat, wearing a cap and glasses, and carrying a small bag. Engström, whose family repeatedly dismissed accusations he was the murderer, called police and media the day after the assassination, saying he was one of the first to arrive on the scene but had left before police arrived. He claimed he had spoken to Lisbet Palme and tried to resuscitate the victim, adding that he ran off in an effort to give police vital information that the prime minister’s wife had given him about the assailant’s appearance. Petersson said there were clear inconsistencies in the story. “What was strange, when we went through the material, was that none of the other witnesses, including Lisbet Palme, identified him as being present at the crime scene,” he said. Yet he “told investigators quite a bit about how he acted at the crime scene”. Other evidence, including time stamps from Engström’s office, threw up further questions. One key witness, Yvonne Nieminen, told police a man she saw hurrying from the scene, who matched Engström’s description, seemed to be “trying to close his bag while still running, rather than stopping to do so”. Petersson said Engström subsequently “changed his story many times”, but was inexplicably dismissed by police as a serious suspect as early as May 1987. “Had the current investigating team been in place 34 years ago, I think he would have been detained,” Petersson said. “In my view, there was sufficient evidence for him to be remanded in custody. That would have given us a reasonable chance to search his office and home, examine his clothing, maybe find the weapon. Unfortunately, we cannot now do that because he is deceased.” The prosecutor said investigators believed Engström acted alone, but could not rule out the possibility of a broader plot. He also said there was “no clear information placing a weapon in Engström’s hands” but he “must have had one that night.” Palme, who was prime minister between 1969 and 1976 and again from 1982 until his death, was a controversial, sometimes divisive figure both at home and abroad. A Social Democrat and passionate orator, he was vocal in his opposition to the US war in Vietnam, publicly supported left-wing governments in Cuba and Nicaragua and was fiercely critical of the apartheid regime in South Africa. He is viewed by his supporters as one of the architects of Sweden’s modern welfare state, but was often at loggerheads with big business and the military, and frequently spoke out against nuclear power. • This article was amended on 12 June 2020 to clarify the nature of the governments in Cuba and Nicaragua supported by Palme."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/mar/28/russia-ukraine-war-latest-news-zelenskiy-putin-live-updates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-29T04:08:14Z","webTitle":" Zelenskiy says he had a ‘very active diplomatic day’ with world leaders – as it happened ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/mar/28/russia-ukraine-war-latest-news-zelenskiy-putin-live-updates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/mar/28/russia-ukraine-war-latest-news-zelenskiy-putin-live-updates","fields":{"headline":" Zelenskiy says he had a ‘very active diplomatic day’ with world leaders – as it happened ","bodyText":"Thanks for following today’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. We have moved our liveblog to the link below. It is approaching 7am in Ukraine in the second month of the war in Ukraine. Here is a comprehensive rundown on where the situation currently stands: Face-to-face peace talks between Ukraine and Russia are likely to start in Turkey today after negotiators arrived in Istanbul for their first face-to-face peace talks in more than two weeks. Both sides have played down the chances of a major breakthrough and a senior US official said Vladimir Putin did not appear ready to compromise. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his nightly address that he had had a “very active diplomatic day” after speaking with British prime minister Boris Johnson, Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau, German chancellor Olaf Scholz, Italian prime minister Mario Draghi and the president of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev. Zelenskiy also urged for sanctions packages to be “effective and substantial” and called for countries to keep supplying weapons to Ukraine. “Ukrainians should not die just because someone cannot find enough courage to hand over the necessary weapons to Ukraine,” he said. “Fear always makes you an accomplice.” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia feels it is “amongst war” with the west after an array of sanctions were imposed on Russian businesses and individuals. Referencing Russia’s ongoing tension with Nato, Peskov told broadcaster PBS: “For a couple of decades, we were telling the collective west that we are afraid of your Nato’s moving eastwards. We too are afraid of Nato getting closer to our borders with its military infrastructure. Please take care of that. Don’t push us into the corner. No.” Peskov added “no one is thinking about using” or “even about [the] idea of using a nuclear weapon”. Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich and a Ukrainian peace negotiator suffered symptoms consistent with poisoning earlier this month, according to a source with direct knowledge of the incident. Abramovich was taking part in informal peace negotiations in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, early in March when he began to feel ill, the source told the Guardian. Ukrainian MP Rustem Umerov was also part of the negotiation. UK military intelligence says that Russia is expected to send more than 1,000 mercenaries into eastern Ukraine as they continue to suffer heavy losses. Russia’s private military company, the Wagner group, has already deployed to eastern Ukraine and is expected to send more than 1,000 mercenaries, including senior officials in the organisation, according to the Ministry of Defence. Kyiv sees no signs on the ground that Russia has given up a plan to surround the Ukrainian capital, Ukrainian defence ministry spokesperson Oleksander Motuzyanyk said. “For now we don’t see the movement of enemy forces away from Kyiv,” he said in a televised briefing. Ukraine’s general staff of the armed forces claimed Russian troops are “weakened, disoriented” and “cut off from logistics and the main forces”. Ukrainian forces have seized back full control of the town of Irpin, a few miles from Kyiv. The area’s mayor, Oleksandr Markushyn. said Irpin had been “liberated” and that Russian soldiers were “offering to surrender”. The United States cannot confirm who is in control of the city of Irpin, a senior US defence official said. Russian soldiers who seized the site of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster drove unprotected through a highly toxic zone called the “Red Forest”, kicking up clouds of radioactive dust, Chernobyl workers told Reuters. The two sources said they had witnessed Russian tanks and other armoured vehicles moving through the Red Forest, which is the most radioactively contaminated part of the zone around Chernobyl. Almost 5,000 people, including about 210 children, have been killed in the devastated city of Mariupol since Russia invaded Ukraine last month, a spokesperson for the mayor said. Vadym Boichenko said Mariupol was on the verge of a humanitarian catastrophe and must be completely evacuated, with about 160,000 civilians were trapped in the city without power. Ukraine’s economy minister, Yulia Svyrydenko, said the war has so far cost the country $564.9bn (£429.3bn) in terms of damage to infrastructure, lost economic growth and other factors. Eight thousand kilometres (4,970 miles) of roads and 10m sq metres of housing have been damaged or destroyed as a result of fighting, she said in an online post. Video footage purporting to show the torture of Russian prisoners of war is being investigated by the Ukrainian government. The film, which has not been verified, appears to show Ukrainian soldiers removing three hooded Russians from a van before shooting them in the legs. US president Joe Biden said he will “make no apologies” after appearing to call for Putin’s removal last week. When asked by a reporter if he regretted saying that Putin should not remain in power, Biden said: “I wasn’t then, nor am I now, articulating a policy change. I was expressing moral outrage that I felt.” Britain’s foreign secretary, Liz Truss, accused Putin’s forces of abducting innocent civilians, describing the move as an “abhorrent tactic” after Ukrainian human rights group, ZMINA, claimed to have identified dozens of individuals who had been abducted, with thousands more deported to Russia. Earlier, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said his people should not die just because someone cannot find enough courage to hand over the necessary weapons to Ukraine. “Fear always makes you an accomplice”, he said. ‘If someone is afraid of Russia ... it makes these people responsible for the catastrophe created by Russian troops in our cities, too”. Zelenskiy was lost for words at the thought that some countries were waiting for Russia to use chemical weapons before putting an embargo on Russia oil exports. “Waiting for chemical weapons”, he said. “We, living people, have to wait? Doesn’t everything that the Russian military is doing and has already done deserve an oil embargo?” Thousands of Ukrainians continue to use subway stations as makeshift bomb shelters. Many sleep just inches away from railway tracks. Peskov described recent sanctions as a war against Russia in trade. Unfortunately, those conditions, they are quite unfriendly. And they are enemy, enemy-like for us. We entered the phase, the phase of a total war. And we in Russia, we will feel ourselves amongst war, because Western European countries, United States, Canada, Australia, they actually — they actually — they are leading war against us in trade, in economy, in seizing our properties, in seizing our funds, in blocking our financial relations. And we have to adapt ourselves to new reality. You have to understand Russia. You have to understand Russia.” Referencing Russia’s ongoing tension with Nato, Peskov said: For a couple of decades, we were telling the collective west that we are afraid of your Nato’s moving eastwards. We too are afraid of Nato getting closer to our borders with its military infrastructure. Please take care of that. Don’t push us into the corner. No. Now we said, listen, guys, we are not happy with this coup in Ukraine. And you have guarantees by Poland, by France and by Germany. You would probably remember the document with the signatures of the relevant foreign ministers. No reaction. Then, we said, listen, guys, we’re not happy with the possibility of Ukraine’s getting into Nato, because it will endanger us additionally, and it will ruin the balance of mutual deterrence in Europe. No reaction. Then we said, listen, guys, we want equal relationship. We want to take into account each other’s concerns. If you don’t into account our concerns, then we will be a little bit nervous. No reaction completely.” Regarding the possible stalemate emerging in Russia’s supply of gas to Europe after Vladimir Putin said he wants payment in rubles, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia is not “going to make a charity out of it”. PBS reporter Ryan Chilcote said it “looks like we have a stalemate here” and asked: “Will Russia turn off the tap? Will it cut off its gas exports to Europe if those countries refuse to pay for that gas in rubles?” Peskov replied: “I don’t know what is going to happen when they reject this possibility. So, as soon as we have the final decision, we will look what can be done. But, definitely, we are not going to make a charity out of it and to send gas free of charge to Western Europe.” When continued to be pressed, Peskov added: “No payment, no gas.” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said “no one is thinking about using” or “even about [the] idea of using a nuclear weapon” in an interview with PBS on Monday evening. Reporter Ryan Chilcote asked Peskov to clear up the confusion surrounding Russia’s position on a possible nuclear attack after the Russian official previously said that Russia would only use nuclear weapons if its very existence were threatened. “There’s still quite a bit of confusion about Russia’s position. We heard yet another official over the weekend, this time former President Dmitry Medvedev, say that Russia reserves the right to use nuclear weapons if it faces an existential threat, even if the other side has not employed nuclear weapons,” Chilcote said. “So could you please clarify for us what exactly would amount to an existential threat to Russia?” Peskov replied: Well, first of all, we have no doubt that all the objectives of our special military operation in Ukraine will be completed. We have no doubt about that. But any outcome of the operation, of course, is not a reason for usage of a nuclear weapon. We have a security concept that very clearly states that only when there is a threat for existence of the state in our country, we can use and we will actually use nuclear weapons to eliminate the threat or the existence of our country.” Peskov continued to clarify that the existence of the state and Russia’s “special military operation” in Ukraine “have nothing to do with each other” while reminding Chilcote that Putin previously warned different states not to interfere in the affairs between Ukraine and Russia during the operation. “He meant that he would use nuclear weapons? He was suggesting he would use nuclear weapons if a third party got involved in the conflict?” Chilcote pressed. “I don’t think so,” Peskov replied. Chilcote continued to push the Kremlin’s spokesperson, saying if he stuck to the dictionary definition of existential threat then “clearly, nothing that is taking place or that is even really, quite frankly, imaginable that could take place could reach that bar of threatening the existence of the Russian state.” “So, why not just clear this up right now? Why can’t you, on behalf of Russia, rule out the use of nuclear weapons in this conflict, right here?” Dmitry Peskov replied: “No one is thinking about using, about — even about idea of using a nuclear weapon.” Here are some of the latest images to come out of Ukraine today. On the outskirts of the capital, a woman looks up at the destruction of her home after a Russian missile plummeted through the roof near Brovary, Ukraine. In the city of Kyiv, a man rides a bicycle past a statue of Grand Princess Olga, covered in sandbags. In Mykolaiv, southern Ukraine, two people sit next to a wall of sandbags for protection against Russian shelling. And in Odesa, a couple says goodbye before boarding the train to Przemysl, Poland. Ukraine’s military has just released its latest operational report as of 10pm this evening, claiming Russian troops are “weakened, disoriented” and “cut off from logistics and the main forces”. “The command of the Russian occupying forces is trying to compensate for the decline in the combat potential of the enemy’s units by indiscriminate artillery fire and rocket-bomb attacks, thus destroying the infrastructure of Ukrainian cities,” officials from the general staff of the armed forces said. Ukrainian forces “continue to maintain the circular defence of the city of Mariupol and defend and deter the advance of the enemy in the Chernihiv region,” the report added. Ukrainian forces are also continuing to defend Kyiv and the settlements of Motyzhyn, Lisne, Kapitanivka and Dmytrivka, officials said. In case you missed Joe Biden’s earlier remarks regarding his comments in Warsaw, you can watch the video from his press conference below. During an appearance in Poland at the weekend, Biden said that Russian president Vladimir Putin “cannot remain in power”, which then prompted hurried efforts by other senior figures in the administration to play down the comment in the face of international criticism. However, Biden on Monday defended the unscripted remarks, saying it reflected his own moral outrage, not an administration policy shift. “I wasn’t then nor am I now articulating a policy change. I was expressing moral outrage that I felt and I make no apologies,” he said. Biden added that he was “not walking anything back” by clarifying the remark. Asked whether the remark would spur a negative response from Putin, Biden said: “I don’t care what he thinks ... He’s going to do what he’s going to do”. Britain’s foreign secretary has accused Putin’s forces of abducting innocent civilians, describing the move as an “abhorrent tactic”. Ukrainian human rights group, ZMINA, claimed to have identified dozens of individuals who had been abducted, with thousands more deported to Russia. Liz Truss condemned the “abhorrent tactic” and said Putin was resorting to “desperate measures” in statements released by PA Media. Putin continues to use abhorrent tactics against the Ukrainian people, including abducting innocent civilians. He is not achieving his objectives and is resorting to desperate measures. Putin must fail in Ukraine.” Truss, in a statement to the House of Commons, later told MPs: “We know that Putin is not serious about talks, he is still wantonly bombing innocent citizens across Ukraine and that is why we need to do more to ensure that he loses and we force him to think again. We must not just stop Putin in Ukraine but we must also look to the long term. We need to ensure that any future talks don’t end up selling Ukraine out or repeating the mistakes of the past.” ZMINA’s chief Tetiana Pechonchyk said: “Russia is detaining and disappearing civilians in an attempt to break the spirit of the Ukrainian people. Today we are publishing our first list of those who have been taken so the Kremlin knows the world is watching and will not allow them to come to harm. In total we have so far documented 39 cases of enforced disappearances and arbitrary detentions in the Ukrainian territories newly occupied by Russia.” Britain should use its leading role in the Ukraine war urgently to repair its relations with the EU by offering to help strengthen European security both via Nato and rapidly evolving EU defence plans, the director of Chatham House, Dr Robin Niblett, has proposed. That will require working more formally with Brussels on foreign policy and defence, including issues such as cyber, intelligence and disinformation, said Niblett, who heads Britain’s leading foreign policy thinktank. He said the move would not only strengthen Europe following “Vladimir Putin’s decision to rip up the post-cold war security arrangements in Europe”, but help indirectly to repair EU-UK economic trade relations. Read the full story by the Guardian’s diplomatic editor, Patrick Wintour, below. Amnesty International also accused Russia of committing war crimes in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol. The human rights organisation said it will soon release an in-depth report on the devastation caused by Russia’s assault on the city on the Sea of Azov. Amnesty’s Secretary-General Agnes Callamard made the announcement in a press conference in Johannesburg, as reported by the Associated Press. The siege of Mariupol, the denial of humanitarian evacuation and humanitarian escape for the population, and the targeting of civilians, according to Amnesty International’s investigation, amounts to war crimes.” The crisis in Ukraine right now, the invasion ... is not just any kind of violation of international law. It is an aggression. It is a violation of the UN charter of the kind that we saw when the US invaded Iraq.” Russia’s assault on Ukraine is “a repetition of what we have seen in Syria,” Amnesty International has said. Agnes Callamard, secretary general of the global rights watchdog, told Agence France-Presse: What is happening in Ukraine is a repetition of what we have seen in Syria. We are in the midst of deliberate attacks on civilian infrastructure,” she said, accusing Russia of turning humanitarian corridors into ‘death traps’. We see the same thing [in Ukraine], just as Russia did in Syria”. Amnesty’s director in Eastern Europe and Asia, Marie Struthers concurred, telling a separate briefing in Paris that researchers in Ukraine had “documented the use of the same tactics as in Syria and Chechnya, including attacks on civilians and the use of arms prohibited under international law. Comparing the besieged city of Mariupol, to Syrian city of Aleppo, bludgeoned by President Bashar al-Assad, with the help of Russian airpower, Callamard said the rights lobby group’s “observation at this point, is a rise in war crimes,” she said. Russia was the main backer of the Syrian governments in the war that erupted in March 2011. Wrapping up his late-night address, Zelenskiy urged other countries to act with courage. Ukrainians should not die just because someone cannot find enough courage to hand over the necessary weapons to Ukraine. Fear always makes you an accomplice. If someone is afraid of Russia, if he or she is afraid to make the necessary decisions that are important to us, in particular for us to get planes, tanks, necessary artillery, shells, it makes these people responsible for the catastrophe created by Russian troops in our cities, too. Because if you could save, you had to save.” Finally, Zelenskiy delivered some emphatic lines regarding sanctions imposed on Russia. Ukraine cannot and will not agree with the passive sanctions position of some entities towards Russia. There should be no ‘suspended’ sanctions packages - that if the Russian troops do something, then there will be some answer... We went through this story last year when we said that strong preventive sanctions against Russia were needed to prevent an invasion. The preventive package was not made. A full-scale war has begun. There are now many hints and warnings that sanctions will be tightened, such as an embargo on Russian oil supplies to Europe, if Russia uses chemical weapons. There are simply no words.” Zelenskiy continued to claim a tightening of sanctions now depends on Russia’s use of chemical weapons. Just think about what it all came down to. Waiting for chemical weapons... We, living people, have to wait… Doesn’t everything that the Russian military is doing and has already done deserve an oil embargo? Don’t phosphorus bombs deserve that? Do the shelled chemical production or nuclear power plant deserve that? Zelenskiy urged for sanctions packages to be “effective and substantial”. If the sanctions packages are weak or do not work enough, if they can be circumvented, it creates a dangerous illusion for the Russian leadership that they can continue to afford what they are doing now. And Ukrainians pay for it with their lives. Thousands of lives.” The Ukrainian president announced he would be creating a group of experts at the President’s Office - Ukrainian and international, who will “constantly analyse the sanctions against Russia” and what they influence. Our goal is for the sanctions to work as intended. And so that there is no possibility to circumvent them. This must be a goal for the whole democratic world, without exception. No exception... No one has the right to use the lives of Ukrainians to save any income in Russia or income common with Russia.” Zelenskiy also described a “very active diplomatic day” after speaking with British prime minister Boris Johnson, Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Italian prime minister Mario Draghi and the president of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev. We agreed with Britain to further support our defence and strengthen sanctions against the Russian Federation. Canada also supports a tougher response from the world to the catastrophe created by Russian troops in Ukrainian cities. In a conversation with German Chancellor Scholz, I also paid considerable attention to the need to increase sanction pressure on Russia. Italy has agreed to become one of the guarantors of Ukraine’s security in the relevant new system of guarantees that we are elaborating.” Zelenskiy said he will continue with talks tomorrow and during the week will speak in the parliaments of Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, Greece and Australia. “It is important that these are speeches not only in front of politicians, but also in front of societies,” he said. “In front of millions of people who want to hear Ukraine and are ready to hear it to help and support. Who feel that we are fighting for our common freedom. One for all people on our Earth.” Hello, it’s Samantha Lock with you as my colleague Maanvi Singh signs off. In what has become a wartime signature for the Ukrainian president, Zelenskiy has given another late-night national address. Noting his country’s military successes over the past day, Zelenskiy said Ukrainian forces liberated Irpin, are advancing in the Kyiv region and are regaining control over Ukrainian territory. “The occupiers are pushed away from Irpin. Pushed away from Kyiv,” he said adding that “it is too early to talk about security in this part of our region. The fighting continues.” Describing the situation in and around the capital, Kyiv, Zelenskiy said: Russian troops control the north of Kyiv, have the resources and manpower. They are trying to restore the destroyed units. The level of their losses, even at 90%, is not an argument for them to stop. Hundreds and hundreds of units of burned and abandoned enemy equipment do not convince them that this will happen to everyone.” Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv regions, Donbas, southern Ukraine - the situation everywhere remains tense, very difficult.” The besieged southern city of Mariupol “remains blocked”, Zelenskiy confirmed adding that “Russian troops did not allow any humanitarian corridor to be organised today”. Face-to-face peace talks between Ukraine and Russia are likely to start in Turkey on Tuesday. As negotiators arrived in Istanbul for their first face-to-face peace talks in more than two weeks, both sides played down the chances of a major breakthrough and a senior US official said Vladimir Putin did not appear ready to compromise. Ukrainian forces have seized back full control of the town of Irpin, a few miles from Kyiv, the local mayor said. Mayor Oleksandr Markushyn said Irpin had been “liberated” and that Russian soldiers were “offering to surrender”. The United States cannot confirm who is in control of the city of Irpin, a senior US defence official said. The billionaire Roman Abramovich and a Ukrainian peace negotiator suffered symptoms consistent with poisoning earlier this month, according to a source with direct knowledge of the incident. Abramovich was taking part in informal peace negotiations in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, early in March when he began to feel ill, the source told the Guardian. Ukrainian MP Rustem Umerov was also part of the negotiation. Russian soldiers who seized the site of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster drove unprotected through a highly toxic zone called the “Red Forest”, kicking up clouds of radioactive dust, Chernobyl workers told Reuters. The two sources said they had witnessed Russian tanks and other armoured vehicles moving through the Red Forest, which is the most radioactively contaminated part of the zone around Chernobyl. Almost 5,000 people, including about 210 children, have been killed in the devastated city of Mariupol since Russia invaded Ukraine last month, a spokesperson for the mayor said. Mayor Vadym Boichenko said Mariupol was on the verge of a humanitarian catastrophe and must be completely evacuated, with about 160,000 civilians were trapped in the city without power. Kyiv sees no signs on the ground that Russia has given up a plan to surround the Ukrainian capital, Ukrainian defence ministry spokesperson Oleksander Motuzyanyk said. “For now we don’t see the movement of enemy forces away from Kyiv,” he said in a televised briefing. Ukraine’s economy minister, Yulia Svyrydenko, said the war has so far cost Ukraine $564.9bn (£429.3bn) in terms of damage to infrastructure, lost economic growth and other factors. Eight thousand kilometres (4,970 miles) of roads and 10m sq metres of housing have been damaged or destroyed as a result of fighting, she said in an online post. President Zelenskiy accused Russian authorities of disrespect towards the families of their own dead soldiers. Criticising Moscow for not agreeing on a scheme to have the remains of those killed in action returned to Russia, Zelenskiy claimed the Kremlin was affording less respect to those killed during its invasion of Ukraine than is usually given to dead pets. Novaya Gazeta, one of Russia’s last remaining independent news outlets, has said it will suspend operations after it received a second warning from the state censor for allegedly violating the country’s “foreign agent” law. The warning came a day after its editor-in-chief, Dmitry Muratov, spoke with Zelenskiy in a group interview with Russian journalists that was quickly banned by the state media watchdog, Roskomnadzor. Video footage purporting to show the torture of Russian prisoners of war is being investigated by the Ukrainian government. The film, which has not been verified, appears to show Ukrainian soldiers removing three hooded Russians from a van before shooting them in the legs. US president Joe Biden said he will “make no apologies” after calling for Putin’s removal last week. When asked by a reporter if he regretted saying that Putin should not remain in power, Biden said: “I wasn’t then, nor am I now, articulating a policy change. I was expressing moral outrage that I felt.” Earlier today, Ukraine experienced a large cyberattack against telecom provider Ukrtelecom. The State Special Communications Service of Ukraine (SSSCIP Ukraine) reported that Russian forces had launched an attack against Ukrtelecom, Ukraine’s singular telephone company. UK military intelligence says that Russia is expected to send more than 1,000 mercenaries into eastern Ukraine amid heavy losses. Russia’s private military company, the Wagner group, has already deployed to eastern Ukraine and is expected to send more than 1,000 mercenaries, including senior officials in the organisation, tweeted the Ministry of Defence. – Léonie Chao-Fong, Gloria Oladipo A political gaffe, Michael Kinsley wrote, “is when a politician tells the truth – some obvious truth he isn’t supposed to say”. President Joe Biden, a self-proclaimed “gaffe machine”, did not fail to deliver at the weekend by declaring that the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, “cannot remain in power”. A Freudian slip, perhaps, from a US president who has already called Mr Putin a “butcher” and a “murderous dictator”. But regime change in Russia is not official US policy – and nor should it be, given the nuclear, chemical and biological weapons Mr Putin possesses. The uproar caused by Mr Biden’s comment led to it being walked back by the White House. This was the mature and correct way for Washington to proceed. Mr Biden had made the unfortunate comment on the eve of peace talks between Russia and Ukraine. Progress has been slow. But the US president’s statement threatened to bring negotiations to a halt. If Mr Biden’s words had not been withdrawn, Mr Putin’s worst fears – that the US wanted him gone – would be confirmed. The Russian president, who has hitherto shown no restraint, would have no reason to compromise, with everything to lose. The Roman statesman Cicero thought that the purpose of war was peace. The Ukrainian army has bravely fought Russian forces to a standstill, but cannot retake the ground it has lost. Mr Putin’s blitzkrieg to topple the Kyiv government failed. There’s no end in sight for the first major European conflict this century. Ukraine is fighting a just war of self-defence. Russia is engaged in an unjust war of aggression. Cicero believed that “an unjust peace is better than a just war”. But terms of peace that were too favourable to Russia would simply be an agreement for further fighting. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has adopted a twin-track strategy to deal with Moscow. He is softening his diplomatic position – telling Russian journalists that Ukraine could be neutral and compromise over the status of the eastern Donbas region as part of a peace deal – while hardening his military position by calling for more tanks, missiles and even fighter jets from Nato. Mr Zelenskiy wants to secure as much sovereignty and autonomy as possible. He deserves our support. Mr Putin does not appear to be taking the talks anywhere near as seriously as Ukraine is. This might explain Mr Zelenskiy’s call for a face-to-face meeting with Mr Putin. The Russian president does not want to be seen to lose. Mr Putin has become drunk on his success in extending his influence across the former Soviet republics and in the Middle East. Yet his immoral and illegal war in Ukraine has galvanised Nato and united the EU. Mr Putin has made real what he most feared: a Ukraine proudly distinct from Russia in which liberals and nationalists have found common cause. Read more: Analysis: There is a murky history behind the apparent targeting of Roman Abramovich and two Ukrainian negotiators An alleged poisoning targeting, apparently, one of the country’s best known international figures. Such a story could only really involve Russia, the state accused of being behind dozens of poisonings over the past century. The plot, in its initial telling, appears bizarre: Roman Abramovich, now the outgoing owner of Chelsea FC, and Ukrainian negotiators engaged in back channel talks were targeted after a meeting in Kyiv – developing symptoms including peeling skin, irritable eyes and were, it is said, painful tears. Can we be sure they were poisoned? Not really; the three men were too busy to provide samples to German toxicologists quickly enough. And their symptoms, never life-threatening, appear to have improved. So like a true Russian mystery, the truth may never be known. But the Kremlin has enough form in this area for poisoning to be a plausible cause, a 100-year history that dates back to the founding of Moscow’s Lab X poisoning laboratory by Vladimir Lenin back in 1921. Names, leaders and possibly ideologies may have changed over the intervening period, but the current regime of Vladimir Putin is accused of being behind multiple poisonings of those who opposed the Kremlin, including the use of the nerve agent novichok. The FSB is accused of trying to kill opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who collapsed on an internal flight in August 2020 and only survived because he was able to get to specialists in Germany for treatment. It was administered, an FSB agent later inadvertently revealed to Navalny himself, in the “inner seams” of his underpants. A couple of years before that, two agents from GRU military intelligence took a trip to Salisbury, although they had no intention of admiring the city’s 123-metre-high cathedral spire, as they later claimed. Novichok, carried in a disguised perfume bottle, was sprayed on the door handle of the house of defector and former colleague Sergei Skripal. It was March 2018 and Sergei’s daughter Yulia was visiting. A few hours after the agents had visited, the two were found on a park bench in the centre of the Wiltshire city, foaming at the mouth and drifting in and out of consciousness. They were lucky to survive. Like Navalny, they were able to receive timely treatment and the dose was not large. Not so fortunate was Dawn Sturgess, a Briton, whose partner found the discarded perfume bottle in a bin and gave it to her thinking it was a gift. After spraying it on her wrists in July 2018, she fell ill within 15 minutes and died a few days later. Read more: Here’s a report from the Observer’s Mark Townsend on how the Wagner group’s mercenaries have been linked to white supremacists and other far-right groups: Russian mercenaries fighting in Ukraine, including the Kremlin-backed Wagner Group, have been linked to far-right extremism including an organisation designated by the US as terrorist, analysis reveals. Although Vladimir Putin says his “special military operation” is aimed at the “denazification” of Ukraine, an investigation has found links between pro-Russian forces and violent rightwing extremism, including those directly affiliated with Wagner. One post on the messaging app Telegram, dated 15 March, shows the flag of the Russian Imperial Movement (RIM), a white-supremacist paramilitary organisation which the US lists as terrorist, allegedly flown by Moscow-backed separatists in Donetsk. The post was shared by a pro-Putin channel. Much of the extremist content, posted on Telegram and the Russian social media platform VKontakte (VK), relates to a far-right unit within the Wagner Group called Rusich with others linked to pro-Kremlin online communities, some bearing the name and logo of Wagner Group. Adam Hadley, the executive director of Tech Against Terrorism, a London-based initiative supported by the UN counter-terrorism executive directorate, said their analysis indicated that Russian-backed forces in Ukraine, including the Wagner Group, are “almost certainly connected with extreme far-right organisations”. Read the full article here. UK military intelligence says that Russia is expected to send more than 1,000 mercenaries into eastern Ukraine amid heavy losses. Russia’s private military company, the Wagner group, has already deployed to eastern Ukraine and is expected to send more than 1,000 mercenaries, including senior officials in the organisation, tweeted the Ministry of Defence. Wagner group personnel have reportedly been pulled from separate missions in Syria and other parts of Africa as Ukraine remains prioritized. A collective of journalists working in Ukraine have asked president Zelenskiy and other Ukrainian officials to end harassment of journalists in the country and provide transparent rules for covering Russian shelling. The statement, which was published on the Institute of Mass Information’s website, says: We, Ukrainian and foreign journalists, as well as media organisations and NGOs, demand that all measures be taken immediately to end the harassment of journalists who are Ukraine’s greatest allies in this war. We also demand to involve qualified technical specialists and to develop transparent rules for the coverage of Russian shelling. The contribution of journalists is extremely valuable for Ukraine. It is through their work that the world and the citizens of Ukraine learn about Russia’s crimes, about the humanitarian catastrophe they caused, and about the destruction and victims of the Russian shelling. It is thanks to the free and unhindered work of foreign journalists that the world now supports Ukraine. Instead, the Russian dictatorship is making every effort to exterminate independent journalists and newsrooms. Due to systematic unsubstantiated statements by officials and official structures, the society began to see betrayal and “adjustment of fire” in the work of all journalists without exception, which is extremely harmful for Ukraine. We call for immediate resolution of key issues which are necessary to improve the situation with the work of journalists in Ukraine. 1. Settle the issue of accreditation of journalists from the Ministry of Defence. Explain to the Territorial Defence Units and the Security Service of Ukraine on the ground what this accreditation means. If journalists are required to provide additional documents to confirm the MoD’s accreditation, indicate what these documents should be in order to remove questions to journalists. 2. Stop the practice of “manual mode” of journalists’ access to filming locations. Army generals must solve combat tasks, not spend their precious time on micromanagement of film crews on the ground. 3. Involve technical specialists and finally resolve the issue of coverage of artillery and missile shelling and places of destruction. Allow journalists to work on the spot immediately after the shelling, but, if necessary, impose an embargo on the publication of information after the shelling. The decision to not cover the shelling should be reasoned by experts and transparent. 4. Settle issues related to the coverage of humanitarian aid distribution points, bomb shelters, the life of peaceful cities, etc. We remind you that information about these places is publicly available, and on the contrary, the authorities and activists ask the media to disseminate it to inform citizens. 5. Provide all possible assistance to the work of Ukrainian journalists, on a par with foreign media, and end “double standards” in relation to foreign and Ukrainian journalists. We call on the parties to engage in dialogue and build transparent rules for the work of journalists in Ukraine. In order for Ukraine to win, it is very important to build the most favourable conditions for the work of a free press, as much as possible in conditions of war. The full statement is also available here. Earlier today, Ukraine experienced a large cyberattack against telecom provider Ukrtelecom. The State Special Communications Service of Ukraine (SSSCIP Ukraine) reported that Russian forces had launched a cyberattack against Ukrtelecom, Ukraine’s singular telephone company. SSSCIP chairman Yurii Shchyhol confirmed that the cyberattack has been neutralised and said that efforts were underway to resume service. Amid the cyberattack, Ukretelecom is not providing service to the majority of its private users and business clients to protect its network infrastructure and continue providing service to the Ukraine army. 1,009 people were evacuated from Ukrainian cities via humanitarian corridors today, reported Reuters citing a senior Ukrainian official. A total of 1,099 people were evacuated from Ukrainian cities through humanitarian corridors on Monday, a senior official said. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of the president’s office, said in an online post that 586 people had left the besieged the city of Mariupol by car and 513 were evacuated by bus in the Luhansk region.

Moscow and Kyiv are discussing a pause in hostilities as part of a possible deal that would involve Ukraine abandoning its drive for Nato membership in exchange for security guarantees and the prospect to join the EU, the people said under the condition of anonymity because the matter is not yet finalised. The draft ceasefire document does not contain any discussion of three of Russia’s initial core demands — “denazification”, “demilitarisation”, and legal protection for the Russian language in Ukraine — the people added. Envoys from both sides meet in Istanbul on Tuesday in a fourth round of peace talks designed to end president Vladimir Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The concessions on Russia’s side come as its month-long ground offensive has largely stalled as a result of fiercer Ukrainian resistance than expected and Russian operational deficiencies. But Ukraine and its western backers remain sceptical of Putin’s intentions, worrying that the Russian president could be using the talks as a smokescreen to replenish his exhausted forces and plan a fresh offensive. David Arakhamia, head of Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky’s party in parliament and a member of Kyiv’s negotiating team, told the FT the parties were close to agreement on the security guarantees and Ukraine’s EU bid but urged caution about prospects for a breakthrough. “All the issues” have been “on the table since the beginning” of negotiations but “lots of points — like in every single item there are unresolved points”, Arakhamia said.

When asked by a reporter if he regretted saying that Putin should not remain in power, Biden said: I’m not walking anything back … I wasn’t then, nor am I now, articulating a policy change. I was expressing moral outrage that I felt and I make no apologies for it. Biden added: “Nobody believes I was talking about taking down Putin … nobody believes that. I was expressing my outrage at the behavior of this man.” Previously, while making a speech in Poland, Biden said that Putin “cannot remain in power.” US officials quickly amended Biden’s comments, saying that Biden was not calling for regime change in Russia. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, in turn, responded to Biden’s earlier remarks saying: “This [Putin remaining in power] is not to be decided by Mr Biden. It should only be a choice of the people of the Russian Federation.” Ukraine’s foreign minister reiterated today that Ukraine’s most ambitious goal ahead of peace talks with Russia this week is to agree to a ceasefire, reported Reuters. While answering questions about the scope of upcoming peace negotiations, Dmytro Kuleba said: The minimum programme will be humanitarian questions, and the maximum programme is reaching an agreement on a ceasefire. The latest peace talks between Russia and Ukraine will likely begin tomorrow in Turkey. Ukraine has proof that Russian forces used banned cluster bombs in two southern regions of the country, reported AFP. Ukraine prosecutor general Iryna Venediktova told reporters today that while Ukraine officials did not have proof that Russian forces used cluster bombs on Kyiv, they had proof that cluster bombs were used in the Odesa and Kherson regions. “We have proof of the utilisation of cluster bombs in the Odesa region and in the Kherson area,” said Venediktova. Venediktova also added, without providing further details: But … I can only mention instances where I have very concrete proof, for example … when I have (bomb) fragments or soil samples and analyses … Human rights groups such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have also said that they have proof that, during the Ukraine invasion, Russia used cluster bombs in areas where civilians were present. Cluster bombs spread dozens of tiny explosive charges in an area. Some of the explosives may not immediately explode and, in effect, become anti-personnel mines that pose a threat to civilians after a conflict ends, said AFP. A 1997 UN treaty concluded that the use of anti-personnel mines was banned. Though Russia and the US never signed, Ukraine did. UK prime minister Boris Johnson says that the UK will continue to help Ukraine defend itself while commenting on talks he had today with Ukraine president Zelenskiy. From Boris Johnson’s twitter: President [Zelenskiy] updated me today on the humanitarian situation in Mariupol, as well as the current negotiations with Russia. The UK will continue to step up our efforts to help Ukraine defend itself from aggression. The governor of Ukraine’s Rivne region said that an oil depot has been hit by a rocket strike, reports Reuters. During a short video address, Vitaliy Koval, head of Rivne regional administration, said that the oil tanks had been struck by Russian forces, reported Euromaidan Press. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, spoke today about the unity between Ireland and Ukraine during Russia’s ongoing invasion, following a conversation he had today with Ireland’s foreign minister. From Dmytro Kuleba’s twitter: Spoke with Irish foreign minister [Simon Coveney] Ireland remains our dedicated partner and friend. Grateful for Ireland’s active stance and comprehensive support within the EU, as well as taking care of Ukrainian citizens. Discussed efforts to put an end to Russia’s brutal war against Ukraine. The UK will increase its economic pressure on Russia, said UK prime minister Boris Johnson to Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy today, Reuters has reported. “The prime minister reiterated the UK would maintain and strengthen economic pressure on Putin’s regime,” said Johnson’s office in a readout of the call between the two world leaders. “President Zelenskiy provided an update on negotiations and the two leaders agreed to coordinate closely in the days ahead.” Johnson and Zelenskiy’s conversation comes ahead of face-to-face peace talks between Russia and Ukraine that will likely begin on Tuesday in Turkey. It is 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where things stand now: Face-to-face peace talks between Ukraine and Russia are likely to start in Turkey on Tuesday. As negotiators arrived in Istanbul for their first face-to-face peace talks in more than two weeks, both sides played down the chances of a major breakthrough and a senior US official said Vladimir Putin did not appear ready to compromise. Ukrainian forces have seized back full control of the town of Irpin, a few miles from Kyiv, the local mayor said. Mayor Oleksandr Markushyn said Irpin had been “liberated” and that Russian soldiers were “offering to surrender”. The United States cannot confirm who is in control of the city of Irpin, a senior US defence official said. The billionaire Roman Abramovich and a Ukrainian peace negotiator suffered symptoms consistent with poisoning earlier this month, according to a source with direct knowledge of the incident. Abramovich was taking part in informal peace negotiations in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, early in March when he began to feel ill, the source told the Guardian. Ukrainian MP Rustem Umerov was also part of the negotiation. Russian soldiers who seized the site of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster drove unprotected through a highly toxic zone called the “Red Forest”, kicking up clouds of radioactive dust, Chernobyl workers told Reuters. The two sources said they had witnessed Russian tanks and other armoured vehicles moving through the Red Forest, which is the most radioactively contaminated part of the zone around Chernobyl. Almost 5,000 people, including about 210 children, have been killed in the devastated city of Mariupol since Russia invaded Ukraine last month, a spokesperson for the mayor said. Mayor Vadym Boichenko said Mariupol was on the verge of a humanitarian catastrophe and must be completely evacuated, with about 160,000 civilians were trapped in the city without power. Kyiv sees no signs on the ground that Russia has given up a plan to surround the Ukrainian capital, Ukrainian defence ministry spokesperson Oleksander Motuzyanyk said. “For now we don’t see the movement of enemy forces away from Kyiv,” he said in a televised briefing. Ukraine’s economy minister, Yulia Svyrydenko, said the war has so far cost Ukraine $564.9bn (£429.3bn) in terms of damage to infrastructure, lost economic growth and other factors. Eight thousand kilometres (4,970 miles) of roads and 10m sq metres of housing have been damaged or destroyed as a result of fighting, she said in an online post. President Zelenskiy accused Russian authorities of disrespect towards the families of their own dead soldiers. Criticising Moscow for not agreeing on a scheme to have the remains of those killed in action returned to Russia, Zelenskiy claimed the Kremlin was affording less respect to those killed during its invasion of Ukraine than is usually given to dead pets. Novaya Gazeta, one of Russia’s last remaining independent news outlets, has said it will suspend operations after it received a second warning from the state censor for allegedly violating the country’s “foreign agent” law. The warning came a day after its editor-in-chief, Dmitry Muratov, spoke with Zelenskiy in a group interview with Russian journalists that was quickly banned by the state media watchdog, Roskomnadzor. Video footage purporting to show the torture of Russian prisoners of war is being investigated by the Ukrainian government. The film, which has not been verified, appears to show Ukrainian soldiers removing three hooded Russians from a van before shooting them in the legs. That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, for today as I hand over the blog to my colleague Gloria Oladipo. See you tomorrow. EU ministers have unanimously endorsed a 10-point plan to create registration and co-ordination hubs for people fleeing Ukraine into Europe, at a meeting of home affairs and justice ministers on Monday. Since Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February, 3.8 million people, half of them children, have arrived in Europe. Some 800,000 have so far applied for temporary protection. EU member states, particularly the countries bordering Ukraine, have put in place reception capacities. Ukrainian refugees have the right to live and work in the EU for three years under an emergency plan, the temporary protection directive (TPD) agreed earlier this month in response to Europe’s biggest refugee crisis this century. The EU has also provided support to the most affected member states through its civil protection mechanism and EU agencies, and is working to unlock additional funds to provide emergency support. The arrivals to the EU are slowing, with 200,000 people per day initially, down to 40,000 per day. Poland has the most, at 1.5 million. The United States cannot confirm who is in control of the city of Irpin, west of Kyiv, a senior US defence official said. The official said Ukrainian forces have retaken the town of Trostyanets from the Russians, and are also actively attempting to seize control of Kherson. From the Washington Post’s Dan Lamothe: Irpin mayor Oleksandr Markushin earlier announced that the city, which has been under heavy attack since the early days of the invasion, had been “liberated” from Russian forces. Russian soldiers who seized the site of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster drove unprotected through a highly toxic zone called the “Red Forest”, kicking up clouds of radioactive dust, Chernobyl workers said. The soldiers drove their armoured vehicles without any anti-radiation gear, according to two sources who spoke to Reuters. Both were on duty when Russian tanks entered Chernobyl on 24 February and took control of the site. The two Chernobyl employees said they had witnessed Russian tanks and other armoured vehicles moving through the Red Forest, which is the most radioactively contaminated part of the zone around Chernobyl. One of the Chernobyl employees said it was “suicidal” for the soldiers because the radioactive dust they inhaled was likely to cause internal radiation in their bodies. A vast area around Chernobyl is off-limits to anyone who does not work there or have special permission, but the Red Forest is considered so highly contaminated that even the nuclear plant workers are not allowed to go there. The Russian military convoy went through the zone, the two sources said. One of them said it used an abandoned road. One of the sources said: A big convoy of military vehicles drove along a road right behind our facility and this road goes past the Red Forest. The convoy kicked up a big column of dust. Many radiation safety sensors showed exceeded levels. Reuters could not independently verify their accounts. Asked about the accounts from Chernobyl staff, Russia’s defence ministry did not respond. Video footage purporting to show the torture of Russian prisoners of war is being investigated by the Ukrainian government. The film, which has not been verified, appears to show Ukrainian soldiers removing three hooded Russians from a van before shooting them in the legs. The Ukrainian military commander Gen Valerii Zaluzhnyi accused Russia of staging the videos. “The enemy produces and shares videos with the inhuman treatment of alleged ‘Russian prisoners’ by ‘Ukrainian soldiers’ in order to discredit the Ukrainian defence forces,” Zaluzhnyi said. However, the government in Kyiv said they were taking the allegations of mistreatment “very seriously” and that there would be an immediate investigation. Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said: We are a European army, and we do not mock our prisoners. If this turns out to be real, this is absolutely unacceptable behaviour. Arestovych added: I would like to remind all our military, civilian and defence forces once again that the abuse of prisoners is a war crime that has no amnesty under military law and has no statute of limitations. Oleksander Motuzyanyk, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian military, said they did not know who was involved or where the incidents took place. He said Currently, no one can confirm or deny the veracity of this video. It’s not known where it’s happening, or who the participants are. Carlsberg has said it will pull out entirely from Russia over the country’s invasion of Ukraine, hours after a similar announcement from Heineken. In a statement, Carlsberg said: We have taken the difficult and immediate decision to seek a full disposal of our business in Russia, which we believe is the right thing to do in the current environment. Upon completion we will have no presence in Russia. The decision to exit Russia would result in a “substantial non-cash impairment charge” this year, it said without providing further details. Carlsberg owns Russian brewer Baltika Brewery, whose employees represent a fifth of Carlberg’s global workforce. We deeply regret the consequences of this decision for our 8,400 employees in Russia. The billionaire Roman Abramovich and a Ukrainian peace negotiator suffered symptoms consistent with poisoning earlier this month, according a source with direct knowledge of the incident. Abramovich was taking part in informal peace negotiations in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, early in March when he began to feel ill, the source told the Guardian. Ukrainian MP Rustem Umerov was also part of the negotiation, and the men later left Ukraine for Poland, and then flew to Istanbul, where they received medical treatment. “It was during his first trip to Kyiv. Roman lost his sight for several hours. In Turkey, they were treated in a clinic, together with Rustem,” said the source. The account backs up the claims of a potential poisoning first reported in the Wall Street Journal and by the investigative journalism outlet Bellingcat. “Bellingcat can confirm that three members of the delegation attending the peace talks between Ukraine and Russia on the night of 3 to 4 March 2022 experienced symptoms consistent with poisoning with chemical weapons. One of victims was Russian entrepreneur Roman Abramovich,” wrote the outlet in a tweet. Bellingcat said the symptoms included eye and skin inflammation, and piercing pain in the eyes. “The three men experiencing the symptoms consumed only chocolate and water in the hours before the symptoms appeared. A fourth member of the team who also consumed these did not experience symptoms,” wrote Bellingcat, which said one of its investigators had been asked to provide an opinion on the incident by chemical weapons specialists. “Based on remote and on-site examinations, the experts concluded that the symptoms are most likely the result of international poisoning with an undefined chemical weapon,” said Bellingcat, Abramovich’s condition improved and he later returned to Kyiv to take part in another round of negotiations, said the source. A fourth round of negotiations between official Russian and Ukrainian delegations is due to begin in Istanbul on Tuesday. Asked for comment A spokesperson for the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said: “There is a lot of speculation at the moment, and we recommend to only follow official information.” Here’s more on that report in the Wall Street Journal that Roman Abramovich and Ukrainian peace negotiators suffered symptoms of suspected poisoning after a meeting in Kyiv. My colleague Shaun Walker has spoken with a source who said Abramovich “lost his sight for several hours”. The investigative journalism group, Bellingcat, confirmed that three members of the Ukrainian delegation experienced symptoms “consistent with poisoning with chemical weapons”. Almost 5,000 people, including about 210 children, have been killed in the devastated city of Mariupol since Russia invaded Ukraine last month, a spokesperson for the mayor said. It was not immediately clear how Vadym Boichenko had calculated the toll, Reuters reports. Meanwhile, Tetyana Lomakina, a Ukrainian presidential adviser, told AFP at least 5,000 people had died in Mariupol. About 5,000 people were buried, but the burials stopped 10 days ago because of continued shelling. She added that the death toll could only be estimated with bodies stuck under the rubble. We could be talking about 10,000 dead. Boichenko, who is no longer in Mariupol, earlier said that about 160,000 civilians were still trapped in the city. The situation in the city remains difficult. People are beyond the line of humanitarian catastrophe. We need to completely evacuate Mariupol. It is 7pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand now: Face-to-face peace talks between Ukraine and Russia are likely to start in Turkey on Tuesday, the Kremlin has said. Vladimir Putin, and his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, agreed on Sunday that ceasefire talks would be held in Istanbul, possibly beginning as early as the following day. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said today, however, that Tuesday was more likely. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said Ukraine is willing to discuss “neutral status” at face-to-face talks with Russia. In a video interview with independent Russian media outlets, Zelenskiy suggested he could make compromises about the status of the eastern Donbas region but he said he was not willing to discuss demilitarisation, and said Ukrainians would need to vote in a referendum to approve their country adopting a neutral status. Ukraine is not willing to sacrifice its “territorial integrity”, Alexander Rodnyansky, a senior adviser to the Ukrainian president, said. He told BBC Radio 4’s World at One programme that “now the pressure is on Russia” and suggested that a “more concrete” version of the “Budapest memorandum” - which gave Ukraine security assurances - would be necessary to secure peace. Ukrainian forces have seized back full control of the town of Irpin, a few miles from Kyiv, the local mayor said. Mayor Oleksandr Markushyn said Irpin had been “liberated” and that Russian soldiers were “offering to surrender”. The information could not immediately be verified. The southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol is on the verge of a humanitarian catastrophe and must be completely evacuated, its mayor said. Vadym Boichenko said about 160,000 civilians were trapped in the city without power. Twenty-six buses were waiting to evacuate civilians but Russian forces had not agreed to give them safe passage, he said Kyiv sees no signs on the ground that Russia has given up a plan to surround the Ukrainian capital, Ukrainian defence ministry spokesperson, Oleksander Motuzyanyk, said. “For now we don’t see the movement of enemy forces away from Kyiv,” he said in a televised briefing. Ukraine’s economy minister, Yulia Svyrydenko, said the war has so far cost Ukraine $564.9bn (£429.3bn) in terms of damage to infrastructure, lost economic growth and other factors.

Roman Abramovich and Ukrainian peace negotiators suffered symptoms of suspected poisoning after a meeting in the capital, Kyiv, earlier this month, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal. Abramovich and at least two senior members of the Ukrainian delegation developed symptoms that included “red eyes, constant and painful tearing”, the paper cites sources familiar with the matter. Hello. I’m Léonie Chao-Fong and I’ll continue to bring you the latest news from the war in Ukraine. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has accused Russian authorities of disrespect towards the families of their own dead soldiers, criticising Moscow for not agreeing on a scheme to have the remains of those killed in action returned to Russia, Shaun Walker and Pjotr Sauer report. Zelenskiy claimed the Kremlin was affording less respect to those killed during its invasion of Ukraine than is usually given to dead pets. We’ve all had a moment in our lives when someone has passed away, maybe not even close people or relatives. Listen: even when a dog or a cat dies, that’s just not how to behave. Zelenskiy said in an online interview with Russian journalists on Sunday evening. I’m saying this to you as the president of a country that is fighting with Russian soldiers … It’s a war, but they are not animals. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk, who is responsible for negotiations with Moscow on returning the remains, said that despite repeated offers for Russia to present lists of the missing and have them returned, officials in Moscow were more concerned about covering up the scale of the losses. She said she had spoken by telephone or Zoom to several Russian officials, including the deputy defence minister, Alexander Fomin, and Tatyana Moskalkova, the Kremlin’s ombudsman for human rights. The Russian authorities don’t want these bodies. I talked to her, and said: ‘Take your bodies away.’ She had no response. She just said: ‘We’ll work on it.’ Roman Abramovich and Ukrainian peace negotiators suffered symptoms of suspected poisoning after a meeting in the capital, Kyiv, earlier this month, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal. Abramovich and at least two senior members of the Ukrainian delegation developed symptoms that included “red eyes, constant and painful tearing”, the paper cites sources familiar with the matter. The paper said individuals familiar with the matter blamed the suspected attack on Moscow who they said wanted to sabotage talks to end the war. A person close to Abramovich said it wasn’t clear who had targeted the group, the WSJ said. Abramovich and the members of the Ukrainian delegation have since improved, the people said. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who has met with Abramovich, was not affected, they said. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said he discussed the progress of peace talks with Russia in a call with Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz. Zelenskiy earlier said he had spoken with the Italian prime minister, Mario Draghi, to “discuss the course of countering Russian aggression”. “We appreciate Italy’s willingness to join the creation of a system of security guarantees for Ukraine,” he said. Novaya Gazeta, one of Russia’s last remaining independent news outlets, has said it will cease operations until the end of the war in Ukraine after it received a second warning from the state censor for allegedly violating the country’s “foreign agent” law. The warning came a day after its editor-in-chief, Dmitry Muratov, spoke with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in a group interview with Russian journalists that was quickly banned by the state media watchdog, Roskomnadzor. Novaya Gazeta is one of the country’s most important independent publications. A number of its journalists have been killed since the 1990s in retaliation for their reporting, including on the war in Chechnya. The Roskomnadzor warning to Novaya Gazeta was allegedly prompted by the newspaper’s failure to identify a “foreign agent” in an unspecified publication. But it appeared to be an act of retaliation for the newspaper’s decision to report on the war and Muratov’s participation in the interview with Zelenskiy. In an effort to avoid being shut down, the newspaper announced its surprise decision to halt publications until the end of Russia’s “special operation”, the Kremlin’s official term for the invasion. “We have received another warning from Roskomnadzor,” Novaya Gazeta’s editorial board wrote in statement. Following this, we will suspend the publication of the newspaper online and in print until the end of the ‘special operation on the territory of Ukraine’. Residents of the besieged Ukrainian port city of Mariupol despair at the destruction they find when they return to inspect their homes. “What is left for us?” asks Valentina, whose home lies in ruins after Russian bombardment. The city’s mayor has warned that Mariupol is on the verge of a humanitarian catastrophe and must be evacuated, with about 160,000 civilians trapped in the city without power. Earlier we reported that Ukraine’s emergency services said a fuel depot in the north-western city of Lutsk had been struck by enemy shelling and caught fire. The attack was part of a volley of Russian missiles aimed at several cities across Ukraine on Sunday night, which struck the capital, Kyiv, as well as Kharkiv, Rivne and Zhytomyr. The head of the provincial military administration, Yuriy Pohuliaiko, said the attack in Lutsk had been carried out with cruise missiles launched from neighbouring Belarus. There were no immediate details about casualties. Ukrainian MP Lesia Vasylenko said the strikes on Sunday night were part of a new Russian strategy to take out Ukrainian oil and petrol reserves. Ukrainian forces have seized back full control of the town of Irpin, a few miles from Kyiv, the local mayor said. Irpin is a commuter town west of the capital that has seen heavy fighting and has come under intense Russian bombardment since the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine last month. In a video post on Telegram, local mayor Oleksandr Markushyn said: We have good news today - Irpin has been liberated. We understand that there will be more attacks on our town and we will defend it courageously. Markushyn spoke to CNN today: Irpin was freed last night. Now we need to clear the town totally. There are wounded Russian soldiers. They are offering to surrender or they will be destroyed. Irpin is a staging area for an attack. We will [next] liberate Bucha, Vorzel and Hostomel. The information could not immediately be verified. My colleague Shaun Walker has written about some of the last residents of Irpin, people who were too old, too frail or too sick to leave the town that has seen no gas, water or electricity and almost no medicine since early March. Ukraine is not willing to sacrifice its “territorial integrity”, a senior adviser to the Ukrainian president said, on the eve of further talks between Ukraine and Russia. Alexander Rodnyansky, an adviser to President Zelenskiy, told BBC Radio 4’s World at One programme that “now the pressure is on Russia”. He said: Clearly, they cannot sustain this war for years and their morale is so low they can’t even keep up their supplies and logistics. Ukraine would not sacrifice its “territorial integrity”, he added. If you ask the people who live in these areas, they wouldn’t want to live in Russia. How can we leave them? Let alone the whole idea of slicing up our country. Rodnyansky suggested that a “more concrete” version of the “Budapest memorandum” - which gave Ukraine security assurances - would be necessary to secure peace. Russia is preparing to restrict entry for citizens of “unfriendly” countries, which would include the UK, all EU countries and the United States, Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said. In a set of televised remarks, Lavrov said: A draft presidential decree is being developed on retaliatory visa measures in response to the ‘unfriendly’ actions of a number of foreign states. He added that the act would introduce “a number of restrictions on entry into Russia”, without elaborating. Russia expanded its list of “unfriendly” countries following the introduction of Western sanctions on Moscow. Countries that now belong on that list include the US, Australia, Canada, Britain, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, all EU member states and several others. Marichka Padalko, 46, is among a small coterie of TV news anchors with a platform to guide the country through the daily and nightly war developments while teasing out psychological advice from studio experts and offering practical tips on everything from shelter etiquette to surviving a chemical weapons attack. She became central to people’s lives when, two days after Vladimir Putin announced his “special military operation”, the four main channels on Ukrainian television decided to work together to create one 24/7 “marathon” news show. With journalists and technicians – particularly those with young families – fleeing the shelling, leaving channels understaffed and given the risk of a studio being hit by a Russian bomb, the peacetime professional rivals combined their efforts to guarantee the news would stay on air. The result is that Padalko, a host on 1+1, which was one of Ukraine’s biggest channels in peacetime, and a further 11 anchors who appear during any given 24-hour period, have a captive audience. “It is something like if BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 [came together]. Technically we’re not united. I mean, we are all in different locations, but all channels now have their own slot, six hours a day. Sometimes we are in the morning, sometimes at night,” she said. For the viewers, she said, the broadcasting teams were “somehow a symbol of normality or some connection to their previous life where they used to see us and we were part of the routine of their life”. Read more of Daniel Boffey’s piece from Lviv: ‘I love my job’: life as a Ukrainian TV news anchor and mother Our video team have just put up the clip of Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy saying during an interview with independent Russian journalists that Ukraine is willing to discuss neutrality as part of peace talks with Moscow. Our Moscow correspondent Andrew Roth has an explainer Q&amp;A asking will Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s interview with Russian media make a difference? Why did Zelenskiy choose to speak to the Russian press The Ukraine president has made several attempts to appeal directly to Russians about the war and has said repeatedly that they can best convince Putin to abandon his invasion of Ukraine. What has Zelenskiy put on the table? Zelenskiy has said that Ukraine is ready to discuss a “neutral status” with Russia, presumably one that would preclude the country from joining Nato, in exchange for security guarantees from attack in the future. This is not a new statement from Zelenskiy, but it nonetheless generated headlines as Ukraine and Russia go into a new round of negotiations in Istanbul this week. Zelenskiy also said that any agreement about “neutrality” would need to be confirmed in a nationwide referendum that would include Ukrainians who have been forced to flee the country. More than 10 million people have been displaced by the Russian invasion, according to some estimates. Read more of Andrew Roth’s analysis here: Will Zelenskiy’s interview with Russian media make a difference? The sale of a piece by Bristol-based street artist Banksy has raised £81,000 ($106,000) for a children’s hospital in Ukraine. All the money raised will be sent to the Ohmatdyt Children’s hospital in Kyiv. PA Media reports that an anonymous donor auctioned the 2005 work CND Soldiers via website MyArtBroker.com, which depicts two soldiers painting the symbol of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament on a wall. In a statement on its website, MyArtBroker’s managing director Charlotte Stewart said: “An incredibly generous client offered to sell their ever-relevant CND Soldiers print by Banksy. “With starting bids of £20,000, the highest bid has far exceeded our expectations at £81,000.” She continued: “Such extraordinary generosity from our seller could not have been better reciprocated by the winning bidder, whose donation of £81,000 will make an enormous difference to the lives of staff, children and their families in the weeks ahead.” A couple of travel related pieces of news here. Agence France-Presse are reporting that Sri Lanka’s national carrier has ended direct flights between Sri Lanka and Russia with immediate effect. The airline cited the spiralling cost of insuring the flights between Moscow and Colombo. Sri Lanka is heavily reliant on tourist income, and Russia is one of the island’s biggest source of tourists. Meanwhile, in another break of relations in Europe, Reuters is reporting that Russian Railways has said it has halted rail freight shipments to Finland. Finland’s national railway operator VR Group said it would no longer accept freight trains because of economic sanctions. Kyiv sees no signs on the ground that Russia has given up a plan to surround the Ukrainian capital, according to Ukrainian defence ministry spokesperson Oleksander Motuzyanyk. Reuters are carrying his remarks, made in a televised briefing. “According to our information, the Russian Federation has not abandoned its attempts, if not to capture, then to surround Kyiv. For now we don’t see the movement of enemy forces away from Kyiv,” he said. At the same time Reuters are reporting that Nikolai Patrushev, Secretary of the Security Council of Russia, has said that a change of government in Ukraine is not the goal of what he insisted on calling Russia’s “special operation”. A reminder that most observers have assumed that Russia’s goal has been to capture Kyiv and install a government friendlier to Moscow, while also potentially seizing control of Ukraine’s southern coast – hence the attacks on Odesa, Kherson and Mariupol – and opening up a land corridor in the east between the Crimea and the self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk. Heineken, the world’s second-largest brewer, said it will end its operations in Russia in a move that will cost the Dutch brewer €400m (£334m). The company said in a statement: We have concluded that Heineken’s ownership of the business in Russia is no longer sustainable nor viable in the current environment. As a result, we have decided to leave Russia. Heineken had previously said it would only halt new investment and exports to Russia. This latest announcement makes Heineken the first international brewing company to exit the country and is likely to increase pressure on its Danish rival, Carlsberg, which owns Russia’s biggest brewer, Baltika. The company added: We are shocked and deeply saddened to watch the war in Ukraine continue to unfold and intensify. Heineken said it would transfer its Russian business to a new owner, adding that it would not profit from any transfer of ownership. It added that its 1,800 Russian employees would be paid until the end of 2022. The UK’s Home Office has granted 21,600 visas to Ukrainians with family links in the UK, Downing Street said. As of 5pm Sunday, 76,200 applications had been opened through the family route of which 37,400 had been completed and submitted, the prime minister’s official spokesperson said. The UK government is due to start publishing figures for visas issued through the Homes for Ukraine scheme this week. Istanbul will host the next round of peace talks between Russian and Ukrainian negotiators, which could begin as soon as Tuesday, according to the Ukrainian MP and negotiator David Arakhamia. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, and the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, discussed the talks during a phone call yesterday, but did not state publicly when this week the talks would begin. Turkey has worked to position itself as a neutral ally to both Ukraine and Russia and a key diplomatic partner at the entrance to the Black Sea region. This includes hosting tripartite talks with the Ukrainian and Russian foreign ministers in the southern city of Antalya as well as the foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, conducting shuttle diplomacy during recent visits to Lviv and Moscow. Turkey viewed the talks as successful, despite a lack of progress around the main discussion point of humanitarian corridors, particularly for the besieged city of Mariupol. The opportunity to host both the Ukrainian and Russian negotiating teams represents a step up for Turkey’s involvement in negotiations, after the Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said that the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, came to Antalya earlier this month “to discuss but not decide”, adding he was surprised at Lavrov’s lack of authority to negotiate. The Times is also reporting that Roman Abramovich held backchannel talks with the Ukrainian MP and Crimean Tartar Rustem Umerov in Istanbul, calling Abramovich “President Putin’s unofficial envoy in talks with Ukraine”. The series of talks were coordinated by presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin, who reportedly proposed that “Crimea and Donbas should be held by Moscow under a long-term lease, similar to Britain’s control over Hong Kong from 1898 to 1997, with their future decided at a later date”, according to the Times. Finding a swift solution to the crisis in Ukraine is a critical issue for Turkey, due to its reliance on Russian gas as well as wheat from both countries amid a prolonged economic crisis in which the lira halved in value last year alone. The talks are occurring as the Ukrainian president, Vlodomyr Zelensky, told a group of Russian journalists that Ukraine was willing to discuss “security guarantees and neutrality”, in exchange for Russia withdrawing their forces. Kalin told local outlet Hurriyet last week that both sides were “close to agreement” on key issues, notably that Ukraine will not join Nato and “demilitarisation”. Novaya Gazeta, the Russian newspaper whose editor, Dmitry Muratov, was last year awarded the Nobel peace prize, has said it will suspend its activities until “the end of the special operation in Ukraine”. It comes after the newspaper received a second official warning from the Russian state communications watchdog, Roskomnadzor. Roskomnadzor said Novaya Gazeta failed to mark a non-governmental organisation mentioned in one of its stories as a “foreign agent” in accordance with Russian legislation. Footage posted on social media by the Ukrainian air reconnaissance unit, Aerorozvidka, purports to show its attacks on a 40-mile column of Russian armoured vehicles outside Kyiv. The unit’s commander, Lt Col Yaroslav Honchar, said the small team of 30 drone operators and special forces was able to halt the column’s advance in a series of night ambushes. Not all the details of these claims could be independently verified, but US defence officials have said Ukrainian attacks contributed to the halting of the armoured column. The amount of aerial combat footage published by Ukrainian forces underlines the importance of drones to their resistance. Germany has said individuals who display the letter “Z” to show support for Russia’s war in Ukraine could be liable to prosecution. The letter “Z” has been used as a marking on Russian military vehicles taking part in the conflict and has become the main symbol of public support for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. A spokesperson for the German interior ministry told reporters today: The letter Z as such is of course not forbidden, but its use may in individual cases constitute an endorsement of the Russian war of aggression. They added: The Russian war of aggression on the Ukraine is a criminal act, and whoever publicly approves of this war of aggression can also make himself liable to prosecution. The federal security authorities have an eye on this, and in this respect we welcome the announcement that several federal states will also examine in individual cases whether this could be a criminal act and to take action accordingly. The European Commission has called on governments to halt the sale of citizenship to investors and to suspend the sale of visas to Russians and Belarusians. The move comes amid concerns that people hit by EU sanctions over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine may be holders of EU golden visas or passports, Reuters reports. The European Commission said: Some Russian or Belarusian nationals who are subject to sanctions or are significantly supporting the war in Ukraine might have acquired EU citizenship or privileged access to the EU, including to travel freely in the Schengen area, under these schemes. Nearly 700 top politicians, business and military individuals accused of supporting the Kremlin have been blacklisted by the EU since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last month. Governments should check whether these sanctioned individuals were holding a golden passport or visa, the Commission said, and should determine whether to annul those passports or immediately withdraw residence permits. Ukraine’s economy minister, Yulia Svyrydenko, said the war has so far cost Ukraine $564.9bn (£429.3bn) in terms of damage to infrastructure, lost economic growth and other factors. Eight thousand kilometres (4,970 miles) of roads and 10m sq metres of housing have been damaged or destroyed as a result of fighting, she said in an online post. The Guardian could not independently verify these figures. The Kremlin has described a remark by Joe Biden calling for an end to Vladimir Putin’s rule of Russia as “alarming”, Reuters reports. On Saturday, while addressing a crowd in Warsaw, the US president cast Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a battle in a much broader conflict between democracy and autocracy, and said of the Russian president: For God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power. The White House attempted to clarify his remarks and Biden later said he had not been calling for regime change in his speech. Asked about Biden’s comment, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said today: This is a statement that is certainly alarming. He told reporters that Russia will continue to track Biden’s statements “in the most attentive way”. Hello. I’m Léonie Chao-Fong with you on the live blog today, I’ll be bringing you all the latest news from the war in Ukraine. Please feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. Ukraine’s ambassador to Germany has publicly rowed with the German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, over a solidarity concert featuring Ukrainian, Russian and Belarusian musicians. Steinmeier, who is in quarantine with a Covid-19 infection, on Sunday morning remotely opened a classical concert “for peace and freedom” by the Berlin Philharmonic at the presidential Bellevue Palace. The concert opened and closed with pieces by the 84-year-old Ukrainian composer Valentin Silvestrov, who has been living in exile in Berlin since 8 March after fleeing Kyiv. The programme also included compositions by Chopin, Shostakovich and Tchaikovsky. According to a report in Der Spiegel, the Ukrainian ambassador Andrij Melnyk had declined to attend the event last Tuesday, citing other commitments. In a tweet on Sunday, however, Melnyk explained his absence with political reasons: “Only Russian soloists, no Ukrainians”, the diplomat said. “An affront. Sorry, I’m keeping a distance.” A spokesperson for the German federal president responded with a series of tweets that seemed to mildly tick off the ambassador for his absence. The concert, she said, was meant as “a joint statement against the criminal Russian war against Ukraine”, adding “it is a shame that we couldn’t send this message together”. Melnyk replied: “My dear God, why is the federal president finding it so hard to realise that we Ukrainians don’t fancy ‘great Russian culture’ while Russian bombs are falling on cities and thousands of civilians are being murdered night and day?” Cautious German rhetoric around the war, at times favouring appeals for reconciliation rather than unequivocal statements of support, has frustrated politicians in Ukraine, eastern Europe and the Baltics since the start of the conflict. In an interview with the Economist magazine, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Germany was “making a mistake” by trying to maintain its deep economic ties with Moscow. The Kremlin has said peace talks between Russia and Ukraine may get under way in Turkey on Tuesday and said it was important that the talks would be held face-to-face despite scant progress in negotiations so far. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, used a video interview with independent Russian media outlets to signal his willingness to discuss having Ukraine adopt a “neutral status”, and also make compromises about the status of the eastern Donbas region, in order to secure a peace agreement with Russia. But he said he was not willing to discuss Ukrainian demilitarisation, and that Ukrainians would need to vote in a referendum to approve their country adopting a neutral status. Russia’s foreign affairs minister, Sergei Lavrov, appears to have ruled out any direct meetings between Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, and Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, saying it would be counter-productive at this point. The southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol is on the verge of a humanitarian catastrophe and must be completely evacuated, its mayor said. Vadym Boichenko said about 160,000 civilians were trapped in the city without power. Ukraine has no plans to open any humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians from besieged cities on Monday because of intelligence reports warning of possible Russian “provocations” along the routes, deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said. The Ukrainian military claimed Russia has withdrawn troops that were surrounding Kyiv after suffering significant losses in its latest operational report. The UK’s Ministry of Defence released its latest intelligence report, claiming there has been “no significant change” to Russian forces’ dispositions in Ukraine over the past 24 hours. US president Joe Biden has denied he is calling for regime change in Russia, after he said during a visit to Poland that Vladimir Putin “cannot remain in power”. When asked by a reporter if he wanted to see the Russian president removed from office, he said “no”. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russian investigators would look into a video circulating on social media that purported to show Ukrainian forces mistreating captured Russian soldiers. He also said that Joe Biden’s comments that Vladimir Putin could not remain in power were a cause for concern. Schools in Ukraine’s capital of Kyiv will reopen today via remote learning online. The UK government’s Cabinet Office has issued a procurement policy note for public sector organisations holding contracts with Russian or Belarusian suppliers, urging them to investigate where they can cancel contracts. UK, the education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, said he had no doubt that Russia had carried out war crimes in Ukraine. The Kremlin has said that peace talks between Russia and Ukraine may get underway in Turkey on Tuesday and said it was important that the talks would be held face-to-face despite scant progress in negotiations so far. Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Turkish counterpart Tayyip Erdogan agreed in a telephone call on Sunday for Istanbul to host the talks, which Ankara hopes will lead to a ceasefire in Ukraine. Turkey said the talks could begin as early as Monday, but Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that was unlikely as the negotiators would only be arriving in Turkey on Monday. Peskov told reporters that no progress had been made on the idea of a potential meeting between Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Reuters report he also said that the talks had so far failed to yield any substantive progress or breakthroughs. A quick snap from Reuters that Russian ambassador to Poland says that the 45 Russian diplomats expelled by Poland have all now left the country. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russian investigators would look into a video circulating on social media that purported to show Ukrainian forces mistreating captured Russian soldiers. Peskov said the video, which he described as containing “monstrous images”, needed to be legally assessed and for those who took part in what he described as torture to be held responsible. Peskov also said that Joe Biden’s comments that Vladimir Putin could not remain in power were a cause for concern. Reuters reports he said Moscow would continue to closely follow Biden’s statements. Biden made the comments in Warsaw on Saturday, then later said the US does not have a policy of regime change in Russia. On energy issues, Peskov said Russia was working out methods for accepting payments of its gas exports in roubles and said it would take decisions in due course should European countries refuse to pay in the Russian currency. Russia’s foreign affairs minister Sergei Lavrov appears to have ruled out any direct meetings between Russia’s president Vladimir Putin and Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, saying it would be counter-productive. Reuters quotes him saying that a meeting between them should only happen when the two sides are close to agreeing on key issues. Ukraine’s interior ministry adviser Vadym Denysenko earlier said he did not expect “any breakthrough on the main issues” in talks due to take place today. There are a few more words here on the UK Labour opposition leader Keir Starmer talking on LBC Radio about the invasion of Ukraine. He said the UK’s government had got the response to the Ukraine refugee crisis “completely wrong” and they have acted “too slowly, they are too mean”. PA Media quotes him saying: They’ve still got this DIY package really, which is all over the place, where we hear the refugees who were supposed to be on their way here still haven’t got visas and clearance. On sanctions, I think they should have gone further and faster. On the other hand, I have, on a number of occasions in the House of Commons, made it clear that politically the United Kingdom stands united in the face of Russian aggression. I do think there are times in history where it’s the role of the leader of the opposition to show the unity of purpose when it comes to something as significant as this. A quick snap from Reuters here that Russia’s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov has said that his nation’s relations with China were at their strongest level ever. China has been one of the countries that has not condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and has been highly critical of western sanctions and the mooted attempt to expel Russia from the G20 group of major economies over it. Kirsty Mackay has set up a photo-project to capture images of people in Britain taking action to help the people of Ukraine since Russia invaded. This photo project is intended to inspire others to recognise the power they hold and to take action. It includes Marc Wilson, in Bristol, who drove to Paris to fill out visa applications for a family of six, Zac and Isky who baked cookies and sold them to their neighbours, and Genia Mineeva, who is helping to match Ukrainian refugees with hosts here in the UK. We have a photo essay from her this morning featuring some of the images: The people helping Ukraine from the UK – photo essay The UK government’s Cabinet Office has issued a procurement policy note for public sector organisations holding contracts with Russian or Belarusian suppliers, urging them to investigate where they can cancel contracts. The statement says: The guidance issued today to public sector buying team recommends that public bodies, including government departments and hospitals, immediately seek to identify any contracts with Russian and Belarusian companies and, if possible to switch suppliers with minimal disruption, pursue legal routes of cancelling them. Downing Street chief of staff Steve Barclay is quoted as saying: Public money should not fund Putin’s war machine. We are asking hospitals, councils and other organisations across the public sector to urgently look at all the ways they can go further to sever their commercial ties to Russia. The government will continue to work closely with these organisations, ensuring they are able to take the necessary steps as quickly as possible, including taking legal routes where necessary. Here is a selection of some of the latest images we have have received from Ukraine. Support from many African leaders and governments for Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine – or at least reluctance to condemn it – has dismayed western officials. At the UN general assembly, on resolution 17 African nations abstained – almost half all abstentions – and one voted against, condemning Russia for its “aggression” and demanding a withdrawal from Ukraine, though a majority of African countries gave it their backing. The resolution passed by 141 to five. Some observers have raised the possibility of a new strategic split across Africa, similar to that during the cold war. “It harks back to cold war days and the divisions we saw then. But … the objective reality of the international system is so different now this raises a lot of questions about some African countries’ commitment to the post-cold war order and its values,” said Priyal Singh, a researcher at Institute for Strategic Studies in Pretoria. Read more of Jason Burke’s piece from Johannesburg: Cold war echoes as African leaders resist criticising Putin’s war In the UK, Labour’s opposition leader Keir Starmer has been critical of US president Joe Biden’s words during his trip to Europe, describing them as “not helpful”. My colleague Shaun Walker has been tweeting about his experience reporting from Irpin in Ukraine. He said: The few people who didn’t leave Irpin were mostly those too old and to frail to walk. For them, the last month has been hell. Death, illness and frayed nerves, a few miles from Kyiv. I found it difficult to listen to these stories &amp; keep it together. To leave Irpin you have to walk over a destroyed bridge that has come under shelling, so for many old people it seems just too much, combined with abandoning their homes and going somewhere uncertain. Volunteers are begging them to leave but many of the oldest simply refuse to go. You can read Shaun Walker’s piece here: Escape from Irpin – frail residents helped to safety after month of hell The southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol is on the verge of a humanitarian catastrophe and must be completely evacuated, its mayor said. Reuters report mayor Vadym Boichenko said about 160,000 civilians were trapped in the city without power. Twenty-six buses were waiting to evacuate civilians but Russian forces had not agreed to give them safe passage, he said. “The Russian Federation is playing with us,” he said. Ukraine has no plans to open any humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians from besieged cities on Monday because of intelligence reports warning of possible Russian “provocations” along the routes, deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said this morning, according to reports from Reuters. Ukraine’s emergency services have tweeted to say that a fuel depot that had been struck by enemy shelling in Lutsk and caught fire is under control. Lutsk is in the north-west of Ukraine, and is the administrative centre of the Volyn Oblast. Gazprom, Russia’s energy giant, has issued its daily figures, saying that it continues to ship gas to Europe via Ukraine – giving a volume of 109.5m cubic metres. One company that has announced a change of plan, however, is Dutch brewing company Heineken. It had previously announced that it would halt new investments and exports to Russia, but not pull out of the country. Reuters are carrying a statement from the company today updating that position, saying: “We have concluded that Heineken’s ownership of the business in Russia is no longer sustainable nor viable in the current environment.” Another Ukrainian figure has been speaking ahead of proposed peace talks in Turkey. Ihor Zhovkva, deputy head of President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s office, said “Turkey is among those countries that could become guarantors of our security in the future,” according to a quote from Reuters. There has been some dampening of expectation ahead of peace talks from the Ukrainian side. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has been widely quoted as hailing the new negotiations, saying he hoped they would bring peace “without delay”. However, Reuters has just posted a quote from interior ministry adviser Vadym Denysenko, ahead of talks between Ukrainian and Russian representatives in Turkey, saying: “I don’t think there will be any breakthrough on the main issues.” On television in the UK, the education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, was asked about US president Joe Biden’s words, and whether they meant that the west was aiming for regime change in Russia. On Sky News, Zahawi said: It’s up to the Russian people to decide who governs them in the future. I think Russian people are pretty fed up. Not only because they’re watching their friends, and some of them have family, in Ukraine, who have been attacked by the Putin regime. Clearly war crimes have been committed, because they’re targeting innocent civilians in civilian areas. The deputy prime minister is working with the international criminal court, to make sure that that evidence is in place. But I think President Biden is right to say that Putin has no place in the Ukraine. They have to make sure that they withdraw from Ukraine because it’s an illegal invasion. He went on to double-down on that accusation of war crimes, saying: War crimes have been committed in the Ukraine, no doubt in my mind. The evidence is clear on that. It’s right to collect that evidence because it’s also important, you know, my family had experience with Saddam Hussein. It’s important that despots and dictators understand that there will be a reckoning. And that reckoning will come through the international criminal court in The Hague, as we’ve seen in Bosnia, and of course, in other parts of the world. It’s really important. This is not something that should be taken lightly, that someone can go into a country illegally, and start bombing civilians, and feel that there is no there is no response from the global community. Russian writer Mikhail Shishkin contributes to our site today, saying that neither Nato nor Ukraine can de-Putinise Russia. We Russians must do it ourselves: Two attempts to introduce a democratic social order in Russia have already failed. The first Russian democracy, of 1917, lasted only a few months. The second, in the 1990s, lasted a few years with great difficulty. Every time my country tries to build a democratic society by establishing elections, a parliament and a republic, it finds itself in a totalitarian empire. Do a dictatorship and a dictator give birth to a slave population or does a slave population give birth to a dictatorship and a dictator? The chicken and the egg. How can this vicious circle be broken? How can a new Russia begin? There was no de-Stalinisation in Russia and there were no Nuremberg trials for the Communist party. Now Russia’s fate depends on de-Putinisation. Just as the “ignorant” German population was shown concentration camps in 1945, so “ignorant” Russians must be shown destroyed Ukrainian cities and the corpses of children. We Russians must openly and courageously acknowledge our guilt and ask for forgiveness. Read more here: Mikhail Shishkin – Neither Nato nor Ukraine can de-Putinise Russia. We Russians must do it ourselves Here is where the situation in Ukraine currently stands: Representatives from Russia and Ukraine will meet this week for a new round of talks aimed at ending the war. Ukraine said the two sides would meet in Turkey on Monday. The Ukrainian military claimed Russia has withdrawn troops that were surrounding Kyiv after suffering significant losses in its latest operational report. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, used a video interview with independent Russian media outlets to signal his willingness to discuss having Ukraine adopt a “neutral status”, and also make compromises about the status of the eastern Donbas region, in order to secure a peace agreement with Russia. But he said he was not willing to discuss Ukrainian demilitarisation, and that Ukrainians would need to vote in a referendum to approve their country adopting a neutral status. In a separate late-night video, Zelenskiy promised to press this week for fresh sanctions against Russia and spoke of the impending new round of negotiations, saying: “We are looking for peace without delay.” Zelenskiy also claimed that 2,000 children from Mariupol have been taken by Russia, according to a press release published by the president’s office late on Sunday. “According to our data, more than 2,000 children were deported. Which means they were abducted. Because we do not know the exact locations of all these children. There were children with and without parents. It’s a catastrophe, it’s horrible.” Zelenskiy said the city remained blocked by the Russian military, describing the situation as a humanitarian catastrophe. “Food, medicine, and water can’t be delivered. The Russian troops are shelling humanitarian convoys and killing drivers.” US president Joe Biden has denied he is calling for regime change in Russia, after he said during a visit to Poland that Vladimir Putin “cannot remain in power”. When asked by a reporter if he wanted to see the Russian president removed from office, he said “no”. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, had already distanced himself from Biden’s comments, while the UK cabinet minister Nadhim Zahawi distanced the UK government from his remarks. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister accused Russia of “irresponsible” acts around the occupied Chernobyl power station that could send radiation across much of Europe, and urged the United Nations to dispatch a mission to assess the risks in an update to her Telegram account. The UK’s Ministry of Defence released its latest intelligence report, claiming there has been “no significant change” to Russian forces’ dispositions in Ukraine over the past 24 hours. An earlier report said Russia is “effectively isolating Ukraine from international maritime trade”, in an update late on Sunday. It also said Russian naval forces were continuing to conduct sporadic missile strikes against targets across Ukraine. Putin is seeking to split Ukraine into two, emulating the postwar division between North and South Korea, Ukraine’s military intelligence chief has said. In comments that raise the prospect of a long and bitter frozen conflict, Gen Kyrylo Budanov, warned of bloody guerrilla warfare. The French foreign minister said on Sunday there would be “collective guilt” if nothing was done to help civilians in Mariupol, the Ukrainian city besieged by Russian forces. Schools in Ukraine’s capital of Kyiv will reopen today via remote learning online. Schools in Ukraine’s capital of Kyiv will reopen today via remote learning online. Kyiv’s mayor Vitali Klitschko made the announcement in a Telegram update on Sunday. “On March 28, the educational process will resume in the capital – online. It will be more adapted to current conditions. And using different educational platforms for students,” he said. “An important task today is for the city to live and work even in such difficult conditions of martial law. They are trying to intimidate us. That will not work! We will not give up!” The UN estimates more than half of the nation’s children have fled Ukraine since Russia invaded on 24 February. Ukraine’s emergency services are reporting a house in Kyiv caught fire as a result of fallen debris from a downed missile overnight. The agency said it received a report of a fire in the Darnytskyi district of the capital at 11.12pm. By 0.27am the fire was localised on an area of 100 sq metres and by 1.24am it had been extinguished. A monument to the famed Ukrainian poet Taras Shevchenko has been covered with sandbags to protect it from shelling in the city of Kharkiv, north-east Ukraine. Ukraine’s second-largest city of 1.5 million people lies close to the Russian border and has been heavily shelled by Russian forces over the past weeks. The UK’s Ministry of Defence has released its latest intelligence report, claiming there has been “no significant change” to Russian forces dispositions in Ukraine over the past 24 hours. The report, released at 6am GMT, reads: In the last 24 hours there has been no significant change to Russian forces’ dispositions in occupied Ukraine. Ongoing logistical shortages have been compounded by a continued lack of momentum and morale amongst the Russian military, and aggressive fighting by the Ukrainians. Russia has gained most ground in the south in the vicinity of Mariupol where heavy fighting continues as Russia attempts to capture the port.” In case you missed this earlier report from late on Sunday evening, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister accused Russia of “irresponsible” acts around the occupied Chernobyl power station that could send radiation across much of Europe. Iryna Vereshchuk posted an update to her Telegram account late Sunday, where she said Russian forces continue to militarise the Chernobyl exclusion zone. This poses a very serious risk of damaging the insulation structures built over the station’s fourth unit after its 1986 explosion. Such damage will inevitably lead to the entry into the atmosphere of a significant amount of radioactive dust and contaminate not only Ukraine but also other European countries.” Vereshchuk continued to claim that the occupying Russian forces “ignored these threats, continuing to transport and store a significant amount of ammunition in the immediate vicinity of the nuclear power plant” and through the city of Pripyat. Russian occupiers transport tens of tons of rockets, shells and mortar ammunition every day. Hundreds of tons of ammunition are being stored in the neighbouring city of Pripyat Chernobyl, which is also a short distance from the nuclear power plant.” Vereshchuk noted the dangers of Russia’s use of “old and substandard ammunition” that “increases the risk of their detonation even during loading and transportation”. In addition, she said significant fires have started in the exclusion zone, which can have “very serious consequences”. As a result of combustion, radionuclides are released into the atmosphere, which the wind can carry over long distances, which threatens radiation not only in Ukraine but also in other European countries. Loss of control over the exclusion zone and the inability to fully extinguish the fire could threaten radiation facilities in the area.” In the context of nuclear security, the irresponsible and unprofessional actions of the Russian military pose a very serious threat not only to Ukraine but also to hundreds of millions of Europeans.” Vereshchuk urged the UN security council to “take immediate measures to demilitarise the Chernobyl exclusion zone and establish a special UN mission” to eliminate the risk of a recurrence of the Chernobyl accident. The Guardian’s Shaun Walker, based in Lviv, brings us this report of residents escaping the town of Irpin, near Kyiv. Some of the last people to leave describe constant noise, near misses and unbearable conditions. They are those who were too old, too frail or too sick to leave earlier. Instead they have endured a month of hell as Russian forces pushed into the surrounding area during the first days of the war. The town has seen heavy fighting and has come under intense Russian bombardment. Read the full story below. Powerful images from the the missile attack that hit Ukraine’s western city of Lviv over the weekend have emerged. Five people were wounded after two rocket strikes hit the outskirts of the city, regional governor Maksym Kozytskyy said. Firefighters battled a massive blaze after a fuel storage facility was hit. US President Joe Biden has said that he was not calling for regime change in Russia when he said on Saturday that Russian President Vladimir Putin “cannot remain in power.” “Mr President, do you want Putin removed? Mr President, were you calling for regime change?” a reporter asked Biden as he left a church service in Washington on Sunday. “No,” the president replied. On Saturday, Joe Biden condemned Vladimir Putin as a “butcher” who could no longer stay in power in a historic speech in Poland as Russian missiles rained down on Ukraine’s most pro-western city, just 40 miles from the Polish border, and Ukraine’s president called for more military aid. “For God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power,” Biden said in his most belligerent speech since the war began a month ago. US officials later said that Biden had been talking about the need for Putin to lose power over Ukrainian territory and in the wider region. In an interview with Russian journalists and later published to the presidential office of Ukraine, president Zelenskiy said Ukraine was prepared to discuss its neutrality status as part of a peace deal. The most important issues in the negotiations with Russia are security guarantees, neutrality and Ukraine’s nuclear-free status.” Zelenskiy was speaking to Russian journalists in a 90-minute video call, an interview that the Russian authorities had pre-emptively warned Russian media to refrain from reporting. Zelenskiy spoke in Russian throughout. We do not discuss ‘denazification’ and demilitarisation at all. I said that we will not sit at the negotiating table at all if we talk about some kind of demilitarisation, some kind of ‘denazification’. For me, these are completely incomprehensible things.” In additional remarks aired on Sunday, he said: Ukraine is prepared to discuss adopting a neutral status as part of a peace deal with Russia but it would have to be guaranteed by third parties and put to a referendum.” Zelenskiy said Russia’s invasion had caused the destruction of Russian-speaking cities in Ukraine, and said the damage was worse than the Russian wars in Chechnya. “Security guarantees and neutrality, non-nuclear status of our state. We are ready to go for it. This is the most important point,” Zelenskiy said. In Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s latest national address, the Ukrainian president promised to work this week for new sanctions against Russia and spoke of an impending new round negotiations. A new round of negotiations is ahead, because we are looking for peace. Really. Without delay. As I was informed, there is an opportunity and a need for a face-to-face meeting already in Turkey. This is not bad. Let’s look at the result. Our priorities in the negotiations are known. Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity are beyond doubt. Effective security guarantees for our state are mandatory. Our goal is obvious - peace and the restoration of normal life in our native state as soon as possible.” The Ukrainian president promised to continue to appeal to the parliaments of other countries, describing a busy diplomatic weeks ahead. No one will be able to hide the Ukrainian interest somewhere in political offices or in bureaucratic loopholes. Zelenskiy also spoke of the “global marathon for peace in Ukraine” where he thanks those who gathered in support of Ukraine across dozens of cities around the world. An impressive number of people in the squares of Europe, on other continents. And this is extremely important. Because when people are in the square, politicians will no longer pretend not to hear us and you, not to hear Ukraine.” We will not let anyone forget about our cities, about Mariupol and other Ukrainian cities that the Russian militaries are destroying. More and more people in the world are on the side of Ukraine, on the side of good in this battle with evil. And if politicians don’t know how to follow people, we will teach them. This is the basis of democracy and our national character.” The Guardian’s world affairs editor, Julian Borger, brings us this report on the drone operators who halted Russian convoy headed for Kyiv. One week into its invasion of Ukraine, Russia massed a 40-mile mechanised column in order to mount an overwhelming attack on Kyiv from the north. But the convoy of armoured vehicles and supply trucks ground to a halt within days, and the offensive failed, in significant part because of a series of night ambushes carried out by a team of 30 Ukrainian special forces and drone operators on quad bikes, according to a Ukrainian commander. The drone operators were drawn from an air reconnaissance unit, Aerorozvidka, which began eight years ago as a group of volunteer IT specialists and hobbyists designing their own machines and has evolved into an essential element in Ukraine’s successful David-and-Goliath resistance. However, while Ukraine’s western backers have supplied thousands of anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles and other military equipment, Aerorozvidka has been forced to resort to crowdfunding and a network of personal contacts in order to keep going, by getting hold of components such as advanced modems and thermal imaging cameras, in the face of export controls that prohibit them being sent to Ukraine. Read the full story below. The Ukrainian military has released its latest morning operational report as of 6am. According to Ukraine’s general staff of the armed forces, Ukrainian forces continue to restrain Russian troops from taking control of key highways and settlements in the city of Kyiv. A total of 5 enemy attacks were repelled from Donetsk and Luhansk with Ukrainian soldiers destroying 2 tanks, a combat machine infantry and one car, the report reads. An earlier report published by Ukraine’s ministry of defence claimed Russia was forced to withdrawal troops that were surrounding Kyiv after suffering significant losses. The withdrawal “significantly decreased” the intensity of Russia’s advance and forced some units to regroup in Belarus, the general staff of the armed forces said. Officials added that they believed Russia was also transporting ‘Iskander’ missiles to Kalinkovichy in the Gomel region of south-eastern Belarus. Hello it’s Samantha Lock with you as we deliver all the latest news from Ukraine. It is approaching 7am in Kyiv. Here is where the situation currently stands: US president Joe Biden has denied he is calling for regime change in Russia, after he said during a visit to Poland that Putin “cannot remain in power”. When asked by a reporter if he wanted to see Russian president Vladimir Putin removed from office he said “no”. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, had already distanced himself from Biden’s comments, while the UK cabinet minister Nadhim Zahawi distanced the UK government from his remarks. Representatives from Russia and Ukraine will meet this week for a new round of talks aimed at ending the war. Ukraine said the two sides would meet in Turkey on Monday. The Ukrainian military claimed Russia has withdrawn troops that were surrounding Kyiv after suffering significant losses in its latest operational report. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy used a video interview with independent Russian media outlets to signal his willingness to discuss having Ukraine adopt a “neutral status”, and also make compromises about the status of the eastern Donbas region, in order to secure a peace agreement with Russia. But he said he was not willing to discuss Ukrainian demilitarisation, and that Ukrainians would need to vote in a referendum to approve their country adopting a neutral status. In a separate late-night video, Zelenskiy promised to work this week for new sanctions against Russia and spoke of the impending new round negotiations, saying “we are looking for peace without delay.” Zelenskiy also claimed that 2,000 children from Mariupol have been taken by Russia, according to a press release published by the president’s office late on Sunday. “According to our data, more than 2,000 children were deported. Which means they were abducted. Because we do not know the exact locations of all these children. There were children with and without parents. It’s a catastrophe, it’s horrible.” Zelenskiy said the city remained blocked by the Russian military, describing the situation as a humanitarian catastrophe. “Food, medicine, and water can’t be delivered. The Russian troops are shelling humanitarian convoys and killing drivers.” Ukraine’s deputy prime minister has accused Russia of “irresponsible” acts around the occupied Chernobyl power station that could send radiation across much of Europe, and urged the United Nations to dispatch a mission to assess the risks in an update to her Telegram account. The UK Ministry of Defence said Russia is “effectively isolating Ukraine from international maritime trade”, in an update late Sunday. It also said Russian naval forces were continuing to conduct sporadic missile strikes against targets across Ukraine. Russia’s communications and internet regulator said in a public statement it would investigate the outlets that interviewed Zelenskiy, and has told them not to distribute the interview. Putin is seeking to split Ukraine into two, emulating the postwar division between North and South Korea, Ukraine’s military intelligence chief has said. In comments that raise the prospect of a long and bitter frozen conflict, General Kyrylo Budanov, warned of bloody guerrilla warfare. The French foreign minister said on Sunday there would be “collective guilt” if nothing was done to help civilians in Mariupol, the Ukrainian city besieged by Russian forces. The UK government’s top legal adviser has appointed a war crimes lawyer to advise Ukraine on the Russian invasion. The attorney general, Suella Braverman, announced on Sunday that Sir Howard Morrison QC would act as an independent adviser to the Ukrainian prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, Press Association reported. Germany is considering purchasing a missile defence system to shield against a potential attack from Russia, Chancellor Olaf Scholz said late on Sunday. Despite reports that Zelenskiy had been pushing to speak on video during the Academy Awards ceremony in Los Angeles tonight, attendees instead observed a 30-second silence as tribute to the people of Ukraine."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2019/mar/11/gas-strategy-in-the-uk-is-wrongheaded","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2019-03-11T18:15:29Z","webTitle":"Gas strategy in the UK is wrongheaded | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/mar/11/gas-strategy-in-the-uk-is-wrongheaded","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2019/mar/11/gas-strategy-in-the-uk-is-wrongheaded","fields":{"headline":"Gas strategy in the UK is wrongheaded","bodyText":"It is no surprise that the government’s strategy on fracking has been deemed unlawful (Fracking guidance illegally ignores climate change, 7 March). Gas may be more fuel efficient than coal when burnt, but shale gas is 95% methane, and methane is a powerful greenhouse gas. According to the IPCC it has a global warming potential (GWP) 85 times greater than carbon dioxide over a 20-year timeframe. Misleadingly, HMG have relied on an obsolete figure of 36 for the GWP of methane, dating back to 2013. Methane levels plateaued in the late 1990s, but have started to increase again over the past decade and have now reached 1,900 parts per billion, against a pre-industrial level of 700. Fracking is the obvious culprit. Satellite data over the US has shown that methane leakage exceeds 5% of shale gas production, an observation that fits with more recent studies by Nasa showing that fossil fuels are the major contributor to the continuing rise in atmospheric methane. Despite this evidence, the government’s energy strategy is to forge ahead with fracking while reducing environmental safeguards and providing tax incentives for its development. The government claim that gas is better than coal from a climate change perspective is only sustainable if fugitive emissions of methane are ignored. Let us hope that the high court judgment means that fracking will be abandoned in the UK as it has been elsewhere in Europe. Dr Robin Russell-Jones Scientific adviser to the all-party parliamentary group on air pollution (APPG) Geraint Davies MP Chair, APPG • Although I agree that climate change needs to be tackled, it is too simplistic for the Committee on Climate Change to suggest not connecting all new-build schemes to the gas grid from 2025 (Call for ban on gas hobs and boilers in new homes by 2025, 21 February). If the committee gets its way and all new builds are off-gas, then electricity for solutions such as heat pumps still needs to come from somewhere. Unless the electricity comes from a zero-carbon source, it defeats the object. If the whole of the country came off gas, we would need the power of about 30 nuclear power stations, and currently we have eight! Also, if we do switch to hydrogen gas then these homes without a gas connection could not be connected in the future and would miss the other benefits that hydrogen gas could deliver such as carbon-free cooking. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) has already acknowledged that there is no one-size-fits-all answer to the decarbonisation of heating. Instead, different solutions should be working together. A hybrid system that uses a heat pump up to a certain temperature, which is then supported by a gas boiler, would be very effective not only in new build but many existing homes as well. Carbon emissions will be even lower if the gas boiler is run on hydrogen gas. Instead of advocating for unreasonable promises from government, the CCC should be supporting the research that is already under way into new “no carbon fuels”. I’d even like to extend an invitation to the CCC’s chief executive, Chris Stark, to a prototype demonstration we have planned later in the year, where we will show how a 100% hydrogen boiler will run. Carl Arntzen CEO, Worcester Bosch Group; chairman, the Domestic Heat Strategy Group • Our unsustainable lifestyles and commitment to perpetual economic growth have become the major drivers of climate change. Jason Hickel suggests that the solution is “about changing the way our economy operates” (Climate breakdown is coming. The UK needs a Greener New Deal, theguardian.com, 5 March). Encouragingly, the UN sustainable development goals (SDGs) form a new roadmap for our future that in principle aligns the economy with the Earth’s life support systems. Yet a recent report by the Stockholm Resilience Centre[1] shows that attempting to achieve the socio-economic goals using conventional growth policies would make it virtually impossible to reduce the speed of global warming and environmental degradation. The research team tested three other scenarios and the only one that met all goals was the one that implemented systemic transformational change. A key element in the model was reducing inequality by a redistribution of wealth, work and income, including ensuring that the 10% richest people take no more that 40% of the income. We have an unprecedented and immense challenge before us – with little choice but to engage.

In addition, South Korean sports authorities have requested that international groups be permitted to monitor radiation levels during the 2020 Games. Food safety concerns in South Korea have grown since Fukushima city was chosen to host six softball games and one baseball game next summer. Fukushima prefecture will also be the location for the start of the domestic leg of the Olympic torch relay, beginning next March. Tokyo Olympics organisers said South Korea’s National Olympic Committee had sent a letter expressing concern at the possibility of produce grown in Fukushima prefecture being served to athletes in the Olympic village. “Nothing is more important than safety. We will seek consultations with the International Olympic Committee and others to secure our athletes’ safety and ensure that the Tokyo Olympics will be held in a safe environment,” the South Korean sports minister, Park Yang-woo, said this week, according to Yonhap news agency. Seoul’s concerns come amid an escalating dispute with Tokyo over South Korean court rulings ordering Japanese companies to compensate Koreans who were forced to work in Japanese factories and mines before and during the second world war, when the Korean peninsula was a Japanese colony. The dispute has affected trade and cultural exchanges, while figures released this week show that the number of South Korean tourists visiting Japan fell by 7.6% year on year last month – its lowest level for almost a year – according to the Japan National Tourism Organisation. Bloomberg reported that the Korea Sport and Olympic Committee is to request international organisations such as Greenpeace be allowed to monitor radiation levels at Olympic venues. Committee officials have also drawn up plans to open a separate cafeteria exclusively for South Korean athletes to ensure that they are not served food from the region affected by radioactive fallout from the March 2011 meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The official threshold for radioactive substances in food from Fukushima is much lower than those in other parts of the world, including the European Union and the US. All food items produced in Fukushima undergo repeated inspections to ensure their safety, according to the prefectural government. “We are only shipping primary products which are certified to be safe through multiple inspections in each stage with cooperation among municipal and prefectural government, production areas, producers, distributors and retailers,” it says on its website. Data from the NGO monitoring group Safecast shows that atmospheric radiation levels in Tokyo are lower than those in many other cities. On Thursday morning, Safecast data showed levels in the Roppongi district of Tokyo stood at 0.084 microsieverts per hour, compared with 0.116 in Suwon, south of Seoul. In Fukushima city, located 45 miles west of the stricken nuclear power plant, atmospheric radiation was recorded at 0.100 microsieverts per hour. The global average of naturally occurring background radiation is 0.17-0.39 microsieverts per hour, according to the pro-nuclear lobby group the World Nuclear Association."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2020/apr/30/boris-johnson-promises-comprehensive-plan-for-reopening-businesses","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2020-04-30T18:03:39Z","webTitle":"Johnson promises 'comprehensive plan' for reopening businesses","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/boris-johnson-promises-comprehensive-plan-for-reopening-businesses","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2020/apr/30/boris-johnson-promises-comprehensive-plan-for-reopening-businesses","fields":{"headline":"Johnson promises 'comprehensive plan' for reopening businesses","bodyText":"Boris Johnson has promised that the government will next week publish a “comprehensive plan” on reopening businesses, with professional bodies working through the weekend to help draw up detailed guidelines on working during lockdown. Large parts of the economy remain closed because of concerns that companies may not be able to adequately protect their workers, but the government is keen for firms to return to work where possible in order to cushion the blow to the economy. The government is due to announce its latest decision on whether to extend lockdown conditions on 7 May, although there is little expectation of any major relaxation of rules, with health services still under pressure. However, the prime minister on Thursday said he expected to present “a comprehensive plan” on how to get the UK economy moving as well as providing childcare for workers, allowing travel to work and allowing safer work within businesses. The business secretary, Alok Sharma, has been gathering views from businesses and lobby groups on guidelines that should be implemented, giving details of how different sectors should adapt. The advice is expected to cover different types of workplace, such as factories, offices, shops, logistics and outdoor work such as farming and mining. While there is no legal impediment to companies returning to work – aside from non-essential retail and public venues that have been explicitly shut down – some businesses are concerned they could face a backlash in the absence of a clear signal from the government.Here is how the different anti-coronavirus measures could work: Factories Any work that cannot be done with social distancing should be done with workers standing either back to back or side by side – rather than face to face. Cleaning of work surfaces will be more regular and shifts should be staggered to prevent large congregations of workers at factory gates or in rest areas – in which 2-metre distancing will be enforced. The carmaker Vauxhall has made face masks and eye protection compulsory at all times. However, sources in other industries have said the government is unlikely to mandate this across the country, given the need to prioritise personal protective equipment for the NHS. Offices There is little prospect of a return to working en masse in offices in the coming weeks, with working from home still encouraged among those who can do so. However, for those who must return to offices, desks will be spaced out and start times could be staggered to prevent rush hour crowding on public transport. Retail Britons have already become familiar with distancing requirements in shops deemed essential by the government. The British Retail Consortium and the Usdaw union have drawn up guidance that covers issues ranging from limiting access to public toilets, to the installation of protective screens at tills and keeping changing rooms permanently closed in clothes shops in order to prevent contamination. Delivery services Warehouses and trucking companies have been in demand like never before as people are stuck at home. Within warehouses safe practices are almost identical to factories, while delivery drivers who interact with consumers as part of their job need to wait for the customer to pick up packages at a safe distance. Outdoor work In farms, quarries and mines, workers should work side by side if they are unable to carry out their jobs 2 metres apart, and enclosed spaces such as machinery cabs should have windows left open to allow for ventilation. The sale of goods – such as farm produce – should not encourage the gathering of crowds, with online orders and deliveries recommended. Construction Some housebuilders had faced protests over continuing work during lockdown, with concerns that some parts of the job are impossible to do while maintaining 2-metre distancing. However, the housing minister, Robert Jenrick, last week gave clear guidance to the construction industry that it should return to work if possible. The housebuilder Taylor Wimpey is manufacturing a bespoke face shield, which will attach to a construction hard hat and will be used on all its sites for two-person tasks. Large sites such as the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station will have split shifts to reduce overlap. Transport and tourism While transport is not thought to be among the sectors to be covered by new business department guidance, any large move back to work will require more public transport. Bus and train companies are hoping for continued government funding to allow them to operate with empty seats – a costly move – to preserve 2-metre distances. Any recovery of the airline industry is likely to be more reliant on international agreements. However, the Hungarian budget airline Wizz Air on Thursday said masks would be compulsory on its flights from now on, with limited flights to resume from Luton airport on 1 May. The Ryanair boss, Michael O’Leary, has rejected the idea of leaving the middle seat empty on planes in order to maintain physical distancing. Hospitality There is little expectation that public gatherings will be allowed for months, given the focus on reducing the potential for coronavirus to spread. The JD Wetherspoon pub chain plans to reopen in June, although few analysts believe that is likely. Any pre-vaccine reopening would need strict social distancing and cleaning routines – if customers could be persuaded to return."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2019/sep/16/morning-mail-cladding-terror-secrecy-magpie-swooping-death-ashes-series-drawn","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2019-09-15T21:09:08Z","webTitle":"Morning mail: cladding 'terror' secrecy, magpie swooping death, Ashes series drawn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/16/morning-mail-cladding-terror-secrecy-magpie-swooping-death-ashes-series-drawn","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2019/sep/16/morning-mail-cladding-terror-secrecy-magpie-swooping-death-ashes-series-drawn","fields":{"headline":"Morning mail: cladding 'terror' secrecy, magpie swooping death, Ashes series drawn","bodyText":"Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Monday 16 September. Top stories The NSW government is advising local councils to invoke terrorism fears to keep the location of potentially lethal flammable cladding secret from the public. A taskforce has spent two years auditing 185,000 building records to understand how widespread the cladding is. Guardian Australia has obtained an internal missive sent by the NSW government to local councils last month warning them the cladding information is “highly sensitive” and advising them the release of the documents may be contrary to the public interest. Councils were given examples of three common reasons to reject requests: the potential to affect property prices; to derail the taskforce’s work; and to create a risk of “terror” and arson. Environmental and civil society groups have warned the government that nuclear power has “no role” in Australia. As submissions to the parliamentary inquiry on nuclear power close, a diverse collection of unions, churches, health, environmental and Indigenous groups has called on the government to rule out changing the law to allow nuclear energy in Australia. The group warned nuclear power was “a dangerous distraction from real movement on the pressing energy decisions and climate actions we need”. A cyclist has died of head injuries after he was startled by a magpie and crashed in Wollongong. The 76-year-old man was riding on an off-road path alongside Nicholson Park at Woonona on Sunday morning when he veered off to avoid a swooping magpie, witnesses reported. He hit a fence post and was thrown to the ground, suffering serious head injuries. He was airlifted to St George hospital in a critical condition and died in the evening. World EU officials have rejected Boris Johnson’s claim that “a huge amount of progress” is being made in Brexit talks, as the European Commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, warned that time was running out. Donald Trump came storming to the defence of Brett Kavanaugh after the publication of new allegations about the supreme court justice’s behaviour while he was a student at Yale led to renewed calls for his impeachment. A peaceful rally in Hong Kong has descended into chaos as police fired teargas and water cannon at protesters who hurled petrol bombs, set fires and clashed with residents. Iran has dismissed US accusations that it was responsible for a series of explosive drone attacks on the world’s largest petroleum processing facility in Saudi Arabia. A new generation of autonomous weapons or “killer robots” could accidentally start a war or cause mass atrocities, a former top Google software engineer has warned. Opinion and analysis At the peak of the media’s fascination with Steve Bannon, one issue dominated – why does he wear two shirts at the same time? The only right answer to the question, writes Nesrine Malik, is: who cares? “The same playbook is being used with Boris Johnson’s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings. Why the gilet? The tote bags? What clouds is he summoning with his powers of political atmokinesis? … Cummings will walk away from the wreckage of Brexit and another ‘compelling’ figure will take his place. The hope is that whoever replaces him will be met with cynicism and outrage, rather than fascination and hagiography.” Australians overwhelmingly support business leaders speaking out on social and political issues, according to a new survey that conflicts with government efforts to paint such efforts as corporate kowtowing to “noisy elites”. But the survey, from the Committee for Economic Development of Australia, also shows that when chief executives do speak out they are regarded as doing so out of self-interest. The survey of 3,000 Australians and 59 bosses showed 78% of the general public supported corporate leaders speaking out on issues of public importance but 52% thought that when they were did they were talking in the interests of their own company. Sport England have won the fifth Test to draw the Ashes series but Australia keep the urn. The home side won by 135 runs at the Oval after finally dismissing Steve Smith for a modest score, 23, despite Matthew Wade’s pugnacious century. The opening round of the NRL finals was full of incident and upsets, writes Matt Cleary. The upshot is minor premiers Melbourne Storm now face an uphill task to reach a fourth consecutive grand final. Thinking time: ‘Now, finally, there was a fight’ “Whenever I try to understand how the past two decades happened, I return to that September – to that ground-zero day and its immediate aftermath,” writes Edward Snowden in an extract from his memoir. “To return means coming up against a truth darker than the lies that tied the Taliban to al-Qaeda and conjured up Saddam Hussein’s illusory stockpile of WMDs. It means, ultimately, confronting the fact that the carnage and abuses that marked my young adulthood were born not only in the executive branch and the intelligence agencies, but also in the hearts and minds of all Americans, myself included.” After the attack, he writes, nearly 100,000 spies returned to work with the knowledge that they had failed at their one and only job, which was protecting the US. “The day after September 11 was the first day of a new era, which the US faced with a unified resolve, strengthened by a revived sense of patriotism and the goodwill and sympathy of the world. In retrospect, my country could have done so much with this opportunity. It could have treated terror not as the theological phenomenon it purported to be, but as the crime it was. It could have used this rare moment of solidarity to reinforce democratic values and cultivate resilience in the now-connected global public. Instead, it went to war.” Media roundup The ABC reveals that disability advocates are threatening to boycott the upcoming royal commission over perceived conflicts of interest. The Sydney Morning Herald says some Sydney residents are being charged 13 times more than others for council service fees. And the Australian has a different take on businesses speaking out on social issues, reporting that “the Business Council of Australia wants CEOs to abandon virtue signalling and focus on the core aims of business”. Coming up Parliament resumes with Scott Morrison set to face pressure over the Victorian MP Gladys Liu’s alleged links to Chinese government-backed organisations.

Thank you for reading. Here is a comprehensive rundown on where the crisis currently stands: Western nations will warn the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, on Thursday that his country will pay “ruinous” costs for invading Ukraine during an unprecedented one-day trio of Nato, G7 and EU summits that will be attended by the US president, Joe Biden, in Brussels. Zelenskiy said he hoped for “meaningful steps” at the round of summits, noting they would reveal “who is a friend, who is a partner, and who betrayed us for money”. The Ukrainian president also called for a global rally to protest Russia’s war on Ukraine, urging citizens of the world to publicly stand against the war. Russian forces have been accused of taking hostage the people of the besieged Ukrainian city of Chernihiv, as local officials imposed drinking water rationing on trapped civilians. About 150,000 people are stuck in the northern city with little hope of aid after Russia cut them off from the capital, Kyiv, when a key bridge was bombed on Wednesday. Ukraine is increasing pressure on Russian forces north-east of Kyiv while carrying out successful counterattacks against Russian positions in towns on the outskirts of the capital, the UK defence ministry has said. Nato announced it will double its troops along the alliance’s eastern flank. “The first step is the deployment of four new Nato battlegroups in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia, along with our existing forces in the Baltic countries and Poland,” said the alliance’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg. Nato countries are also expected to agree at Thursday’s meeting to provide special kit to help protect Ukraine against chemical, biological or nuclear attacks launched by Russia. The White House has quietly assembled a team of national security officials to sketch out scenarios of how the United States and its allies should respond if Russian President Vladimir Putin unleashes his stockpiles of chemical, biological or nuclear weapons, the New York Times reports. Britain will provide 6,000 defensive missiles and extra funds to support the Ukrainian military, as well as BBC journalists providing news coverage in the region. The US government has said it believes war crimes have been committed in Ukraine based on its assessment of evidence that civilians have been deliberately targeted. Between 7,000 and 15,000 Russian soldiers have been killed since the beginning of the war, Nato estimates. By way of comparison, Russia lost about 15,000 troops over 10 years in Afghanistan, the Associated Press has reported. Ukraine is using facial recognition software to identify the bodies of Russian soldiers killed in combat and to trace their families to inform them of their deaths, Ukraine’s vice prime minister said. The Russian climate envoy Anatoly Chubais has stepped down and left the country in protest against Putin’s war in Ukraine. He is the highest-level official to break with the Kremlin over the invasion. Israel has blocked Ukraine from buying Pegasus spyware, fearing Russia’s anger. The revelation, after a joint investigation by the Guardian and Washington Post, offers new insight into the way Israel’s relationship with Russia has at times undermined Ukraine’s offensive capabilities – and contradicted US priorities. Putin has said Russia plans to demand payment in roubles for its gas sales to “unfriendly” countries. The announcement sent European futures soaring over concerns the switch would exacerbate a looming energy crisis by jamming up deals that run to hundreds of millions of dollars every day. The risk of coup by Russia’s federal security service (FSB) against President Putin is growing every week that the war in Ukraine continues, a whistleblower at the heart of Russian intelligence has said, according to a report from The Times. As usual, for any tips and feedback please contact me through Twitter or at samantha.lock@theguardian.com The Guardian keeps you up to the minute on the crisis in Ukraine with a global perspective and from our team around the world and around the clock. Thank you for reading and please do stay tuned. Russia’s failure to score a quick victory has led to a grimmer phase of the war, and much still hangs in the balance. The Guardian’s Shaun Walker writes how the tragedy has unfolded in Ukraine, one month on. The United States Embassy in Moscow on Wednesday received a list of its diplomats that were declared “persona non grata”, a state department spokesperson said, in what Russian media said was a response to a US move ousting Russian staff at the United Nations. Washington last month said it was expelling the Russian diplomats at the country’s UN mission in New York over national security concerns, and later announced it would oust an additional Russian at the UN who it claimed was a spy. Russia, which denies the allegations, told the United States on Wednesday it would throw out an unspecified number of American diplomats in response to the moves, Interfax news agency said. “The American side was told very firmly that any hostile U.S. actions against Russia would provoke a decisive and comparable response,” the agency said. It is not clear how many US diplomats will be affected by the order, and when they will be expelled from Russia. For weeks the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol has been under constant bombardment from Russian artillery. With the city in ruins, residents who risked everything to escape can now tell their stories. As Isobel Koshiw tells Hannah Moore, the story of Mariupol in the past month has been one of siege, bombardment and almost unimaginable hardship. Residents tell of having to drink water from their radiators and cook over fires in the street, as electricity, gas and water supplies have all been cut off. And with the internet and phone lines down, the city has become not only unreachable but also uncontactable, for the most part. Listen to the Guardian’s latest Today in Focus episode below. We have reported on what Putin’s rouble gambit might mean for Europe and gas - and the Japanese government has also weighed in, saying that it did not understand how the change would work in practice. “Currently, we’re looking into the situation with relevant ministries as we don’t quite understand what is (Russia’s) intention and how they would do this,” finance minister Shunichi Suzuki said in a parliament session. Japan takes 9% of its liquified natural gas from Russia and 4% of its crude oil. Suzuki said the government will closely monitor the “side effects” of its Russia-oriented sanctions on the Japanese economy and financial markets and take appropriate steps in coordination with the Group of Seven and the international community. Meanwhile, Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, rose 45c, or 0.4%, to $122.05 a barrel on Thursday morning. US West Texas Intermediate futures were up about 15 cents, or 0.2%, at $115.07 a barrel. The British gas benchmark for day-ahead delivery jumped by 11.8% to close at 246.00 pence per therm on Wednesday. Repeated attempts by the United States’ top defence and military leaders to speak with their Russian counterparts have been rejected by Moscow, leaving officials in the dark about explanations for military movements and raising fears of a major miscalculation or battlefield accident, the Washington Post reports. Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, defense secretary Lloyd Austin and Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, have tried to set up phone calls with Russia’s defense minister Sergei Shoigu and Gen. Valery Gerasimov but the Russians “have so far declined to engage,” Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said in a statement Wednesday. James Stavridis, who served as the supreme allied commander at Nato from 2009 to 2013, said: There is a high risk of escalation without the firebreak of direct contact between the most senior officials. Very young people are flying in jets, operating warships, and conducting combat operations in the Ukrainian war. They are not seasoned diplomats, and their actions in the heat of operations can be misunderstood. We must avoid a scenario of Nato and Russia sleepwalking into war because senior leaders can’t pick up a phone and explain to each other what is happening.” Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy earlier called for the world to show solidarity with Ukraine by marking one month since Russia’s invasion began by gathering in their city centres and making themselves heard. “Come with Ukrainian symbols to support Ukraine, to support freedom, to support life.” Speaking in English, Zelenskiy also said that he would be watching to see which nations “sell out” on the issues of bolstering sanctions and energy. “Life can be protected only in unity. Freedom must be armed,” he said. Watch the video of Zelenskiy’s remarks below. Russia’s deputy ambassador to the UN has said Russia retains the right to use nuclear weapons if the country is “provoked” by Nato. In an interview with Sky News, Dmitry Polyanskiy was asked if Putin was right to hold the prospect of nuclear war over the rest of the world. He replied: If Russia is provoked by Nato, if Russia is attacked by Nato, I don’t know ... we are a nuclear power, why not? When pressed if his remarks were a “legitimate thing to be saying” Polyanskiy responded: I don’t think it’s the right thing to be saying. But it’s not the right thing to threaten Russia, and to try to interfere. So when you’re dealing with a nuclear power, of course, you have to calculate all the possible outcomes of your behaviour.” The White House has quietly assembled a team of national security officials to sketch out scenarios of how the United States and its allies should respond if Russian President Vladimir Putin unleashes his stockpiles of chemical, biological or nuclear weapons, the New York Times is reporting. The group, known as the Tiger Team, is also examining responses if Putin reaches into Nato territory to attack convoys bringing weapons and aid to Ukraine, according to several officials involved in the process. The team is also looking at responses if Russia seeks to extend the war to neighbouring nations, including Moldova and Georgia, and how to prepare European countries for the refugees flowing in on a scale not seen in decades, the Times reports. These plans are expected to be discussed in Brussels on Thursday, when US President Biden meets leaders of the 29 other Nato nations. As Biden flew to Europe on Wednesday, both he and Stoltenberg warned of growing evidence that Russia was in fact preparing to use chemical weapons in Ukraine. One major issue the Tiger Team is reportedly looking at is the threshold that could prompt the alliance to use military force in Ukraine. Biden has made clear that he is reluctant to to do so, fearing that direct confrontation with Russia could escalate the conflict beyond control. “That’s World War Three,” he said recently. The rouble has recovered more ground against the US dollar on Thursday in the wake of Vladiumir Putin’s decision to make “unfriendly countries” pay for Russian gas in the country’s currency. It rose 1.5% to 96.7 to the dollar in early trade on Thursday after closing up 6% at 97.7375 per dollar on Wednesday. The value of the rouble plummeted to as lows as 154 to the dollar in the first couple of weeks of the war after the US and its allies imposed sanctions on Russia and banned its central bank for intervening to prop up the currency. Putin’s move is clearly intended to ensure that the rouble rises again as other countries use their currencies to buy roubles to pay for the natural gas. (Nearly all Russian gas purchases are made in euros and dollars by the way.) They may also have to ignore their own sanctions and sell things to Russia in order to earn roubles. However, analysts painted some different scenarios for what might happen, including noting that the Russian gambit might just incentivise European countries to cut the umbilical cord of gas supplies more wquickly than they had already planned. Rystad Energy’s senior analyst Vinicius Romano said: Gas supply agreements are generally considered sacrosanct: and in an extreme scenario, insisting on rouble payments may give buyers cause to re-open other aspects of their contracts – such as the duration - and simply speed up their exit from Russian gas altogether. At face value this appears to be an attempt to prop up the Ruble by compelling gas buyers to buy the previously free-falling currency in order to pay. What is clear however, is that this has added another element of uncertainty to the already chaotic European gas market by complicating gas purchases that many countries have been reluctant to cut. It may also accelerate attempts by the EU to strike a deal with the US to supply more liquefied natural gas when leaders meet in Brussels today. US president Joe Biden may announce more details on this on Friday. Russia supplies 40% of the EU’s collective gas needs, 27% of its oil imports and 46% of coal imports. The risk of coup by Russia’s federal security service (FSB) against President Putin is growing every week that the war in Ukraine continues, a whistleblower at the heart of Russian intelligence has said. The whistleblower claims that chaos and discontent have engulfed the security services after Russia’s botched invasion of Ukraine. Letters written by an anonymous Russian intelligence analyst to Vladimir Osechkin, an exiled Russian activist and founder of the human rights group Gulagu.net, have since been published online. Osechkin told The Times that the risk taken by intelligence agents in speaking out was a sign of their growing anger towards Putin and discontent from the effect that sanctions have had on FSB officers who will no longer be able to “go on holidays to their villas in Italy and take their kids to Disneyland Paris”. Speaking from his home in France, where he has lived in exile since 2015, Osechkin told the newspaper: For 20 years Putin created stability in Russia. FSB officers, policemen, state prosecutors — those people inside the system — were able to live good lives. But now that has all gone. They recognise that this war is a catastrophe for the economy, for humanity. They don’t want to go back to the Soviet Union. For every week and every month that this war continues, the possibility of a rebellion by those in the security services increases.” Russia’s communications regulator has blocked the news aggregator service of Alphabet Inc’s Google, accusing it of allowing access to what it calls fake material about the country’s military operation in Ukraine, Interfax news agency reported on Wednesday. Google said in statement: We’ve confirmed that some people are having difficulty accessing the Google News app and website in Russia and that this is not due to any technical issues on our end. We’ve worked hard to keep information services like News accessible to people in Russia for as long as possible.” Interfax said Roskomnadzor, the regulator, had acted on a request from the office of Russia’s prosecutor general. “The American online news resource in question provided access to numerous publications and materials containing inauthentic and publicly important information about the course of the special military operation on the territory of Ukraine,” Interfax quoted the regulator as saying. Ukraine’s president has called for a global rally to protest Russia’s war on Ukraine, urging citizens of the world to publicly stand against the war. I ask you to stand against the war! Starting from March 24 – exactly one month after the Russian invasion… From this day and after then. Show your standing! Come from your offices, your homes, your schools and universities. Come in the name of peace. Come with Ukrainian symbols to support Ukraine, to support freedom, to support life. Come to your squares, your streets. Make yourselves visible and heard. Say that people matter. Freedom matters. Peace matters. Ukraine matters. From March 24. In downtowns of your cities. All as one together who want to stop the war.” Ukraine is using facial recognition software to identify the bodies of Russian soldiers killed in combat and to trace their families to inform them of their deaths, Ukraine’s vice prime minister told Reuters. Ukraine’s ministry of defence this month began using technology from Clearview AI, a US facial recognition provider that finds images on the web that match faces from uploaded photos. Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine’s vice prime minister who also runs the ministry of digital transformation, told Reuters Ukraine had been using Clearview AI software to find the social media accounts of dead Russian soldiers. From there, authorities are messaging relatives to make arrangements to collect the body, he said. Fedorov tweeted late on Wednesday: A month ago, we all worked on FaceID and CRM systems to process calls for eServices. Now, we work on automatic identification of occupiers’ corpses and autodial RU subscribers to tell the truth about the war.” “As a courtesy to the mothers of those soldiers, we are disseminating this information over social media to at least let families know that they they’ve lost their sons and to then enable them to come to collect their bodies,” Fedorov added in an interview. Fedorov declined to specify the number of bodies identified through facial recognition but he said the percentage of recognised individuals claimed by families has been “high.” Opponents of facial recognition, including civil rights groups, have decried Ukraine’s adoption of Clearview, citing the possibility of misidentification. Fedorov said Ukraine was not using the technology to identify its own troops killed in battle. He did not specify why. Ukraine’s ministry of internal affairs has been overseeing the country’s Look For Your Own project, a Telegram channel where it posts images of unidentified captured or killed Russian soldiers and invites claims from relatives. The Ukrainian government has an online form where Russian relatives can submit a claim to collect a body. Julian Borger, the Guardian’s world affairs editor, provides some more detail surrounding the formal accusation from the US that Russian forces are committing war crimes in Ukraine. The US has formally accused Russian forces of committing war crimes in Ukraine and said it would pursue accountability “using every tool available”. The announcement came as Joe Biden left for a trip to Europe to bolster western unity in the face of an increasingly brutal invasion. The secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said that the US had come to its conclusion using both public and intelligence sources. “Today, I can announce that, based on information currently available, the US government assesses that members of Russia’s forces have committed war crimes in Ukraine,” Blinken said. “As with any alleged crime, a court of law with jurisdiction over the crime is ultimately responsible for determining criminal guilt in specific cases,” he added, saying the US would continue its efforts to gather evidence and share it with international institutions. “We are committed to pursuing accountability using every tool available, including criminal prosecutions,” Blinken said. Jessica Elgot, the UK’s chief political correspondent, brings us more detail on Boris Johnson’s announcement Britain will provide of 6,000 weapons and £25m for Ukraine’s military. The UK will double the number of missiles it sends to Ukraine and urge western allies to step up provisions of lethal aid to the country, as the Russian invasion turns into a prolonged war of attrition. Boris Johnson will tell world leaders at the Nato summit on Thursday that the conflict is entering a new phase of aggression and humanitarian catastrophe with the siege of Mariupol and the indiscriminate attacks on civilians. Western officials have said that both the Ukrainians and the Russians are running short of weapons as the conflict grinds on due to Ukrainian defence that was far better than expected – and that they had anticipated they would be supporting a smaller Ukrainian insurgency by this stage. Ahead of the summit, Johnson said the UK would provide 6,000 new defensive missiles, including high-explosive weapons, and £25m from Foreign Office funds to help Ukraine pay its military and police forces. Not all of the missiles are expected to be next-generation light anti-tank weapons (NLAWs) – of which the UK has already provided more than 4,200. The additional weaponry means that the UK has now provided more than 10,000 missiles. It will be supplying Starstreak high-velocity anti-air missiles to help Ukrainians defend themselves against aerial bombings, as well as body armour, helmets and combat boots. A group of 54 Ukrainian orphans fleeing the horrors of Vladimir Putin’s bloody war arrived safely at Heathrow airport on Wednesday night. None of the children, from orphanages in Dnipro, central Ukraine, had been on a plane before. Aged between two and 18, they ran up and down the aisles, watched TV shows and played with Disney stuffed toys as they escaped the escalating Russian violence. Accompanied by five carers and a translator, the group were due to arrive from Poland on Monday but were held up by 48 hours due to a delay in providing crucial paperwork. Read the full story from Guardian reporter, Tom Ambrose, below. More images of the destruction of Ukraine’s cities has emerged. Abandoned tanks lie next to bombed apartment complexes while once-bustling city streets are seen reduced to rubble. Meanwhile, the UK’s ministry of defence has released its latest intelligence update, suggesting Ukraine is increasing pressure on Russian forces north-east of Kyiv while carrying out successful counter attacks against Russian positions in towns on the outskirts of the capital. Russian forces along this axis are already facing considerable supply and morale issues. Ukrainian forces are carrying out successful counter attacks against Russian positions in towns on the outskirts of the capital, and have probably retaken Makariv and Moschun. There is a realistic possibility that Ukrainian forces are now able to encircle Russian units in Bucha and Irpin. It is likely that successful counter attacks by Ukraine will disrupt the ability of Russian forces to reorganise and resume their own offensive towards Kyiv.” Referencing the Nato, EU and G7 summits that will take place in Brussels on Thursday, Zelenskiy urged for “meaningful steps” while noting the talks will reveal “who is a friend, who is a partner, and who betrayed us for money.” Politicians must also support freedom. All of them. They must support the struggle for life. We are waiting for meaningful steps. From Nato, the EU and the G7. We know that the Russians have already begun to lobby their interests. These are the interests of war. We know that they are working with some partners. We know that they want to put this issue out. The struggle against war. But this is the war that needs to be put out. Our firm position will be represented at these three summits. At these three summits we will see: Who is a friend, who is a partner, and who betrayed us for money.” Zelenskiy continued to say Ukrainian sky has not been made safe from Russian missiles and bombs, urging for more support in weapons. We have not received aircraft and modern anti-missile weapons. We have not received tanks, anti-ship equipment. Russian forces can keep killing thousands of our citizens, destroying our cities. Just because there are too many invaders. Just because Russia has been preparing for such a war for decades. We asked to close our sky. And we asked for assistance from Nato to be effective and without limits. Any support in weapons that we need. We asked the Alliance to say it will fully help Ukraine win this war, clear our territories of the invaders and restore peace in Ukraine.” Zelenskiy addressed the citizens of Russia separately. I am sure that there are many of you who are disgusted by the policy of your state. Who are already just sick of what you see on TV. Of the lies of your propagandists on the Internet. Propagandists who are paid by your taxes. And they lie about the war, which is paid for by your taxes. And which makes all the citizens of Russia poorer. Poorer every day. Isn’t that stupid? Your state collects taxes from you to make you poorer. To isolate you from the world. To make it easier for them to control you. And easier to send you to the war to die. The president continued to assert that Ukraine “has never threatened the security of Russia”. We are doing everything to end this war. And when we succeed - it will certainly happen - you will be sure of at least one thing: your children will no longer be sent to die on our land, on our territory. Therefore, you, the citizens of Russia, are also interested in peace. Save your sons from the war. Tell the truth about the war. And if you can leave Russia so as not to give your taxes to the war, do it.” Zelenskiy has drawn on the wider existential implications of Russia’s war. The war of Russia is not only the war against Ukraine. Its meaning is much wider. Russia started the war against freedom as it is. Zelenskiy continued to state that it is “only the beginning for Russia” by invading Ukrainian land. Russia is trying to defeat the freedom of all people in Europe. Of all the people in the world. It tries to show that only crude and cruel force matters. It tries to show that people do not matter, as well as everything else that makes us people. That’s the reason we all must stop Russia. The world must stop the war.” The Ukrainian leader added: “This is a war for independence. And we must win.” Hello it’s Samantha Lock with you as we continue to provide today’s rolling coverage of the crisis unfolding in Ukraine. In what has become a nightly routine, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has once again given a moving national address. Noting the significance of 24 March as marking one month since Russia launched its war against Ukraine, he said: It’s already a month of our defence against the attempt to destroy us. Wipe off the face of the earth. The original plan of the Russian troops failed already in the first days of the invasion. They thought Ukrainians would be frightened. They thought Ukrainians would not fight. They were wrong. They know nothing about us, about Ukrainians. They know nothing at all about freedom. About how valuable it is. They do not know how freedom enriches life. Gives meaning to life.” The US government announced that it believes that war crimes have been committed in Ukraine based on its assessment of evidence that civilians have been deliberately targeted. The US also said it would announce a package of Russia-related sanctions against political figures and oligarchs on Thursday while US president Joe Biden meets with Nato leaders on Ukraine. Nato announced it will double its troops along the alliance’s eastern flank. “The first step is the deployment of four new NATO battlegroups in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia, along with our existing forces in the Baltic countries and Poland,” said the alliance’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg. Russian climate envoy Anatoly Chubais has stepped down and left the country in protest against president Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine. He is the highest-level official to break with the Kremlin over the invasion. Ludmila Denisova, Ukraine’s human rights ombudsman, claimed that the population in the city of Chernihiv, just north of Kyiv, had effectively been turned into hostages by Russian forces who have cut off the main routes for humanitarian aid. Officials in Chernihiv said they were now running out of drinkable water. The Pentagon, in a briefing with reporters, said Russian troops are adopting defensive positions north of Kyiv, rather than advancing, while Russian efforts elsewhere have stalled. Ukraine’s counter-offensive near Kyiv has pushed Russian forces further from the capital, having been driven back about 15 miles. Vladimir Putin said Russia planned to switch payments for its gas sales to “unfriendly” countries to roubles, in a move which has alarmed international markets. The announcement sent European futures Soarin over concerns the switch would exacerbate a looming energy crisis by jamming up deals that run to hundreds of millions of dollars every day. – Guardian staff “We all must stop Russia. The world must stop the war,” Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his latest address, posted on Telegram. “The acts of terror against peaceful people go on. One month already. That long. It breaks my heart, hearts of all Ukrainians and every free person on the planet. That’s why I ask you to stand against the war,” he said. Britain is providing Ukraine with 6,000 new defensive missiles and extra funds to support the Ukrainian military and BBC journalists providing news coverage in the region. Reuters reports: British prime minister Boris Johnson will announce the new package of support on Thursday at the Nato and G7 leaders’ meetings while also signalling a willingness to bolster Ukraine’s defence capabilities further, his office said on Wednesday. “The United Kingdom will work with our allies to step up military and economic support to Ukraine, strengthening their defences as they turn the tide in this fight,” Johnson said. “One month into this crisis, the international community faces a choice. We can keep the flame of freedom alive in Ukraine, or risk it being snuffed out across Europe and the world.” As part of the package, the UK will provide 6,000 missiles and £25m in financial backing for the Ukrainian military. It will also provide £4.1m for the BBC World Service to help support its Ukrainian- and Russian-language services, and tackle disinformation. Britain said with the new commitment it will have provided up to 10,000 missiles and that the additional funds come on top of £400m committed in humanitarian and economic aid. Thursday’s Nato summit in Brussels is expected to unlock additional aid for Kyiv including equipment to help Ukraine protect against chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats. A US state department spokesperson has confirmed that the US embassy has received a list of diplomats from Russia who are considered “persona non grata” by the Russian foreign ministry. The spokesperson characterized the move as unhelpful and counterproductive, emphasizing the need to keep diplomatic communication open. The move is a reaction to the US’s expulsion of 12 Russian diplomats at the UN. The US characterized those diplomats as “intelligence operatives” who were “engaging in espionage activities that are adverse to our national security”. Nato estimates that between 7,000 and 15,000 Russian soldiers have been killed since the beginning of the war. The AP reports: By way of comparison, Russia lost about 15,000 troops over 10 years in Afghanistan. A senior Nato military official said the alliance’s estimate was based on information from Ukrainian authorities, what Russia has released intentionally or not and intelligence gathered from open sources. The official spoke on condition of anonymity under ground rules set by Nato. Ukraine has released little information about its own military losses, and the west has not given an estimate, but Volodymr Zelenskiy said nearly two weeks ago that about 1,300 Ukrainian servicemen had been killed. When Russia unleashed its invasion Feb. 24 in Europe’s biggest offensive since World War II, a swift toppling of Ukraine’s government seemed likely. But with Wednesday marking four full weeks of fighting, Moscow is bogged down in a grinding military campaign. With its ground forces slowed or stopped by hit-and-run Ukrainian units armed with western-supplied weapons, Russian president Vladimir Putin’s troops are bombarding targets from afar, falling back on the tactics they used in reducing cities to rubble in Syria and Chechnya. A Russian call for aid in Ukraine – one that doesn’t at all mention Russia’s role in creating a humanitarian crisis there – was voted down by the UN security council. Reuters reports: Only Russia and China voted yes, and the remaining 13 members of the security council abstained from voting on the Russia-drafted proposal. “If Russia cared about the humanitarian situation, it would stop bombing children and end their siege tactics. But they haven’t,” Britain’s UN ambassador, Barbara Woodward, told the council after the vote. Russia denies attacking civilians. A security council resolution needs at least nine votes in favor and no vetoes by Russia, China, Britain, France or the United States to be adopted. Moscow had scrapped a planned security council vote last Friday after accusing western countries of an “unprecedented pressure” campaign against the measure. The United States rejected Russia’s allegation. Russia proposed the text after France and Mexico withdrew their own push for a security council resolution on Ukraine’s humanitarian situation because they said it would have been vetoed by Moscow. That draft would have criticized Russia for its role in creating the humanitarian situation in Ukraine. Ukraine and its allies are instead planning to put a similar draft resolution to a vote this week in the 193-member general assembly where no country wields a veto. General assembly resolutions are nonbinding, but they carry political weight. “In one month Russia caused one of the fastest growing humanitarian catastrophes in the world,” the US ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, told the general assembly earlier on Wednesday. A diplomatic tit-for-tat has been escalating at the world body since Russia launched what it calls a “special military operation” on Feb. 24 that is says aims to destroy Ukraine’s military infrastructure. UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres on Tuesday blasted Russia’s “absurd war”. Officials in Chernihiv said they were now running out of drinkable water, in a grim forewarning of a humanitarian disaster to match that of the flattened port of Mariupol, in the south-east of the country, from where 100,000 people are struggling to flee. “The number of tanks for drinking water is limited,” Chernihiv officials said in a warning to civilians on Wednesday. “Due to this, in order to protect the population of the city, starting from [Thursday] restrictions are imposed on the distribution of drinking water. Water will be poured in the amount of 10 litres per person.” Lyudmila Denisova, Ukraine’s human rights ombudsman, claimed that the population was being held hostage, with the Ukrainian government fearful that the Kremlin is seeking to push its “maximalist” demands in the current peace negotiations with Kyiv by ratcheting up the targeting of civilians. Denisova said: “Today Chernihiv remains completely cut off from the capital. The occupiers bombed the bridge across the River Desna, through which we transported humanitarian aid to the city and evacuated civilians. “The city has no electricity, water, heat and almost no gas, infrastructure is destroyed. According to local residents, the occupiers are compiling lists of civilians for the ‘evacuation’ to Lgov [in the Kursk region of Russia]. The racists, cutting off Chernihiv from the capital, turned its inhabitants into hostages.” Read more: Satellite images show the extent of the damage that Russian forces have caused in Mariupol. The images show fires burning in residential neighborhoods and burned-up apartment buildings. An estimated 300,000 people in the city are without food and water. Israel blocked Ukraine from buying NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware for fear that Russian officials would be angered by the sale of the sophisticated hacking tool to a regional foe, according to people familiar with the matter. The revelation, following a joint investigation by the Guardian and Washington Post, offers new insight into the way Israel’s relationship with Russia has at times undermined Ukraine’s offensive capabilities – and contradicted US priorities. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has been critical of Israel’s stance since Russia launched its full and bloody invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, saying in a recent address before members of Israel’s Knesset that Israel would have to “give answers” on why it had not given weapons to Ukraine or applied sanctions on Russians. People with direct knowledge of the matter say that, dating back to at least 2019, Ukrainian officials lobbied Israel to try to convince it to license the spyware tool for use by Ukraine. But those efforts were rebuffed and NSO Group, which is regulated by the Israeli ministry of defense, was never permitted to market or sell the company’s spyware to Ukraine. When it is successfully deployed against a target, Pegasus can be used to hack into any mobile phone and intercept phone conversations, read text messages, or view a user’s photographs. It can also be used as a remote listening device, because a government user of the spyware can use it to remotely turn a mobile phone recorder on and off. Read more: The US held off on sanctioning Roman Abramovich after Ukraine’s president said the Russian oligarch could prove an important go-between in Ukraine-Russia peace talks, the Wall Street Journal reported. The UK and EU have imposed sanctions on Abramovich, with the EU claiming his ‘privileged access’ to Putin has “helped him to maintain his considerable wealth”. Abramovich, who owns Chelsea football club, has not been named on the US sanctions list, although a number of US-based hedge funds have reportedly agreed to freeze his assets under guidance from the UK. On Monday the New York Times reported that Abramovich had used shell companies to “quietly place billions of dollars with prominent U.S. hedge funds and private equity firms”. Although Zelensky reportedly believed Abramovich could help negotiate peace, US officials told the WSJ “they have no reason to believe Mr. Abramovich has been particularly helpful in the talks between the Ukrainian and Russian governments, and intelligence assessments have, in fact, suggested otherwise”. The newspaper reported that there was skepticism within the Ukrainian government and other western administrations about exactly how helpful Abramovich had been so far. Several UK and European officials say they have no knowledge of Zelensky making a specific plea to their leaders not to levy sanctions on Mr Abramovich. Several Ukrainian officials and officials from other Western governments are also skeptical about how deeply Mr Abramovich is involved in the peace talks. The Pentagon, in a briefing with reporters, said Russian troops are adopting defensive positions north of Kyiv, rather than advancing, while Russian efforts elsewhere have stalled. US security correspondents have been tweeting details from the briefing. Jack Detsch, a reporter at Foreign Policy, tweeted that Ukraine’s counter-offensive near Kyiv has pushed Russian forces further from the capital. Russian fighters have been driven back 15 miles in the past few days, Detsch reported. The Pentagon said Russia has now launched more than 1,200 missiles, Jeff Seldin, a correspondent at Voice of America, reported. The Pentagon also said Russian troops north of Kyiv were now assuming defensive positions, rather than continuing their assault. Carla Babb, a correspondent at Voice of America, said Russian troops have also stalled outside Chernihiv, towards the Belarus border. About 150,000 people are stuck in Chernihiv after Russia cut them off from the capital, Kyiv, 100 miles south, by bombing a road bridge across the Desna River. Vladimir Putin said Russia planned to switch payments for its gas sales to “unfriendly” countries to roubles, in a move which has alarmed international markets. The announcement sent European futures soaring, Reuters reported, over concerns the switch would exacerbate a looming energy crisis by jamming up deals that run to hundreds of millions of dollars every day. Russian gas accounts for some 40% of Europe’s total gas consumption. Reuters reported: Moscow has drawn up a list of “unfriendly” countries which corresponds to those that imposed sanctions. They include the United States, European Union members, Britain and Japan, among others. Russia would continue to supply natural gas in line with previously concluded contracts, Putin said at a televised meeting with government ministers. “The changes will only affect the currency of payment, which will be changed to Russian roubles,” he said. With a host of European countries still dependent on Moscow for much of their energy supplies, Putin is counting that receiving payment in roubles could boost the decimated Russian currency. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is “gravely concerned” about the “safety and security of [Ukraine’s] nuclear facilities”, the group’s director general said. Rafael Mariano Grossi said “the need to prevent a nuclear accident becomes more pressing with each day that passes”, in a statement urging authorities to allow IAEA experts and equipments to evaluate Ukraine’s nuclear reactors. Russia took control of the abandoned Chernobyl power plant in February, and on Tuesday Ukraine warned that the Russian control was hampering efforts to control forest fires within the Chernobyl exclusion zone. Ukraine has 15 nuclear reactors, several of which are now under Russian control, and Grossi said IAEA is hoping to send in experts to “ensure the safety and security of its nuclear facilities and prevent the risk of a severe accident that could threaten both people and the environment”. Here’s the summary of the key events from the afternoon of day 28 of the Russian invasion in Ukraine: The US government announced that it believes that war crimes have been committed in Ukraine based on its assessment of evidence that civilians have been deliberately targeted. The US also said it would announce a package of Russia-related sanctions against political figures and oligarchs on Thursday while US president Joe Biden meets with Nato leaders on Ukraine. The mayor of Kyiv said one person was killed and two seriously wounded on Wednesday after shells hit a shopping centre’s parking lot in a northern district of the Ukrainian capital. Nato said it was considering whether to ramp up military forces on its border with Ukraine, with an announcement anticipated on Thursday. Russian climate envoy Anatoly Chubais has stepped down and left the country in protest against president Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine, making him the highest-level official to break with the Kremlin over the invasion. Ludmila Denisova, Ukraine’s human rights ombudsman, claimed that the population in the city of Cherniv, just north of Kiev, had effectively been turned into hostages by Russian forces who have cut off the main routes for humanitarian aid That’s all from me for today. I’m now passing you over to my colleague in New York, Adam Gabbatt, who’ll be keeping you updated for the rest of the evening. Thanks for tuning in. A Russian journalist has died after she was hit by Russian shelling in Kyiv while filming destruction from rocket fire in a shopping centre in the Podolsky district. Oksana Baulina, a video journalist for the Insider, an independent news website based in Russia, and also an activist, died alongside one other civilian, while two people accompanying her were wounded and hospitalised. Baulina was in Ukraine as a correspondent, where she dispatched reports from Lviv and Kyiv, with a focus on Russian government corruption. Baulina began her career working lifestyle magazines including Time Out Moscow and In Style, but after a decade she shifted to more political work, becoming a producer for the Anti-Corruption Foundation. She was briefly jailed after the Russian police stormed the headquarters of the independent Anti-Corruption Foundation where she was coordinating a live broadcast from a national rally. After the Russian government classified the organisation as extremist, she had to leave the country, where she continued her reporting work for the Insider, which specialises in investigations, fact-checking and political analysis, and Coda Story, which investigates authoritarianism. In a new article reporting her death, the Insider said it “expresses its deepest condolences to Oksana’s family and friends”. The publication added: “We will continue to cover the war in Ukraine, including such Russian war crimes as indiscriminate shelling of residential areas which result in the deaths of civilians and journalists.” There are growing concerns over the dangers faced by Ukrainian journalists covering Russia’s invasion of their country. Photojournalist Maks Levin has not been heard from since 13 March. The Committee to Protect Journalists said two other journalists, Oleh Baturyn and Viktoria Roshchina, had previously gone missing but have since been released by their abductors, who are presumed to belong to the Russian armed forces. Reporters Without Borders (RSF) said that targeting journalists was a war crime, and added that three other journalists had been abducted since the invasion. Nato must face a Russian adversary that is more unpredictable and ready to take greater risks to project power in Europe, according to a US general, warning that studying Russian capabilities and military doctrine was no longer enough. Reuters reports: Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow launched on 24 February and calls a “special military operation”, has jolted analysts’ assumptions that Russian president Vladimir Putin would always take calibrated risks, use limited ground forces and find diplomatic exit strategies, as he did in his 2014 annexation of Crimea and his intervention in Syria from 2015. By contrast, Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine – the biggest military mobilisation since World War Two – involves siege warfare, escalation tactics such as putting nuclear forces on alert and exposing the Russian economy to massive western sanctions to achieve military goals. Speaking to reporters during Nato exercises in Norway, US general David Berger said: “We have a clear understanding of what their capabilities are. And we’ve studied their doctrine for a long time. “Their decision-making on the part of the president, that’s another factor, whether or not they would do something. “I think the lesson learned here is you can’t predict what a dictator might do,” he said of Putin, who the west says has become increasingly authoritarian, crushing dissent at home. Russia has said it will throw out a number of American diplomats in response to a US move to expel Russian staff from the permanent UN mission. Interfax news agency also said the foreign ministry had told the United States any hostile actions against Russia would provoke a decisive response. The US government believes that war crimes have been committed in Ukraine based on its assessment of evidence that civilians have been deliberately targeted. Here’s the statement by the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, published today (edited for length): Since launching his unprovoked and unjust war of choice, Russian President Vladimir Putin has unleashed unrelenting violence that has caused death and destruction across Ukraine. We’ve seen numerous credible reports of indiscriminate attacks and attacks deliberately targeting civilians, as well as other atrocities. Russia’s forces have destroyed apartment buildings, schools, hospitals, critical infrastructure, civilian vehicles, shopping centers, and ambulances, leaving thousands of innocent civilians killed or wounded. Last week, I echoed President Biden’s statement, based on the countless accounts and images of destruction and suffering we have all seen, that war crimes had been committed by Putin’s forces in Ukraine. I noted then that the deliberate targeting of civilians is a war crime. I emphasised that Department of State and other U.S. government experts were documenting and assessing potential war crimes in Ukraine. Today, I can announce that, based on information currently available, the US government assesses that members of Russia’s forces have committed war crimes in Ukraine. As with any alleged crime, a court of law with jurisdiction over the crime is ultimately responsible for determining criminal guilt in specific cases. The US government will continue to track reports of war crimes and will share information we gather with allies, partners, and international institutions and organisations, as appropriate. We are committed to pursuing accountability using every tool available, including criminal prosecutions. The United States will announce a package of Russia-related sanctions against political figures and oligarchs on Thursday while US President Joe Biden meets with Nato leaders on Ukraine. US national security adviser Jake Sullivan, who spoke to reporters as Biden headed to Brussels for the Nato summit, said G7 leaders will also agree on Thursday to coordinate on sanctions enforcement and plan to issue a statement. He also said officials will have more to say on Friday about European energy issues, adding that the US would look to increase supplies of liquified natural gas to Europe in the coming weeks. Google has promised to pause all ads containing content that exploits, dismisses or condones the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, joining a raft of major social media platforms that have introduced new content restrictions. This includes blocking Russian state media RT and Sputnik in the European Union. Earlier this month, Google said it had stopped selling all online ads in Russia. French companies including carmaker Renault and retailer Auchan must leave the Russian market, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy told French lawmakers on Wednesday. In an address via video link to France’s national assembly, Zelenskiy said: Renault, Auchan, Leroy Merlin must stop being sponsors of the Russian war machine, stop financing the murder of children and women, of rape. “French companies must leave the Russian market.” Russia held a funeral service for the deputy commander of its Black Sea Fleet in annexed Crimea on Wednesday, the latest in what Ukraine says is a string of high-ranking Russian military casualties. Reuters reports: Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak on Sunday named six Russian generals who he said had been killed in Ukraine along with dozens of colonels and other officers. Russia’s defence ministry has not confirmed any of those casualties. It has not revised its troop casualties since 2 March, a week into the war, when it said that 498 of its soldiers had died. Ukraine puts the figure at 15,600. Reuters could not independently verify most of Ukraine’s claims, but some have been confirmed from Russian sources. The Guardian’s defence editor, Dan Sabbagh, has been speaking to officials in the west with knowledge of the situation in Ukraine to understand their perspective on how the conflict is evolving: Western officials’ “greatest concern” for Ukraine’s military prospects is that Russia is grinding its way to an inevitable and bloody victory in Mariupol, which will in turn free up its force to move north and attack Kyiv’s elite troops defending the Donbas from three directions. They say that Russia has lost the ability to fight an offensive on “multiple axes” because of the casualties it has suffered - around 7,000 to 8,000 killed - on its disastrous offensive and is now focusing on one principal battle at a time while its attack on the Ukrainian capital has essentially stalled. “I think the challenge is once Mariupol falls and is taken, and I think there’s a grim reality around Mariupol with the kind of reckless and inhumane nature of the operation there,” one said. An estimated 100,000 people remain in the bombed and encircled port city. Another official said this would give Russia “the opportunity to bring in more firepower and to move north”, which could allow Moscow’s forces to encircle the Ukranian’s most experienced fighting forces in the east of the country. “This is probably the area where we have the greatest concern,” the official added. The mayor of Kyiv said one person was killed and two seriously wounded on Wednesday after shells hit a shopping centre’s parking lot in a northern district of the Ukrainian capital. Mayor Vitali Klitschko said in an online post: The enemy continues to fire at the capital.” Russia denies targeting civilians. European Union countries will start discussing “fair burden sharing” in hosting millions of Ukranian refugees. The EU will not allocate a number of refugees each country must take, Home Affairs Commissioner Ylva Johansson said, avoiding a repeat of failures during the last major refugee influx in 2015-16 when the 27 member states squabbled bitterly over who should take in how many refugees among the 1 million who had fled the war in Syria. She said “fair burden-sharing” would be addressed by the bloc’s 27 national migration ministers at emergency talks on Monday. “It needs to be developed,” she told a news conference. Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed the conflict in Ukraine by telephone with Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett on Wednesday, the Kremlin said in a statement. Bennett “shared his assessment of the situation around Ukraine, taking into account his contacts with leaders of a number of foreign countries, and expressed several ideas in relation to the ongoing negotiations”, the statement said. Sweden will provide Ukraine with an additional 5,000 anti-tank weapons, the Swedish defence minister told the country’s TT news agency. Sweden has already sent 5,000 anti-tank weapons, along with other military materiel to Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Wednesday said he had spoken with the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, who had assured his support for Ukraine ahead of Nato, G7 and EU summits. “Received assurances of his [Johnson’s] support on the eve of tomorrow’s important meetings. Discussed the course of hostilities and defense assistance to Ukraine,” Zelenskiy said on Twitter. Thursday’s Nato summit in Brussels is expected to agree additional aid for Kyiv including equipment to protect against chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats. Reporting from the New York Times estimates that at least 1,500 civilian buildings, structures and vehicles in Ukraine have been damaged or destroyed in the weeks since the invasion began. Nato will likely decide on Thursday to ramp up military forces on its eastern flank, according to the alliance’s chief Jens Stoltenberg. Reuters reports: Nato has sharply increased its presence at the eastern border of the alliance, with some 40,000 troops spread from the Baltic to the Black Sea, and is seeking to deploy four new combat units in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia. “I expect leaders will agree to strengthen Nato’s posture in all domains, with major increases in the eastern part of the alliance. On land, in the air and at sea,” Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg told a news conference ahead of a Nato summit in Brussels on Thursday. The additional multinational battlegroups come on top of four existing combat units, with a total of some 5,000 troops, deployed by Nato to the three Baltic states and Poland after Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014. A regular war bulletin from Ukraine’s embassy in the US contains the following summary of the conflict: 121 children have died and 167 children have been wounded since the conflict began, from the unified register of pre-trial investigations and unconfirmed sources Russian combat losses recorded by Ukraine between 24 February and 23 March included 15,600 personnel, 517 tanks and 101 aircraft 9 million Ukrainians have been forced to leave their homes, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said Ukraine is continuing to mount a defence operation in the eastern, southern, and north-eastern directions, including holding defences in the besieged cities of Mariupol and Chernihiv and holding back Russia’s advancement towards Kyiv. Russian Olympic athletes who participated in a rally supporting Vladimir Putin and the invasion of Ukraine are facing a backlash, with one losing a sponsorship deal and facing a disciplinary investigation. Medalists from cross-country skiing, gymnastics, figure skating and swimming gathered on stage at the Luzhniki Stadium on Friday as part of the concert and entertainment program around Putin’s speech. Olympic champion swimmer Evgeny Rylov is under investigation for attending the event, the sport’s governing body told the Associated Press. Rylov has also lost his endorsement deal with swimwear manufacturer Speedo because of his involvement in the rally. Most of the athletes, including Rylov, were pictured wearing jackets with a “Z” on the chest at the rally. The letter isn’t part of the Russian alphabet but has become a symbol of support for Russian troops after it was used as a marker on Russian armoured vehicles operating in Ukraine. Other Olympic medalists in attendance included figure skaters Victoria Sinitsina, Nikita Katsalapov, Evgenia Tarasova and Vladimir Morozov; cross-country skier Alexander Bolshunov; and rhythmic gymnastics twin sisters Dina and Arina Averina. The athletes stood on stage as the national anthem was played in an apparent reference to how Russian teams at last year’s Summer Olympics in Tokyo and this year’s Winter Olympics in Beijing didn’t have the anthem at their ceremonies due to a worldwide ban for Russia’s state-sponsored doping programme. Read more here: Russian athletes face backlash after wearing ‘Z’ symbol at Putin rally The UK’s Ministry of Defence (MoD) has made public a letter dated from yesterday that it says it has sent to YouTube, asking them to remove a video clip of a hoax call to the defence secretary, Ben Wallace. Wallace took the call from Vladimir Kuznetsov and Alexey Stolyarov, who are known as Vovan and Lexus, believing it was Denys Shmyhal, the Ukrainian prime minister. In the letter, the MoD say that the clips which have emerged have been doctored, and object to two passages in particular. They write: The doctored clip asserts that the UK’s supply of NLAWS to Ukraine have ‘often failed’. Our NLAWS have not failed, this is factually incorrect. They also dispute the accuracy of Wallace appearing to say that the UK has weapons supply issues. The letter says: We have no supply shortages. Information of this nature affects the UK’s ability to maintain our national defensive capability and reputation as an international and Nato ally. It concludes: I am confident you would not wish to be a conduit for Russian propaganda or be in any way associated with the potential consequences of this type of media manipulation. The invasion of Ukraine by Russian forces has taken place while the world is still dealing with the coronavirus pandemic. Surplus personal protective equipment (PPE) stock worth £3.5m is now being sent to Ukraine by the Department of Health in Northern Ireland. The items include masks, coveralls, oxygen therapy consumables and sterile gowns. PA Media quote Northern Ireland’s health minister Robin Swann saying: These supplies have played an important role in the acute phase of the crisis response. My officials continue to work closely with the UK government, UK Health Security Agency and the other devolved administrations to mobilise a variety of items including equipment, such as monitors and medical consumable items, personal protective equipment and medicines, in response to specific requests from the government of Ukraine. The Russian Football Federation has unexpectedly declared an interest in hosting either Euro2028 or Euro2032, despite their teams currently being banned from Uefa and Fifa competitions because of the invasion of Ukraine. A meeting of the Russian Football Union executive committee today decided to “support the decision to declare interest”. “We are going to file a bid for hosting of the 2028 and 2032 European Championships,” RFU board member Sergei Anokhin said on broadcaster Match TV. It had been anticipated that Uefa would shortly select the UK and Ireland as hosts of Euro2028 on the basis that they were the sole bid. The venue of the 2018 World Cup Final, Luzhniki Stadium, was used last week for a national rally featuring President Vladimir Putin. Rajan Menon is senior research fellow at the Saltzman Institute of War and Peace Studies at Columbia University, and he writes for us today on how, one month in, the war on Ukraine has not unfolded as many had predicted it might: The Ukrainians mounted a surprisingly stiff resistance from the get-go, partly because they were defending their homeland, partly because they had been preparing for this eventuality, and partly because of the weapons and training provided them since 2015 by the United States, Britain, and Canada. Still, the balance of power overwhelmingly favored Russia, whether in the number of troops, the quantity of major armaments, and their technological caliber. So lopsided was the advantage that it was hardly unreasonable to assume that the Russian juggernaut would roll over the Ukrainians’ valiant resistance and conquer their major cities. Assaying the military balance between two putative adversaries involves, in part, bean counting – so many of this weapon, so many of that, and so on – but the exercise generally proves valid when the results massively favour one side. The exceptions are remembered because they are uncommon. This war has been one of those atypical instances. Even if it ends with Ukraine’s defeat – something that remains possible – this surely is not the campaign Putin and his generals had in mind. You can read more of Rajan Menon’s analysis here: Nearly a month in, the Russia-Ukraine war is defying all expectations There’s more detail on Reuters on Belarus’s decision to expel Ukrainian diplomats: Close Russia ally Belarus has told Ukraine to cut its diplomatic presence in the country citing unfriendly actions and meddling in its internal affairs, the Belarusian foreign ministry said on Wednesday. Russia has used Belarusian territory as a staging post for its attack on Ukraine and the Ukrainian president’s office on Sunday warned it saw a high risk of an attack on western Ukraine’s Volyn region being launched from Belarus. The foreign ministry said in a statement that an unspecified number of Ukrainian diplomats would have to leave within 72 hours and that the Ukrainian consulate in the city of Brest would be closed due to a lack of staff. It said the Ukrainian ambassador and four other diplomats would be allowed to stay. A Russian reporter under investigation for spreading false information about the war in Ukraine has defended his claims on social media that Russian forces had shelled a maternity hospital. Reuters reports: In an open letter to Russia’s top investigator, Alexander Bastrykin, prominent journalist Alexander Nevzorov said he was being blamed for drawing his conclusions from the international media, which had access to proof of what happened, rather than from the Russian defence ministry. He also said the criminal law, which could see journalists jailed for up to 15 years for purposefully spreading false information, contradicted freedom of speech provisions in the Russian constitution and media law. The Investigative Committee law enforcement agency said it had opened a case against Nevzorov for posting on Instagram and YouTube that Russia’s armed forces had deliberately shelled a maternity hospital in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol. Nevzorov said the case against him was meant as a signal to journalists in Russia that “the regime is not going to spare anyone, and that any attempts to comprehend the criminal war will end in prison”. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov declined to comment on Nevzorov’s specific case, but said the tough new law was justified by what he called the most brutal information war being waged against Russia. Iran’s priority is to strengthen strategic ties with Syria in response to a changing geopolitical landscape following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Reuters reports: Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian told reporters on his arrival in Damascus that his country stood with Syria in “the same trench” and that ties with were going through their best phase. “We are talking about strategic ties and today, aside from all the dimensions of our relationship, the issue of economic relations is the priority,” he told reporters. Syrian Foreign Minister Faisal Mekdad said the Ukraine crisis and its repercussions would be a focus for talks between the two Middle East allies, both under Western sanctions. “We are holding talks after the major developments after the Russian operation [in Ukraine] and we will discuss our joint positions towards these developments,” Mekdad added. The initial impact of the EU’s sanctions against Moscow in response to its invasion of Ukraine has led to a greater drop in trade between Finland and Russia than when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. Reuters reports: Finnish Customs recorded a roughly 60% drop in both imports from Russia and exports from Finland to Russia in the last two weeks compared with the previous two weeks before the EU began to impose sanctions, director of statistics at Finnish customs Olli-Pekka Penttila told Reuters. “In the 1990s there were no sanctions, payment transactions functioned and there were no reputational risks (for companies). Now all these three are reality and it means that the impact is certainly bigger than it was in the 1990s,” Penttila said. He said financial sanctions were having a greater impact than export sanctions, with the biggest impact resulting from reputational risks as Western companies withdraw voluntarily from Russia to avoid being reprimanded by clients for staying. There is “a real threat” of Russia using chemical weapons against Ukraine, according to US President Joe Biden, who answered questions as he departed for Europe to attend the Nato summit. Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered Gazprom to convert oil and gas contracts with hostile countries into roubles to boost the currency. Russian newspaper Kommersant reports: In Putin’s opinion, supplying Russian goods to the EU and the USA and receiving payment in dollars and euros “does not make any sense for us”. In response, the rouble rose on the Moscow Exchange. Videos circulating on social media purport to show a volley of missiles being launched from a ship near the Black Sea port of Sevastopol, Crimea. The Russian military said a combat ship launched eight cruise missiles against Ukrainian military infrastructure on 22 March. Belarus has told some Ukrainian diplomats to leave the country and plans to shut the Ukrainian consulate in the southwestern city of Brest, which is close to the borders of Poland and Ukraine, according to the Belarusian news agency Belta. On Tuesday the Belarusian security service, the KGB, accused eight Ukrainian diplomats of espionage. Russian climate envoy Anatoly Chubais has stepped down and left the country in protest against President Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine, making him the highest-level official to break with the Kremlin over the invasion. Bloomberg reports: Chubais, 66, is one of the few 1990s-era economic reformers who’d remained in Putin’s government and had maintained close ties with Western officials. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Since the war, the government has stepped up pressure on domestic critics of the invasion. Putin warned on 16 March that he would cleanse Russia of the “scum and traitors” he accuses of working covertly for the US and its allies. Facing economic meltdown, the Russian leader accused the West of wanting to destroy Russia. Nestlé is suspending brands including KitKat and Nesquik, among others, in Russia. A Nestlé spokesperson said: We are focused on providing essential foods such as baby food and medical/hospital nutrition products. This means we will suspend the vast majority of our pre-war volume in Russia.” Citizens in France, Germany, Italy and Sweden overwhelmingly support stronger and further-reaching sanctions against Russia, even if they lead to increased economic hardship at home, new polling shows The poll, commissioned by the Kyiv School of Economics and undertaken in mid-March, revealed that 47% believe that current sanctions against Russia do not go far enough, while 76% said “sanctions should remain for as long as is needed to stop the war, even if this negatively impacts my cost of living”, compared with 24% who said “due to their impact on my cost of living, sanctions should be removed and normal trade should resume”. This consensus held in each of the four countries polled. Just 13% believe current sanctions go too far. When asked what they thought to their country purchasing Russian oil and gas, 30% thought cutting off oil and gas would increase prices too much; 23% thought continuing to import Russian oil and gas was morally wrong; 22% said it was a risk to European security and 18% said it was a national embarrassment. Many Europeans (26%) are also considering opening their homes to refugees from the war, and are either planning to do so (7%), have seriously considered at some point (17%) or are already hosting a Ukrainian refugee family (3%). The Kyiv School of Economics is calling for European countries to introduce five measures, including disconnecting Russian and Belarussian banks from the Swift payment system, banning exports of arms and other military equipment to Russia, an energy export embargo, closing ports to all Russian ships and imposing personal sanctions on individuals connected to Putin. The Guardian’s UK tech editor, Alex Hern, has some insight on video game Fortnite’s fundraising effort: The video game Fortnite has raised $50m (£38m) in aid for Ukraine in just three days, after Epic Games announced it would be donating 100% of its income from the game’s current chapter, which runs from 20 March through to 3 April. It’s an astronomical sum to have raised, a fifth of the total raised by the entire Disasters Emergency Committee fundraising appeal over its first two weeks, and will be split between the UN’s UNHCR, Unicef and World Food Programme appeals, as well as the charity Direct Relief. Epic Games has been donating 100% of its net proceeds from Fortnite since its latest chapter launched, and hit the $50m total less than a quarter of the way through the run. As well as the important impact of the donation, it’s a canny effort to head off some potential bad press: the latest update to Fortnite is rather unfortunately themed around an invasion plot line that calls on the player to “join the resistance in the final battle to free the zero point”. Owing to the timescales of game development, that decision will have been made months before Russia invaded, but Epic Games possibly felt it had to make clear that the company wasn’t trying to cash in on the invasion. There are growing concerns about the situation in the encircled city of Chernihiv, north of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. Ludmila Denisova, Ukraine’s human rights ombudsman, claimed that the population had effectively been turned into hostages by Russian forces who have cut off the main routes for humanitarian aid. She said: “Today Chernihiv remains completely cut off from the capital. The occupiers bombed the bridge across the river Desna, through which transported humanitarian aid to the city and evacuated civilians. “The city has no electricity, water, heat and almost no gas, infrastructure is destroyed. According to local residents, the occupiers are compiling lists of civilians for the ‘evacuation’ to Lgov [Kursk region of Russia]. The racists, cutting off Chernihiv from the capital, turned its inhabitants into hostages.” Chernihiv, which has a population of nearly 290,000 people, has been under siege by Russian forces for 12 days. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, accused Russian forces of seizing a humanitarian convoy near Mangush west of Mariupol. “Employees of the state emergency service and bus drivers have been taken captive,” he said, adding that 100,000 people remained in the city living “in inhumane conditions. In a total blockade. Without food, water, medication. Under constant shelling, under constant bombing”. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said agreement had been reached to try to evacuate civilians trapped in Ukrainian towns and cities through nine “humanitarian corridors” on Wednesday, but no agreement had been reached to establish a safe corridor from the heart of Mariupol. The governor of the Luhansk region in eastern Ukraine said agreement had been reached on a local ceasefire to evacuate civilians trapped by fighting. The assessment by the UK’s MoD is that the battlefield across northern Ukraine remains largely static with Russian forces likely conducting a period of reorganisation before resuming large-scale offensive operations. Russia’s defence ministry has said Russian forces hit a Ukrainian arms depot outside the country’s northwestern city of Rivne on Tuesday, destroying an arsenal of weapons and equipment. Russia has warned Nato of dire consequences if it were to agree to send some peacekeeping forces into Ukraine. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said: “It would be a very reckless and extremely dangerous decision.” Ukraine needs more long-range anti-tank weapons, the country’s ambassador to the UK has said. China has backed Russia over suggestions that G20 expulsion could follow their invasion of Ukraine. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said: “The G20 is the main forum for international economic cooperation. Russia is an important member, and no member has the right to expel another country.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has addressed the Japanese parliament over videolink, thanking them for leading the way among Asian countries in condemning Russia’s invasion and introducing sanctions. Poland’s internal security and counter-espionage service ABW has identified 45 Russian diplomats as suspected spies and called on the foreign ministry to expel them. Russia has threatened to retaliate. Speaking to the Italian parliament, Italian prime minister, Mario Draghi, said Russian President Vladimir Putin did not appear to be interested in agreeing a ceasefire that could allow negotiations to end the conflict to succeed. I am handing you over now to my colleague Rachel Hall. Some more images are coming through this morning of the impact the latest Russian bombardment is having on Kyiv. Russia has warned Nato of dire consequences if it were to agree to send some peacekeeping forces into Ukraine. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said: “It would be a very reckless and extremely dangerous decision.” He told reporters on a conference call that any possible contact between Russian and Nato forces “could have clear consequences that would be hard to repair”. Poland said last Friday it would formally submit a proposal for a peacekeeping mission in Ukraine at the next Nato summit. US President Joe Biden is flying to Europe for an emergency Nato summit in Brussels tomorrow. Reuters report that Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov also attacked the proposal in remarks to staff and students at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations on Wednesday. “This will be the direct clash between the Russian and Nato armed forces that everyone has not only tried to avoid but said should not take place in principle,” he said. Also on the energy supplies front, Agence France-Presse report from France that TotalEnergies’ chief executive said his company could not stop buying Russian natural gas in retaliation for Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, saying it would force a partial economic shutdown in Europe. The French energy giant had announced yesterday that it would stop buying Russia’s oil and petroleum products by the end of this year, the latest of several multinationals to halt or curtail their operations in the country. But CEO Patrick Pouyanne said ending its natural gas purchases from Russia would effectively hand over billions of euros to Russian investors. “I know how to replace this oil and diesel fuel,” Pouyanne told RTL radio, but “with gas, I don’t know how to do it. I don’t know how to replace it, there isn’t any other available, and I have 25-year contracts that I can’t get out of.” Unless European governments impose sanctions on Russian gas, which would allow companies to declare force majeure to break contracts, he argued that pulling out of existing deals would require TotalEnergies to pay billions in penalties to its Russian partners. In a budget speech to parliament, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz struck a more cautious tone on reducing Germany’s energy dependence on Russia than some of his ministers have done in recent days. Scholz told the Bundestag lower house of parliament: “Yes, we will end this dependency - as soon as possible. But to do this from one day to the next would mean plunging our country and the whole of Europe into a recession.” “Hundreds of thousands of jobs would be in danger. Whole branches of industry would be on the brink,” he said. “Sanctions should not hurt European states harder than the Russian leadership.” “Putin needs to hear the truth about the war in Ukraine. And that truth is: the war is destroying Ukraine. But with the war, Putin is also destroying Russia’s future,” Scholz told the lawmakers. Ukraine needs more long-range anti-tank weapons, the country’s ambassador to the UK has said. Vadym Prystaiko also told Sky News that the Ukrainian army need their weapon stocks replenishing. He said: “We didn’t have enough [weapons] in the first place. So, we’re running out of weaponry. That’s what we’ll be seeing in the week to come.” PA Media quote him adding “Tomorrow, President Zelensky will talk to Nato, the whole of Nato, and we will see how can we replenish our stocks and what we can have that has a much longer range and is stronger than ever. “We have enough weapons to stop tanks immediately when they approach us. But to clear out our land we need to have something with a much greater distance.” Emergency services in Ukraine hves issued a couple more handout photos today of damage done to Mykolaiv. The city is near the Black Sea, in between Odesa and Kherson. Yesterday there was some chatter about the possibility that Russia might be expelled from the G20 group of the world’s largest economies, sparked by a Polish minister saying they had raised the possibility in a meeting with Washngton where it received a warm welcome. Jake Sullivan, the US White House National Security Advisor, has gone on record saying: “On the question of the G20, I will just say this: We believe that it cannot be business as usual for Russia in international institutions and in the international community.” China, today, have indicated that they would not be on board with any such plan. Agence France-Presse report from Beijing that Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told reporters: The G20 is the main forum for international economic cooperation. Russia is an important member, and no member has the right to expel another country. This has not gone unnoticed in the Kremlin, where Reuters report that a spokesperson has said that some countries in the G20 are holding their own sovereign points of view, despite pressure from the US. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has given his latest videolink address to a foreign parliament to Japan. In the session he thanked them for leading the way among Asian countries in condemning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and introducing sanctions. Reuters report he also asked Japan to increase sanctions pressure on Russia by introducing a trade embargo on Russian goods. Zelenskiy looks set to address the Swedish parliament on Thursday. Poland’s internal security and counter-espionage service ABW has identified 45 Russian diplomats as suspected spies and called on the foreign ministry to expel them, its spokesperson has said. Agence France-Presse report that Stanislaw Zaryn told reporters “The internal security agency has drawn up a list of 45 people working in Poland under the cover of diplomatic activities,” accusing the suspects of targeting Poland. He said the list of suspects had been transferred to the foreign ministry, tweeting that “ABW is requesting that they be expelled from Polish territory”. The ABW “has detained a Polish national on suspicion of espionage for the Russian secret services,” the spokesperson added on Twitter. It is reported that the Russian ambassador had been summoned to the foreign ministry in Warsaw. The RIA news agency in Russia is reporting that the foreign ministry there is already committed to retaliating if its diplomats are expelled from Poland. Shelling has taken place overnight and again this morning in Kyiv, leading to some more dramatic images as firefighters attempt to control the impact. Last night, in his nightly address, Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said that bus drivers and emergency services personnel seeking to rescue people from the port city of Mariupol through a route agreed by the Russian forces had been taken prisoner. On Wednesday, Iryna Vereshchuk, a deputy prime minister, provided more details. In total, more than 7,000 civilians in Mariupol were rescued on Tuesday, she said, but the Russian forces violated a deal on providing safe passage through a number of agreed humanitarian corridors. Vereshchuk said: “Unfortunately, the occupying forces violated the agreement and did not allow buses to evacuate Mariupol residents from the village of Nikolske and the village of Melekino. “There are eleven buses and two vehicles of the State Emergency Service that were seized at a Russian checkpoint at the entrance to the city of Mangush and taken away in an unknown direction. “The occupiers also took hostage 4 [emergency service] officers and 11 drivers. We demand from the International Committee of the Red Cross and the United Nations to do everything urgently to ensure that our people are released immediately”. The Financial Times newspaper in the UK is carrying a letter today from Carl Scott, formerly a UK defence attaché in Moscow. He is keen to point out that in his view the UK prioritised the City of London’s economic relationship with Russian money over the ominous developments taking place under Putin’s watch while Scott was in Moscow from 2011 to 2016. He writes: This long, dark march to war was obvious, the path to conflict lit by the many pronouncements emanating from the dark red walls of Vladimir Putin’s palace. We reported the inevitability of conflict in detail, regularly and with the despair of Cassandra. The evidence of Putin’s chosen path was never concealed. His many declarations were meant to be heard and understood. It was not until I returned to the UK on the eve of our withdrawal from the EU, a manoeuvre which greatly emboldened those in Moscow, that I understood how our society had changed in the years I was serving overseas. All was subjugated to the City, all served the interests of our lucrative status as a safe haven for corrupt, and corrupting, wealth. Read more here: FT Letters – A defence attaché despairs at inevitability of conflict Former Surrey fast bowler Stuart Meaker has been interviewed by Sky News in the UK this morning. He is currently in Poland working with volunteers helping refugees process their visa applications to reach the UK after fleeing Ukraine. He left The Kia Oval with a vanful of aid for refugees a week ago. He was critical of the process being forced upon refugees by the British government, saying that they are being obliged to ask 3-years-olds, who have fled with just a teddy and a bag of clothes, whether they have a military background or any prior convictions. For adults, Meaker complained that they are being asked to produce mortgage deeds, which they are unlikely to have packed, and he said that it is taking five to six hours on average to process the applications for the refugees. He said: “We’re struggling to be able to get people to connect with families in the UK, and it’s just not working. It’s almost like we don’t want them to come.” There are quite a lot of diplomatic lines floating around on the newswires at the moment. Two that have caught the eye are Russia’s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov warning that sending peacekeepers into Ukraine might lead to direct conflict between Russia and Nato, and that negotiations with Ukraine are “difficult” because Kyiv is constantly changing its position. In Poland, meanwhile, Reuters are suggesting that the Russian ambassador has been summoned to the Polish foreign ministry, as rumours swirl that Poland is about to expel as many as 40 Russian diplomats. Speaking to the Italian parliament, Italian prime minister Mario Draghi said Russian President Vladimir Putin did not appear to be interested in agreeing a ceasefire that could allow negotiations to end the conflict to succeed. Reuters also report that Draghi urged China not to support Russia and to join efforts to bring peace to Ukraine. The Ukrainian central bank has asked the SWIFT network to switch the Russian central bank off from its financial messaging system. “We hope for your support and assistance in order to save the lives of thousands of Ukrainians and protect the sovereignty of our country,” Governor Kyrylo Shevchenko said in a statement, Reuters report. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov has been speaking at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations. It has been a basic re-stating of Russia’s case for war, saying that the West considers the invasion to have started on 24 February because they discount all the things that happened before then, and sprinkled with references to neo-Nazis and “cancel culture” and the West “playing with words”. We have a photo gallery today featuring Orthodox monks at the remote 15th-century Putna Monastery in the hills of north-eastern Romania have opening their doors to Ukrainians fleeing war. Russia’s Defence Ministry has said Russian forces hit a Ukrainian arms depot outside the country’s northwestern city of Rivne on Tuesday, destroying an arsenal of weapons and equipment. The ministry said it had struck the depot using high-precision, long-range weapons fired from the sea. Reuters says it was unable to independently verify the report. Estonia is calling for Nato to abandon its current “tripwire” posture in eastern Europe and build up a permanent force in the region capable of stopping a Russian offensive. Ahead of Thursday’s Nato summit, Jonatan Vseviov, the permanent secretary of the Estonian foreign ministry, said the Europe and the North Atlantic alliance could never return to the world it knew before the 24 February Russian invasion of Ukraine. “We will be in a totally new security environment. There will be a new Ukraine. There will be a new Russia. There will be a new Europe. There is no going back to 23 February,” Vseviov told the Guardian in an interview in Washington. More than 20,000 Nato troops, the overwhelming majority of them US forces, have been deployed to the Baltic states, Poland and the rest of eastern Europe in the aftermath of the invasion.

Iryna Vereshchuk said agreement has been reached to try to evacuate civilians trapped in Ukrainian towns and cities through nine “humanitarian corridors”, but no agreement had been reached with Russia to establish a safe corridor from the heart of Mariupol. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov will meet the head of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Peter Maurer, in Moscow in Thursday, the Russian foreign ministry has announced. Reuters report that the foreign ministry said in a statement “The agenda of the meeting envisages discussion of the key areas of the ICRC’s work in the field of humanitarian response.” An ICRC spokesperson had already said on Tuesday that Maurer would be in Moscow for talks on the Ukraine conflict A four-generation family of 10 who fled the war-torn Ukrainian city of Kharkiv are moving into a home in Cambridgeshire, donated for their use by a businessman. The family, ranging in age from 10 to 90, have come to the UK under the Ukraine Family Scheme and were helped by their relative Roman Starkov, who is a British citizen. The software developer helped his family through the visa process which he described as “pretty involved”. “You have to fill out arcane forms, and for such a big group there’s a lot of repetition,” he said. His 90-year-old grandmother Ludmila Starkova does not have a valid international passport. “On every border that was a challenge,” he said. Sam Russell reports for PA that Mick Swinhoe bought the house next to his own just before the war broke out, and initially planned to use it as a “project house”, but said he wants the house to be used for “something more useful. I can do what I want to do later when things get better.” Starkov’s sister Valeriia Starkova, 37, said her journey by car to the UK took 20 days and they were “exhausted”. “We were in the basement,” she said. “We couldn’t go outside. We stayed five days in the basement without going anywhere. Then we decided that we had to leave as we couldn’t sleep, it was so scary. We just put our bags in the cars and went.” Starkov said he has “mixed emotions” now his family have safely fled Ukraine. “Yes they are safe, that’s amazing,” he said. “There’s a lot of uncertainty about their future here. Will they fit in, will they find a place, will they feel comfortable? I don’t know. They’ve still lost everything.” There are some strong words being quoted this morning from former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev. He has said that “The West has acted in a disgusting, criminal, and amoral way” in relation to Russia. According to quotes posted by Reuters, he additionally said that the United States has tried to “humiliate, limit, divide and destroy Russia”, and that the US “risks becoming the last refuge of those who are falling into senility.” The 56 year old is currently the Kremlin’s Deputy Chairman of the Security Council of Russia. Hello, it is Martin Belam in London taking over from Samantha Lock in Sydney. In the last few minutes the UK’s Ministry of Defence has issued its latest daily “Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine”. They claim: The battlefield across northern Ukraine remains largely static with Russian forces likely conducting a period of reorganisation before resuming large-scale offensive operations. Russian forces are attempting to envelop Ukrainian forces in the east of the country as they advance from the direction of Kharkiv in the north and Mariupol in the south. Russian forces are still attempting to circumvent Mykolaiv as they look to drive west towards Odesa. The governor of the Luhansk region in eastern Ukraine said agreement had been reached on a local ceasefire to evacuate civilians trapped by fighting. Reuters note that Governor Serhiy Gaidai said on the Telegram messaging app that the ceasefire would come into force at 9am local time, which is 0700 GMT. Unconfirmed reports are filtering in that a bridge that was crucial for bringing in humanitarian aid and evacuating civilians was bombed by Russian forces overnight in Chernihiv. Advisor to Ukraine’s interior ministry, Anton Gerashchenko, reported the news on his Telegram account early this morning, citing confirmation from the head of the Chernihiv Regional State Administration, Vyacheslav Chaus. Chernihiv is located about 150km north-east of Kyiv. Here is a comprehensive rundown on where the crisis currently stands: Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy accused Russian forces of seizing a humanitarian convoy near Mangush west of Mariupol. “Employees of the state emergency service and bus drivers have been taken captive,” he said, adding that 100,000 people remained in the city living “in inhumane conditions. In a total blockade. Without food, water, medication. Under constant shelling, under constant bombing”. Russian forces are now inside Mariupol, a senior US defence official said. Two “super-powerful bombs” rocked the city on Tuesday even as rescue efforts were ongoing, local authorities said. Ukraine’s armed forces say its military continues to defend the southern port city of Mariupol as well as Chernihiv to deter Russia’s advance towards Kyiv, according to a report as of 6am this morning. Officials said rebels operating in Belarus against Russia’s war on Ukraine partially removed a railway connection between Belarus and Ukraine. The Ukrainian army also claimed that Russia has resorted to recruiting former soldiers to join its war effort in order to make up for heavy losses. Russia’s combat power in Ukraine has declined below 90% of its pre-invasion levels for the first time since its attack began, a senior US defence official said on Tuesday, suggesting heavy losses of weaponry and growing casualties and describing morale issues, command-and-control problems, a reliance on conscripts and a stalled advance to Kyiv. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov refused to rule out the use of nuclear weapons in an interview with CNN on Tuesday. Peskov told the broadcaster that such arms could be used if Russia faced an “existential threat”. Russia has the world’s largest stockpile of nuclear warheads. The Pentagon later condemned Peskov’s refusal to rule out the use of nuclear weapons. US President Joe Biden will depart on Wednesday to fly to Brussels where he is expected to announce new sanctions against Russia and new measures to tighten existing ones. The deputy head of Kyiv’s police force has accused Russia of using white phosphorous munitions in the city of Kramatorsk in Donetsk. Oleksiy Biloshytskiy shared online footage, which could not be independently verified, of material burning fiercely underneath a pile of aggregate. “Another use of phosphorus ammunitions in Kramatorsk,” he said. Zelenskiy will speak virtually at the Nato summit in Brussels on Thursday, where US president Joe Biden is also planning to push for new sanctions against Russia. “Three important summits are scheduled this week: G7, Nato and the EU,” he said. “New packages of sanctions, new support.” About 300,000 people in the occupied southern city of Kherson are running out of food and medical supplies, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s foreign ministry said. Kherson was the first major Ukrainian city to fall into Russian hands since the invasion began on 24 February. Russia plans to unleash a “great terror” on Kherson by kidnapping residents and taking them across the Russian border, an FSB whistleblower has claimed. The Kremlin was no longer willing to “play nicely” with protesters in the Ukrainian city, a letter said. Russian forces have only three further days of fuel, food and ammunition left to conduct the war after a breakdown in their supply chains, Ukrainian military commanders have claimed. The statements were described as “plausible” by western officials. Russian forces have “kidnapped” 2,389 children from the Russian-controlled territories of Luhansk and Donetsk, the US embassy in Kyiv has said, citing figures by Ukraine’s foreign ministry. The embassy said: “This is not assistance. It is kidnapping.” The Ukrainian health minister, Viktor Lyashko, said 10 hospitals had been completely destroyed since Russia invaded. Other hospitals could not be restocked with medicines and supplies because of nearby fighting, the minister added. The UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, said it is time for Russia to end its “absurd” and “unwinnable” war in Ukraine, as the EU prepared to set up a “trust fund” aimed at helping Kyiv repel the invasion and rebuild afterwards. Speaking to reporters at the UN’s headquarters in New York, Guterres said the war was “going nowhere, fast”. The United States and its western allies are assessing whether Russia should remain within the Group of Twenty (G20) grouping of major economies following its invasion of Ukraine, sources involved in the discussions told Reuters on Tuesday. The war in Ukraine has killed 121 children so far, the office of the prosecutor general said on Wednesday in a message on Telegram, adding that the number of wounded children stood at 167. The United Nations will face three resolutions today on the worsening humanitarian situation in Ukraine after Russia decided to call for a vote on its Security Council resolution that makes no mention of its attack on Ukraine. In case you missed this briefing from senior US defense officials, here is a quick recap. Russia’s combat power in Ukraine has declined below 90% of its pre-invasion levels for the first time since its attack began, a senior US defence official said on Tuesday, suggesting heavy losses of weaponry and growing casualties. The United States has estimated Russia assembled more than 150,000 troops around Ukraine before the 24 February invasion, along with enough aircraft, artillery, tanks and other firepower for its full-scale attack. The US defence official, on condition of anonymity and according to a transcript published by the US department of defense, told reporters: We assess Russian combat power at just below 90 percent. They’re expending an awful lot, but they also built up an awful lot since the early fall, and they just have a lot available to them. For the first time they may be just a little bit below 90 percent.” The official did not provide evidence for the claims. The defense official also gave a critical review of Russia’s ability to take over Ukraine, describing morale issues, command-and-control problems, a reliance on conscripts and a stalled advance to Kyiv. The official said: We still hold them about 30 kilometres to the east of Kyiv, which is where they were last week. The official also described morale issues inside Russian ranks Anecdotally, we still assess that the Russians are experiencing morale issues at various levels and at various places ... They did not expect this level of resistance. Describing a reliance on conscript soldiers, the official added: Some of them were not told what they were actually going to be doing inside Ukraine. We know they relied on conscripts, and they still do. I mean, still it has been largely a conscript army. And so these are very young men who haven’t -- don’t have a long experience with soldiering and -- and we believe that all those factors are combining to affect their morale.” Additionally, the official said Russian forces continue to be plagued by logistical problems. We believe that they are having command-and-control problems just in terms of communications. I mean, they just weren’t fully-prepared for operations of this intensity for this long on so many different multiple lines of attack.” Ultimately, the official said Russia has not achieved its objectives, which is population centres so that they could occupy and take over Ukraine. The war in Ukraine has killed 121 children so far, the office of the prosecutor general said on Wednesday in a message on Telegram, adding that the number of wounded children stood at 167. The latest United Nations report on civilian casualties as of 10pm 21 March recorded 2,510 civilian casualties, including 953 killed and 1,557 injured. Of the 953 who have been killed, the agency said this comprised of 192 men, 142 women, 12 girls, and 26 boys, as well as 40 children and 541 adults whose sex is yet unknown. The United Nations will face three resolutions today on the worsening humanitarian situation in Ukraine after Russia decided to call for a vote on its Security Council resolution that makes no mention of its attack on Ukraine. The General Assembly is scheduled to start considering two rival resolutions Wednesday morning — one supported by Ukraine and western nations that makes clear Russia is responsible for the escalating humanitarian crisis and the other sponsored by South Africa that doesn’t mention Russia, the Associated Press reports. The Security Council will vote on the third resolution, which is sponsored by Russia and widely criticised for not referring to its invasion of Ukraine. Russia had cancelled a council vote on the measure last Friday as diplomats predicted it would be overwhelmingly defeated. Russia’s deputy UN ambassador, Dmitry Polyansky, told reporters on Tuesday that Russia had now asked for a vote on Wednesday. It was scheduled to be held after the Security Council’s scheduled meeting Wednesday morning on its cooperation with the Arab League. Polyansky said if Western nations don’t support the Russian resolution it will be “a reflection of their hypocrisy” and refusal to support a purely humanitarian measure “without any politicisation,” just like other humanitarian resolutions adopted by the 15-member council. Ukrainian civilians continue to flee their homeland. According to UNHCR figures, more than 3,557,245 Ukrainians have fled since Russia invaded on 24 February. Russian troops continue to advance on key cities across Ukraine. The latest conviction of imprisoned Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny on Tuesday reflects the Russian government’s intensified crackdown on dissent and free expression, Human Rights Watch has said. Hugh Williamson, Europe and central Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement: This verdict is apparently intended not only to silence Navalny but to serve as a warning to Russian civil society and anyone who dares to stand up to the Kremlin’s policies.” Navalny is already serving a two-and-a-half-year sentence and was found guilty of embezzling money from his own Anti-Corruption Foundation and sentenced to a further nine years in prison. The cases against Navalny are part of the Kremlin’s grim landscape of repression against Russia’s civil society and peaceful dissent, which has drastically intensified since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The Kremlin seems determined to isolate Russian society from the outside world to cut Russians off from uncomfortable facts, including about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. So it’s hardly surprising that Russian authorities are doubling down on smearing and silencing Navalny and others who can tell people not to believe the Kremlin’s lies and that the world is watching.” Ukraine’s armed forces has released its operational report as of 6am this morning, claiming its military continues to defend the southern port city of Mariupol as well as Chernihiv to deter Russia’s advance towards Kyiv. Notably, officials said rebels operating in Belarus against Russia’s war on Ukraine partially removed a railway connection between Belarus and Ukraine. “On the territory of Belarus, representatives of the opposition forces and caring citizens, who condemn the contribution of the current illegal power of the Russian Federation in the war with Ukraine, partially removed the railway connection between the Republic of Belarus and Ukraine. The information is being specified,” the report, published by Ukraine’s the ministry of defence, read. The Ukrainian army also claimed that Russia has resorted to recruiting former soldiers to join its war effort in order to make up for heavy losses. Russian military officials have been actively recruiting former servicemen particularly “those who already have combat experience”, the Ukrainian military said. Officials added that 17 Russian air targets were destroyed over the past 24 hours, including 6 aircraft, 5 UAVS, 1 helicopter and 5 winged missiles. Russian President Vladimir Putin intends to attend a G20 summit being hosted by Indonesia later this year, Russia’s ambassador in Jakarta said on Wednesday, following calls by some members for the country to be barred from the group. “Not only G20, many organisations are trying to expel Russia....the reaction of the west is absolutely disproportional,” ambassador Lyudmila Vorobieva told a news conference on Wednesday. The United States and its western allies are assessing whether Russia should remain within the Group of Twenty (G20) grouping of major economies following its invasion of Ukraine, sources involved in the discussions told the news agency earlier on Tuesday. The Pentagon has condemned Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov’s refusal to rule out the use of nuclear weapons during the Ukraine conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin raised the threat of using nuclear weapons and in an interview with CNN on Tuesday, Peskov refused to rule out their use. Peskov told the broadcaster that such arms could be used if Russia faced an “existential threat”. Russia has the world’s largest stockpile of nuclear warheads. US department of defense spokesman John Kirby said Moscow’s nuclear remarks were “dangerous”. Speaking to reporters, he said: It’s not the way a responsible nuclear power should act.” However, Kirby added that Pentagon officials “haven’t seen anything that would lead us to conclude that we need to change our strategic deterrent posture”. “We monitor this as best we can every day,” he added. Former US Defense Secretary Leon Panetta also criticised Peskov’s comments. “I don’t see how you can see it any other way but as dangerous when Russia is looking for a possible excuse for the use of low-yield nuclear weapons,” Panetta told CNN. “And basing it frankly on a very false premise that somehow Russia is being threatened. I think that presents a real concern that Russia at least is considering that possibility.” Scenes of normality contrast with the catastrophic attacks Russia continues to launch on Ukraine. The United States and its western allies are assessing whether Russia should remain within the Group of Twenty (G20) grouping of major economies following its invasion of Ukraine, sources involved in the discussions told Reuters on Tuesday. The likelihood that any bid to exclude Russia outright would be vetoed by others in the club - which includes China, India, Saudi Arabia and others - raised the prospect of some countries instead skipping G20 meetings this year, the sources said. The G20 along with the smaller Group of Seven - comprising just the United States, France, Germany, Italy, Canada, Japan and Britain - is a key international platform for coordinating everything from climate change action to cross-border debt. According to Reuters, a senior G7 source said: There have been discussions about whether it’s appropriate for Russia to be part of the G20. If Russia remains a member, it will become a less useful organisation.” Asked whether US President Joe Biden would move to push Russia out of the G20 when he meets with allies in Brussels this week, national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters at the White House Tuesday: “We believe that it cannot be business as usual for Russia in international institutions and in the international community.” However, the United States plans to consult with its allies before any other pronouncements are made, he said. A European Union source separately confirmed the discussions about Russia’s status at forthcoming meetings of the G20, whose rotating chair is currently held by Indonesia. “It has been made very clear to Indonesia that Russia’s presence at forthcoming ministerial meetings would be highly problematic for European countries,” said the source, adding there was however no clear process for excluding a country. US President Joe Biden is expected to announce new sanctions against Russia and new measures to tighten existing ones when he visits Brussels this week. Biden will meet with leaders of Nato, the EU and G7 on Thursday, where he is expected to announce new sanctions on more than 300 members of Russia’s lower house of parliament as soon as Thursday, according to The Wall Street Journal, which cited unnamed officials and internal documents. “No final decisions have been made about who we will sanction and how many we will sanction,” said a White House spokesperson. “We will have additional sanctions measures to announce that will be rolled out in conjunction with our allies on Thursday when the President has the opportunity to speak with them.” Biden’s Europe trip is also set to include an announcement on joint action to enhance energy security on the continent, which is highly reliant on Russian gas, and a visit to Poland to show solidarity with Ukraine’s neighbour. The US president will also announce more US aid to help tackle the growing refugee crisis in Poland and other eastern European countries, the White House said. In a statement, the White House said Biden will also outline “further American contributions to a coordinated humanitarian response to ease the suffering of civilians inside Ukraine and to respond to the growing flow of refugees”. In Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s nightly national address, the Ukrainian president provided an update on the situation unfolding in Mariupol, saying there are still 100,000 people in the city living in “inhumane” conditions while accusing Russian forces of seizing a humanitarian convoy near Mangush, just 20km south-west of Mariupol. As of today, there are about 100,000 people in the city. In inhumane conditions. In a total blockade. Without food, water, medication. Under constant shelling, under constant bombing.” The president added that officials are continuing to attempt to organise humanitarian corridors for Mariupol residents but efforts have been sabotaged by continued shelling. Sadly, almost all of our efforts are sabotaged by Russian occupants, by [their] shelling or deliberate terror. Today, one of the humanitarian convoys was seized by occupants on an arranged route near Mangush. Employees of the State Emergency Service and bus drivers have been taken captive. We are doing everything to set our people free and unblocked the movement of humanitarian cargo.” Despite the difficulties, Zelenskiy said 7,026 people were able to be saved from Mariupol with efforts continuing to arrange humanitarian corridors in Kyiv, Kharkiv, Zaporizhia, and Luhansk regions. Zelenskiy wrapped up his nightly address by promising he was continuing to work “to push Russia towards peace”. We are continuing to work on various levels to push Russia towards peace, towards the end of this brutal war. Ukrainian representatives are continuing negotiations that basically take place daily. It is very hard, sometimes, scandalous. But step by step we are moving forward.” Zelenskiy also noted the three summits scheduled for this week: G7, Nato and the EU. New packages of sanctions, new support. We’ll keep working and will keep fighting as much as we can. Until the end. Courageously and openly. On all of those platforms. With full energy. With all our strength. And we will not get tired. We will have rest when we win. And it will definitely happen.” Hello it’s Samantha Lock with you and we unpack all the latest developments in Ukraine. It is the morning of day 28 of Russia’s war on Ukraine. Casualties are in the thousands and millions have fled the country seeking refuge abroad. Here is a comprehensive rundown on where the crisis currently stands: Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy accused Russian forces of seizing a humanitarian convoy near Mangush west of Mariupol. “Employees of the state emergency service and bus drivers have been taken captive,” he said, adding that 100,000 people remained in the city living “in inhumane conditions.

You can keep up to date with all the latest developments in the link below. If you have just joined us, here is a quick recap of where the situation stands: US president Joe Biden has denied he is calling for regime change in Russia, after he said during a visit to Poland that Putin “cannot remain in power”. When asked by a reporter if he wanted to see Russian president Vladimir Putin removed from office he said “no”. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, had already distanced himself from Biden’s comments, while the UK cabinet minister Nadhim Zahawi distanced the UK government from his remarks. Representatives from Russia and Ukraine will meet this week for a new round of talks aimed at ending the war. Ukraine said the two sides would meet in Turkey on Monday. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy used a video interview with independent Russian media outlets to signal his willingness to discuss having Ukraine adopt a “neutral status”, and also make compromises about the status of the eastern Donbas region, in order to secure a peace agreement with Russia. But he said he was not willing to discuss Ukrainian demilitarisation, and that Ukrainians would need to vote in a referendum to approve their country adopting a neutral status. In a separate late-night video, Zelenskiy promised to work this week for new sanctions against Russia and spoke of the impending new round negotiations, saying “we are looking for peace without delay.” Zelenskiy also claimed that 2,000 children from Mariupol have been taken by Russia, according to a press release published by the president’s office late on Sunday. “According to our data, more than 2,000 children were deported. Which means they were abducted. Because we do not know the exact locations of all these children. There were children with and without parents. It’s a catastrophe, it’s horrible.” Zelenskiy said the city remained blocked by the Russian military, describing the situation as a humanitarian catastrophe. “Food, medicine, and water can’t be delivered. The Russian troops are shelling humanitarian convoys and killing drivers.” Ukraine’s deputy prime minister has accused Russia of “irresponsible” acts around the occupied Chernobyl power station that could send radiation across much of Europe, and urged the United Nations to dispatch a mission to assess the risks in an update to her Telegram account. The UK Ministry of Defence said Russia is “effectively isolating Ukraine from international maritime trade”, in an update late Sunday. It also said Russian naval forces were continuing to conduct sporadic missile strikes against targets across Ukraine. The Ukrainian military claimed Russia has withdrawn troops that were surrounding Kyiv after suffering significant losses in its latest operational report. Russia’s communications and internet regulator said in a public statement it would investigate the outlets that interviewed Zelenskiy, and has told them not to distribute the interview. Putin is seeking to split Ukraine into two, emulating the postwar division between North and South Korea, Ukraine’s military intelligence chief has said. In comments that raise the prospect of a long and bitter frozen conflict, General Kyrylo Budanov, warned of bloody guerrilla warfare. The French foreign minister said on Sunday there would be “collective guilt” if nothing was done to help civilians in Mariupol, the Ukrainian city besieged by Russian forces. The UK government’s top legal adviser has appointed a war crimes lawyer to advise Ukraine on the Russian invasion. The attorney general, Suella Braverman, announced on Sunday that Sir Howard Morrison QC would act as an independent adviser to the Ukrainian prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, Press Association reported. Germany is considering purchasing a missile defence system to shield against a potential attack from Russia, Chancellor Olaf Scholz said late on Sunday. Despite reports that Zelenskiy had been pushing to speak on video during the Academy Awards ceremony in Los Angeles tonight, attendees instead observed a 30-second silence as tribute to the people of Ukraine. The risks are stacking up for Asia’s once-promising economic recovery from the pandemic, thanks to the war in Ukraine, US policy rate rises, spiking energy prices, and escalating Covid cases in China. Analysts at S&amp;P Global Ratings said on Monday that these new risks will lead to inflation across Asia Pacific, and that they will dent an otherwise strong rebound from the pandemic. “We have generally lowered our growth forecasts across Asia-Pacific and raised our inflation expectations. This reflects already-higher energy and commodity prices, an expectation of Fed interest rate increases, and the volatility and inflation effects of the Russia-Ukraine war,” they said. Stock markets in Asia were down on Monday with the Nikkei losing 0.4%. The weekend once again saw dozens of protests against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine continue in cities across the world. In case you missed it earlier, our correspondent in Delhi has been looking at why Indian popular opinion has remained even-handed about Russia and its invasion of Ukraine. One man tells Amrit Dhillon that India’s close ties with the old Soviet regimes of the 50s and 60s created a lasting bond of “brothers” between the two countries. Another man, an electrician, says that Russia could have legitimate claim to Ukraine: “I hear that Ukraine used to be a part of Russia, but instead of respecting that, Nato is pulling Ukraine into its own orbit. But war is never good for anyone and the Russian bombing of civilians is not the way to solve these differences. They must sit down and talk.” You can read the full story here: Civilians in Ukraine continue to fight back in creative, new ways. According to Belarusian journalist Hanna Liubakova, who is based in the western city of Lviv, local coffee shops are displaying Russian losses in their windows. “The losses of the Russian army are mentioned and renewed daily at the door of the famous Lviv Coffee Mine,” A moment of reflection for the people of Ukraine has plunged the 94th Academy Awards currently under way in Hollywood into a 30-second silence. The Associated Press reports: A tribute that started with words from the Ukrainian-born actress Mila Kunis ended with the Academy Awards fading to black about midway through Sunday’s show from Los Angeles, with a plea for anyone watching to do whatever possible to send help to those in the war-torn nation. “Recent global events have left many of us feeling gutted,” Kunis said as she took the stage, part of her remarks to introduce Reba McIntyre’s performance of the Oscar-nominated song “Somehow You Do” from “Four Good Days.” “Yet when you witness the strength and dignity of those facing such devastation, it’s impossible to not be moved by their resilience,” Kunis continued. “One cannot help but be in awe of those who find strength to keep fighting through unimaginable darkness.” That’s when McIntyre took the stage, dressed in a black gown, for her performance. The balance between celebrating art while Russia’s invasion of Ukraine rages on has been a delicate one for the Oscars. Sean Penn has openly campaigned for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy — a former actor — to speak at the ceremony. Some arrived for the Oscars wearing blue-and-gold ribbons, an obvious show of support since those are the colours of the Ukrainian flag. When McIntyre’s song ended, a large video screen hovering over the stage displayed a tribute and a plea as the 30-second moment of silence began. “We’d like to have a moment of silence to show our support for the people of Ukraine currently facing invasion, conflict and prejudice within their own borders,” read the screen. “While film is an important avenue for us to express our humanity in times of conflict, the reality is millions of families in Ukraine need food, medical care, clean water and emergency services. Resources are scarce and we — collectively as a global community — can do more.” It then ended with a display of the following: “We ask you to support Ukraine in any way you are able. #StandWithUkraine.” A monument to famed Ukrainian poet, Taras Shevchenko, has been covered with sandbags to protect it from shelling in the city of Kharkiv, northeast Ukraine. Ukraine’s second-largest city of 1.5 million people lies close to the Russian border and has been heavily shelled by Russian forces over the past weeks. Ukraine’s ministry of foreign affairs says Russian forces have turned the besieged city of Mariupol “into dust” while describing the current humanitarian situation in the city as “catastrophic”. “While Mariupol besieged and bombed, people fight to survive. The humanitarian situation in the city is catastrophic. Russian Armed Forces is turning the city into dust,” the ministry said on Monday. In an earlier interview for Russian media, published and transcribed by the presidential offie of Ukraine, Zelenskiy spoke of a “cultural split” that has taken place towards Russians in Ukraine. A global historical and cultural split took place during this month. It’s not just a war, I think it’s much worse.” Zelenskiy noted that before the war some Ukrainians were loyal to Russia but after the destruction of their cities and death of civilians, this attitude has changed to hatred, adding that he believed the damage is “irreparable”. I think this is the worst disappointment that has happened. Disappointment that turned into hatred of the nations. I have no answer as to how it can be returned, there is no answer as to whether it will ever return.” Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has provided some more detail surrounding his earlier claim that 2,000 children from Mariupol have been taken by Russia. Zelenskiy confirmed that people were leaving the city through humanitarian corridors using civilian transport, but Russia also “organised the forcible removal of Mariupol residents to the occupied territories,” according to a press release published by the president’s office late on Sunday. According to our data, more than 2,000 children were deported. Which means they were abducted. Because we do not know the exact locations of all these children. There were children with and without parents. It’s a catastrophe, it’s horrible.” Zelenskiy continued: The reality is that the city is blocked by the Russian military, all entrances and exits from Mariupol are blocked, the port is mined. The humanitarian catastrophe in the city is obvious. Because food, medicine, and water can’t be delivered. The Russian troops are shelling humanitarian convoys and killing drivers.” Due to the shelling, many humanitarian convoys returned without reaching Mariupol, Zelenskiy added. The president said that there was an attempt to agree with the Russian side on the removal of the bodies of killed soldiers and civilians lying in the open air, but such removal was not allowed. The Ukrainian military has released its latest operational report as of 10pm local time, claiming Russia has withdrawn troops that were surrounding Kyiv after suffering significant losses. The withdrawal has “significantly decreased” the intensity of Russia’s advance and forced some units to regroup in Belarus, the general staff of the armed forces said. Officials added that they believed Russia was also transporting ‘Iskander’ missiles to Kalinkovichy in the Gomel region of south-eastern Belarus. The destruction of cities across Ukraine continues as the war drags on into its second month. Here is a selection of the latest images taken from Mykolaiv, Mariupol and Kharkiv. French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian has called for immediate action in Ukraine’s south-eastern city Mariupol, drawing comparisons to the destruction of Aleppo, Syria. “You can very well see that Mariupol is a second Aleppo with, I hope, a collective guilt if we don’t do anything,” he said at the Doha Forum, a meeting of policy makers, referring to a Syrian city that saw some of the worst fighting of the country’s brutal civil war. “Mariupol is a siege war that Russia’s been in for a month now. Maybe it wasn’t envisaged as a siege war but today we’re in siege warfare, and Mariupol is one of the most striking examples. “Military sieges are horrible wars because civil populations are massacred, annihilated. The suffering is terrible.” Germany is considering purchasing a missile defence system to shield against a potential attack from Russia, Chancellor Olaf Scholz said late on Sunday. When asked during an appearance on public broadcaster ARD whether Germany might buy a defence system such as Israel’s Iron Dome, Scholz said: “This is certainly one of the issues we are discussing, and for good reason,” though he did not specify what type of system Berlin was considering. When asked whether Germany aimed to procure a missile defence system with a longer range than its existing Patriot batteries, Scholz said: “We need to be aware that we have a neighbour who is prepared to use violence to enforce their interests.” The Bild am Sonntag newspaper reported earlier a missile defence shield for the whole territory of Germany was one of the topics discussed when Scholz met with Eberhard Zorn, Germany’s chief of defence. Specifically, they spoke about a possible acquisition of the Israeli “Arrow 3” system, the paper said. Andreas Schwarz, a member of parliament for Scholz’ Social Democrats, told the newspaper: We must protect ourselves better against the threat from Russia. For this, we need a Germany-wide missile defence shield quickly. The Israeli Arrow 3 system is a good solution.” French president Emmanuel Macron earlier called for restraint in both words and actions in dealing with the Ukraine conflict, after US president Joe Biden described Russian president Vladimir Putin as a “butcher” and said he should not remain in power. “I wouldn’t use this type of wording because I continue to hold discussions with president Putin,” Macron told France 3. “What do we want to do collectively? We want to stop the war that Russia has launched in Ukraine without waging war and without escalation.” Watch Macron’s remarks in the video below. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister has accused Russia of “irresponsible” acts around the occupied Chernobyl power station that could send radiation across much of Europe, and urged the United Nations to dispatch a mission to assess the risks. Iryna Vereshchuk posted an update to her Telegram account late Sunday, where she said Russian forces continue to militarise the Chernobyl exclusion zone. This poses a very serious risk of damaging the insulation structures built over the station’s fourth unit after its 1986 explosion. Such damage will inevitably lead to the entry into the atmosphere of a significant amount of radioactive dust and contaminate not only Ukraine but also other European countries.” Vereshchuk continued to claim that the occupying Russian forces “ ignored these threats, continuing to transport and store a significant amount of ammunition in the immediate vicinity of the nuclear power plant” and through the city of Pripyat. Russian occupiers transport tens of tons of rockets, shells and mortar ammunition every day. Hundreds of tons of ammunition are being stored in the neighbouring city of Pripyat Chernobyl, which is also a short distance from the nuclear power plant.” Vereshchuk noted the dangers of Russia’s use of “old and substandard ammunition” which “increases the risk of their detonation even during loading and transportation.” In addition, she said significant fires have started in the exclusion zone, which can have “very serious consequences.” “It is impossible to control and extinguish fires in full due to the capture of the exclusion zone by the Russian occupation forces,” she said. As a result of combustion, radionuclides are released into the atmosphere, which the wind can carry over long distances, which threatens radiation not only in Ukraine but also in other European countries. Loss of control over the exclusion zone and the inability to fully extinguish the fire could threaten radiation facilities in the area.” In the context of nuclear security, the irresponsible and unprofessional actions of the Russian military pose a very serious threat not only to Ukraine but also to hundreds of millions of Europeans.” Vereshchuk urged the UN Security Council to “take immediate measures to demilitarise the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone and establish a special UN mission” to eliminate the risk of a recurrence of the Chernobyl accident. The UK’s ministry of defence has just released its latest intelligence report on the situation in Ukraine, claiming Russia is “effectively isolating Ukraine from international maritime trade.” Russia is maintaining a distant blockade of Ukraine’s Black Sea coast, effectively isolating Ukraine from international maritime trade. Russian naval forces are also continuing to conduct sporadic missile strikes against targets throughout Ukraine. The destruction of the Saratov landing ship at Berdyansk will likely damage the confidence of the Russian Navy to conduct operations in close proximity to the coast of Ukraine in the future.” US President Joe Biden has said that he was not calling for regime change in Russia when he said on Saturday that Russian President Vladimir Putin “cannot remain in power.” “Mr President, do you want Putin removed? Mr President, were you calling for regime change?” a reporter asked Biden as he left a church service in Washington on Sunday. “No,” the president replied. On Saturday, Joe Biden condemned Vladimir Putin as a “butcher” who could no longer stay in power in a historic speech in Poland as Russian missiles rained down on Ukraine’s most pro-western city, just 40 miles from the Polish border, and Ukraine’s president called for more military aid. “For God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power,” Biden said in his most belligerent speech since the war began a month ago. US officials later said that Biden had been talking about the need for Putin to lose power over Ukrainian territory and in the wider region. Zelenskiy also spoke of the “global marathon for peace in Ukraine” where he thanks those who gathered in support of Ukraine across dozens of cities around the world. An impressive number of people in the squares of Europe, on other continents. And this is extremely important. Because when people are in the square, politicians will no longer pretend not to hear us and you, not to hear Ukraine.” We will not let anyone forget about our cities, about Mariupol and other Ukrainian cities that the Russian militaries are destroying. More and more people in the world are on the side of Ukraine, on the side of good in this battle with evil. And if politicians don’t know how to follow people, we will teach them. This is the basis of democracy and our national character.” Zelenskiy promised to work this week for new sanctions against Russia and spoke of an impending new round negotiations. A new round of negotiations is ahead, because we are looking for peace. Really. Without delay. As I was informed, there is an opportunity and a need for a face-to-face meeting already in Turkey. This is not bad. Let’s look at the result. Our priorities in the negotiations are known. Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity are beyond doubt. Effective security guarantees for our state are mandatory. Our goal is obvious - peace and the restoration of normal life in our native state as soon as possible.” The Ukrainian president promised to continue to appeal to the parliaments of other countries, describing a busy diplomatic weeks ahead. No one will be able to hide the Ukrainian interest somewhere in political offices or in bureaucratic loopholes. Hello it’s Samantha Lock with you as my colleague Lois Beckett signs off. Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has once again delivered a moving late-night national address. Referencing his earlier interview with Russian journalists, he said: Today is the day when we see again and again how far we are from the Russian Federation. Imagine, they were frightened there in Moscow because of my interview to Russian journalists. To those of them who can afford to tell the truth. When journalists were preparing to publish our interview - and we spoke with them this afternoon - the Russian censorship agency came out with a threat. That’s what they wrote - they demand not to publish the conversation. It would be ridiculous if it wasn’t so tragic. They destroyed freedom of speech in their state, they are trying to destroy the neighbouring state. They portray themselves as global players. And they themselves are afraid of a relatively short conversation with several journalists. Well, if there is such a reaction, then we are doing everything right, then they are nervous. Apparently, they have seen that their citizens have more and more questions about the state of affairs in their country.” It’s nearly 2am in Ukraine, and there have been reports of air raid sirens and missile strikes in cities across Ukraine, including in Lutsk, Kharkiv, Zhytomyr, and Rivne. Here are some of the key developments of the past few hours: Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy used a video interview with independent Russian media outlets to signal his willingness to discuss having Ukraine adopt a “neutral status,” and also make compromises about the status of the eastern Donbas region, in order to secure a peace agreement with Russia. But he said he was not willing to discuss Ukrainian demilitarisation, and that Ukrainians would need to vote in a referendum to approve their country adopting a neutral status. Russia’s communications and Internet regulator said in a public statement it would investigate the outlets that interviewed Zelenskiy and told them not to distribute the interview. Despite reports that Zelenskiy had been pushing to speak on video during the Academy Awards ceremony in Los Angeles tonight, and some statements of support from celebrities in his favor, it was not clear if the Academy had agreed, or if it would opt instead for watered-down references to the conflict and vague statements of support. Talks between Russia and Ukraine are expected to continue in Turkey in the coming days. Zelenskiy claims that 2,000 children from Mariupol have been taken by Russia: CNN One of the most striking claims in the Ukrainian president’s interview with Russian reporters was Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s assertion that Russia has “stolen” 2,000 children from Mariupol during attempts to evacuate civilians from the city, CNN reported. CNN’s Jim Acosta reported Zelenskiy’s comments on CNN, with the caveat that CNN has not independently verified the claim. A week ago, the US condemned as “unconscionable” reports that Russia was transporting thousands of civilians out of Mariupol and into Russia and Russian-controlled territory. Ukrainian officials have said that tens of thousands of civilians from Mariupol have been taken into Russian-controlled territory, calling these “deportations,” and BBC News reported on Sunday that a refugee from Mariupol who is currently in Russia said: “All of us were taken forcibly”. “According to our information, more than 2,000 children were taken, ie, stolen, because we do not know the exact location of all these children. Some are with parents, some without. This is a catastrophe,” Zelenskiy said, according to a video of his interview with Russian reporters. In Hollywood, signs of support for Ukraine on the Oscars red carpet As celebrities and nominees arrive for the Academy Awards tonight, some of them are wearing blue-and-yellow tributes to Ukraine, and others speaking out about Ukrainian refugees, according to early reports from the red carpet. Still no word on whether Ukrainian president will speak during the Oscars: CNN Despite much discussion over whether the Academy Awards tonight will include a video address from Volodymyr Zelenskiy, it’s still not clear what is happening. CNN’s Jim Acosta reports that the news outlet has not heard back from the Academy either way. As my colleague Catherine Shoard reported earlier, actor Sean Penn pledged to “smelt” his own Oscar statuettes if Zelenskiy was not invited to speak. Watch the Ukrainian president’s interview with Russian reporters The full interview with Volodymyr Zelenskiy, already the subject of a crackdown by the Russian government on the media outlets involved, is available here with English subtitles. This video is from the YouTube channel of Tikhon Dzyadko, one of the Russian journalists who took part in the interview. Zelenskiy also released the full video on his Telegram channel. Russian artist staging anti-war protest arrested in St Petersburg: reports A Russian artist who covered herself in fake blood and chanted “my heart bleeds” as part of an anti-war protest in St Petersburg on Sunday was taken by police, Radio Free Europe, a US government-funded outlet, reported. After a quiet Sunday, reports of evening missile strikes across Ukraine After reports of air raid sirens across Ukraine about an hour ago, there are now initial reports of Russian missiles striking multiple cities. More from Reuters: Speaking more than a month after Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, Zelenskiy said no peace deal would be possible without a ceasefire and troop withdrawals. He ruled out trying to recapture all Russian-held territory by force, saying it would lead to a third world war, and said he wanted to reach a “compromise” over the eastern Donbass region, held by Russian-backed forces since 2014. Zelenskiy said Ukraine refused to discuss certain other Russian demands, such as the demilitarisation of the country. Ukraine’s military intelligence chief Gen Kyrylo Budanov said earlier that he believed that Putin wanted to split Ukraine into two, emulating the postwar division between North and South Korea. More on Ukraine’s willingness to discuss adopting a neutral status in talks with Russia Reuters has more on a key comment Volodymyr Zelenskiy made to Russian journalists: Ukraine is prepared to discuss adopting a neutral status as part of a peace deal with Russia but it would have to be guaranteed by third parties and put to a referendum, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in remarks aired on Sunday... “Security guarantees and neutrality, non-nuclear status of our state. We are ready to go for it. This is the most important point,” Zelenskiy said. Ukraine was discussing the use of the Russian language in Ukraine in talks with Russia, but refused to discuss other Russian demands, such as the demilitarisation of Ukraine, Zelenskiy said. Another night: reports of sirens, sounds of explosions across Ukraine It’s around 10 pm in Ukraine, and there are reports from multiple cities of air raid sirens and the sound of explosions. What Zelenskiy told Russian reporters Russian independent new outlets are already facing warnings from Russia’s communications regulator that they are under investigation for conducting a video interview with Ukraine’s president, and that they are forbidden from distributing the interview. As journalists review the now publicly posted footage from the 92-minute interview, they are highlighting some of the key points Volodymyr Zelenskiy made: Zelenskiy said he believes Putin was told that Ukrainians would welcome a Russian invasion, and claimed that Ukraine found Russian parade uniforms in early convoys, suggesting they were ready for immediate victory marches. Zelenskiy also said the bodies of Russian and Ukrainian people were lying in piles across Mariupol, and that Russians were not picking up the bodies of their own dead or allowing Ukrainians to pick up their own wounded and dead, the CNN analyst Bianna Golodryga reports. Vladimir Putin is seeking to split Ukraine into two, emulating the postwar division between North and South Korea, the invaded country’s military intelligence chief has said. In comments that raise the prospect of a long and bitter frozen conflict, Gen Kyrylo Budanov, who foretold of Russia’s invasion as far back as November, warned of bloody guerrilla warfare. The prediction came as Leonid Pasechnik, the leader of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic in eastern Ukraine, said: “I think that in the near future a referendum will be held on the territory of the republic, during which the people will … express their opinion on joining the Russian Federation.” Turkish president pushes for a ceasefire in phone call with Putin: Reuters New from Reuters: Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan told Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in a telephone call on Sunday that a ceasefire and better humanitarian conditions were needed following Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, his office said in a statement. “Erdogan noted the importance of a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine, the implementation of peace and the improvement of humanitarian conditions in the region,” his office said in a readout of the call. It added they agreed the next round of peace committee talks between Ukraine and Russia would be held in Istanbul. Earlier on Sunday, Ukrainian negotiator David Arakhamia said the next round of face to face talks between Ukraine and Russia will take place in Turkey on March 28-30. A key development from the Ukrainian president’s interview with Russian journalists, Reuters reports: Ukraine is prepared to discuss adopting a neutral status as part of a peace deal with Russia but it would have to be guaranteed by third parties and put to a referendum, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in remarks aired on Sunday. Zelenskiy was speaking to Russian journalists in a 90 minute video call, an interview that the Russian authorities had pre-emptively warned Russian media to refrain from reporting. Zelenskiy spoke in Russian throughout. Zelenskiy said Russia’s invasion had caused the destruction of Russian-speaking cities in Ukraine, and said the damage was worse than the Russian wars in Chechnya. “Security guarantees and neutrality, non-nuclear status of our state. We are ready to go for it. This is the most important point,” Zelenskiy said. Ukraine was discussing the use of the Russian language in Ukraine in talks with Russia, but refused to discuss other Russian demands, such as the demilitarisation of Ukraine, Zelenskiy said. Russian communications censor tells news outlets not to publish interview with Zelenskiy Russia’s internet and communications regulator, Roskomnadzor, has warned Russian news outlets not to report on an interview they conducted with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, according to Reuters and other news outlets. The BBC’s Sarah Rainsford notes that Russian media outlets who are already blocked by the government are now being told they cannot report on the interview: Zelenskiy has already posted the full 90-minute video interview to his Telegram channel. Kyiv mayor says online schooling will restart on Monday, CNN reports Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said on Telegram that online schooling would restart in the capital this week, CNN reports. Humanitarian organizations were unprepared for war, Ukrainian politicians charge Ukrainian politicians have accused international humanitarian organizations, including the UN’s refugee agency and the International Committee of the Red Cross, of being unprepared, “impotent,” and “disoriented,” my colleagues Daniel Boffey and Shaun Walker report. Read the full story here: The time in Kyiv is 7.48pm. Here is a roundup of the latest news so far today: In-person talks between Ukrainian and Russian negotiating teams are set to resume tomorrow, said David Arakhamiya, a Ukrainian lawmaker and a member of the negotiations group. The French foreign minister said on Sunday there would be “collective guilt” if nothing was done to help civilians in Mariupol, the Ukrainian city besieged by Russian forces. The UK government’s top legal adviser has appointed a war crimes lawyer to advise Ukraine over the Russian invasion.The attorney general, Suella Braverman, announced on Sunday that Sir Howard Morrison QC would act as an independent adviser to the Ukrainian prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, PA Media reported. The US has no strategy of regime change for Russia, the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, told reporters on Sunday after President Joe Biden said Vladimir Putin “cannot remain in power”. Biden had condemned Putin as a “butcher” who could no longer stay in power in a speech in Poland. Biden appeared to urge those around the Russian president to oust him from the Kremlin. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, distanced himself from Biden’s comments, while the UK cabinet minister Nadhim Zahawi distanced the UK government from the comments. Russia is trying to split Ukraine in two to create a Moscow-controlled region after failing to take over the whole country, the head of Ukrainian military intelligence said on Sunday. The Russian-backed self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic in eastern Ukraine could hold a referendum soon on joining Russia, the rebel region’s news outlet cited the local leader Leonid Pasechnik as saying on Sunday. Russia struck military targets in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv with high-precision cruise missiles, the Russian defence ministry said on Sunday. Russia hit a fuel depot being used by Ukrainian forces near Lviv with long-range missiles and used cruise missiles to strike a plant in the city being used to repair anti-aircraft systems, radar stations and sights for tanks, the ministry said. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has called on the US and Europe to supply more planes, tanks, anti-missile defences and anti-ship weaponry, arguing that Europe’s security is at stake. “This is what is covered with dust at their storage facilities … this is all for freedom not only in Ukraine – this is for freedom in Europe,” he said in his nightly address. Two humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians from conflict zones have been agreed for Sunday, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, has said, including from Mariupol. Russia has started destroying Ukrainian fuel and food storage depots, meaning the government will have to disperse the stocks of both in the near future, Vadym Denysenko, an adviser to the Ukrainian interior ministry, has said, according to Reuters. The Kremlin has again raised the spectre of the use of nuclear weapons in the war with Ukraine. Dmitry Medvedev, a former Russian president who is deputy chair of the country’s security council, said Moscow could use them to strike an enemy that only used conventional weapons. Russian forces appear to be concentrating their effort to attempt the encirclement of Ukrainian forces directly facing the separatist regions in the east of the country, the UK’s Ministry of Defence has said in its latest intelligence report on the war in Ukraine. Ukrainian troops are reporting that Russian forces are deploying white phosphorus against them near the eastern city of Avdiivka. While these reports cannot be confirmed, Zelenskiy told Nato leaders earlier this week that Russia had used phosphorus bombs that had killed adults and children. Russian forces seized Slavutych, a northern town close to the Chernobyl nuclear site, on Saturday and took its mayor, Yuri Fomichev, prisoner. However, after failing to disperse the numerous protesters in the main square on Saturday – despite deploying stun grenades and firing overhead – the Russian troops released the mayor and agreed to leave. In-person talks between Ukrainian and Russian negotiating teams will resume this week, officials have said today. A Ukrainian lawmaker and a member of the negotiations group, David Arakhamiya, said the next round of face-to-face talks between Ukraine and Russia will take place in Turkey on 28-30 March on Facebook, multiple news sources reported. Arakhamia wrote: Today, during another round of video negotiations, it was decided to hold the next in-person round of the two delegations in Turkey on March 28-30. Russia’s chief negotiator, Vladimir Medinsky, said the sides had agreed to hold in-person talks on 29-30 March after the latest round was conducted via video link. He did not specify the location of the planned session. The AFP reports: Russia and Ukraine failed to make a breakthrough in their first top-level talks, on 10 March in Antalya, since Moscow launched its invasion of Ukraine in late February. The two sides have held regular talks via video conference but offered scant hopes for any breakthroughs with both sides describing efforts as difficult. Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said this week that Russia and Ukraine appeared to have reached an understanding on four out of six negotiating points; Ukraine staying out of Nato, the use of Russian language in Ukraine, disarmament and security guarantees. The Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said Friday however that there was “no consensus” on key points with Russia. Yaroslav Trofimov, chief foreign affairs correspondent of the Wall Street Journal, has pointed to information provided by Oryx (@oryxspioenkop) that records destruction of military equipment. Oryx says the Russian army is now visually confirmed to have lost at least 300 tanks since it began its invasion of Ukraine a month ago. As Trofimov notes, that is equivalent to the entire tank stock of the French army and half of the stock of the British army. You can also follow Emma Graham-Harrison on Twitter, where her handle is @_EmmaGH. Here are some of the images she has posted today: In case you missed it, this dispatch from the Guardian and Observer’s Emma Graham-Harrison in Kharkiv, is profoundly moving. The rubbish collectors in Kharkiv wear flak jackets now. Several of their trucks are peppered with shrapnel holes from shells that landed during their rounds. The bins they empty are packed with the shattered, twisted remains of homes destroyed by explosions. But still, every morning they go out to keep Kharkiv clean. Ukraine’s second city is perhaps the most-shelled target in the country after besieged Mariupol. Every day brings a hail of Grad rockets, cluster bombs, shells and missiles. Hundreds are dead, thousands injured. The morgues cannot cope with the daily toll inflicted by Russia. At one city-centre facility, dozens of bodies, wrapped only in plastic bags or blankets, are stacked in a courtyard. Yet Kharkiv’s people are determined that their city will stand, that life must continue among the ruins, even if for now it is a terrifying half-existence in the shadow of sudden death. And that means keeping the city clean. You can read the full piece here: The French foreign minister said on Sunday there would be “collective guilt” if nothing was done to help civilians in Mariupol, the Ukrainian city besieged by Russian forces. “Mariupol is a striking example of a military siege, and military sieges are horrible wars because civil populations are massacred, annihilated. The suffering is terrible,” Jean-Yves Le Drian told the Doha Forum international conference. “This is why there needs to be at least one moment when the civilian population can breathe,” he said, adding that this was what the French president, Emmanuel Macron, was working to secure, Reuters reported. Macron said on Friday he was seeking to hold further talks with Russian president Vladimir Putin in the coming days about the situation in Ukraine and the initiative to help people leave Mariupol. That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, for today. My colleague Alexandra Topping will be along shortly to continue bringing you all the latest news from Putin’s war on Ukraine. Ambassador Julianne Smith, the US’s envoy to Nato, was asked by CNN’s State of the Union Sunday show host Dana Bash if the US president Joe Biden’s remarks about Russian president Vladimiar Putin were “a mistake”. She replied: In the moment, I think that was a principled human reaction to the stories that he had heard that day. But no, as you’ve heard from secretary Blinken and others, the US does not have a policy of regime change in Russia. Full stop. This week has been remarkable. It’s been historic. I thought the speech was completely pitch-perfect. And I think this will set us on a good course for continuing to support the allies, support Ukrainians, and apply pressure on Russia to get them to stop this war. We are not pursuing a policy of regime change, but I think the full administration, the president included, believes that we cannot empower Putin right now to wage war in Ukraine or pursue these acts of aggression. She then interviewed senator James Risch, a Republican on the Senate’s foreign relations committee and member of the Senate intelligence committee. He said: There was a horrendous gaffe right at the end of it. I just wish he would stay on script. Whoever wrote that speech did a good job for him. But my gosh, I wish they would keep him on script. The UK government’s top legal adviser has appointed a war crimes lawyer to advise Ukraine over the Russian invasion. The attorney general, Suella Braverman, announced on Sunday that Sir Howard Morrison QC will act as an independent adviser to Ukrainian prosecutor general Iryna Venediktova, PA Media reported. Sir Howard has served as a judge at the international criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and the international criminal court (ICC) for more than 12 years, including overseeing cases like that of the Serbian war criminal Radovan Karadžić. Vladimir Putin has been accused repeatedly of war crimes over his invasion of Ukraine. Asked about alternative forms of prosecution outside the ICC, of which Russia is not a member, Braverman said: All options are on the table and I will always defer and support my counterpart in Ukraine, the prosecutor general, in terms of my efforts to support her in terms of her choice of route for redress. But whilst we welcome the focus on accountability, we do believe that the ICC is the right place for those responsible for committing these atrocious crimes in Ukraine to be held accountable for their actions. That’s why we’re focusing all of our energy, led by the deputy prime minister [Dominic Raab], all of our assistance and all of our resources on the ICC prosecutor’s independent investigation. At the bustling tea stands and roadside eateries of Delhi, European politics is not a regular topic of conversation. But with wall-to-wall coverage of the war in Ukraine on television and in the newspapers, petrol prices rising and pressure growing on the prime minister, Narendra Modi, to denounce Russia, Indians are starting to grapple with the consequences of the conflict 2,800 miles away. Ram Agarwal, a shopkeeper, does not condone the loss of civilian life but nor can he bring himself to criticise Russia. He grew up in the 1950s and 60s when India and the Soviet Union were such close allies that Nikita Khrushchev coined the slogan “Hindi Rusi bhai bhai” (Indians and Russians are brothers). “I am 74 and my generation grew up with Hindi Rusi bhai bhai. It’s like attacking a dear old friend,” he said. Arvind Maurya, an electrician, also expressed the even-handedness that has marked much of the public response. “I hear that Ukraine used to be a part of Russia, but instead of respecting that, Nato is pulling Ukraine into its own orbit. But war is never good for anyone and the Russian bombing of civilians is not the way to solve these differences. They must sit down and talk,” he said. But away from the street, feelings are stronger. Indians from the right and left have converged on the war, the former because of their antipathy towards western culture and the latter because of their anti-Americanism, particularly in relation to foreign policy. Ukraine said that Russia holding a referendum in occupied Ukrainian territory would have no legal basis and would face a strong response from the international community, deepening its global isolation. The Russian-controlled Luhansk region in eastern Ukraine could hold a referendum soon on joining Russia, its local leader was quoted as saying. “All fake referendums in the temporarily occupied territories are null and void and will have no legal validity,” Ukraine’s foreign ministry spokesperson Oleg Nikolenko said in a statement to Reuters. “Instead, Russia will face an even stronger response from the international community, further deepening its global isolation.” In his latest address, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy criticised western nations for hesitating to give his country defensive arms including fighter jets, decrying “ping-pong” talks about who should supply them. He urged the west to summon just “1%” of the courage shown by those fighting to defend Mariupol from Russian forces. India is likely to continue to import coking coal from Russia, Reuters reports. On Sunday, the country’s steel minister appeared to shun the global trend of limiting Russian imports in response to its invasion of Ukraine. Ramchandra Prasad Singh told a conference in New Delhi: We are moving in the direction of importing coking coal from Russia. India plans to double imports of Russian coking coal, a key ingredient in making steel, the minister said. India is a major buyer of Russian goods from commodities to weapons, and has abstained from several key United Nations votes condemning the invasion of Ukraine. Russia, India’s sixth-largest supplier of coking and thermal coal, could start offering more competitive prices to Chinese and Indian buyers as European and other customers spurn the nations because of sanctions, according to traders. US secretary of state Antony Blinken on Sunday described Israel’s efforts to mediate an end to the Ukraine-Russia conflict as important and “closely coordinated” with Washington. Blinken made his remarks during a Jerusalem meeting with Israeli prime minister Naftali Bennett. French president Emmanuel Macron has distanced himself from comments made by the US president Joe Biden about Russia’s Vladimir Putin. In a speech in Warsaw, Poland, last night, Biden said Putin is a “butcher” and said “this man cannot remain in power”. However, the White House later clarified that the US was not calling for regime change. Macron told broadcaster France 3: “I would not use those words.” He added that “everything must be done to stop the situation from escalating” if there is to be any hope of stopping Russia’s war in Ukraine. Macron also told France 3 he saw his task as “achieving first a ceasefire and then the total withdrawal of [Russian] troops by diplomatic means. If we want to do that, we can’t escalate either in words or actions.” Pope Francis has stepped up his pleas for negotiations to end the fighting in Ukraine. Francis told the public in St Peter’s Square on Sunday that the continuation of “this cruel and senseless war” after more than a month represented “a defeat for all”. He lamented that parents are burying their children, and “the powerful decide and the poor die”. Once again, he did not cite Russia by name as the aggressor, the Associated Press reported. Referring to reports that about half of all the children in Ukraine have been displaced by the conflict, Francis said that “war doesn’t just devastate the present but also the future of society”. The pontiff reiterated his condemnation of war as barbarous and sacrilegious. He said that “humanity must understand that the moment has come to abolish war, to cancel war from the history of man before it cancels man from history”. The Ukrainian MP Lesia Vasylenko said people are starving and being forced to drink sewage water in Ukraine as the situation across the country worsens. Speaking to Times Radio, Vasylenko said Kyiv is still facing attacks while people are “made to stay in basements and metro stations”. She said: People are actually starving without food, and drinking sewage water. In Mariupol, thousands of people are getting forcefully deported across the border to Russia apparently to safety but then they are sent off in an unknown direction and nobody hears from them again. So the atrocities, they’re just the same all over the place. • This post was amended on 27 March 2022 to clarify earlier uncertainty over the location that Lesia Vasylenko was referring to. A UK cabinet minister has distanced the government from Joe Biden’s call that Russia’s Vladimir Putin “cannot remain in power” amid criticism that the comment could bolster the Kremlin. Nadhim Zahawi, the education secretary, said it was “for the Russian people to decide how they are governed” after the unscripted remark from the US president during a speech in Poland, which the White House later said was not a call for regime change. “I think that’s up to the Russian people,” he told Sky’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday. “The Russian people, I think, are pretty fed up with what is happening in Ukraine, this illegal invasion, the destruction of their own livelihoods, their economy is collapsing around them and I think the Russian people will decide the fate of Putin and his cronies.” Biden’s comments came as Russia fired missiles aimed at the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, 40 miles from the Polish border. The city is the most pro-western in the country and the base of many western journalists. Analysts described the attacks as intending to send a clear signal to the White House. Biden described Putin as a “butcher” and told an audience in Warsaw that the west must steel itself “for a long fight ahead”. It was the kind of spring day in Mayfair they used to write songs about. Beneath a cloudless sky daffodils were blooming in Hyde Park. Blue and yellow, the colours of Ukraine. Everything seemed to be blue and yellow: the Euro Car Parks sign, the police vans and motorcycles, and the hi-vis jackets their occupants wore, but most obviously the hundreds of flags held aloft by those gathered beneath the Park Lane Hilton for the London Stands With Ukraine march to Trafalgar Square. It was not a typical anti-war crowd. With the conspicuous exception of Peter Tatchell, it lacked that class of seasoned protesters that fill out these occasions. Neither Stop the War nor CND, which both want the UK to stop arming the besieged Ukrainians, was behind the event. Instead it was the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, who called for the protest, supported by the decidedly unradical European Movement (president: Michael Heseltine). Rachel, a middle-aged woman wearing a Roger Waters T-shirt, said it was the first demonstration she’d ever been on. “I’m from East Molesey, near Hampton Court,” she said. “It’s not known as a hotbed of protest.” She had come because she was upset and appalled by what was going on in Ukraine. “Maybe it’s naive, but I hope that if Putin sees enough of the world protest, maybe he will stop.” She pulled a face, as if to suggest that this was a long shot. Turkey and other nations must still talk to Russia to help end the war in Ukraine, Turkey’s presidential spokesman said on Sunday, adding that Kyiv needed more support to defend itself. Nato member Turkey has good relations with both Russia and Ukraine and has sought to mediate in the month-long conflict, Reuters reported. “If everybody burns bridges with Russia then who is going to talk to them at the end of the day,” Ibrahim Kalin told the Doha international forum. “Ukrainians need to be supported by every means possible so they can defend themselves … but the Russian case must be heard, one way or the other,” so that its grievances could be understood if not justified, Kalin added. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has urged the western allies to give his country tanks, planes and missiles to fend off Russian forces. The west has responded to Russia’s invasion by imposing sweeping economic sanctions on Moscow. Ankara says Russia’s invasion is unacceptable but opposes the western sanctions on principle and has not joined them. Ukraine will “not be silent” about the “horror” of rapes being committed against women during the Russian invasion, a politician in the country has said. The Ukrainian MP Maria Mezentseva said while one particularly shocking case had been publicly talked about, there are “many more victims” who will need support in the future. She referred to a case that Ukraine’s prosecutor is investigating, in which a woman was allegedly sexually assaulted in front of her child, PA Media reported. Mezentseva, who is head of the permanent delegation of Ukraine to the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe, said details of incidents must be recorded as they happen because “justice has to prevail”. She told Sky’s Sophy Ridge On Sunday programme: There is one case which was very widely discussed recently because it’s been recorded and proceeded with [by] the prosecutor’s office, and we’re not going into details, but it’s quite a scary scene when a civilian was shot dead in his house in a small town next to Kyiv. His wife was – I’m sorry but I have to say it – raped several times in front of her underage child. Mezentseva, who was speaking to Sky from western Ukraine, said the country could benefit from the experience of other countries, such as the UK, in how to help victims in the aftermath of war. She said: There are many more victims rather than just this one case which has been made public by the prosecutor general. And of course, we are expecting many more of them, which will be public once victims will be ready to talk about that. The time in Kyiv is 1.15pm. Here is a roundup of the latest news so far today: The US has no strategy of regime change for Russia, secretary of state Antony Blinken told reporters on Sunday after president Joe Biden said Russian Vladimir Putin “cannot remain in power”. It came as Biden condemned Putin as a “butcher” who could no longer stay in power in a historic speech in Poland. Biden appeared to urge those around the Russian president to oust him from the Kremlin. Russia is trying to split Ukraine in two to create a Moscow-controlled region after failing to take over the whole country, the head of Ukrainian military intelligence said on Sunday. The Russian-backed self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic in eastern Ukraine could hold a referendum soon on joining Russia, the rebel region’s news outlet cited local leader Leonid Pasechnik as saying on Sunday. Russia struck military targets in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv with high-precision cruise missiles, the Russian defence ministry said on Sunday. Russia hit a fuel depot being used by Ukrainian forces near Lviv with long-range missiles and used cruise missiles to strike a plant in the city being used to repair anti-aircraft systems, radar stations and sights for tanks, the ministry said. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has called on the US and Europe to supply more planes, tanks, anti-missiles defences and anti-ship weaponry, arguing that Europe’s own security was at stake. “This is what is covered with dust at their storage facilities … this is all for freedom not only in Ukraine – this is for freedom in Europe,” he said in his nightly address. Two humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians from conflict zones have been agreed for Sunday, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk has said, including from Mariupol. Russia has started destroying Ukrainian fuel and food storage depots, meaning the government will have to disperse the stocks of both in the near future, Ukrainian interior ministry adviser Vadym Denysenko has said according to Reuters. The Kremlin has again raised the spectre of the use of nuclear weapons in the war with Ukraine. Dmitry Medvedev, a former Russian president who is deputy chairman of the country’s security council, said Moscow could use them to strike an enemy that only used conventional weapons. Russian forces appear to be concentrating their effort to attempt the encirclement of Ukrainian forces directly facing the separatist regions in the east of the country, the UK’s Ministry of Defence has said in its latest intelligence report on the war in Ukraine. Ukrainian troops are reporting that Russian forces are deploying white phosphorus against them near the eastern city of Avdiivka. While these reports cannot be confirmed, Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy told Nato leaders earlier this week that Russia had used phosphorus bombs that had killed adults and children. Russian forces seized Slavutych, a northern town close to the Chernobyl nuclear site, on Saturday and took its mayor, Yuri Fomichev, prisoner. However, after failing to disperse the numerous protesters in the main square on Saturday – despite deploying stun grenades and firing overhead – the Russian troops released the mayor and agreed to leave. Russia is trying to split Ukraine in two to create a Moscow-controlled region after failing to take over the whole country, the head of Ukrainian military intelligence said on Sunday. “In fact, it is an attempt to create North and South Korea in Ukraine,” Kyrylo Budanov said in a statement, adding that Ukraine would soon launch guerrilla warfare in Russian-occupied territory. The Russian-backed self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic in eastern Ukraine could hold a referendum soon on joining Russia, the rebel region’s news outlet cited local leader Leonid Pasechnik as saying on Sunday. “I think that in the near future a referendum will be held on the territory of the republic,” Pasechnik said. “The people will exercise their ultimate constitutional right and express their opinion on joining the Russian Federation.” Russia last month recognised Luhansk and Donetsk self-proclaimed republics as independent and ordered what it called a peacekeeping operation in the region shortly after, Reuters reported. The US has no strategy of regime change for Russia, secretary of state Antony Blinken told reporters on Sunday after president Joe Biden said Russian Vladimir Putin “cannot remain in power”. “I think the president, the White House, made the point last night that, quite simply, President Putin cannot be empowered to wage war or engage in aggression against Ukraine or anyone else,” Blinken said during a visit to Jerusalem. “As you know, and as you have heard us say repeatedly, we do not have a strategy of regime change in Russia – or anywhere else, for that matter.” Normality is another world for the Ukrainian football team Shakhtar Donetsk. When Russia invaded Ukraine, football was stopped and the lives of the players, coaches, staff and fans were turned upside down in an instant. There was no time to waste with lives at stake as the autumn’s Champions League games against Real Madrid and Internazionale quickly became a distant memory. Sergei Palkin, the chief executive, has been at the forefront of the club’s humanitarian efforts and ensuring the safety of players from the academy to the first-team captain. Critical decisions were constantly needed as the invasion began, a world away from transfer and contract negotiations, as Shakhtar looked to use their influence to make a positive impact as football takes a backseat during the conflict. “We are dreaming when everything will be returned to normal, we dream of flying to play Champions League games,” Palkin says. “For us it will be the biggest win and the greatest happiness, but for now we can only dream about it. “When you are leading a normal life, you never think about being happy, or your freedom, as you do in all democratic countries. When you have this kind of situation where war has arrived in our homes, you start to think about the essential stuff.” Russia struck military targets in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv with high-precision cruise missiles, the Russian defence ministry said on Sunday. Russia hit a fuel depot being used by Ukrainian forces near Lviv with long-range missiles and used cruise missiles to strike a plant in the city being used to repair anti-aircraft systems, radar stations and sights for tanks, the ministry said. “The armed forces of the Russian Federation continue offensive actions as part of the special military operation,” the ministry said in a statement to Reuters. Russia used sea-based long-range missiles to destroy an arsenal of S-300 missiles and BUK anti-aircraft missile systems near Kyiv, the ministry said. Russian forces also destroyed a number of drones, it said. In an early update on Sunday, Ukraine’s general staff said it had repelled seven enemy attacks in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of the Donbas, destroying eight tanks. Russia’s defence ministry, meanwhile, reported a battle for control of two villages near the separatist stronghold of Donetsk and also claimed a missile strike had destroyed an arms and ammunition depot in the Zhytomyr region, west of Kyiv, on Friday. Despite reaching one of the darkest moments in more than 40 years as a dissident and human rights activist, Oleg Orlov says that he has no plans to flee Russia. “I made a decision a long time ago that I want to live and die in Russia, it’s my country,” Orlov told the Observer. “Even though it’s never been so bad.” That’s saying something for Orlov, who can recall printing homemade anti-war posters in the late 1970s to protest against the Russian invasion of Afghanistan or in support of Poland’s Solidarność movement, and was an observer and negotiator during the bloody war in Chechnya in the 1990s. He has been arrested three times for holding pickets since late February, when Russian troops launched an assault on Ukraine. And he doesn’t rule out a prison term in his future. “I understand the high likelihood of a criminal case against me and my colleagues,” he said. “But we have to do something … even if it is just to go out with a picket and speak honestly about what is happening.” Tens of thousands of Russians have fled the country since it invaded Ukraine, fearing a wave of government repression and a possible closure of Russia’s borders similar to what happened in the Soviet Union. The veteran US diplomat Richard Haass has criticised the US president Joe Biden over his comment that Russian president Vladimir Putin “cannot remain in power”. In Twitter posts made on Sunday, Haass, the president of the US Council on Foreign Relations, said Biden had “made a difficult situation more difficult and a dangerous situation more dangerous”. He wrote: The comments by @potus made a difficult situation more difficult and a dangerous situation more dangerous. That is obvious. Less obvious is how to undo the damage, but I suggest his chief aides reach their counterparts &amp; make clear US prepared to deal with this Russian govt. The White House had earlier clarified that Biden was not calling for regime change in Russia. Hello, I’m Tom Ambrose and I’ll be with you throughout the next eight hours to bring you the latest news on Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Russian artists and performers must not stay silent about the war, according to one of the world’s leading ballet choreographers, Alexei Ratmansky. The Russian-born former artistic director of the Bolshoi Ballet, who left a new production in Moscow on news of the invasion, was responding to Mikhail Baryshnikov’s call not to punish cultural and sporting figures for failing to stand up to Vladimir Putin’s regime. Speaking to the Observer on 20 March, Baryshnikov, the actor and ballet star, launched a fundraising drive to support Ukraine. But he also said Russian stars who do not speak out should not be targeted by the west. In contrast, Ratmansky, an admirer and friend of Baryshnikov, believes there is no excuse for not actively opposing the war. Posting on Facebook, the choreographer said he found it “hard to agree with Misha”. He pointed out that in 2014 more than 500 well-known Russian figures in the arts, including major ballet personalities, signed a letter of support for Putin’s annexation of Crimea. “After this letter,” Ratmansky wrote, “every performance or any public action of these 500 could be seen as an act of propaganda. Especially those who have gone on to perform in the west. These people have made a strong political statement supporting their president’s unlawful actions. They are playing politics and therefore should be held responsible or at least asked serious questions. “It is precisely because of the support of the most visible figures of Russian culture that Putin gained his unlimited power and now is using it against humanity in this bloody war that is destroying Ukraine.” Read more here: Two humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians from conflict zones have been agreed for Sunday, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk has said, including from Mariupol. Residents of the besieged Donetsk city will be allowed to use their own transport to get to the city of Zaporizhzhia, around 250km away, she said in a post on Telegram. People trying to escape the fighting in the neighbouring Luhansk region will be allowed to evacuate from the city of Rubizhne to Bakhmut, about 80km away. Russia has started destroying Ukrainian fuel and food storage depots, meaning the government will have to disperse the stocks of both in the near future, Ukrainian Interior Ministry adviser Vadym Denysenko has said according to Reuters. Speaking on local television, Denysenko also said Russia was bringing forces to the Ukrainian border on rotation, and could make new attempts to advance in its invasion of Ukraine. In an early update on Sunday, Ukraine’s General Staff meanwhile said it had repelled seven enemy attacks in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of the Donbas, destroying eight tanks. Russia’s defence ministry reported a battle for control of two villages near the separatist stronghold of Donetsk and also claimed a missile strike had destroyed an arms and ammunition depot in the Zhytomyr region, west of Kyiv, on Friday. As US president Joe Biden was visiting Poland on Saturday, Russian missiles struck the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, just 60 kilometres from the Polish border. The timing of the attacks, only the third on west Ukrainian targets since the war began, and the closest to Lviv’s city centre and its residential areas, was clearly designed to send a message to the White House. At least five people were injured and one of the strikes hit a fuel storage facility. Ukraine has asked the International Committee of the Red Cross not to open a planned office in Russia’s Rostov-on-Don, Reuters reports, saying it would legitimise Moscow’s “humanitarian corridors” and the abduction and forced deportation of Ukrainians. The head of the ICRC said on Thursday after his talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov that agreement between the Russian and Ukrainian armies was needed before civilians could be evacuated properly from war-torn Ukraine. Russian media reported that Red Cross chief Peter Maurer asked Russia to facilitate the opening of a Red Cross office in Rostov-on-Don. Mykhailo Radutskyi, chairman of public health committee in Ukraine’s parliament, appealed to the Red Cross to change its plans. “The Committee calls on the International Committee of the Red Cross that it would not legitimise ‘humanitarian corridors’ on the territory of the Russian Federation as well as that it would not support the abduction of Ukrainians and its forced deportation,” Radutskyi said in a statement. The ICRC was not immediately available to comment. Rostov-on-Don is the largest Russian city on Ukraine’s eastern border and administrative capital of the Rostov region, which has been used by Russia for temporary accommodation camps for people transported out of the war zone. Russia said last week it had evacuated several hundred thousand people from Ukraine since the start of what it calls is a “special military operation” to disarm and “denazify” its neighbour. Ukraine claims that Russia has illegally deported thousands of people since the war started, including about 15,000 civilians from the besieged city of Mariupol. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has killed thousands of people, displaced nearly 4 million and raised fears of a wider confrontation between Russia and the West. Russian forces appear to be concentrating their effort to attempt the encirclement of Ukrainian forces directly facing the separatist regions in the east of the country, the UK’s Ministry of Defence has said in its latest intelligence report on the war in Ukraine. It said Russian forces were advancing from the direction of Kharkiv in the north and Mariupol in the south. However, the battlefield across northern Ukraine “remains largely static with local Ukrainian counterattacks hampering Russian attempts to reorganise their forces.” A chef and humanitarian who has been serving millions of meals to Ukrainians has accused the UN and the EU of a lack of leadership in response to the refugee crisis, warning of a “huge humanitarian emergency at the doorstep of Europe”. Speaking from Lviv in Ukraine, José Andrés, a two-Michelin-starred Spanish-American chef who runs not-for-profit World Central Kitchen (WCK) claimed the UN and the EU do not have enough “boots on the ground” to care for the refugees. WCK has served more than 3m meals in the region since the start of Russia’s invasion. “We need to be expecting more from the big organisations. If not, my question is what do we have them for? What do we spend the millions for?” he said. “We are lacking that leadership.” While he praised the work of the Polish government, he said looking after the refugees’ basic needs is a “gigantic undertaking” that needs more support. The crisis has displaced more than 10 million people, according to UN figures. At least 3.7 million people have left Ukraine – 2.2 million of whom are in Poland – and an estimated 6.5 million are displaced within the country. Read on here: US president Joe Biden was in Poland on Saturday, where he called his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin a “butcher” who “cannot remain in power”. The White House later walked back the comments, saying Biden had been talking about the need for Putin to lose power over Ukrainian territory and in the wider region. The historic speech came as Russian forces fired missiles at Lviv, just over the border from Poland, an act clearly designed to send a message to the US. Here are some images of the visit: To start off with, here’s a quick recap of Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s nightly address, in which he called on the west to supply more tanks and planes to Ukraine and asked whether the US-European alliance was afraid of Moscow. “Who runs the Euro-Atlantic community? Is it still Moscow because of intimidation?” he said. Referring to the bravery of those who are defending the besieged port city of Mariupol, he continued: I wish at least a percentage of their courage to those who have been thinking for 31 days how to transfer a dozen or two of planes or tanks ... Ukraine cannot shoot down Russian missiles using shotguns, machine guns, which are too much in supplies. And it is impossible to unblock Mariupol without a sufficient number of tanks, other armored vehicles and, of course, aircraft. All defenders of Ukraine know that. All defenders of Mariupol know that. Thousands of people know that - citizens, civilians who are dying there in the blockade. The United States knows that. All European politicians know. We told everyone. And this should be known as soon as possible by as many people on Earth as possible. So that everyone understands who and why was simply afraid to prevent this tragedy. Afraid to simply make a decision.” Zelenskiy, a native Russian speaker, also said Russia itself was “doing everything to ensure that de-russification takes place” in Ukraine. “You are doing it. In one generation. And forever. This is another manifestation of your suicide policy.” And he hailed the residents of Slavutych, a northern town close to the Chernobyl nuclear site, who staged a mass protest when Russian forces seized the town. After failing to disperse the numerous protesters in the main square on Saturday – despite deploying stun grenades and firing overhead – the Russian troops released the captured mayor and agreed to leave. “Today we were all with you - on your streets, in your protest. And all together we tell the occupiers one thing: go home while you can still walk,” Zelenskiy said. He ended his speech by noting that Russian forces had “denazified” a Holocaust memorial in Drobytsky Yar, a ravine in Kharkiv where the Nazis executed thousands of people during the second world war. “Eighty years later they are killed a second time. And Russia is doing it,” Zelenskiy said. “Russian troops receive just such orders: to destroy everything that makes our nation nation, our people - people, our culture - culture. This is exactly how the Nazis tried to capture Europe 80 years ago. This is exactly how the occupiers act in Ukraine. No one will forgive them.” Hello, this is Helen Livingstone bringing you the Guardian’s live coverage of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Here’s what’s been happening: US president Joe Biden has condemned Vladimir Putin as a “butcher” who could no longer stay in power in a historic speech in Poland. Biden appeared to urge those around the Russian president to oust him from the Kremlin, although US officials later said he had been talking about the need for Putin to lose power over Ukrainian territory and in the wider region. As he spoke, Russian missiles rained down on Ukraine’s most pro-western city, Lviv, just 40 miles from the Polish border. The timing of the attacks, only the third on west Ukrainian targets since the war began, and the closest to Lviv’s city centre and its residential areas, was clearly designed to send a message to the White House.

The Kremlin has again raised the spectre of the use of nuclear weapons in the war with Ukraine. Dmitry Medvedev, a former Russian president who is deputy chairman of the country’s security council, said Moscow could use them to strike an enemy that only used conventional weapons. The comments prompted Zelenskiy, appearing by video link at Qatar’s Doha Forum, to warn that Moscow was a direct threat to the world. “Russia is deliberating bragging they can destroy with nuclear weapons, not only a certain country but the entire planet,” he said. Ukrainian troops are reporting that Russian forces are deploying white phosphorus against them near the eastern city of Avdiivka. While these reports cannot be confirmed, Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy told Nato leaders earlier this week that Russia had used phosphorus bombs that had killed adults and children. Russian forces seized Slavutych, a northern town close to the Chernobyl nuclear site on Saturday and took its mayor, Yuri Fomichev, prisoner. However, after failing to disperse the numerous protesters in the main square on Saturday – despite deploying stun grenades and firing overhead – the Russian troops released the mayor and agreed to leave. The Institute of Mass Media in Ukraine has documented 148 crimes against journalists and the media since the start of the Russian invasion. It said five journalists had been killed, six had been captured or kidnapped and seven had been wounded. The Ukrainian parliament has confirmed a fresh Russian attack on the nuclear research reactor in Kharkiv. In a tweet, it quoted the State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate as saying, “It is currently impossible to estimate the extent of damage due to hostilities that do not stop in the area of the nuclear installation.” Tens of thousands of people gathered in central London to express solidarity with the people of Ukraine. After a rallying call by Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, for people everywhere to protest against the bloodshed by taking to the streets, Trafalgar Square was transformed into a sea of yellow and blue. Experts in the UK have warned that the country’s Homes for Ukraine scheme risks operating as “Tinder for sex traffickers”. The warning comes as evidence emerges that UK-based criminals are targeting women and children fleeing the war. While Russia is distracted by its invasion of Ukraine, Azerbaijan has moved its forces into the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region. Russia’s defence ministry said on Saturday Azeri armed forces had entered a zone policed by Russian peacekeepers in Nagorno-Karabakh, in a violation of an agreement, though Azerbaijan challenged these claims."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2020/jun/18/first-thing-trump-pours-scorn-on-bolton-as-book-drops-fresh-revelations","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2020-06-18T10:29:45Z","webTitle":"First Thing: Trump pours scorn on Bolton as book drops fresh revelations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/18/first-thing-trump-pours-scorn-on-bolton-as-book-drops-fresh-revelations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2020/jun/18/first-thing-trump-pours-scorn-on-bolton-as-book-drops-fresh-revelations","fields":{"headline":"First Thing: Trump pours scorn on Bolton as book drops fresh revelations","bodyText":"Good morning, On Wednesday evening, the Trump administration sought a last-minute emergency order from a judge to block the publication of a White House memoir by the president’s former national security adviser John Bolton. But by then it was already too late: many of the book’s most incendiary details had already reached the press, including Bolton’s claim that Donald Trump was willing to halt criminal investigations to “give personal favors to dictators he liked” – and that he didn’t know the UK was a nuclear power. Trump has attacked his erstwhile aide as a “disgruntled boring fool who only wanted to go to war” while Democrats have again criticised Bolton for refusing to testify at last year’s impeachment inquiry, raising the alarm over the abuses he now purports to have witnessed. But Julian Borger says Bolton’s book, The Room Where it Happened, shows it is still possible to be shocked by Trump’s presidency: Even with all the inequities of the US electoral system, Trump’s 40% core voters will not be enough to get him reelected. He needs some independents and that’s where Bolton’s book may well deepen and accelerate the process of corrosion. Rayshard Brooks’s killer has been charged with murder The Atlanta police officer who shot 27-year-old Rayshard Brooks twice in the back as he fled from an arrest has been charged with his murder. Prosecutors said Garrett Rolfe, who had already been fired by the police department after the incident, kicked Brooks and offered no medical treatment as he lay dying on the ground. It has also emerged that Rolfe was accused of involvement in the cover-up of a 2015 police shooting of another black man. Trump hopes Rolfe “gets a fair shake”. The president told Fox News in an interview on Wednesday that “police have not been treated fairly in our country.” Activists want reparations over the 1921 Tulsa race massacre It is perhaps the worst single incident of racial violence in America’s post-civil war history. On 31 May 1921, the vibrant Tulsa area known as “Black Wall Street” came under attack from a white mob, in a 24-hour rampage that left 35 square blocks razed and an estimated 300 people dead. Now, as Trump prepares to hold a controversial rally in the Oklahoma city this weekend, Ed Pilkington finds that the focus on Tulsa has renewed calls from activists for reparations to the survivors and their descendants. The UN’s human rights chief has called for slavery reparations. At a debate on racism and police brutality at the organisation’s Geneva HQ, Michelle Bachelet urged countries to confront their legacies of slavery and colonialism, and to make amends for “centuries of violence and discrimination”. Oakland police are investigating “nooses” found hanging from at least five trees in the city’s Lake Merritt neighbourhood as a possible hate crime. Fauci says he wouldn’t attend Trump’s Tulsa rally Dr Anthony Fauci, the country’s leading infectious disease expert, has said that, “personally”, he would not be inclined to attend the president’s Tulsa rally this weekend – particularly since Oklahoma is among six US states with record numbers of new coronavirus cases. Fauci also warned on Wednesday that the US was “still in the first wave” of Covid-19 infections, with outbreaks flaring across the country amid a continued easing of lockdown restrictions. The Covid-19 jobless crisis in Florida has created headaches for Republicans seeking re-election, while Michael Adno reports from one rural Floridian town where farm labourers have little choice but to keep working, despite the rampant disease. Arizona’s governor has backtracked on masks, telling local governments they can set their own rules on mask-wearing, but insisting he will not mandate the practice statewide amid a surge in coronavirus hospitalisations. In other news … Beijing says it will “resolutely hit back” over sanctions imposed on its officials under the US Uighur Human Rights Act, which Trump signed on Wednesday in response to China’s mass incarceration of Uighurs and other Muslim minorities. The new chief of the US’s state media organisation has purged top career officials and replaced them with Trump allies, raising concerns that the president wants to turn the likes of Voice of America into the sort of loyal state broadcaster more commonly found in authoritarian societies. The world has six months to change the course of the climate crisis, the chief of the International Energy Agency has said, urging governments to develop sustainable economic recovery packages to prevent a continuing rise in emissions. Trump would support Colin Kaepernick’s return to the NFL, the president told an interviewer on Wednesday, three years after he called the players who followed Kaepernick’s example by kneeling for the national anthem “sons of bitches”. Great reads Does the coronavirus crisis mean the end of tourism? Cruise ships have become a symbol for the ravages the coronavirus crisis inflicted on tourism. But their absence – and the welcome break from the crowds and chaos they inflict on the world’s wonders – has many pondering whether tourism itself needs a fundamental rethink, writes Christopher de Bellaigue. The black progressive upsetting the race to unseat McConnell Amy McGrath, a former fighter pilot, raised a record $2.5m in 24 hours after launching her campaign for Mitch McConnell’s Kentucky Senate seat. But now she may not even make it to November, after weeks of anti-racist protest shifted the spotlight to her Democratic primary challenger Charles Booker. Josh Wood reports from Louisville. Opinion: Anti-racist protests are achieving more under Trump The anti-racist movement sparked by George Floyd’s death has achieved more political traction, and faster, than similar protests in the Obama era. They mark a culmination of three-and-a-half years of progressive resistance to the Trump presidency, says Cas Mudde.

You can read our full report on the UN vote here. The UN voted by 141 to 7 with 32 abstentions to call for Russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw from Ukraine, a sign that the international community has not wavered in its determination to condemn Russia’s actions. In the last vote taken immediately after Russia had annexed republics in the east of Ukraine, Russia was condemned 143 to five with 35 abstentions, the bulk of these in Africa. Applause broke out when the result was announced. Russia had worked hard to try to end its isolation by pointing to the damage the west was caused by pouring arms into the region or by pointing to the growing hunger crisis that it blamed on western sanctions. Ukraine foreign minister Dymotro Kuleba said: By voting in favour of today’s UNGA resolution 141 UN member states made it clear that Russia must end its illegal aggression. Ukraine’s territorial integrity must be restored. One year after Russia launched its full-scale invasion global support for Ukraine remains strong. The seven countries voting against the resolution were Belarus, Mali, Nicaragua, Russia, Syria, North Korea and Eritrea. The resolution was adopted after amendments proposed by Belarus that would have stripped much of the language were resoundingly defeated. Foreign ministers and diplomats from more than 75 countries addressed the assembly during two days of debate, with many urging support for the resolution that upholds Ukraine’s territorial integrity, a basic principle of the UN charter that all countries must subscribe to when they join the world organisation. China abstained as the UN passed a nonbinding resolution calling for Russia to end hostilities and withdraw from Ukraine. It also called for a halt to fighting and for peace in Ukraine, Reuters reports. The 141-7 vote with 32 abstentions, which included China, was slightly below the highest vote for the five previous resolutions approved by the 193-member world body since Russia sent troops and tanks across the border into its smaller neighbour. After the year-long Russian invasion of Ukraine, drone footage shows the scale of destruction in Bakhmut. The Russian military has increased its attacks around the eastern city before the 24 February anniversary. Drone footage shows rows of destroyed and burned out buildings, with no civilians in sight. The German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, clashed with Chinese diplomats on Thursday, passionately rejecting their claim that the west was adding fuel to the fire by arming Ukraine. Baerbock said it was time for China to tell Russia to stop its aggression. In a debate at the UN general assembly marking the anniversary of the invasion and seen as a key barometer of the state of world opinion, China intervened to present itself as above the conflict by proposing a catalogue of measures: a ceasefire, dialogue, security guarantees for Russia, protection of civilians and the upholding of territorial integrity. The deputy Chinese envoy to the UN, Dai Bing, insisted the west was worsening the situation by arming Ukraine, saying: “Adding fuel to the fire will only exacerbate tensions”. US secretary of state Antony Blinken said countries like India and South Africa, which have not joined the West in denouncing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, were likely on a trajectory away from alignment with Moscow but that process would not happen “in one fell swoop”. “There are countries that have longstanding, decades-long relationships with Russia, with the Soviet Union before, that are challenging to break off in one fell swoop. It’s not flipping a light switch, it’s moving an aircraft carrier,” Blinken said in an interview with The Atlantic, marking the one year anniversary of the war. India has faced pressure from the West to distance itself from Moscow after Russian invaded Ukraine. New Delhi has thus far resisted that pressure, citing its longstanding ties with Russia and its economic and oil needs, Reuters reported. Russia has been India’s largest weapons supplier since the Soviet Union days. However, Washington in recent years has looked to woo New Delhi away from its traditional military supplier. India is desperate to modernise its largely Soviet-era fighter jet fleet to boost its air power after concerns over Russian supply delays due to the Ukraine war. “India for decades had Russia at the core of providing military equipment to it and its defenses, but what we’ve seen over the last few years is a trajectory away from relying on Russia and moving into partnership with us and other countries,” Blinken said. Ukraine’s supporters urged the UN general assembly to vote for a resolution that calls for Russia to end hostilities and withdraw from its neighbour on the eve of the first anniversary of Moscow’s invasion. The draft resolution is all but certain to pass later in the day but is nonbinding, the Associated Press reported. Diplomats from Ukraine’s allies seek to win over more nations that have been ambivalent toward the war in previous votes, including China. Foreign ministers and diplomats from more than 75 countries addressed the assembly during two days of debate, with many urging support for the resolution that upholds Ukraine’s territorial integrity. Venezuela’s deputy ambassador addressed the council on behalf of 16 countries that either voted against or abstained on almost all of five previous resolutions on Ukraine: Belarus, Bolivia, Cambodia, China, Cuba, Eritrea, Equatorial Guinea, Iran, Laos, Mali, Nicaragua, North Korea, St. Vincent, Syria, Venezuela and Zimbabwe. While other countries focused on Russia’s actions, deputy ambassador Joaquín Pérez Ayestarán said Wednesday that all countries without exception “must stringently comply with the United Nations Charter.” He said the countries in his group were against what he called divisive action in the general assembly, and for “a spirit of compromise.” In his own appeal, Polish foreign minister Zbigniew Rau said Ukrainians deserve “not only our compassion, but also our support and solidarity.” It’s 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: The EU’s top diplomats have failed to finalise the bloc’s tenth round of sanctions against Russia, which would ban the sale of more military-critical technologies. Talks are understood to be stuck on the question of rubber trade with Russia. Ambassadors are due to resume talks on Friday, the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Friday. The UN’s general assembly is expected to vote on a motion calling for the unconditional withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine. The 193-member assembly is expected by a massive majority to endorse the broad resolution, but China, South Africa, India and many countries in the global south are likely to continue to abstain. China’s deputy UN ambassador, Dai Bing, has said “brutal facts offer ample proof that sending weapons will not bring peace”. Dai, speaking during a UN debate on a draft resolution urging Russia to leave Ukraine, said Beijing’s “top priority is to facilitate ceasefire and cessation of hostilities without delay”, adding that it was ready to “continue playing a constructive role” in resolving the crisis in Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said he had not seen any Chinese peace plan but he would welcome a meeting between Ukraine and China. “We would like to meet with China,” he said during a news briefing in Kyiv with the visiting Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, on the eve of the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said the alliance had seen signs that China was considering supplying arms to Russia and warned Beijing against taking any such step. Stoltenberg said potential Chinese assistance would amount to providing “(direct) support to a blatant violation of international law, and of course (as) a member of the UN security council China should not in any way support violation of the U.N. charter, or international law.” The US Treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, has warned China that providing any material support to Russia’s war effort would be “a very serious concern”. “We will certainly continue to make clear to the Chinese government and to companies and banks in their jurisdictions what the rules are regarding our sanctions and the serious consequences that they would face in violating them.,” she told reporters in India. Russian forces have stepped up attacks along the eastern frontline of the war in Ukraine as Kyiv prepares to mark the sombre first anniversary of the invasion. Amid fears that the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, intends to mark the anniversary with fresh attacks on key cities, Ukraine’s general staff said it had repelled 90 assaults in the east and north-east in the past 24 hours. Russia has fired 5,000 missiles at Ukraine and carried out almost 3,500 airstrikes, according to Ukraine’s general staff. Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has arrived in Kyiv to meet Volodymyr Zelenskiy as the first anniversary of the Russian invasion approaches. Sánchez said: “I’m back in Ukraine a year after the start of the war. We will stay by Ukraine’s side until peace returns to Europe.” Sánchez confirmed that Spain will send Ukraine six Leopard tanks, but would be willing to up that number to 10 if necessary. He also said Spain had offered to train Ukrainian soldiers in how to use the tanks. “We understand that Ukraine needs more [weapons] to put an end to this aggression and recover its territories,” Sánchez said. “ Vladimir Putin has said Russia will deploy its new Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile, nicknamed “Satan 2”, as well as roll out hypersonic missiles and new nuclear submarines. In an address to mark the “Defender of the Fatherland” holiday on Thursday, Putin said Russia would “pay increased attention” to boost its nuclear forces on land, sea and in the air. The founder of Russia’s Wagner mercenary force, Yevgeny Prigozhin, has said much-needed ammunition for his troops has been dispatched, after a public row in which he accused the military leadership of treason. In an audio clip on Thursday, Prigozhin said he felt the pressure he and others had put on the defence ministry had paid off, and he had been told that ammunition was now on its way. Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin was able to pass UK anti-money laundering checks by submitting a utility bill in the name of his elderly mother, according to a report. Leaked emails seen by the Financial Times show that the law firm Discreet Law in 2021 requested identification documents from Prigozhin, who has been placed under sanctions and accused of human rights abuses around the world, before taking him on as a client. The sanctions introduced by G7 nations against Russia since its invasion of Ukraine should be applied by all G20 countries, Italy’s economy minister, Giancarlo Giorgetti, has said. In a statement issued on the sidelines of a summit among G20 finance leaders in Bengaluru, Giorgetti said the sanctions “must be applied not only by the G7 countries but also by the G20 countries”. Australia will send drones to Ukraine and expand sanctions against Russian government, military and media figures as part of a pledge to stand with Kyiv “for as long as it takes”. The package includes travel bans and asset freezes for a further 90 Russian individuals and 40 Russian entities, including the state-owned media outlet Sputnik. Finland will send three Leopard 2 battle tanks to Ukraine, the country’s defence ministry has said. The announcement comes after Sweden’s defence minister said it was open to sending some of its Leopard battle tanks. The Czech government has also announced a further military aid shipment to Ukraine. A US army official has said it could take up to two years for M1 Abrams tanks to be delivered to Ukraine. The US announced in January that it would supply Ukraine with 31 advanced M1 Abrams tanks worth $400m in a matter of months. But plans are still being drawn up on how they will be delivered, and when, the US army secretary Christine Wormuth said. The UK’s former prime minister Boris Johnson has warned that Britain’s security could be at risk if Ukraine does not win in the face of Russian aggression. In an interview with Sky News ahead of the one-year anniversary of the war, Johnson urged the UK to “break the ice” by becoming the first country to supply Ukraine with fighter jets. Moldova has dismissed an accusation by Russia’s defence ministry that Ukraine planned to invade the breakaway Moldovan region of Transdniestria after staging a false-flag operation, and called for calm. The Russian ministry said Ukraine planned to stage an attack purportedly by Russian forces from Transnistria as a pretext for the invasion, state media reported. Ukrainian courts have brought charges against nearly 300 individuals for war crimes since Russia’s full-fledged invasion a year ago, an official has said. Ukraine’s prosecutor coordinating war crimes cases in The Hague, Myroslava Krasnoborova, said 26 individuals had been tried and convicted and a total of 276 individuals charged with war crimes. The Kerch bridge, which connects mainland Russia to the occupied Crimean peninsula, has reopened to road traffic, deputy prime minister Marat Khusnullin has announced. The bridge, which has served as a vital transport link for carrying military equipment to Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine, was partially destroyed by a deadly blast in October. A Russian man who has lived in Poland for many years has been charged with spying, Polish authorities said. The suspect was detained in April on suspicion of collecting information between 2015 and April 2022 concerning the military readiness of Poland’s armed forces and of Nato, and then passing them on to the Russian intelligence service. A series of cyber-attacks on Wednesday targeting Italian companies and public institutions, including the websites of the defence ministry and police, were “a threat, a warning” from Russia, Italy’s foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, has said. The attacks, which were claimed by the Russian group NoName057, came after Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni’s visit to Ukraine this week. The White House has said Joe Biden will meet virtually on Friday with G7 leaders and Volodymyr Zelenskiy and will announce a new wave of sanctions against Russia. The leaders of the 27 EU countries have issued a joint statement on the eve of the one-year anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, vowing not to rest until Ukraine prevails, is rebuilt and “justice is done”. Ukraine is “part of our European family” and its people have shown “resolve in defending democracy and freedom, resilience in the face of hardship and dignity when confronted with Russia’s crimes”, the statement reads. The European Union will continue to support Ukraine in political, economic, humanitarian, financial and military terms, including through swift coordinated procurement from European industry. We will also support Ukraine’s reconstruction, for which we will strive to use frozen and immobilised Russian assets in accordance with EU and international law. We will further increase collective pressure on Russia to end its war of aggression. The EU and its partners have acted “swiftly and in unity” and will continue to stand firmly and in full solidarity with Ukraine and its people “for as long as it takes”, it continues. We support President Zelenskiy’s peace formula. Together with our international partners, we will make sure that Ukraine prevails, that international law is respected, that peace and Ukraine’s territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders are restored, that Ukraine is rebuilt, and that justice is done. Iran will abstain from a UN general assembly vote on the draft resolution calling for Russia to unconditionally and immediately withdraw from Ukraine’s territory, my colleague Patrick Wintour writes. The 193-strong UN general assembly is expected by a massive majority to endorse the resolution later today, although China, South Africa, India and many countries in the global south are likely to continue to abstain. Ukraine’s central bank has unveiled a commemorative banknote to mark the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion. One side of the 20-hryvnia (£.0.45) note shows three soldiers raising the national flag, while the other side features an image of two hands tied with tape, an apparent allusion to the alleged war crimes that Ukraine has accused Russian forces of committing. Ukraine’s national bank governor, Andriy Pyshnyi, said during a presentation in Kyiv: To mark the anniversary of the war, we decided to launch a commemorative banknote which will depict on a small piece of paper a year of emotions, patterns, content and iconic things. Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has confirmed that his country will send Ukraine six Leopard tanks, but would be willing to up that number to 10 if necessary. He also said Spain had offered to train Ukrainian soldiers in how to use the tanks. “We understand that Ukraine needs more [weapons] to put an end to this aggression and recover its territories,” Sánchez said. “That’s why we’re stepping up our military contributions and that’s why my government announced its decision on Wednesday to send six Leopard tanks.” Speaking on Thursday during his second visit since Russia invaded almost a year ago, he also underlined Spain’s commitment to Ukraine and to the 165,000 Ukrainian refugees it has taken in over the past 12 months. Sánchez said that Ukraine – unlike its enemy – was “fighting for what is right and it knows what it’s fighting for”. He added: Ukraine is fighting for its survival while your enemy is fighting for power. Its fight is not honourable; yours is a song of freedom. A US army official has said it could take up to two years for M1 Abrams tanks to be delivered to Ukraine. The US announced in January that it would supply Ukraine with 31 advanced M1 Abrams tanks worth $400m in a matter of months. But plans are still being drawn up on how they will be delivered, and when, CNN quotes the US army secretary Christine Wormuth as saying. The US army is “looking at what’s the fastest way we can get the tanks to the Ukrainians”, she said. It’s not going to be a matter of weeks, I will say that. None of the options that we’re exploring are weeks or two months. There are longer timelines involved. But I think there are options that are less than two years, less than a year and a half. But again we have to look at the pros and cons of each of them. Among the options being presented to the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, were building tanks “from scratch”, she said. She added that another option would include “countries that we’ve sold tanks to previously”, which could “presumably get tanks to the Ukrainians more quickly but might disrupt relations with important allies”. Earlier we reported that four people have been arrested in London on suspicion of criminal damage, after the campaign group Led By Donkeys painted a Ukrainian flag on the road outside the Russian embassy. Here’s the clip: China’s deputy UN ambassador, Dai Bing, has told the UN general assembly that one year into the Ukraine war, “brutal facts offer ample proof that sending weapons will not bring peace”. Dai, speaking during a UN debate on a draft resolution urging Russia to leave Ukraine, said China’s position on Ukraine has been “consistent and clear”. Beijing’s “top priority is to facilitate ceasefire and cessation of hostilities without delay”, he said, adding that it was ready to “continue playing a constructive role” in resolving the crisis in Ukraine. On the subject of nuclear war, Dai said “all parties should strictly abide by nuclear conventions”, adding: Nuclear weapons cannot be used, nuclear war cannot be fought. The UK’s former prime minister Boris Johnson has warned that Britain’s security could be at risk if Ukraine does not win in the face of Russian aggression. In an interview with Sky News ahead of the one-year anniversary of the war, Johnson urged the UK to “break the ice” by becoming the first country to supply Ukraine with fighter jets. He said: What the Ukrainians want is F-16s. As it happens, we don’t have F-16s but we do have Typhoons. I think there’s an argument for the UK breaking the ice and giving them some Typhoons. If it’s a question of training people up to use those machines – we can do that. The consequences of a Russian victory would be Vladimir Putin’s ability to threaten the Baltic states, and that the UK’s security would be “much more gravely in peril”. On the subject of China, Johnson said Beijing would be making an “historic mistake” if it supplied Moscow with weapons and that he was “very concerned” to see China’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, meet Vladimir Putin yesterday. Why does China want to be contaminated by association with Putin, who has revealed himself to be this gangster and adventurer? I think it would be a big, big mistake by China. The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has said Ukraine has become the centre of the European continent in a video address ahead of the first year anniversary of Russia’s invasion. Many had predicted that Kyiv would fall “in a matter of days” when it was invaded by Moscow’s troops last February, but this did not account for “the moral and the physical courage” of Ukraine’s people, she said. Europe “is with you”, she said, addressing the Ukrainian people. We have been with you in this existential fight from the beginning. We have massively stepped up our economic, humanitarian and military support. Because Ukraine has become the centre of our continent, the place where our values are upheld, where our freedom is defended, where the future of Europe is written. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, says he and the UN’s secretary general, António Guterres, discussed ways to end Russian aggression based on the principles of the UN Charter and international law. Posting to Twitter, Kuleba said he commended Guterres’ efforts to enable the Black Sea Grain Initiative which he said “will go down in history as his legacy”. Meeting in Brussels, the EU’s top diplomats failed to finalise the bloc’s tenth round of sanctions against Russia, which would ban the sale of more military-critical technologies. Ambassadors are due to resume talks on Friday, the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Friday. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, had told Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the EU aimed to have the measures in place by 24 February. Talks are understood to be stuck on the question of rubber trade with Russia. The latest package would ban the export of components for drones and helicopters and spare parts for vehicles, items that were found on the battlefields of Ukraine and had been missed off previous ones. The search for consensus came as British, US and EU officials met on Thursday to share information about sanctions, amid a growing international push to curb apparent Russian attempts to dodge the restrictions with the help of its neighbours. Following the start of western sanctions in February 2022, exports from Europe and the US to Russia fell sharply, but some trade has been rerouted to former Soviet states in the Caucasus and Central Asia. Western exports to Kyrgyzstan and Armenia have increased dramatically, with smaller but noticeable increases to Kazakhstan and Georgia, according to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Western officials fear this trade is being sent on to Russia, which has also seen a jump in imports from Turkey and the United Arab Emirates since the war began. Officials are now studying on a case-by-case basis how to prevent any sanctions dodging, via a mix of persuasion or threats to cut market access. Earlier this week ten EU countries called for a crackdown on Russia’s attempts to source military parts from front companies in neighbouring countries, with threats to cut off access to the EU market to companies and individuals involved in such trade. It’s 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Russian forces have stepped up attacks along the eastern frontline of the war in Ukraine as Kyiv prepares to mark the sombre first anniversary of the invasion. Amid fears that the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, intends to mark the anniversary with fresh attacks on key cities, Ukraine’s general staff said it had repelled 90 assaults in the east and north-east in the past 24 hours.

The Czech government has also announced a further military aid shipment to Ukraine. A Russian fighter plane crashed on Thursday and the pilot was killed in Russia’s Belgorod region, near the border with Ukraine. The cause of the crash was a “technical malfunction”, according to preliminary information, the Russian state-run Tass news agency cited the ministry as saying. The plane crashed in an uninhabited area and there were no reports of other damage, it said. Moldova has dismissed an accusation by Russia’s defence ministry that Ukraine planned to invade the breakaway Moldovan region of Transdniestria after staging a false-flag operation, and called for calm.

I’m Léonie Chao-Fong and I’ll be bringing you all the latest developments from the Russia-Ukraine war. I’m on Twitter or you can email me. The Kerch bridge, which connects mainland Russia to the occupied Crimean peninsula, has reopened to road traffic, deputy prime minister Marat Khusnullin has announced. The bridge, which has served as a vital transport link for carrying military equipment to Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine, was partially destroyed by a deadly blast in October. The exact cause of the blast remains unclear. Russia blamed Ukraine for the explosion, but Kyiv has not claimed responsibility. In a statement posted to Telegram, Khusnullin said: All lanes of the Crimean bridge are fully open to car traffic 39 days ahead of schedule. He said the reopening of the bridge was a “big gift for the Defender of the Fatherland Day” national holiday celebrated in Russia today. He added that “work was carried out round-the-clock” by around 500 people to complete the repairs, and that other parts of the bridge were still being restored. The EU should consider appointing a full-time commissioner to oversee the drafting and enforcing of sanctions so they can be used effectively against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the Lithuanian foreign minister, Gabrielius Landsbergis, told the Guardian in an interview. He was speaking in London as he met the foreign secretary, James Cleverly, to discuss the summer Nato summit in Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital, where the Baltic states will press for progress on Ukraine’s Nato application and for more to be done to defend the bloc’s European flank. He said he was frustrated with the number of exemptions to sanctions, saying “sometimes we derogate so much that we can call this a hole in a ship that can sink the ship”. He cited the derogations from sanctions provided in September for coal, cement and wood on the basis that they were linked to protecting food security. There needs to be a clearer explanation of these derogations. In some cases there may be a link, but when we talk about cement, I am sorry, I cannot find the link with food security. While EU officials had been appointed to check how sanctions were being implemented, Landsbergis argued, “sanctions are becoming so important to the EU single market that we may need to go further and make sanctions policy a political portfolio”. Read the full story here: The UN’s general assembly is meeting for a second day ahead of a vote on a motion calling for the unconditional withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine. The 193-member assembly will vote on the motion, backed by Kyiv and its allies, to mark the first anniversary of Moscow’s full-fledged invasion of its neighbour, which UN secretary general António Guterres denounced as an “attack on our collective conscience”. In an address marking the start of the session yesterday, Guterres warned of a further escalation of the war, and referred to “indirect threats” of the use of nuclear weapons and “irresponsible” military actions in the vicinity of nuclear power plants. The assembly is expected by a massive majority to endorse a broad resolution demanding Russia unconditionally and immediately withdraw from Ukraine’s territory, but China, South Africa, India and many countries in the global south are likely to continue to abstain, underlining their alienation from what they regarded as the west’s war. You can watch the vote and the preceding debate live here: Unlike the UN’s security council, Russia has no veto right in the general assembly. The resolutions are not binding under international law. Since Russia invaded Ukraine last year, the assembly has passed a series of resolutions condemning its actions. In March last year, 141 of the 193 UN member states voted in favour of a resolution calling Russia to withdraw from Ukraine “immediately” In April, the assembly decided with a much narrower majority of 93 votes to suspend Russia’s UN human rights council membership in Geneva. In October, 143 member states condemned Russia’s “illegal annexations” of Ukraine’s Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhia regions. Anna and her husband left Russia after Putin’s mobilisation. She told Clea Skopeliti of the difficulties in Turkey and the potential dangers of moving back. “A few months after leaving Russia, I came back to Moscow. We’re still figuring out what to do. We’re considering moving back to Russia because we can’t afford living in Turkey, since the rouble has become much weaker. “But it’s not safe. There could be another mobilisation at any moment, and we worry my husband could be drafted because he has an engineering background. It is so hard to make all those decisions when there are so many things you don’t know. I’m really scared of him being drafted because if they take you, there’s nothing you can do. There are two options: war or jail.” Read more here: Here are the latest images from Ukraine: Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Thursday he had not seen any Chinese peace plan but he would welcome a meeting between Ukraine and China, Reuters reports. “We would like to meet with China,” he said during a news briefing in Kyiv with the visiting Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, on the eve of the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Earlier on Thursday, the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said the alliance had seen signs that China was considering supplying arms to Russia and warned Beijing against taking any such step. The announcement came days after the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, warned China of consequences if it provided material support to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Stoltenberg told Reuters: We haven’t seen any supplies of lethal aid from China to Russia, but we have seen signs that they are considering and may be planning for that …That’s the reason why the United States and other allies have been very clear, warning against that. And China should of course not support Russia’s illegal war. There was no immediate comment from China, but its foreign ministry said earlier on Thursday that any potential intelligence on arms transfer by China to Russia that the US planned to release was just speculation. The Guardian reporters Shaun Walker, Isobel Koshiw, Pjotr Sauer, Morten Risberg, Liz Cookman and Luke Harding revisited one of the grimmest chapters of Russia’s war – the ruin of Mariupol. For more than 80 days, the Russians bombarded Mariupol, determined to take the port city even if they had to raze it to the ground first. After Russian forces finally crushed Ukrainian resistance last May, they set about putting their stamp on Mariupol, erasing evidence of the recent atrocities and of past Ukrainian history in the city. A year on from the invasion of Ukraine, the Guardian tells the story of Mariupol – perhaps the bloodiest and most shocking chapter of Russia’s brutal war. Read more here: The sanctions introduced by G7 nations against Russia since its invasion of Ukraine should be applied by all G20 countries, Italy’s economy minister, Giancarlo Giorgetti, said on Thursday. In a statement issued on the sidelines of a summit among G20 finance leaders in Bengaluru, Giorgetti said the sanctions “must be applied not only by the G7 countries but also by the G20 countries”, Reuters reports. “Otherwise Russia circumvents the sanctions system and the effects risk falling short of our expectations,” the minister added. Australia will send drones to Ukraine and expand sanctions against Russian government, military and media figures as part of a pledge to stand with Kyiv “for as long as it takes”. Announcing the new support on the first anniversary of Russia’s large-scale invasion of Ukraine, the government said the sanctions would also target “those spreading mistruths to justify this war”. The package includes travel bans and asset freezes for a further 90 Russian individuals and 40 Russian entities, including the state-owned media outlet Sputnik. Read more here: Earlier we reported that the US Treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, had stepped up calls for increased financing support to Ukraine during a news conference in India. Yellen also told journalists that talks between the US and China on economic issues would resume at “an appropriate time”, while warning Beijing that providing any material support to Moscow’s war effort would be “a very serious concern”. On the subject of US sanctions on Russia over its war in Ukraine, she said: We have made clear that providing material support to Russia or assistance with any type of systemic sanctions evasion would be a very serious concern to us. And we will certainly continue to make clear to the Chinese government and to companies and banks in their jurisdictions what the rules are regarding our sanctions and the serious consequences that they would face in violating them. The warning came a day after China’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, met Vladimir Putin in Moscow, as Beijing and Moscow reaffirmed their close bilateral relationship before the first anniversary of the start of the Ukraine war. Ukrainian courts have brought charges against nearly 300 individuals for war crimes since Russia’s full-fledged invasion a year ago, an official has said. Ukraine’s prosecutor coordinating war crimes cases in The Hague, Myroslava Krasnoborova, said 26 individuals had been tried and convicted and a total of 276 individuals charged with war crimes. The convictions were for crimes including rape and murder, the shelling of residential buildings, cruel treatment of civilians and pillaging, she said. More than 71,000 alleged war crimes have been registered in Ukraine since 24 February 2022, she said. The “atrocities and destruction” caused by Russia were “colossal and endless”, she said during a briefing. Millions of people have been forced to leave everything behind. Massive missile attacks are destroying the civilian infrastructure and many tragically lost their lives. This damage cannot be undone, but what we can do is to ensure that those responsible are brought to justice. Ukraine’s law enforcement agencies are being assisted in war crimes investigations by dozens of countries and institutions. Russia has denied committing atrocities or targeting civilians. Anti-war protesters in London poured yellow and blue paint on to the road outside the Russian embassy to create a giant Ukrainian flag before the one-year anniversary of Russia’s full-fledged invasion. The campaign group Led By Donkeys halted traffic before spreading more than 300 litres of paint across the road, using wheelbarrows and brushes to make the 500 square metre flag. In a statement, the group said Ukraine was “an independent state and a people with every right to self-determination”, adding: The existence of a massive Ukrainian flag outside Putin’s embassy in London will serve to remind him of that. The group said the non-toxic, solvent-free and fast-dry edible paint was washable and designed for road art. Four people – three men and one woman – were arrested on suspicion of criminal damage and obstructing the highway, the Metropolitan police said. A Russian man who has lived in Poland for many years has been charged with spying, Polish authorities said. The suspect was detained in April on suspicion of collecting information between 2015 and April 2022 concerning the military readiness of Poland’s armed forces and of Nato, and then passing them on to the Russian intelligence service. An indictment was submitted last Friday to Gdansk district court against the suspect, a spokesperson for the Gdansk district prosecutor’s office said in a statement. They said the Russian citizen’s “espionage activity was focused on military units located in the north-eastern part of Poland, as part of which he carried out tasks of reconnaissance of important elements of the Polish armed force”. The case was one of “several” concerning activity for the Russian and Belarusian intelligence services against the Polish military, they added. North Korean state media have marked the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine by blaming Nato and calling the US’s involvement a “trail to self-destruction.” In comments to the state-run news agency KCNA, reported by Reuters, Kim Yoo-chul, described as an international affairs critic, said the conflict in Ukraine was the “inevitable product of coercion and hegemony” by the US and its allies. He wrote: If Ukraine had not blindly taken part in the US policy of anti-Russian confrontation, if it had abandoned the dirty demons of the United States and promoted reconciliation and unity with its neighbours, the situation would not have reached the point where it is as bad as it is now. The current situation in Ukraine once again proves that there can be no peace in the world at any time unless the United States’ policy of force, tyranny and greedy aggression … is ended. North Korea has forged close ties with Russia since Vladimir Putin ordered his troops to launch a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. It has publicly supported Moscow in statements as well as at the UN, and has expressed support for Russia’s proclaimed annexation of parts of Ukraine. Here are some images we have received of Ukrainian army volunteers receiving Challenger tank training at a military base in southern England. Based on the UK’s basic soldier training, the course covers weapons handling, battlefield first aid, fieldcraft, patrol tactics and the law of armed conflict. Italy’s foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, said a series of cyber-attacks on Wednesday targeting Italian companies and public institutions, including the websites of the defence ministry and police, were “a threat, a warning” from Russia after the prime minister Giorgia Meloni’s visit to Ukraine this week. The attacks, which caused limited damage due to strong cyber-defence systems being in place, were claimed by the Russian group NoName057, which wrote on Telegram that Italy was “Russiaphobic”, while referring to the government’s approval of a sixth military aid package for Ukraine. Tajani made the comments to reporters on the sidelines of the UN’s emergency special session in New York marking one year since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Meloni met Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Kyiv on Tuesday on her first visit to Ukraine since she came to power in October. Meloni pledged that Italy would continue to give “military, financial and civil support”. “Those who support Ukraine, even militarily, are those who work for peace,” she said. Vladimir Putin has said Russia will deploy its new Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile, nicknamed “Satan 2”, as well as roll out hypersonic missiles and new nuclear submarines. In an address to mark the “Defender of the Fatherland” holiday on Thursday, Putin said Russia would “pay increased attention” to boost its nuclear forces on land, sea and in the air, Reuters reports. The Russian leader, who has in recent days has signalled he is ready to rip up the architecture of nuclear arms control, invoked the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany to argue that Russia needed modernised armed forces to guarantee its sovereignty. It comes after he said Russia would halt its participation in New Start, the last major remaining nuclear arms control treaty with the US. In his address today, Putin said the Sarmat silo-based intercontinental ballistic missiles would be deployed this year. The RS-28 Sarmat liquid-fueled missile has been in development for years. Russia said it had test-launched the missile in April 2022. The US believes Russia carried out a test of the Sarmat just before President Joe Biden’s visit to Kyiv earlier this week and that the test failed, CNN has reported. The Russian defence ministry has not commented on that report. In addition, Putin said Russia would continue mass production of air-based hypersonic Kinzhal systems and would start mass supplies of sea-based Zircon hypersonic missiles. In remarks issued by the Kremlin earlier today, Putin said: With the adoption of the Borei-A nuclear-powered submarine project ‘Emperor Alexander III’ into the navy, the share of modern weapons and equipment in the naval strategic nuclear forces will reach 100%. Emperor Alexander III, first launched in December, is the seventh Borei-A class submarine and can each carry 16 Bulava submarine-launched ballistic missiles. Putin said Russia would develop all parts of Russia’s conventional armed forces, improve training, add advanced equipment, bolster the arms industry and promote soldiers who had proven themselves in battle. He said: A modern, efficient army and navy are a guarantee of the country’s security and sovereignty, a guarantee of its stable development and its future. Therefore, we will continue to pay priority attention to strengthening our defence capability. Hello everyone, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong taking over the live blog from Geneva Abdul. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. The Ukrainian comedian Vasyl Baidak sparks an unlikely and enduring friendship with retiree Iryna Terekhova when he joins a group of young people from Kyiv to rebuild her home, in a new Guardian documentary. Terekhova, a devout Orthodox Christian, lives in a farming village in the Chernihiv region. Her house was destroyed during the Russian occupation of March 2022. She reflects on a traumatic time when she was forced to share her cellar with Russian soldiers who said they had come to liberate her, but who devastated her village. Refusing to leave the area where she has lived most of her life, Terekhova is galvanised by the entrepreneurial spirit of the young Kyiv builders, while Baidak proves that humour is the vital ingredient to bolster their collective spirit. “I wait for the war to end, that’s when our new year will begin. For now, 2022 still continues,” concludes Iryna. Hello and welcome to those now following today’s live coverage on the war in Ukraine. It’s 1pm in Kyiv. On the eve of the anniversary of the start of the war, Vladimir Putin has threatened to strengthen Russia’s nuclear forces. His comments were released before an address to mark Thursday’s Defender of the Fatherland public holiday. And Nato’s chief, Jens Stoltenberg, says the military alliance has seen “some signs” that China may be planning to support Russia in its war in Ukraine, and strongly urged Beijing to desist from what would be a violation of international law. The UN general assembly is expected to endorse a broad resolution demanding Russia unconditionally and immediately withdraw from Ukraine’s territory by a massive majority. But China, South Africa, India and many countries in the global south are likely to continue to abstain, underlining their alienation from what they regarded as the west’s war. We’ll have more on these stories shortly. In the meantime, here are the key recent developments: Russia is intensifying hostilities in Ukraine a year after its invasion in a deliberate attempt to deplete Ukrainian forces, the Ukrainian military said on Thursday. The fiercest fighting remained around the eastern city of Bakhmut, Brig Gen Oleksiy Gromov said, according to Reuters. Finland will send three Leopard 2 battle tanks to Ukraine, the country’s defence ministry said, according to Reuters. The founder of Russia’s Wagner mercenary force has said much-needed ammunition for his troops has been dispatched, after a public row in which he accused the military leadership of treason. In an audio clip on Thursday, Prigozhin said he felt the pressure he and others had put on the defence ministry had paid off, and he had been told that ammunition was now on its way. A Russian fighter plane crashed and the pilot was killed in Russia’s Belgorod region, near the border with Ukraine, on Thursday . The cause of the crash was a “technical malfunction”, according to preliminary information. The plane crashed in an uninhabited area and there were no reports of other damage. Sweden is open to sending some of its Leopard battle tanks to Ukraine as it prepares to present another package of aid to help Kyiv fight off the Russian invasion, the country’s defence minister said. Moldova dismissed an accusation by Russia’s defence ministry on Thursday that Ukraine planned to invade the breakaway Moldovan region of Transdniestria after staging a false-flag operation, and called for calm. The US Treasury secretary stepped up calls for increased financing support to Ukraine, as the US readies an additional $10bn in economic assistance in the coming weeks. Janet Yellen said it was critical for the IMF to “move swiftly” towards a fully financed loan programme for Ukraine. ‘I think he is not going to stop’, the UK defence secretary has said of Vladimir Putin’s war. Ben Wallace said the conflict in Ukraine could last another year. PA news also reported that Wallace stressed that the war was “not a Nato conflict”. Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has arrived in Kyiv to meet Volodymyr Zelenskiy as the first anniversary of the Russian invasion approaches. Sánchez said: “I’m back in Ukraine a year after the start of the war. We will stay by Ukraine’s side until peace returns to Europe.” The town of Vuhledar, in southern Donetsk oblast, has experienced heavy shelling again, according to the UK MoD’s latest defence intelligence update. “There is a realistic possibility that Russia is preparing for another offensive effort in this area despite costly failed attacks in early February and late 2022,” the update on Thursday morning said. The Chinese government did not consult with Kyiv when preparing its peace plan to end Russia’s war in Ukraine, a senior Ukrainian official said on condition of anonymity. Vladimir Putin will use an address to mark Thursday’s Defender of the Fatherland public holiday to threaten to strengthen the country’s nuclear forces. Putin said that for the first time, Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missiles – a weapon able to carry multiple nuclear warheads – would be deployed this year. Russia is intensifying hostilities in Ukraine a year after its invasion in a deliberate attempt to deplete Ukrainian forces, the Ukrainian military said on Thursday. Brig Gen Oleksiy Gromov said Russia had set the goal of capturing all the territory it does not control in the two regions that make up the industrial Donbas area of eastern Ukraine by the summer, Reuters reports. The fiercest fighting remained around the eastern city of Bakhmut, he told a military briefing on the eve of Friday’s anniversary of the invasion. Gromov said: The enemy, having an advantage in the resource of human mobilisation, is deliberately intensifying hostilities in an effort to deplete the units of the armed forces of Ukraine … In the short term, it is important for the Kremlin to capture the key settlements in the Donetsk region, and in the future to capture [all of] the Donetsk and Luhansk regions before the summer. Finland will send three Leopard 2 battle tanks to Ukraine, Reuters cites the country’s defence ministry as saying on Thursday. The announcement comes after Sweden’s defence minister said it was open to sending some of its Leopard battle tanks. As reported earlier, the Czech government has announced a further military aid shipment to Ukraine. Here are some of the latest images from Ukraine: The Czech government has approved a further military aid shipment to Ukraine and will continue to send equipment from stocks, the defence minister, Jana Černochová, said on Thursday. Černochová did not disclose details of specific equipment being shipped, reports Reuters, but said the country had so far sent 38 tanks, 55 armoured vehicles, four aircraft and 13 self-propelled howitzers from its military reserves, alongside larger shipments from the private sector. The founder of Russia’s Wagner mercenary force has said much-needed ammunition for his troops has been dispatched, after a public row in which he accused the military leadership of treason. On Wednesday, Yevgeny Prigozhin published a grisly image of dozens of men who he said had been killed because commanders including the defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, and the chief of the general staff, Valery Gerasimov, had withheld ammunition to spite him, Reuters reports. Neither man commented but the defence ministry rejected the charge. In an audio clip on Thursday, Prigozhin said he felt the pressure he and others had put on the ministry had paid off, and he had been told that ammunition was now on its way. “So far it’s all on paper but, so we have been told, the principal documents have already been signed,” Prigozhin said. A Russian fighter plane crashed on Thursday and the pilot was killed in Russia’s Belgorod region, near the border with Ukraine. The cause of the crash was a “technical malfunction”, according to preliminary information, the TASS news agency cited the ministry as saying. The plane crashed in an uninhabited area and there were no reports of other damage, it said. In a post on the Telegram messenger app, Belgorod’s governor, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said the emergency services and investigators were on the scene near the town of Valyuki, and the reason for the crash was being established. Mikhail Afanasyev wants your letters, write Andrew Roth and Pjotr Sauer. The Russian journalist from Abakan in Siberia was jailed last year for writing about a small group of national guardsmen who had refused to fight in Ukraine. But Afanasyev remains defiant, while local supporters crowdfund thousands of dollars to pay off his legal fines. “It is the duty of every person to expand the horizon of freedom by his actions, so that light pours in and overcomes the darkness,” Afanasyev wrote from pre-trial detention in a letter to his supporters this month. “I really ask you to write to me, very much! It helps me a lot … I just want to be a journalist, faithful to my profession to the end and defend its values.” Read more of the story here: Sweden is open to sending some of its Leopard battle tanks to Ukraine as it prepares to present another package of aid to help Kyiv fight off the Russian invasion, its defence minister told the local news agency TT. The latest instalment Sweden has delivered to Ukraine since the invasion includes armoured infantry fighting vehicles, which the defence minister, Pal Jonson, told Reuters would be the country’s main contribution to Ukraine in terms of equipment for ground warfare. Sweden is also preparing to send Ukraine the advanced Archer artillery system to Ukraine, and support has been growing in the Swedish parliament for additionally contributing some of the country’s around 120 Leopard tanks. “We are open to that and we are in close dialogue with above all Germany about it,” Jonson was quoted by TT as saying. Moldova has dismissed an accusation by Russia’s defence ministry on Thursday that Ukraine planned to invade the breakaway Moldovan region of Transdniestria after staging a false-flag operation, and called for calm, Reuters reports. Earlier we reported on Russia’s defence ministry accusing Ukraine of planning to invade Moldova’s breakaway Transnistria region after a false-flag operation, citing reports from the RIA news agency. The ministry said Ukraine planned to stage an attack purportedly by Russian forces from Transnistria as a pretext for the invasion, according to RIA. Separately, the Tass news agency quoted the Russian deputy foreign minister Mikhail Galuzin as saying the west had instructed the Chisinau government to stop all interaction with the Moscow-backed Transnistrian administration. Moldova’s president, Maia Sandu, accused Moscow earlier this month of planning a coup to overthrow the government and drag Transnistria into its war. The mainly Russian-speaking region broke away from the then Soviet Moldova in 1990. After the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, pro-Russia separatists fought a bloody war with the Moldovan government forces. The US Treasury secretary has stepped up calls for increased financing support to Ukraine, as the US readies an additional $10bn in economic assistance in the coming weeks. In remarks prepared for delivery to a news conference as G20 finance leaders gathered on the outskirts of the Indian technology hub of Bengaluru, Janet Yellen said it was critical for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to “move swiftly” towards a fully financed loan programme for Ukraine, Reuters reports. As President Biden has said, we will stand with Ukraine in its fight – for as long as it takes. Continued, robust support for Ukraine will be a major topic of discussion during my time here in India. Yellen added: Our economic assistance is making Ukraine’s resistance possible by supporting the home front: funding critical public services and helping keep the government running. In the coming months, we expect to provide around $10bn in additional economic support for Ukraine. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the Russian founder of the Wagner mercenary group, was able to pass UK anti-money laundering checks by submitting a utility bill in the name of his elderly mother, the FT reports. Leaked emails seen by the Financial Times show that the law firm Discreet Law in 2021 requested identification documents from Prigozhin, who has been placed under sanctions and accused of human rights abuses around the world, before taking him on as a client. As part of anti-laundering checks, Prigozhin’s Russian lawyers forwarded the London-based law firm a copy of his passport and a gas bill in the name of his then 81-year-old mother, Violetta, for an address in St Petersburg, the FT reports. Discreet Law’s founder, Roger Gherson, said the firm “cannot comment on confidential communications with [its] former clients”. Here are some of the latest images from Ukraine: Hello and welcome to those now following today’s live coverage on the war in Ukraine. It’s 10am in Kyiv.

Vladimir Putin will use an address to mark Thursday’s Defender of the Fatherland public holiday to threaten to strengthen the country’s nuclear forces. Putin said that for the first time, Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missiles – a weapon able to carry multiple nuclear warheads – would be deployed this year. Joe Biden has said Putin made a “big mistake” by suspending the last remaining nuclear arms treaty with the US. The Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, has said Russia’s decision to suspend its participation in the New Start nuclear arms reduction treaty with the US will not increase the risk of a nuclear war. Russia’s parliament on Wednesday approved Putin’s move to suspend the treaty. The Biden administration is considering releasing intelligence it believes shows that China is weighing whether to supply weapons to support Russia’s war in Ukraine, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as “an affront to our collective conscience”, at a two-day meeting of the general assembly. Friday’s anniversary is “a grim milestone for the people of Ukraine and for the international community”, he said in New York. Two civilians were killed in Russian shelling of the Kherson region in southern Ukraine on Wednesday, according to regional officials. Oleksandr Prokudin, the head of the regional military administration, said an 81-year-old woman and a 68-year-old man were killed during shelling of the village of Novotyahinka, about 40km (25 miles) from Kherson city. A Russian missile strike on the north-eastern city of Kharkiv on Wednesday morning left two civilians wounded, Oleh Synyehubov, the governor of Kharkiv region, has said. Biden vowed that the US would defend “literally every inch of Nato” territory, ahead of talks with Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, and leaders of the Bucharest Nine (B9), a collection of nations on the most eastern parts of the Nato alliance and closest to Russia. All members of the B9 have jointly condemned Russia’s war in Ukraine, a Polish presidential adviser said. Biden and the B9 leaders “reaffirmed their unwavering support for Ukraine and underscored their shared commitment to stand with the Ukrainian people for as long as it takes” according to a White House account of Wednesday afternoon’s meeting in Warsaw. China’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, has met Vladimir Putin in Moscow, as China and Russia reaffirm their close bilateral relationship. Wang told Putin that Beijing would play a “constructive” role in reaching a political settlement of the crisis in Ukraine, the Russian state-owned Tass news agency reported. Earlier on Wednesday, Wang met Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, where he said he expected to reach a “new consensus” on advancing the relationship between the two allies. Xi Jinping, China’s president, is expected to visit Putin in Russia in the coming months. Vladimir Putin has praised soldiers who are “fighting heroically, courageously, bravely” to “defend the fatherland”, in a speech at a rally in Moscow to mark a year of war in Ukraine. Thousands gathered at Luzhniki stadium in Moscow for a concert marking Defenders of the Fatherland Day. EU countries have failed to agree on a new set of sanctions against Russia meant to be in place for the one-year anniversary of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine on Friday, four diplomatic sources in Brussels have told Reuters. More talks among Brussels representatives of EU member countries were due on Thursday afternoon, said the sources. On Thursday 2 February, my friend Pete Reed died as he tried to evacuate civilians in the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, writes Cengiz Yar. Based on footage we now have of the incident, his vehicle was hit by a Russian anti-tank missile. He was killed in the blast, and others in his team were severely injured. Reports suggest it was likely a double-tap strike, a technique used frequently by Russia in Syria, where an attack is made to draw in additional support and recovery operations before a second attack is made. Pete was one of the most selfless people I’ve ever met. You should know a bit about the good he did in this world. I met him in the spring of 2016 over some drinks in Iraq, where I worked as a photographer. He was loud, a bit goofy, and trying to do some good. What good? He hadn’t quite figured that out yet. Read more by Cengiz Yar here: Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has arrived in Kyiv to meet Volodymyr Zelenskiy as the first anniversary of the Russian invasion approaches. Arriving in the Ukrainian capital, Sánchez said: I’m back in Ukraine a year after the start of the war. We will stay by Ukraine’s side until peace returns to Europe. Sánchez, who last visited Ukraine in April, is understood to have travelled to Ukraine at Zelenskiy’s invitation. The UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has said the conflict in Ukraine could last another year, PA news reports. When asked whether he could see the war continuing for another 12 months, Wallace told LBC: I think we will. I think Russia has shown a complete disregard, not only for the lives of the people of Ukraine but for its own soldiers. We are sitting here 12 months in and 188,000, actually more now, Russian soldiers are dead or injured as a result of this catastrophic miscalculation and aggression by President Putin. Wallace added: When someone has crossed the line and thinks it is OK to do that to your own people, running effectively a meat grinder for an army, I think he is not going to stop. He told LBC that planes currently held by Nato countries could be given to Ukraine, and he stressed that the war was “not a Nato conflict”, according to PA news. Wallace said: There is already talk, I think, of an eastern European country supplying MiG-29s … We’re not going to see Nato, we’re going to see countries that are members of Nato potentially put in air force equipment or MiG-29. The town of Vuhledar, in southern Donetsk oblast, has experienced heavy shelling again, according to the MoD’s latest defence intelligence update. “There is a realistic possibility that Russia is preparing for another offensive effort in this area despite costly failed attacks in early February and late 2022,” the update on Thursday morning said. Colonel General Rustam Muradov, commander of Russia’s Eastern Group of forces, is likely to be under intense pressure to improve results in Vuhledar after harsh criticism from the Russian nationalist community, according to the MoD. “However, it is unlikely that Muradov has a striking force capable of achieving a breakthrough,” it said. Ukraine’s boxing federation has joined a growing boycott of the amateur world championships over the inclusion of Russian and Belarusian boxers, who have been allowed to compete with national flags and anthems. The FBU vice-president, Oleg Ilchenko, told the public broadcaster Suspline on Wednesday that its boxers would not compete in this year’s men’s and women’s championships, which will be held in New Delhi and Tashkent respectively. Both competitions are organised by the International Boxing Association, led by a Russian, Umar Kremlev. The United States, Ireland and Britain are among nine other federations that have boycotted the women’s event, while several have also pulled out of the men’s tournament. Russia’s defence ministry accused Ukraine on Thursday of planning to invade Moldova’s breakaway Transnistria region after a false-flag operation, the RIA news agency reported. The ministry said Ukraine planned to stage an attack purportedly by Russian forces from Transnistria as a pretext for the invasion, according to RIA. Separately, the Tass news agency quoted the Russian deputy foreign minister Mikhail Galuzin as saying the west had instructed the Chisinau government to stop all interaction with the Moscow-backed Transnistrian administration. Moldova’s president, Maia Sandu, accused Moscow earlier this month of planning a coup to overthrow the government and drag Transnistria into its war. The mainly Russian-speaking region broke away from the then Soviet Moldova in 1990. After the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, pro-Russia separatists fought a bloody war with the Moldovan government forces. The 193-strong UN general assembly is expected by a massive majority on Thursday to endorse a broad resolution demanding that Russia unconditionally and immediately withdraws from Ukraine’s territory, but China, South Africa, India and many countries in the global south are likely to continue to abstain, underlining their alienation from what they regard as the west’s war. The resolution has been the subject of weeks of negotiations and has required Ukraine’s allies in the G7 to persuade Kyiv not to press for very specific wider demands and risk seeing some of the countries that have previously voted for Ukraine’s sovereignty peeling off. The last time the UN general assembly voted on the issue, 143 countries backed Ukraine and only five supported Russia. Ukraine has been warned that the number may slip to 135 in Thursday’s vote, marking the first anniversary of the war’s start, but Ukraine and its allies have been involved in last-minute high-level lobbying of countries such as Pakistan and India. Ukraine’s top diplomat Dmytro Kuleba said his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi shared “key elements of the Chinese peace plan” during their meeting in Germany earlier this week. “We are looking forward to receiving the text because this is not something that you can, you know, make your conclusions on just after hearing,” he added. Speaking at the UN general assembly on Wednesday, Kuleba told reporters that Ukraine was open to a conversation on the matter. “We are ready to talk with those who have ideas, other ideas which can help us achieve this goal,” he said. But the Ukrainian official warned on Wednesday that no peace plan should cross the “red lines” outlined by Kyiv. “The red lines are the principles of the UN charter, including respect for the territorial integrity of Ukraine,” the official said. “There will be no bargaining with any Ukrainian territories. The president [Volodymyr Zelenskiy] has already clearly said that.” The Chinese government did not consult with Kyiv when preparing its peace plan to end Russia’s war in Ukraine, a senior Ukrainian official said on condition of anonymity. “China did not consult with us,” the official told reporters, including AFP. Beijing has promised to publish its proposed “political solution” to Ukraine conflict this week, in time for the first anniversary of Russia’s 24 February invasion of its neighbour. Nato’s chief said on Wednesday that the military alliance had seen “some signs” that China may be planning to support Russia in its war in Ukraine, and strongly urged Beijing to desist from what would be a violation of international law. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, also told the Associated Press in an interview that the alliance, while not a party to the war, would support Ukraine “for as long as it takes”. Asked whether Nato had any indication that China might be ready to provide arms or other support to Russia’s war, Stoltenberg said: “We have seen some signs that they may be planning for that and of course Nato allies, the United States, have been warning against it because this is something that should not happen. China should not support Russia’s illegal war.” Stoltenberg said potential Chinese assistance would amount to providing “[direct] support to a blatant violation of international law, and of course [as] a member of the UN security council China should not in any way support violation of the UN charter, or international law.” On Wednesday, Vladimir Putin hosted the Chinese Communist party’s most senior foreign policy official, Wang Yi, raising concern in the west that Beijing might be ready to offer Moscow stronger support in the almost year-old war. Vladimir Putin will use an address to mark Thursday’s Defender of the Fatherland public holiday to threaten to strengthen the country’s nuclear forces. “As before, we will pay increased attention to strengthening the nuclear triad,” Putin said in remarks issued early on Thursday morning by the Kremlin. The “triad” refers to nuclear missiles based on land, sea and in the air. Putin said that for the first time, Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missiles - a weapon able to carry multiple nuclear warheads – would be deployed this year. “We will continue mass production of air-based hypersonic Kinzhal systems and will start mass supplies of sea-based Zircon hypersonic missiles,” Putin said. Hello and welcome to today’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. On the eve of the anniversary of the start of the war, Vladimir Putin has threatened to strengthen Russia’s nuclear forces. His comments were released ahead of an address to mark Thursday’s Defender of the Fatherland public holiday. And Nato’s chief says the military alliance has seen “some signs” that China may be planning to support Russia in its war in Ukraine, and strongly urged Beijing to desist from what would be a violation of international law. We’ll have more on these stories shortly. In the meantime, here are the key recent developments: Joe Biden has said Putin made a “big mistake” by suspending the last remaining nuclear arms treaty with the US. Russia’s decision to suspend its participation in the New Start nuclear arms reduction treaty with the US will not increase the risk of a nuclear war, Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, has said. Russia’s parliament on Wednesday approved Putin’s move to suspend the treaty. The Biden administration is considering releasing intelligence it believes shows that China is weighing whether to supply weapons to support Russia’s war in Ukraine, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday. The UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as “an affront to our collective conscience”, at a two-day meeting of the general assembly. Friday’s anniversary is “a grim milestone for the people of Ukraine and for the international community”, he said in New York. Two civilians were killed in Russian shelling of the Kherson region in southern Ukraine on Wednesday, according to regional officials. Oleksandr Prokudin, the head of the regional military administration, said an 81-year-old woman and a 68-year-old man were killed during shelling of the village of Novotyahinka, about 40km (25 miles) from Kherson city. A Russian missile strike on the north-eastern city of Kharkiv on Wednesday morning left two civilians wounded, Oleh Synyehubov, the governor of Kharkiv region, has said. Biden vowed that the US would defend “literally every inch of Nato” territory, ahead of talks with Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, and leaders of the Bucharest Nine (B9), a collection of nations on the most eastern parts of the Nato alliance and closest to Russia. All members of the Bucharest Nine (B9) have jointly condemned Russia’s war in Ukraine, a Polish presidential adviser said. Biden and the B9 leaders “reaffirmed their unwavering support for Ukraine and underscored their shared commitment to stand with the Ukrainian people for as long as it takes” according to a White House account of Wednesday afternoon’s meeting in Warsaw. China’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, has met Vladimir Putin in Moscow, as China and Russia reaffirm their close bilateral relationship. Wang told Putin that Beijing will play a “constructive” role in reaching a political settlement of the crisis in Ukraine, the Russian state-owned Tass news agency reported. Earlier on Wednesday, Wang met Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, where he said he expected to reach a “new consensus” on advancing the relationship between the two allies. Xi Jinping, China’s president, is expected to visit Putin in Russia in the coming months. Vladimir Putin has praised soldiers who are “fighting heroically, courageously, bravely” to “defend the fatherland”, in a speech at a rally in Moscow to mark a year of war in Ukraine. Thousands gathered at Luzhniki stadium in Moscow to attend a concert marking the “Defenders of the Fatherland” Day. EU countries have failed to agree on a new set of sanctions against Russia meant to be in place for the one-year anniversary of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine on Friday, four diplomatic sources in Brussels have told Reuters. More talks among Brussels representatives of EU member countries were due on Thursday afternoon, said the sources."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/oct/30/belgium-energy-crisis-nuclear-reactors-shut-down-electricity","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-10-30T13:18:05Z","webTitle":"Belgium faces winter blackouts amid nuclear reactor shutdowns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/30/belgium-energy-crisis-nuclear-reactors-shut-down-electricity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/oct/30/belgium-energy-crisis-nuclear-reactors-shut-down-electricity","fields":{"headline":"Belgium faces winter blackouts amid nuclear reactor shutdowns","bodyText":"A forced shutdown of one nuclear reactor in the lead up to winter may be regarded as unfortunate. But the closure of six of the seven reactors responsible for supplying 40% of Belgium’s electricity is raising eyebrows, even in a country so prone to chaotic administration. An emergency “load shedding” plan has been updated, under which motorway lights will be switched off, industrial production suspended and rolling three-hour blackouts launched in homes nationwide should temperatures drop in the coming months and demand outstrip the now limited electricity supply. Residents have also been warned bills could increase, despite the suggestion that they might need to iron less and use just one pot to cook. The impending crisis stems from the discovery at the end of last month of “concrete degradation” at the Tihange nuclear power plant, west of Liege, forcing the closure of its three reactors. Unfortunately, three of the four reactors at Belgium’s second nuclear plant, in Doel, near Antwerp, are also out of action due to planned repairs. A gas-fired power plant belonging to the Bulgarian Energy Market group in Vilvoorde, north of Brussels, has been restarted to fill some of the supply gap. And the Belgian energy minister, Marie-Christine Marghem, told MPs the country was “covered” for December, but the situation remained fluid for January and February. But the fate of Belgians now seems to depend on the weather in a neighbouring country. A deal has been struck for France to provide electricity, but that might not be possible if it is hit by a cold snap. There are also technical obstacles emerging to plans to source power from Germany. Engie Electrabel, the company that runs the nuclear plants, has launched an advertising campaign to persuade industrial firms to reduce their electricity usage. Concerned residents have been told by the country’s energy supplier, Elia, there is a free app, the eliaforecast, to keep them abreast of the electricity situation and inform them whether there is a risk of a power shortage, disconnection or termination of supply. “The power indicator not only gives you the status of today, but also the prospects for the next six days,” Elia says. A spokesman for Elia said: “There’s a taskforce under the minister of energy. We are monitoring the situation week by week and we report to her. If we need additional measures it is her responsibility.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2020/jun/18/trump-john-bolton-book-china-super-duper-missile","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2020-06-18T13:59:23Z","webTitle":"The super-secret code name of Trump’s ‘super-duper missile’ is … Donald Trump | Richard Wolffe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/18/trump-john-bolton-book-china-super-duper-missile","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/18/trump-john-bolton-book-china-super-duper-missile","fields":{"headline":"The super-secret code name of Trump’s ‘super-duper missile’ is … Donald Trump","bodyText":"Last month, Donald Trump blabbed his mouth about a brand new, top-secret weapon in front of own gobsmacked military leaders. “I call it the super-duper missile,” he blurted, displaying all he’s learned in three and a half years as the commander-in-chief of the world’s greatest fighting force. “And I heard the other night, 17 times faster than what they have right now.” By the powers of deduction, we can now reveal the super-secret code name of this most awesome missile, capable of delivering the swiftest possible destructive power to the highest value targets. Its name is Donald Trump. For the last several years, the Trump administration has declared in no uncertain terms that China is its greatest enemy. Back when he was running for president, about a century ago, Trump said that China was “raping our country” with trade and currency policies that he called “the greatest theft in the history of the world”. Say what you like about his mastery of national security, but Trump is something of an expert in heists. At least when it comes to foundations and universities. This is not a new obsession. Consistency may be the hobgoblin of little minds, but it is the magic orb of little strongmen. “No surprise that China was caught cheating in the Olympics,” he tweeted eight years ago. “That’s the Chinese MO – Lie, Cheat &amp; Steal in all international dealings.” Seriously. Is there anything worse than lying and cheating in international dealings? And so our great populist president looked out for the little guy by launching a massive trade war with China to teach Beijing a thing or two about all that thieving and cheating. There were tariffs that cost American importers $48bn and about 300,000 jobs. There were farming subsidies that cost American taxpayers $28bn. But it was so worth it because Trump was standing tough and the Chinese would surely crumble. After all, according to Trump, the Chinese were paying the tariffs. Just like the Mexicans were paying for the border wall. Then came the pandemic, or the Chinese virus, as Trump preferred to call it. Maybe it came from a Chinese government lab, or maybe the Chinese had corrupted the World Health Organization. You may have gotten the unfortunate impression from all this that China was some kind of enemy for Trump. You may have noticed the Trump campaign gearing up for a titanic struggle to paint Joe Biden as being weak on China, probably because of some self-interested dealings with Beijing. Blame China seemed like the only strategy left for a campaign laid low by a catastrophically mismanaged pandemic and historic recession. One pro-Trump group even spent $10m on a TV ad last month called “Beijing Biden”. Then, just as it was all coming together so nicely, a super-duper missile dumped its payload faster than a president can run down the last 10ft of an astonishingly steep ramp. As recently as a year ago, our strongly anti-China president was – to use the diplomatic term of art – sucking up to Xi Jinping. “You’re the greatest Chinese leader in 300 years!” he told his great adversary in one of those epic face-offs about the trade war he had launched so strongly. A few minutes later, he upgraded Xi to “the greatest leader in Chinese history”. What on earth could possibly trigger this stealth attack by the Trumpahawk missile on something so precious and permanent as Trump’s loathing of Chinese power? You may be surprised to hear this. It could shake your beliefs to their core. But apparently “America first” takes second place to “Trump first”. “He stressed the importance of farmers, and increased Chinese purchases of soybeans and wheat in the electoral outcome,” wrote John Bolton, Trump’s former national security adviser, in the book the Trump administration is doing its best to publicize by trying to stop its publication. “I would print Trump’s exact words but the government’s prepublication review process has decided otherwise.” This conversation took place at the G20 summit in Japan, just one month before a certain fateful call to the Ukraine president asking for a similar deal to mess with this year’s election. A quid pro quo sounds a bit cheap for a deal that cost America at least $76bn. Seriously. Is there anything worse than lying and cheating in international dealings? In his flop sweat for a deal, the leader of the free world told his Chinese foe that it was fine and dandy to build concentration camps for Muslim Uighurs. It’s debatable whether that’s more or less shocking than his offer to Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, to drop legal proceedings for breaking the sanctions against Iran. Those are the sanctions that Trump has made even more severe than the “very severe” ones he was willing to help his Turkish friend dodge. Thanks to Bolton, we now know that Trump thought Finland was part of Russia and that invading Venezuela would be cool because it was really part of the United States. He also had no idea that Britain was a nuclear power, which is a truly special way to treat the special relationship. To be clear, John Bolton is no hero in this whistleblowing account entitled, with all due modesty, The Room Where It Happened. Bolton is merely the ferret-in-chief in this sack of fighting predators. He was Dick Cheney’s plant inside Colin Powell’s state department, manipulating the deep state apparatus for his own warmongering goals. Now he has turned his finely-tuned chest-stabbing skills into a best-selling book while somehow neglecting to dish to the Congress during this thing called impeachment. His lawyer said the House needed to sue to get him to testify, but his publishers just wrote him a $2m contract to get the same result. Stupid Democrats. They committed what Bolton calls “impeachment malpractice” by not offering him $3m to serve the nation. It’s a remarkable coincidence how many of Trump’s most senior aides have the lowest possible opinion about his patriotism, competence, and whether he is even compos mentis. At some point, you have to wonder if Trump isn’t, as some have retweeted, “arguably the greatest president in our history.” Maybe, just maybe, this super-duper missile will self-destruct in the next five months."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2018/nov/14/john-large-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-11-14T15:01:17Z","webTitle":"John Large obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/14/john-large-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/nov/14/john-large-obituary","fields":{"headline":"John Large obituary","bodyText":"John Large’s working life was split into two halves, the first spent designing civil and military nuclear reactors and the second trying to make sure the industry was kept safe from accidents, nuclear waste and security threats. In this later role as a consulting engineer John was a dangerous opponent for the secretive nuclear establishment because his inside knowledge gave him the ability to ask difficult questions and expose weaknesses. He was never afraid to speak truth to power, although it took courage to take on such a powerful industry. Despite his chosen role as an outsider, John’s abilities meant he had an astonishing list of clients ranging from the Russian Federation, the British government, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and Greenpeace International. He was invited by the IAEA to China, North Korea and Iran, and by others to the US and Japan, to give advice on their nuclear programmes and the risks they posed. John was still the leading independent analyst of safety and security in the nuclear industry at the time of his death, aged 75, from a heart attack. He was working on a report pressing for the permanent closure of Hunterston B nuclear plant in north Ayrshire, currently offline while cracks in the graphite bricks are investigated. While John often gave the impression that he had just stepped off the floor of an engineering works and was too busy to talk, he was in fact generous with his time and patient enough to explain a point of nuclear physics to an inquiring reporter. He insisted on accuracy. As a result journalists who were faced with a secretive industry frequently turned to him to see if a possible story was credible, and for background information. Once I asked him how he knew about a serious problem with refuelling Britain’s fleet of advanced gas-cooled reactors, including Hunterston B, and he replied it was because he had helped design them. He rarely talked about his achievements, but he was proud of his role in 2001 in overseeing nuclear safety for the successful raising of the Russian nuclear-powered K-141 submarine, the Kursk, which had sunk a year earlier with the loss of all 118 crew. He was the main nuclear adviser to the Dutch salvage company Mammoet-Smit and the Russian Federation, for which the Russians gave him a medal. But it was his detailed reports for governments, MPs and campaigning organisations that had the most influence. They were always written in the same easy to understand but precise style and detail. Though many of the reports made uncomfortable reading for governments and the industry, nobody ever suggested his facts or interpretation were wrong, even though they often tried to ignore them. Some of his latest reports on the danger of terrorism to nuclear installations in Britain and elsewhere have been kept secret to avoid revealing the industry’s weakest points. His immense knowledge stemmed from working in the 1960s and 70s as a senior research fellow with the UK Atomic Energy Authority while a member of the department of mechanical engineering at Brunel University in west London. At the time the UKAEA was responsible for Britain’s intertwined civil and military nuclear programmes and only employed the brightest and best brains. Much of his early work is still classified as secret. In the late 60s John worked for a time at Windscale (now Sellafield), where plutonium for Britain’s nuclear weapons programme was produced and then transferred to the US in the early 70s as part of the 1958 US/UK Nuclear Cooperation Agreement. A curious attempt by the US military to get him to serve in Vietnam led John to take a sudden fishing holiday in Canada before returning directly to the UK and resuming work at Brunel University and the UKAEA. John’s background as the son of a Fleet Street printer, Henry Large, and his wife, Rose (nee Hampshire), the landlady of the Neptune pub in Bermondsey, gave him a quick wit and ability to get to the point. His direct approach made a big impact in many court appearances as an expert witness, before committees of MPs, and in television studios. He was born in Woking, Surrey, but grew up in London, where he went to Wilson’s grammar school in Peckham, and spent a year at Camberwell School of Art, before studying engineering at Imperial College. He was appointed a research assistant at Brunel in 1968, promoted to lecturer in 1971, and remained on the staff there until 1986. He began the second phase of his career that year when he set up Large &amp; Associates, consultant engineers that at one time employed up to 40 people. It was when things went wrong at nuclear power plants that John found himself in greatest demand. His first technical assessment of the Fukushima accident in Japan in 2011 confirmed a triple reactor meltdown within two weeks, well before it was officially acknowledged. As well as his work, he applied his skills to restoring the 18th-century Robert Adam home he shared with his partner, Jenny Sherrell (known to everyone, including John, as AP, because she was from Alexandra Palace). This was in Ha-Ha Road overlooking the military barracks in Woolwich, an address that delighted him. There he kept bees and over 40 years took a leading role in the running of Oxleas Wood Apiary, located at Shooters Hill, a remnant of old London countryside. For many years he taught with great enthusiasm a 10-week summer course for aspiring beekeepers. He is survived by Jenny, his daughter, Joanna, from an earlier relationship, and his brother, Bob. • John Henry Large, consulting engineer, born 4 May 1943; died 3 November 2018"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/oct/02/hinkley-point-c-nuclear-mud-case-dropped-after-debate-secured","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-10-02T12:00:33Z","webTitle":"Welsh leaders urged to halt 'nuclear mud' dumping off Cardiff","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/oct/02/hinkley-point-c-nuclear-mud-case-dropped-after-debate-secured","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/oct/02/hinkley-point-c-nuclear-mud-case-dropped-after-debate-secured","fields":{"headline":"Welsh leaders urged to halt 'nuclear mud' dumping off Cardiff","bodyText":"Pressure is increasing on the Labour-led Welsh government to halt the dumping of “nuclear mud” in the sea close to Cardiff after a campaign by an eclectic group of scientists, surfers and a pop star. A motion calling on the government to suspend the licence allowing mud excavated from the construction site of the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station in Somerset to be disposed of just off the Welsh capital is to be debated next week in the national assembly for Wales. The development prompted Cian Ciarán, the keyboard player from Super Furry Animals, to discontinue an attempt on Tuesday to obtain a court injunction to stop the dumping. There is growing concern and anger that 300,000 tonnes of sediment from the Hinkley Point C site is being disposed of at the Cardiff Grounds sandbank. Campaigners claim the mud has not been tested properly and could contain particles that may pose a health risk. They have described the sediment as “nuclear mud” and nicknamed the sea off Cardiff “Geiger Bay”, a play on Tiger Bay, the old slang name for the city’s docklands. One of their main concerns is that the sediment could be washed ashore in a storm. Welcoming the assembly debate, Ciarán said: “This Labour government has taken the Welsh people for granted and has risked the health of the nation. For me the core message of the campaign remains unchanged: the absence of evidence is not the evidence of absence and therefore the precautionary principle should dictate a rethink. We will continue to seek the answers the Welsh public deserve.” He called for the Welsh government’s patrol vessel, FPV Rhodri Morgan, to monitor the dumping that is taking place. “It is a duty for every Welsh assembly member to do right by its people and hold to account the government that granted the licence,” he said. Neil McEvoy, an independent assembly member, has accused the Welsh government of being out of touch on the issue. If the dumping does not cease, he wants boat owners to form a “people’s flotilla” to take direct action and blockade Cardiff Grounds. He said taking on EDF Energy, which is building Hinkley Point C on the English side of the Bristol Channel, had been a huge risk. “This was always a David v Goliath case,” McEvoy said. “Cian took the brave decision to put his name to a legal challenge against a massive, billion-pound energy giant. He’s risked everything for the safety of Wales. Labour need to know that Wales is not a dumping ground for other people’s waste.” The campaigners claim no proper environmental impact assessment has been carried out. The motion for debate, put forward jointly by the Tories and Plaid Cymru, calls on the Welsh government to “publish more detailed evidence in response to concerns regarding risks to public health and the environment”, including allowing for further testing, and to “instruct Natural Resources Wales to suspend the marine licence that enables the disposal activity and undertake a wide-ranging programme of engagement and consultation with local communities and stakeholders across south Wales”. EDF said Ciarán’s decision to drop the legal action was “good news for a project that is vital for the UK’s energy future and provides work for 25 Welsh companies and 1,000 Welsh workers”. A spokesperson added: “EDF did everything that it was requested to do when it applied for a licence to dredge and deposit mud in the Severn estuary. The mud is no different to mud found anywhere else up and down the coast and it has been thoroughly tested by independent experts who confirmed it poses no threat to human health or the environment.” EDF says it is dredging mud and sediment from the seabed before the drilling of six vertical shafts for the cooling water system. It says Cardiff Grounds is the only suitable site large enough to handle the amount of the type of sediment it is dredging. The Welsh government has been asked to comment. It has previously insisted the mud is safe."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2021/sep/21/food-industry-uk-shortages-co2-crisis-gas-meat-poultry-stock-markets-factories-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2021-09-21T17:59:18Z","webTitle":"UK seeks to restart CO2 production; inflation expectations jump; Entain shares surge on takeover approach – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2021/sep/21/food-industry-uk-shortages-co2-crisis-gas-meat-poultry-stock-markets-factories-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2021/sep/21/food-industry-uk-shortages-co2-crisis-gas-meat-poultry-stock-markets-factories-business-live","fields":{"headline":"UK seeks to restart CO2 production; inflation expectations jump; Entain shares surge on takeover approach – as it happened","bodyText":"Time to wrap up: Ministers are very close to reaching a deal to restart carbon dioxide (CO2) production at factories on Teesside and in Cheshire, in an effort to ease fears of food shortages. The talks were held as food and drink bodies warned that UK consumers would see shortages in 10 days time, unless carbon dioxide supplies were restored. Poultry producers, pig farmers and fizzy drinks makers are all warning that supplies are short. The UK public’s inflation expectations have jumped this month, amid rising consumer prices and surging energy costs. Analysts have warned that millions of households could face a second record jump in energy bills next spring, on top of the £139 increase due next month, as the global gas crisis continues to drive market prices to new highs. The world’s energy watchdog has called on Russia to send more gas to Europe as the energy supply crunch bleeds across the continent, in a rare public rebuke of the Kremlin. UK factories have reported record orders, but a slowdown in output growth as the supply chain crisis leaves them struggling to meet demand. UK government borrowing increased by more than expected in August as rising inflation pushed up debt interest payments. The Office for National Statistics said the government’s budget deficit – the gap between spending and income – dropped to £20.5bn in August from about £26bn in the same month a year earlier as Britain’s economy recovers from lockdown. However, the latest snapshot showed that the gains from a rebound in tax receipts were offset by inflation driving up interest payments on the national debt by 84% compared with the same month a year ago. The OECD has raised its inflation forecasts sharply, and trimmed its growth forecasts - with the UK seen as the fastest growing G7 country in 2021 and 2022. It also warned governments and central banks against an over-hasty withdrawal of support for growth amid concerns that recovery from the pandemic-induced recession is incomplete. A report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies has shown Britain’s worst labour market shortages in decades are being driven by employers struggling to recruit low-paid workers, while vacancies in other areas are still significantly below pre-pandemic levels. Entain, the gambling company behind Ladbrokes and Coral, has received a $20bn takeover approach from DraftKings – the latest swoop by an American rival. Virgin Atlantic has reported a 600% surge in flight bookings to the US after the US said it would lift restrictions to allow fully vaccinated passengers from the UK and most European Union countries to travel to the country from early November. British Airways reported a jump in searches. National Express is in talks to buy Stagecoach in a deal that would combine the UK’s biggest coach and bus operators. Ethical kids clothing company Frugi has joined forces with new children’s clothing rental service thelittleloop, to let customers rent clothes rather than buy them. European stock markets have closed higher, recovering from a sharp drop on Monday. And Universal Music Group’s shares surged by more than a third in its stock market debut on Tuesday, putting its chairman and chief executive, Sir Lucian Grainge, in line for a potential bonus of almost $150m (£110m). Goodnight. GW The world’s energy watchdog has called on Russia to send more gas to Europe as the energy supply crunch bleeds across the continent, in a rare public rebuke of the Kremlin. The International Energy Agency (IEA), which advises global governments on energy policy, called out the gas-rich country for refusing to increase exports even as fierce demand has driven market prices to successive record highs, appearing to support claims that Russia is withholding supplies. “The IEA believes that Russia could do more to increase gas availability to Europe and ensure storage is filled to adequate levels in preparation for the coming winter heating season,” the Paris-based agency said, adding: “This is also an opportunity for Russia to underscore its credentials as a reliable supplier to the European market,” The IEA’s intervention has come amid growing unease in Europe over Russia’s decision not to increase gas exports to Europe next month, despite record gas market prices across the continent. It said Russia had been “fulfilling its long-term contracts with European counterparts – but its exports to Europe are down from their 2019 level” The British public’s expectations for inflation over the next year and over the longer-term have jumped this month -- as prices rise in the shops, and energy costs surge. It raises the risk that the Bank of England will tighten policy to stop them becoming unmoored, Citi said on Tuesday. Reuters has the details: The British public’s expectations for inflation over the next 12 months surged by a full percentage point in September to 4.1% and expectations for five to 10 years’ time rose to 3.8%, Citi said, based on its monthly survey with pollsters YouGov. “Today’s data, especially the movement in long-term expectations, suggest that growing risks inflation expectations could become de-anchored to the upside. The sharp increase risks a hawkish response from the MPC this week,” Citi said. UK consumer price inflation jumped to 3.2% per year in August, from 2% - the biggest jump on record, to the highest rate since March 2012. The Bank of England (which meets this week) has forecast inflation will hit 4% by the end of this year. But it also argues that these inflationary pressures will be temporary, due to supply chain problems following the pandemic, and a burst of demand, pushing up prices. Ministers are very close to reaching a deal to restart carbon dioxide (CO2) production at factories on Teesside and in Cheshire, in an effort to ease fears of food shortages, my colleagues Rowena Mason and Aubrey Allegretti write tonight. The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, has been locked in talks with the US firm CF Industries after it stopped work at its fertiliser plants because of the surge in gas prices. Earlier he suggested the government could be willing to provide the industry with support to restart after warnings that a shortage of the gas could cause food supply problems. He told the BBC: “Time is of the essence, and that’s why I spoke to the chief executive, speaking to him twice in the last two days, and we’re hopeful that we can get something sorted today and get the production up and running in the next few days.” In a sign that taxpayers’ money could be used, Kwarteng said: “It may come at some cost, we’re still hammering out details, we’re still looking at a plan.” More details of the agreement to restart production are expected later on Tuesday or on Wednesday morning. The closure of the fertiliser factories has led to a food production crisis, as CO2 is a byproduct of production and is used to stun animals for slaughter, as well as in baking and vacuum packing. Boris Johnson acknowledged the government was taking “direct steps” to safeguard CO2 supplies, although the government has not formally confirmed a deal. Here’s their full story: Energy analyst John Kemp has shown how poorer households will be hit hardest by the price surge, as energy bills are a greater share of their income than for wealthier households: Entain’s surging share price has helped the London stock market more than recover Monday’s losses. The blue-chip FTSE 100 index has closed 77 points higher at 6980, up 1.1%, after falling to a two-month low yesterday. Entain (+18%) was the top riser, followed by hedge fund management company Pershing Square (+5%) and oil giant Royal Dutch Shell (after it agreed to sell its Permian Basin assets for $9.5bn, with $7bn being returned to shareholders). Travel stocks also added to yesterday’s gains, on relief that double-vaccinated foreign travellers will be allowed into the US from November. IAG (British Airways parent) gained 3%, while Rolls-Royce (whose jet servicing business could be busier) rose 3.5%. Bu mining companies and banks lost ground, amid anxiety over China’s indebted property group Evergrande (which faces a debt repayment this week). DIY chain Kingfisher fell almost 5%, despite lifting its interim dividend by almost 40 per cent and announcing a £300m share buyback -- with analysts wondering how long the pandemic sales boom would last. European markets recovered from their worst day in two months, with the Stoxx 600 index gaining 1%. Danni Hewson, AJ Bell financial analyst, says DraftKing’s ‘stonking offer’ for Entain lifted the gambling sector (Flutter gained 3.5%): Whilst investors are still clearly nervous about the countdown to a potential Evergrande default they’ve been happy to jump on some rebound action today or embrace potential new seams of opportunity. Sports betting group Entain has topped the FTSE 100 risers after it confirmed a takeover approach from US operator DraftKings and there’s been enough of a glow generated that other UK betting companies have been able to bask a little too. It’s a stonking offer when you compare it to that from MGM earlier in the year and there’s little wonder that shares have shot to an all-time high, though investors in the US company seem a little less enamoured with the prospect. M&amp;A action is also front and centre for the FTSE 250 with National Express’ plans to snap up rival Stagecoach have been met with a warm welcome all round; there’s just the little issue of the competition watchdog to deal with before any ink can meet paper. “Though London’s blue-chip index has still failed to claw its way back above that all important 7,000 mark today has delivered some confidence boosters including news that the government has struck a deal to get production back underway at two fertiliser plants. While many headlines will focus on the meat that goes along with our two veg the government has been keen to point out that this deal is a one-off and is primarily concerned with keeping NHS operations on track and cooling vaccines. Good intentions pave the way to some pretty tricky places and there will be some concerned about the precedent set by the move and there will certainly be questions about contingency plans going forward. Here’s Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, on DraftKing’s takeover approach to gambling firm Entain, the owner of Ladbrokes and Coral: At first glance, staid UK high street bookmakers are not an obvious fit for a US fantasy sports giant, but it’s Entain’s US sports betting venture with MGM that’s drawn DraftKings eye. Rapid growth in a market share in a market which is itself exploding makes Entain hot stuff, and a bid from MGM back in January is proof that rivals are prepared to put their hands in their pockets to secure a slice of the action. A subsequent spin off/sale of more mature assets, as we saw with William Hill, would probably follow. However, the fact there are so few details available, not even an offer price, means talks are at an early stage and there can be no certainty whatsoever that a firm offer will eventually be forthcoming, let alone that a deal will complete. There’s potential for some added complexity in the deal, since it’s not clear how MGM would react to a rival seizing a good chunk of its growing joint venture and the Entain board have rebuffed offers in the past. Chickens and eggs spring to mind.” Downing Street would not confirm any details of a deal with CF Industries over the CO2 shortage, PA Media reports. A No 10 spokesman said: “The Business Secretary has been in discussions with CF Industries since the weekend on how we get their plants up and running as soon as possible to secure a continued supply of CO2 to UK businesses.” There’s no official confirmation yet that the government has struck a deal with CF Industries to restart production at its fertiliser plans, and boost CO2 supplies. As reported earlier, Sky News have said an agreement has been reached. Here’s Bloomberg take: The U.K. government reached a deal to restart fertilizer production hit by a gas crunch, in a bid to ease a shortage of carbon dioxide that’s crucial for the food industry. The deal is with CF Industries Holdings Inc., a person familiar with the matter said. High gas prices forced the fertilizer maker to last week close U.K. plants that make carbon dioxide as a byproduct, threatening to disrupt the country’s food supplies almost immediately. More here: U.K. in Deal to Restart Fertilizer Output, Easing CO2 Crunch Entain’s shares have soared to a fresh record high in London, currently up over 18% at £22.67. That values the firm at around $18bn, or £13.3bn, I think, up from $15.4bn (£11.2bn) last night. The Financial Times says: The bid was submitted in recent days and valued Entain at more than £25 a share, according to a person with knowledge of the approach. The exact terms of the offer could not be learned but CNBC, which first reported the approach, said it was comprised of mostly shares. At £25 a share, the bid would value Entain shares at roughly £14.6bn before the inclusion of £2bn in net debt. The UK-listed company’s shares were valued at around £18 before news of the deal was first reported on Tuesday. They have since jumped 20 per cent to £22.83. DraftKings have slid by almost 8%, though, as Wall Street investors digest the prospect of potentially paying $20bn (£16.6bn) for the Ladbrokes owner. Entain has confirmed that it has received a takeover proposal from DraftKings, following CNBC’s report. In a statement to the City, it says: The Board of Entain confirms that it has received a proposal from DraftKings to acquire Entain, the consideration for which would include a combination of DraftKings stock and cash. There can be no certainty that any offer will be made for the Company, nor as to the terms on which any such offer may be made. A further announcement will be made as and when appropriate. Shareholders are urged to take no action at this time. The BBC’s Simon Jack has more details of the deal to restart CO2 production at two UK fertiliser factories:... Lord Adebowale, chair of the NHS Confederation, has warned that operations at NHS hospitals are at risk of being cancelled due to carbon dioxide shortages. We wrote on Sunday: “What I am concerned about, and I think Kwasi Kwarteng and others will be focused on, is making sure there’s enough CO2 for the NHS,” Adebowale told Times Radio. “Because CO2 is used in a number of interventions in the NHS – invasive surgery, endoscopy, for instance, stabilising body cavities so that surgeons can see what’s going on inside.” One senior health service source said the NHS had this weekend received assurances from the government that its access to the UK’s supply of CO2 would not be affected. Back in the City, shares in UK betting group Entain have surged 16% after CNBC reported that DraftKings, the US fantasy sports and sports betting operator, is making a $20bn offer (£14.6bn). Entain owns Ladbrokes, Coral, bwin, PartyPoker, and Sportingbet - and this offer is sharply higher than an $11bn (£8bn) offer from Las Vegas casino operator MGM it turned down early this year. CNBC’s David Faber says the offer is largely in DraftKings stock, along with cash, according to sources. Back in January, Entain rejected an £8bn offer from US-based casino giant MGM Resorts International, saying it significantly undervalued” the business. Analysts and investors have been speculating that the U.S. casino operator could return with a new bid. MGM and Entain have an online sports betting partnership in the U.S. called BetMGM. UK gambling companies have been in demand since the US supreme court struck down a federal law that bars gambling on football, basketball, baseball and other sports in most states in 2018. That has sent US casino companies scrambling for the online betting expertise build up by UK-listed companies over the years. My colleague Rob Davies explained last month: Since the supreme court overturned a ban on sports betting, the market has been opening up state by state. Tens of billions are being spent as firms jockey for a leading position in a market that looks like it could be even more lucrative than anyone thought. The market research firm Ibis World thinks US sports betting could be worth $55bn (£40bn) a year, about 17 times the size of the UK market. How Entain and Flutter are faring in that race will be interesting. Both have launched major tie-ups with US partners but it’s the nature of the relationship between Entain and its American buddies MGM Resorts that will garner most attention. In January, Entain knocked back an £8bn takeover bid from MGM, which decided it would rather own the spoils from their joint venture, BetMGM, than share them. Faced with short shrift from the Entain board and investors, MGM walked away, starting the clock on a six-month period during which takeover rules prevented it from having another tilt. The moratorium expired in mid-July and Entain’s share price since then suggests the board was right to send the American suitor back across the Atlantic with a flea in its ear. Entain’s stock market value has soared to more than £11bn, meaning MGM will have to dig deep if it means business. Shareholders, who have already seen the value of their investments rise thanks to the accelerated movement online during the pandemic, will be licking their lips. Here’s a clip of Sky’s News’s Paul Kelso explaining that the UK government has reached agreement with CF Industries to restart carbon dioxide production at its UK sites. As he points out, we don’t yet know exactly when CO2 production will restart, easing pressures on the UK food supply chain. It’s also unclear what the deal will cost, to encourage CF Industries to resume operations at Ince, Cheshire and Billingham, Teeside. Production at both plants halted last week after the gas price surge made fertiliser production uneconomic (CO2 is a byproduct of the fertiliser-making process). The deal comes just hours after the Food and Drink Federation warned that the UK had just 10 days before consumers saw food shortages. Pork and poultry producers are already struggling, and fizzy drinks makers have warned that some soft drinks manufacturers have only a few days of CO2 supply left in reserve. Boris Johnson has said the Government was taking “direct steps” to make sure carbon dioxide would be available for industries such as the food sector, PA Media report. Speaking to the BBC during his trip to the United States, he said the spikes in gas prices which have led to the disruption of CO2 production “are being caused by the world economy waking up after quite a long period of cryogenic paralysis - it’s unfreezing everywhere and that is causing supply chain problems”. “Obviously, we’re working with the companies to make sure that we can keep the supplies going. “On the carbon dioxide issue that’s particularly important for some industries, we’re taking direct steps to make sure that that continues to be available.” Asked whether that meant subsidies, he said: “We’ll do what’s necessary and you’ll be hearing a bit more about that later on in the day.” The government has reached agreement with CF Industries to restart carbon dioxide production at its UK sites following talks between the company and Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng, Sky News reports. They say: The US firm said last week that it had stopped work at its fertiliser plants at Billingham on Teesside and Ince in Cheshire because of a surge in gas prices. That prompted a crisis in the food industry because the CO2 which is a by-product of the fertiliser manufacturing process is used to stun farm animals before slaughter as well as in the vacuum packing process. It prompted warnings that shoppers could start noticing shortages in poultry, pork and bakery products within days. Kate Ferguson, deputy political editor at The Sun, has more details: Over in the US, the housing market has rebounded. The number of new housing starts jumped 3.9% in August, the US Commerce Department reports, beating forecasts. The number of building permits (approval to start a new house) handed out also jumped, rising 6% month-on-month in August. Housing demand had been hit by the jump in material prices earlier this year; the fall in timber prices may have encouraged activity again. Sky News’s Ed Conway has written a handy thread on the energy crisis, explaining why the UK may face “a very nervy winter”, for several reasons.... The former Conservative leader William Hague has now weighed in on the energy crisis, warning it could be a “more than tricky” winter for many British families. Hague said the government needed an elite group of ministers chairing meetings each day on how to tackle the crisis – akin to the Covid Operations committee during the height of the pandemic. He told Times Radio. “If I was in government, I would be saying: ‘Get an elite group of ministers together in this reshuffled cabinet who are going to meet every day’ to be on top of all of these issues,” “And to do anything that the government needs to do, but they won’t be able to do everything. There just will be shortages of something.” Here’s the full story: Our energy correspondent Jillian Ambrose has explained the many causes of the crisis here; here’s a flavour: The UK also relies heavily on gas for home heating and cooking. Yet despite the obvious reliance on fossil fuels for electricity, homes and in heavy industry, the UK has some of the lowest amounts of gas storage capabilities in Europe, leaving the market uniquely exposed to the supply crunch. Less than 1% of Europe’s stored gas is held by the UK. Britain has been forced to temporarily fire up coal power stations, paying millions of pounds to the likes of Drax in North Yorkshire, to plug some of this power shortfall. That fragile system faces further challenges in the years ahead, with most of the UK’s nuclear power plants, which supply up to 20% of electricity, to close by the end of the decade. Just one new nuclear power station, Hinkley Point C in Somerset, is being built to replace them. Universal Music Group’s shares surged by more than a third in its stock market debut on Tuesday, putting its chairman and chief executive, Sir Lucian Grainge, in line for a potential bonus of almost $150m (£110m). Shares in the world’s largest music company, the label behind artists including Taylor Swift and Bob Dylan, rose more than 35% to €25 a share in early trading giving the business a market value of more than €45bn. Universal’s parent company, Vivendi, had set a reference price of €18.5 a share, a market capitalisation of €33.5bn, ahead of the spin-off of its crown jewel asset on the Euronext stock exchange in Amsterdam. However, investors eager to cash in on the streaming boom – analysts at JP Morgan Cazenove have described Universal Music as an “extraordinary, must-own asset” – have made it the biggest European listing of the year. British-born Grainge is now in line for one of the largest corporate payouts in history. Under the terms of the flotation Grainge will receive a “transaction bonus” of a share of $150m and 1% of Universal Music’s equity value above $30bn, relating to the 60% of the music company that Vivendi is releasing in the flotation. This means that the 61-year-old is in line for a bonus of potentially more than $140m, according to Vivendi’s prospectus on the flotation published last week. More here: A top U.S. investment bank cut China’s economic growth forecast on Tuesday for the next three years thanks to the combination of the Delta variant outbreak and tightening controls on the property and the infrastructure sector, Reuters reports. BoFA Securities said its new real gross domestic product growth forecast for China for this year was trimmed to 8.0% from 8.3%, 5.3% from 6.2% in 2022 and 5.8% from 6.0% for 2023. The bank also said its base-case scenario of the ongoing problems at Chinese property giant Evergrande is “there would be little spillover” effect on the property sector as a whole and financial markets if the government comes to the rescue by facilitating an orderly debt restructuring. Analysts at the investment bank said in a note: “Any further delay in policy response from the fourth quarter of 2021 to the first quarter of 2022 or mishandling of a major debtor default would potentially raise the risk of growth dislocation.” The west’s leading economic thinktank has warned governments and central banks against an over-hasty withdrawal of support for growth amid concerns that recovery from the pandemic-induced recession is incomplete, my colleague Larry Elliott reports. The Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said a continuation of the stimulus policies of the past 18 months was justified because the recent pickup in inflation was likely to prove temporary. Central banks – including the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England – have started to voice concerns about rising cost of living pressures but the OECD said policy support was still needed as long as the outlook was uncertain and employment had not yet recovered fully to its pre-crisis levels. The thinktank said central banks should combine loose monetary policy – keeping interest lows and continuing with asset purchase programmes – with clear guidance about how high they would be prepared to see inflation go before taking action. The OECD secretary-general, Mathias Cormann, said: “The world is experiencing a strong recovery thanks to decisive action taken by governments at the height of the crisis. But as we have seen with vaccine distribution, progress is uneven. Ensuring the recovery is sustained and widespread requires action on a number of fronts – from effective vaccination programmes across all countries to concerted public investment strategies to build for the future.” Here’s the full story: Another very eye-catching chart from the OECD: Despite rising inflation pressures, the UK is expected to be the fastest-growing G7 economy in 2021 and 2022, according to the OECD’s forecasts today. But that follows a very sharp downturn in 2020, which leaves the UK with a lot of ground to make up on growth and employment: Virgin Atlantic has reported that bookings to the US increased overnight by over 600%, compared to last week, after the White House announced it will relax its ban on overseas visitors. Bookings surged after the Biden administration said that passengers who are fully vaccinated against Covid-19 will be able to fly to the US from November, ending a long ban on arrivals from the UK and EU countries. New York had the most bookings of any US city overnight. Leisure travel destinations also saw a jump from people booking holidays -- flights to Orlando are up 11 fold, Miami 9 fold and Las Vegas 8 fold. Last week, UK ministers unveiled simpler Covid foreign travel rules for England, replacing the traffic-light system with a single red list and bringing in a laxer regime for tests. Juha Jarvinen, chief commercial officer at Virgin Atlantic, says it was a busy weekend in flight bookings for the airline, after this relaxation of Government restrictions: Flights to the airline’s sunny destinations in the Caribbean have risen 50% week on week, with its newest route to St Vincent and The Grenadines, set to launch on 13th October, becoming the most booked Caribbean flight. Barbados follows closely behind, with bookings for both October half term and the Christmas break proving the most popular time to visit. Bookings to both Jamaica and St Lucia have also doubled. Interest in routes popular amongst those visiting friends and relatives also remain strong. Following its removal from the Red List, bookings to Pakistan increased by nearly 300%, with flights from London to India up by nearly 100%, highlighting the long-awaited desire to reconnect with loved ones. The National Farmers Union is holding an emergency summit to discuss the string of problems facing farmers and food producers currently - ranging from lack of staff and supply chain disruption, to the ongoing CO2 shortage. At the hastily-convened summit, which was only arranged on Monday according to NFU President Minette Batters, the union is currently discussing labour shortages in the sector, along with representatives from the logistics sector, supply chain organisation and food producers. This afternoon, the NFU will be discussing what to do about the CO2 shortage impacting farmers. The gas is widely used in the slaughter of animals including pigs and chickens. The NFU has invited retailers, food service chain organisations and other associations to take part. UK factories are struggling to keep pace with a record surge in orders, as the jump in energy prices drives up their costs and threatens to disrupt their work. Manufacturing order books have hit their highest level on record this month (doing back to 1977), according to the latest healthcheck from the CBI. Export books also strengthened to the best reading since March 2019, as demand for British-made goods picks up. But, output growth in the three months for September slowed for the second month in a row (although still firm by historical standards), while stocks of finished goods levels improved slightly from record lows in the last three months. Tom Crotty, group director at chemicals group INEOS, says supply chain problems are hitting growth. “It is reassuring to see order books reaching new highs, but global supply chain issues and cost pressures are continuing to hold back the sector. It is important that these issues are addressed as a priority. Many firms also expect to hike their prices over the next quarter, as they pass on price pressures due to global supply chain disruption onto their customers. Anna Leach, CBI deputy chief economist, said UK firms are finding it harder to meet high demand, with the surge in energy prices adding to their headaches. “Today’s survey highlights how amidst a variety of supply challenges, companies are beginning to struggle to meet high demand. Despite close to half of manufacturers surveyed reporting order books above normal, output growth has slowed sharply, albeit remaining relatively robust. As well as skill and labour shortages, sharply increasing material costs and shortages of key components, producers now face rocketing energy prices. “Current issues reinforce the need for Government to take a more active approach to gripping the economic recovery. That will mean working together with business to ease these critical supply challenges that are affecting manufacturing production across the UK and risk putting the brakes on the recovery. With pressure on energy supply set to increase in the colder months ahead, energy security is vital for ensuring that crucial parts of the supply chain are able to continue operating.” Here are the details (the percentages show the balance between firms who agreed and disagreed). Output Output growth slowed (+16% from +22% in August) for the second consecutive month in the three months to September. However, growth remains firm by historical standards (long-run average +3%). Output increased in 11 of 17 subsectors, with growth mostly driven by the food, drink &amp; tobacco subsector. Manufacturers expect output growth to accelerate in the next three months (+25%). Orders Total order books improved (+22% from +18% in August) to their strongest on record (since April 1977). Export order books improved to their highest balance since March 2019 (-2% from -16% in August, and long-run average -18%). Prices Manufacturers’ expectations for output price growth in the next three months remained strong (+41% from +43% in August, long-run average of +3%). Stocks Stock adequacy picked up slightly from its record low in August (-11% from -14%) but remains weak overall (long-run average of +12%). The OECD also warns that there are signs that the global recovery is losing momentum, as supply problems hit growth. In its interim economic outlook, it says: Retail sales spending weakened slightly in July, and global car sales have fallen sharply. Industrial production and global merchandise trade growth have also moderated, with supply shortages in key sectors, such as semi-conductors and shipping, and rising supplier delivery times holding back output in some industries, particularly car production. A widening discrepancy between new order levels and inventory holdings suggests that inventory rebuilding will be an important additional source of demand over time, but it also means that there is reduced capacity to meet new orders immediately, likely pushing up prices. The OECD has warned that the global recovery from the pandemic remains uneven, as it lifts its inflation forecasts following the surge in commodity prices. In its latest economic outlook, the Paris-based group warned that a rapid increase in demand as economies reopen has pushed up the cost of key commodities such as oil and metals. Food prices are also rising, boosting prices especially in emerging markets, with supply chain tensions pushing up cost pressures and shipping costs rising sharply, it says. So, the OECD has lifted its forecast for inflation across the G20 group of nations this year to 3.7%, from 3.5%, and for 2022 to 3.9% from 3.4%. The UK’s inflation rate is now seen at 2.3% this year (up from 1.3% back in May), and at 3.1% in 2022 -- over the Bank of England’s 2% target. The OECD says the outlook for inflation “varies markedly”, having risen sharply in the US and some emerging market economies but remains relatively low in many other advanced economies, particularly in Europe. Headline consumer price inflation has also picked up around the world in recent months, pushed up by higher commodity prices, supply-side constraints, stronger consumer demand as economies reopen, and the reversal of some sectoral price declines in the early months of the pandemic. Annual inflation has risen to over 5% in the United States but remains at relatively low rates in many other advanced economies, particularly in Europe and Asia. Part of the current rise in inflation reflects base effects, following price declines in the early phase of the pandemic. In many emerging-market economies, high energy and food prices have pushed up inflation, reflecting both strong price increases and the relatively high share of commodities in consumers’ expenditure. These inflationary pressures should eventually fade, it adds: Once bottlenecks are resolved, price increases in durable goods, such as cars, are likely to ease quickly as supply from the manufacturing sector rapidly picks up. Consumer price inflation in G20 countries is projected to peak towards the end of 2021 and slow throughout 2022. Although sizeable pay increases are happening in some sectors that are reopening such as transportation, leisure and hospitality, overall wage pressure remains moderate. The OECD says the global economic recovery remains strong, helped by government and central bank support and vaccination programmes. But while global GDP has now risen above its pre-pandemic level, the recovery remains uneven with countries emerging from the crisis facing different challenges, it warns. It now forecasts world GDP would rise 5.7% this year, down from 5.8% forecast back in May, after shrinking 3.4% last year. Growth in 2022 has been nudged up to 4.5% from 4.4%. It cut its forecast for UK growth this year to 6.7%, from 7.2%, and for 2022 from 5.5% to 5.2%. The US growth forecast this year was cut from 6.9% to 6%, but lifted from 3.6% to 3.9% next year. The forecast for eurozone growth this year has been lifted by a full percentage point to 5.3%, followed by 4.6% next year (up from 4.4%). Kwasi Kwarteng says he is ‘locked in discussions’ with colleagues across Government to find ways to secure CO2 supplies (to get those fertiliser plants running again). DIY chain Kingfisher has reported that its stock levels of wood, cement and some products that contain semiconductor chips are below target levels -- a sign that global supply chain problems continue. Reuters has the details: “Everybody in the world is looking for timber ... we are looking for cement and there is a shortage of chips for computers and it impacts some of our product,” chief executive Thierry Garnier told reporters after the firm published first half results. However, he said that generally he was “pretty happy” with overall product availability as the group had placed orders significantly ahead of peak trading periods. “Today we are in a good place,” he said. Kingfisher, which owns B&amp;Q and Screwfix, also launched a £300m share buyback after the pandemic DIY boom boosted sales, with profits up over 61% in the first half of the year. In Europe’s financial markets, shares have bounced back from their worst day in two months. The Europe-wide Stoxx 600 index has gained 0.9%, while the UK’s FTSE 100 of blue-chip shares is up 60 points (0.9%) at 6,963 points. Airlines are among the risers, after the US lifted its ban on arrivals from the UK and EU, with British Airways parent IAG up 3.5%. Miners are also rising after a slump on Monday, as worries about the global economy appear to recede. Oil company Royal Dutch Shell has jumped 3.7% after agreeing to sell its business in the Permian Basin, the biggest oilfield in the US, to rival ConocoPhillips for $9.5bn in cash, with $7bn being returned to shareholders. Investors are waiting to see if embattled Chinese property developer Evergrande is able to pay out its interest due on a bond this week, or default on it. AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould explains: “The miners, scarred by heavy selling on Monday, eked out a recovery while British Airways owner International Consolidated Airlines continued the ascent which begin yesterday afternoon when the US lifted travel restrictions on fully vaccinated UK and EU visitors. “The major catalyst for market volatility of late, fears about the fall-out from a potential collapse of Chinese property developer Evergrande, haven’t disappeared though. “Evergrande is due to make a debt repayment on Thursday and this event could be the next major test of investors’ resolve. “The challenge for the markets is trying to guess how Beijing might react, particularly after its notably strident approach in recent months when it comes to the technology industry. Will it be similarly strict with the property sector? “Before Thursday there is also the small matter of the latest US Federal Reserve meeting and the question of whether recent events will lead chair Jay Powell and his colleagues to rethink their plans for tapering financial stimulus.” Here’s a clip of Kwasi Kwarteng explaining his hopes for a deal to restart the UK’s carbon dioxide production: National Express is in talks to buy Stagecoach, the UK’s largest bus operator, in an all-share deal Both companies suffered from the slump in passenger numbers in the pandemic, and a merger would create a business with a fleet of 36,000 buses and coaches, bringing two of the UK’s larger transport groups together. My colleague Julia Kollewe explains: Stagecoach shareholders would receive 0.36 new National Express shares for each Stagecoach share they own, handing them 25% of the combined group. That would value Stagecoach at about £445m, representing an 18% premium on the closing price of the Perth-based company’s shares on Monday. Stagecoach has a fleet of 8,400 buses and coaches serving 1 billion passengers a year. It is UK-focused and operates mainly in Scotland, Greater Manchester, Sheffield and Greater London. National Express has a bigger coach operation than Stagecoach and has an overall fleet of 28,000 vehicles, operating across the UK and in Spain, and runs school buses in the US. Stagecoach sold its North American division for £214m in 2018 to focus more on the UK. More here: Shares in Stagecoach have surged 21%, with National Express up almost 8%. National Express says it expects to find annual savings of at least £35m -- including from ‘rationalising’ duplicate back office and IT costs, selling some non-depot property and offices, and from network efficiencies, shared technologies and ‘best practices’. The UK government borrowed more than expected to balance the books in August, as rising inflation pushed up its debt servicing costs. The Office for National Statistics reports that public sector net borrowing (excluding public sector banks) came in at £20.5bn in August 2021, with Covid-19 costs also still high. That’s the second-highest August borrowing since monthly records began in 1993, but £5.5bn less than in August 2020. It’s also higher than the City expected -- economists had expected borrowing to drop to around £15.5bn for August. Gains from a rebound in tax receipts and lower government spending were offset by inflation driving up interest payments on the national debt by 84% compared with the same month a year ago. My colleague Richard Partington has more details: The ONS also revised upwards its estimate for borrowing in the financial year to the end of March 2021 by £27.1bn, taking the deficit to £325.1bn for the year when Covid-19 triggered the worst fallout for the public finances since the second world war. It said this was driven mainly by the inclusion of expected losses on government-backed emergency Covid loans to businesses worth £20.9bn, which it had included in the estimates for the public finances for the first time. Although representing about a quarter of the total £80bn emergency lending to businesses, the estimated losses are lower than the previous £27bn forecast made by the Office for Budget Responsibility. The figures come as Rishi Sunak prepares to scale back emergency Covid support schemes and set out the government’s post-pandemic tax and spending plans at next month’s autumn budget and three-year spending review. Responding to the latest figures, the chancellor said the government would continue to support businesses and workers in the rebuilding job from the pandemic. “At the same time, we are determined to get our public finances back on track – that’s why we have set out the focused and responsible steps we are taking to keep debt under control,” he said. So far this year, public borrowing has reached £93.8bn -- the second highest financial year-to-August borrowing since monthly records began in 1993. That’s almost £89bn less than in the same period last year, when the cost of Covid-19 was at its height. It’s also more than £30bn less than the Office for Budget Responsibility, the UK’s fiscal watchdog, had forecast -- which may give the chancellor some flexibility ahead of next month’s budget. Overall, the UK national debt was £2,202.9bn at the end of August 2021 or around 97.6% of GDP, the highest ratio since the 98.3% recorded in March 1963. A large chunk of that debt is currently held by the Bank of England, bought through its quantitate easing stimulus programme. Kwasi Kwarteng has also admitted that hard-pressed families will face a “difficult winter” with rising energy bills and cuts to benefits. The Business Secretary told BBC Breakfast that the UK faces a global energy price spike: “But I’ve said that there are mechanisms in place now to protect consumers. I’ve been very clear that the energy price cap is staying, even though some energy companies I read today are asking for it to be removed. I’ve been very clear that that’s staying, so we’re protecting customers there. We’ve got the warm home discount, we’ve got winter fuel payments, which are again focused on the most vulnerable customers. So, we’re completely focused on helping vulnerable customers through this winter – particularly with regard to energy prices.” Pushed on the issue of universal credit, he said “It’s a difficult situation, it could be a very difficult winter. That’s why, as energy minister, I’m very focused on helping people that are fuel poor. Universal credit, you will know, is an issue for the chancellor and the work and pensions secretary. I’m speaking to them a great deal about it.” Here’s the full story:: The £20 uplift to Universal Credit ends next week, meaning a £1,000 per year cut for some households. That blow will land as energy bills rise by 12%, or £139 per year, for a typical gas and electricity customer as the price cap is lifted. The Resolution Foundation warned yesterday that the UK faces a ‘cost of living crunch’ on several fronts, in which low-income families will be worse hit. Kwasi Kwarteng has also told Sky News he was “confident” of a resolution to to get production at CF’s fertiliser plants up and running again, saying “it’s pretty imminent”. He added the CO2 situation was “critical” (as the food industry have warned). Update: Kwarteng said: “We’re definitely looking at trying to secure carbon dioxide supply. I’ve spoken to the CEO of the business, Tony Will. He flew over on Sunday. We spoke very candidly about the situation. “He said the problem he had was that the natural gas price is much higher than the ammonia which he sells. So essentially what happened last week was that the plant downed tools. And I said of course we’ve got to manufacture this CO2. And that’s what we’re talking about this week. It’s pretty imminent. “I hope we have a very clear plan to get CO2 production going again. I’m very confident and hopeful that we can sort it out by the end of the week.” Business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng says he’s hopeful of reaching an agreement with US fertiliser maker CF Industries today to resume production of the CO2 desperately needed by the UK food and drink industry. Kwarteng says he spoke to the company’s CEO on Sunday and Monday, and has also spoken to chancellor Rishi Sunak about the issue. “We are looking at ways very soon” to make sure that the production of CO2 is resumed quickly, Kwarteng tells Radio 4’s Today Programme. But that could come at a cost - if the government provides financial support to persuade CF to resume operations at its factories in Ince, Cheshire and Billingham, Cleveland,Teesside. Kwarteng explains that CF halted production of ammonia and CO2 (a byproduct of the fertiliser process) last week because the jump in natural gas prices made it uneconomic. Asked if he’s prepared to subsidise CF, Kwarteng says the government is “looking at different ways in which we can provide support”, and prepared to look at every solution to get production up and running. If support is provided, it will be on a temporary basis - it’s not something the government wants to do indefinitely. Kwarteng explains: Time is of the essence, that’s why I’ve spoken to the CEO twice in the last two days. We are hopeful that we can get something sorted today - and get the production up and running in the next few days. Kwarteng adds that this ‘may come’ at some cost -- the government is still hammering out the details. Nationalising the company isn’t the answer, Kwarteng said -- it would take too long to fix the CO2 shortages. But between nationalisation and simply doing nothing there are many options to address the problem, says Kwarteng, adding that he’s “very hopeful” of progress today. Fizzy drinks suppliers have warned that production could soon be hit by the UK’s CO2 shortages -- and that Brexit means importing supplies isn’t feasible. The British Soft Drinks Association revealed last night that manufacturers have “only a few days” of carbon dioxide left in reserve to produce beverages. In a sign that the CO2 crisis is causing wide shockwaves in Britain’s food and drink sector, most carbon dioxide suppliers aren’t scheduling deliveries earlier than 24 hours in advance. This means manufacturers have no visibility on stock levels or when they will receive their next batch. The BSDA said: “Some soft drinks manufacturers have only a few days of CO2 supply left in reserve. As it stands, most CO2 suppliers are currently not scheduling beyond 24 hours in advance, meaning there is no visibility as to UK stocks and no certainty around deliveries. If soft drinks manufacturers cannot get hold of CO2 supplies after their reserves have run out, production of certain products will have to cease. Given the ‘perfect storm’ of trading conditions, BSDA also want the government to financially support the operation of UK fertiliser plants through to the end of the year to prevent disruption at Christmas. They also warned that supplies of CO2 can’t be imported -- partly due to Brexit. The BSDA says: Relying on European supply is not feasible given the problems associated with Brexit and the fact that CO2 production on the continent is also disrupted. While the UK already imports CO2 in large quantities from plants in Norway and the Netherlands, the Norwegian plant is shortly due to close for up to two weeks for maintenance, and the Dutch plant is prioritising its customers in the EU. There’s a handy FAQ here. UK poultry producers have started taking emergency measures to conserve carbon dioxide used to stun birds for slaughter, as a shortage of the gas poses an increasingly grave threat to the meat supply chain. The Financial Times explains: Richard Griffiths, chief executive of the British Poultry Council, said deliveries of carbon dioxide had started to arrive that were short of the amounts that companies had ordered. Some meat processors have reactivated old electrical stunning equipment — which processes birds about 30 per cent more slowly — and diverted CO2 from packaging to slaughter. “But not everyone has the kit [for electrical stunning] and not everyone has the people trained to operate it,” added Griffiths. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Fears are growing that the UK’s carbon dioxide shortage will soon lead to empty shelves, as food producers urge the government to step in and provide support. Ian Wright, CEO of the Food and Drink Federation, told the BBC’s Today Programme this morning that it is “a real crisis”, explaining that supply chains are under unprecedented pressures. We have been saying for several weeks now that the just-in-time system which underpins both our supermarkets and our hospitality industry is under the most strain it’s ever been in the 40 years it’s been there. Poultry producers are warning that production will erode seriously by the end of this week, Wright says, and the same is true of pig production -- both sectors need CO2 to stun animals for slaughter. Bakery goods and meat packaging is probably only a week behind, he predicts. We probably have about 10 days before this gets to the point where consumers and shoppers, and diners, notice that those products are not available. Wright adds that ministers, particularly in DEFRA, take the problem extremely seriously.... he’s hopeful, but not confident, that the industry and government can work together on a solution. He has written to the secretary for food and rural affairs, George Eustice, urging action. In a letter seen by the Guardian, Wright says: “Across industry there is a united view that the situation is worsening, with little prospect of additional CO2 supply unless the UK government intervenes.” The carbon dioxide shortage is being caused by the gas crisis, because CO2 is a byproduct of fertiliser production. The surge in natural gas prices has forced the US fertiliser maker CF Industries to halt production at its plants in Billingham in Teesside and Ince in Cheshire last week -- creating disruption across supply chains. The FDF say the government must take three steps to support the food industry: Subsidise the small number of fertiliser plants who are the key sources of CO2 which the food and drink sector needs Help the industry find alternative sources for materials to stun animals, and for food packaging. Address labour shortages which mean the industry is so acutely susceptible to these shortages. Meat producers are also warning that supplies could be disrupted soon. Cranswick, which makes fresh pork products and gourmet sausages, bacon, ham and and charcuterie, says the UK risks a “major crisis in the food industry”. Adam Couch, Cranswick CEO, said the government must act immediately, to avoid shortages: The sector has been asking for support to ease the labour crisis, and now C02 shortages could effectively bring production to a halt throughout the supply chain. “The industry is already at tipping point ahead of the demanding Christmas period. We have worked tirelessly throughout the pandemic to keep food on the shelves, but there is a real risk of product shortages across the country if the Government does not act immediately to address these issues.” As the energy crisis intensified yesterday, the government insisted that the UK was “highly resilient”, with “no question of the lights going out”. Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, pledged: “There will be no three-day working weeks or a throwback to the 1970s. Such thinking is alarmist, unhelpful and completely misguided.” But No 10 has been warned that hundreds of thousands of Britons face a “very, very difficult” winter thanks to rising household costs fears of a three-day week for factories and further gaps on supermarket shelves. And with supermarket chain Iceland warning that UK food supplies could be under threat long before Christmas unless carbon dioxide supplies are restored, pressure is mounting...

Suella Braverman has revived a previous Conservative pledge to reduce net migration to tens of thousands of people, despite the failure of successive governments to hit the same target over a nine-year period. Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng are being warned not to stretch their plans for medium-term growth beyond the traditional definition of three to five years amid concerns in Whitehall that the fiscal plan may take the best part of a decade to deliver. Liz Truss has said she is still in principle in favour of cutting the 45% top rate of tax – even though she has shelved plans to abolish it now. (See 3.14pm.) Suella Braverman, the home secretary, received two standing ovations during her speech – one when she said “not give up” on tackling the small boats crossing the Channel, and another as she wound up. Hardline speeches from home secretaries always go down well at Tory conference, and this was one was in that tradition. Here are the key points. Braverman said she would legislate to stop anyone crossing the Channel on a small boat claim asylum. She said: I will commit to you that I will look to bring forward legislation make it clear that the only route to the United Kingdom is through a safe and legal route. And that is so that we can support those who need that help the most, including women and girls. This is something her predecessor, Priti Patel, said she would achieve through the Nationality and Borders Act. But she also stressed that there were no easy solutions to the problems of migrants crossing the Channel. She said: We’ve all heard pledges and promises, but this problem is complex and entrenched, and there are many forces working against us. Among her opponents on this issue, she cited the Labour party, the Liberal Democrats, the Guardian and lawyers. “The Guardian will have a meltdown,” she promised. She said the UK should not be relying on migrant labour. She said: And we mustn’t forget how to do things for ourselves. There is absolutely no reason why we can’t train up enough of our own HGV drivers, or butchers, or fruit pickers. The way we build a high skilled, high wage economy is by encouraging business to invest in capital and domestic labour, not relying wholly on low skilled, foreign workers. This seems to contradict what Liz Truss told the Sunday Telegraph at the weekend about how she wanted to increase the number of seasonal agricultural workers coming to the UK. Braverman claimed modern slavery laws, introduced by Theresa May when she was home secretary, were being abused. Braverman said: But the hard truth is that our modern slavery laws are being abused by people gaming the system. We have seen a 450% increase in modern slavery claims since 2014. Today, the largest group of small boats migrants are from Albania, a safe country. Many of them claim to be trafficked as modern slaves. That’s despite them having paid thousands of pounds to come here or having willingly taken a dangerous journey on the Channel. The truth is many of them are not modern slaves and their claims of being trafficked are lies. We need to make sure our system strikes a right balance. Our laws need to be resilient against abuse whilst at the same time ensuring we help those in genuine need. Robert Halfon, the Conservative chair of the Commons education committee, told Radio 4’s PM programme that benefits should be uprated in line with inflation because the Tories should care about growing society, as well as growing the economy. He said There’s no other way to say that things have been grim, grim at conference, and grim over the past week. The prime minister keeps talking about growing the economy, but we have got to talk about growing society as well and being the party of human and social capital, and not just the party of economic ... because both go hand in hand. What does that mean? That means a relentless focus on the cost of living and helping the lower-paid and absolutely raising benefits in line with inflation as Boris Johnson pledged. It means looking at how we’re going to ensure more affordable housing, how we’re championing education and skills, and at the moment we seem to be doing none of those things because the government seem bogged down in this argument amongst, in essence, people in the cabinet about the tax cuts for the well-off. The German ambassador to the UK has said that if the UK implemented laws arising out of the Northern Ireland protocol bill it would be “the end” of talks to find a solution to the Brexit impasse over trade arrangements between GB and NI. Miguel Berger told a Centre for European Reform panel at the conference: We need to find a solution without the application of the protocol bill, because I think if this would be implemented, in my view at the end of the talks. But he said he was hopeful that talks, which have resumed, would deliver a solution and allow everyone “to move forward”. The polling company Redfield and Wilton Strategies has published new polling giving Labour a 38-point lead in red wall seats. The detailed figures will make bleak reading for the Conservatives. One graph shows how the proportion of voters in red wall seat saying they “strongly disapprove” of Liz Truss has tripled since mid September. Many of the Tories publicly calling for benefits to be uprated in line with inflation are on the one nation, leftish wing of the party. But rightwingers are making this case too, and this afternoon Lord Frost, the former Brexit minister who on most issues is a strong supporter of the Liz Truss agenda, has joined those saying not uprating in line with inflation would be wrong. He told GB News: I’m going to say something which I don’t say very often, which is I agree with Penny Mordaunt (see 8.02am) and I think she’s got this right. The government has made a commitment to uprate benefits. It shouldn’t take on battles it can’t win. People feel insecure going into the autumn and I think it should stick to this commitment. We should, of course, for the future, look at incentives to work and probably there is going to have to be reform over time, but choose your moments and reassure people and take people with you. That’ll be my view in the following the events of the last few days. In the conference hall Suella Braverman, the home secretary, has just started speaking. According to briefing in advance, she will announce plans for a new law to stop anyone crossing the Channel on a small boat from claiming asylum in the UK (even thought the Nationality and Borders Act, passed by Priti Patel, was supposed to achieve this). I will post a summary once the speech is over. Andrew Marr, the former BBC political editor, has been attending party conferences since the 1980s. If you thought our mid-afternoon upsum was harsh (see 3.34pm), you should listen to his take on LBC this morning. He says that it’s an omnishambles conference and that it feels fatal for Liz Truss. Priti Patel, the former home secretary, delivered her first major political intervention at a fringe meeting at the party conference today. In remarks briefed overnight ahead of her speech to the Times, she criticised the decison to announce unfunded tax cuts, saying the Tories had to be the party of “sustainable public spending”. She said: We are spending today with no thought of tomorrow, and like the Blob in the old horror film, the more resources are absorbed today the bigger the problem gets and the more resources it will need to eat up tomorrow. Right now, we have got into a pattern of borrowing huge amounts to fix today’s urgent problems or generate short-term populist headlines. Each time it seems that there’s a good case, but what does this mean for future generations? I want to see our party regain its credibility by restoring its commitment to sustainable public spending . . . which is affordable today, tomorrow and for the foreseeable future. As Sophia Sleigh reports at Huffpost UK, Patel also said that “nothing would be more divisive” than having another leadership contest to replace Liz Truss. Jo Johnson, the former Tory universities minister, has criticised the education minister Andrea Jenkyns for saying at a fringe meeting yesterday that “the current system would rather our young people get a degree in Harry Potter studies than the apprenticeships shaping construction”. In an interview with Times Radio, Johnson said this “relentless uni-bashing” was tiresome. Accusing Jenkyns of recycling a cliche, he said: It used to be that ‘Mickey Mouse studies’ was the favourite sort of target for attack and now it’s become Harry Potter studies. The reality is these courses are few and far between relative to the numbers of really valuable courses that our higher education system is providing … Our universities are a really great national asset for the UK and this relentless uni-bashing is a bit wearisome. So I would urge ministers to go easy on the sort of the relentless negativity about a sector which is really one of our great strengths as a country. Off the maps in the brochure and in a quiet(ish) corner several levels above the conference floor, Conservative donors, senior MPs, and ministers are rubbing shoulders in the imaginatively named Blue Room. It is a place where donors, and other VIPs, can meet senior party figures discreetly. Its location is so poorly publicised that the Guardian ended up guiding a minister’s bag carrier as well as the president of a significant Conservative local association to the doors of the Jane How Room, which boasts “stunning views over Centenary Square”. The Blue Room, a long-standing fixture of Tory conferences, is this year – as it was last year – sponsored by Tratos, a firm led by party donor Maurizio Bragagni. As opposed to its modest presence at the Labour party conference floor, the firm does not have a stall with the general corporate exhibitors, choosing instead to get its branding in front of the eyes of the Conservative party’s most senior figures. Tratos’s sponsorship comes despite a Conservative party spokesperson criticising Bragagni after the BBC revealed remarks he had made about “foreign Muslims” running English cities. Earlier this afternoon outside the Blue Room, Bragagni greeted the Guardian, saying he was “fine, always fine. Better than me: only the Pope.” Following a steady drumbeat set by Conservative party HQ, a stream of ministers came and went during the two hours the Guardian spent observing the comings and goings, such as Thérèse Coffey, James Cleverly, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, and Ranil Jayawardena. Politicians past and present including Liam Fox, Brooks Newmark, and Shaun Bailey, the unsuccessful London mayoral candidate, as well as the TV personality Georgia Toffolo all passed the Guardian’s nook outside the Blue Room. And with them, donors, businessmen, strategists, and advisers, talking away from prying eyes and ears. Nadine Dorries, the former culture secretary, has restated her claim that, if Liz Truss wants to change the government’s policy agenda, she should call a general election. Thérèse Coffey’s speech to the Tory conference was mostly – or almost entirely – a rehash of the plan for patients she announed to MPs last month. James Illman from the Health Service Journal struggled to spot a new line. The first speaker of the day on the platform at the Conservative party confernce is Thérese Coffey, the health secretary and deputy prime minister. After a tribute to Andy Street, the Tory mayor of the West Midlands, she urges the party to “come together to tackle the issues that we have long faced”. I will post a summary of the highlights once I have seen the full text. Eric Pickles, a Tory peer and former party chair, told the BBC that it was “almost certain” that Tory MPs would fail to support the government if it tries to uprate benefits just in line with earnings. He said: The next big issue is with regard to the uprating of benefits, and I obviously I’m out of it – I don’t know what’s happening in the Commons – but I was just recently talking to somebody who does know what’s happening, and it was her estimation that the numbers against not uprating were greater than those that were against the 45% income tax [cut]. Asked if he thought the government could not get sufficient backing if it decided against uprating benefits in line with inflation, Pickles said: “Yeah, I think that’s almost certain.” As our fresh splash reports, Sir Robert Buckland, the Welsh secretary, has joined fellow cabinet minister Penny Mordaunt (see 8.02am) in signalling that he wants benefits to rise in line with inflation. Mordaunt said so explicitly. Buckland was a tiny bit more circumspect, but it is not hard to work out what he means. He told Newsnight’s Nicholas Watt: I’ve worked very closely with this prime minister for many years. She’s an extremely effective team player, she’s a great leader. And she’ll continue to listen and act accordingly. I have full confidence in that. I’m a one nation compassionate Conservative. I believe in enabling the most successful in our society to succeed, and I believe in the safety net as well. Asked if he wanted to see benefits rise in line with inflation, Buckland replied: Every Conservative government that I’ve been part of has maintained the safety net, and I’m sure this one will do the same. My colleagues Rowena Mason, Jessica Elgot and Rajeev Syal have filed a story summing up the state of play at the Conservative party conference so far today. The intro is harsh – but not wrong. Liz Truss’s government is in chaos after the chancellor refused to confirm he would bring forward his budget to calm the markets and the home secretary accused fellow MPs of a coup against the prime minister. At the fringe event where Suella Braverman, the home secretary, claimed Tory MPs “staged a coup” against Liz Truss when they forced her to abandon the 45% top rate of tax (see 1.18pm and 2.30pm), she named Michael Gove as a key culprit. Braverman told Chopper’s Politics podcast that the former cabinet minister was “airing dirty laundry” and called for him to stop. She said: Ultimately I’m very disappointed that members of our own party staged a coup, effectively, and undermined the authority of the prime minister in an unprofessional way. We are one party, the prime minister has been elected. She has got a serious mandate to deliver. She did talk about tax cuts all through the summer in a pretty exhausting process. She is doing what it said on the tin. Asked about Gove’s recent criticisms of the now scrapped 45p tax rate, she said: Michael is a friend of mine but I do think he has got this wrong and it is incumbent on him to try and corral support and encourage the new administration to succeed, because ultimately we are on the same team and we should be focused on being united and delivering to the British people. Asked what she would say to Gove, she said: Michael, if you have got concerns, if you have disagreements raise them in private ... You don’t air your dirty linen. Kemi Badenoch, the international trade secretary, has also urged Tory MPs unhappy about government policy to air their grievances in private, not through the media. And here are some more lines from the round of TV interviews that Liz Truss recorded this morning. Truss said she was still in principle in favour of cutting the 45% top rate of tax – even though she had shelved plans to abolish it now. She said: I would like to see the higher rate lower. I want us to be a competitive country but I have listened to feedback, I want to take people with me. She claimed that spending cuts would not involve cuts to frontline services. The government has said departments will have to stick within existing budgets, even though inflation has gone up by more than was expected, meaning they face cuts in real terms. Talking about her plans for public spending, Truss said: There will be some areas where there are projects the government is doing that we don’t think should go ahead, but what I’m not talking about is reducing frontline services. Critics say it is very hard to cut departmental budgets without frontline services being affected. She said she wanted to see more Rwanda-style deals to deter people crossing the Channel on small boats, and she said she would consider “all options” to deal with the problem. She said she did not want to see immigration rising. She said: I don’t want to see numbers going up, what I want to see is the right people coming in with the right skills that can contribute to Britain. She rejected suggestions that Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the Commons, should be sacked for saying benefits should rise in line with inflation (see 8.02am) – a comment that seemed to breach collective cabinet responsibility, because Mordaunt was pre-judging a decision not yet taken. Asked if Mordaunt had to go, Truss replied: “No, she doesn’t. This is about a decision that we are taking later on this year.” Truss rejected a suggestion that her first month in office had been a disaster. “I don’t agree with that analysis,” she said, when it was put to her. She said the government has no plans to abolish inheritance tax – even though Andrew Griffith, a Treasury minister, has said personally he would favour the idea. (Alert readers will have noticed a pattern in the blog today. With ministers sounding off about policy, regardless of what the government line is, unity and message discipline is breaking down.) Truss refused an invitation to apologise to people who lost mortgage deals, or who are paying higher mortgages, as a result of the market turmoil triggered by the mini-budget. And she also said she had no shame over this. She told Sky News: I think there’s absolutely no shame in a leader listening to people and responding and that’s the kind of person I am. I’ve been totally honest and upfront with people that everything I have done as prime minister is focused on helping people get through what is a very difficult winter. She said there was no immediate prospect of Ukraine joining Nato. She said she did not support the return of the Parthenon marbles to Greece. Liz Truss has been doing a series of interviews with broadcasters today. Speaking to Sky’s Sam Coates, she twice refused to say she trusted Kwasi Kwarteng, her chancellor. (See 12.09pm.) But in a subsequent interview with Talk TV she said that, of course, she trusted him. She said: I do trust the chancellor, absolutely. The chancellor is a very close colleague of mine, we work very closely together. Simon Clarke, the levelling up secretary, has joined Suella Braverman, the home secretary, in criticising the Tory MPs who persuaded Liz Truss to abandon the plan to cut the 45% top rate of income tax. (See 1.18pm.) He has posted this on Twiter. This is fascinating, because there is a lot going on in these nine words. Ostensibly, Braverman and Clarke are having a go at Michael Gove. Gove (Clarke’s predecessor-but-one as levelling up secretary) was the MP who led the attack on the decision to abolish the 45% rate at the conference on Friday. All three were hardline Brexiters, but on this issue they are at loggerheads. Gove’s views were shared by many, and probably most, Conservative MPs. The two cabinet ministers are not just attacking a maverick colleague; they are dismissing a large chunk of the parliamentary party as disloyal. This is the sort of language that emerges when a party is sliding into civil war territory. And, most interestingly, Braverman, and Clarke with his endorsement of her comments, are implicitly criticising Liz Truss for giving into pressure on the 45% issue in the first place. In interviews, Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng, the chancellor, have accepted that trying to abolish this tax rate now was a mistake (although they have implied they still believe in principle it would be good for the 45% rate to go at some point). But Braverman and Clarke seem to be saying Truss should have stuck to her guns, echoing criticism of her in the Daily Mail and the Daily Telegraph. Andrew Mitchell, the former Tory chief whip, has joined those calling for benefits to be uprated in line with inflation, and not just earnings. He told the World at One: I didn’t come into politics to make poor people poorer. It seems to me that it will be very strange to have dealt with and addressed this issue of terrifying rising costs on the one hand, and then not to maintain the real value of the benefits and support that the poorest in society really needs. Mitchell said government whips were talking to MPs to find out how much support there would be for a decision to uprate benefits just in line with earnings. Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, has posted an interesting thread on Twitter countering arguments that benefits should only be uprated in line with earnings, not inflation. It starts here. And this is his conclusion. Good afternoon. I’m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Ben Quinn. This is from Pat McFadden, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, responding to Liz Truss refusing twice in a Sky News interview to say she trusts Kwasi Kwarteng. (See 12.09pm.) McFadden said: The fact that the prime minister can’t even say she trusts her chancellor tells you all you need to know about the architects of the economic chaos into which they have plunged the country. Instead of disowning the problem and blaming one another they must put the country first and abandon their discredited trickle-down approach. Tory MPs “staged a coup” against the prime minister over the 45p tax rate, Suella Braverman has said. The home secretary told the Chopper’s Politics podcast: Ultimately I’m very disappointed that members of our own party staged a coup, effectively, against the prime minister. She added that former minister Michael Gove “got it wrong”, saying it was “incumbent on him to try and corral support” for Liz Truss and he should have raised his concerns “in private”. She said: I’m very disappointed to say the least by how some of our colleagues have behaved. Kwasi Kwarteng’s medium-term fiscal plan is in confusion. He told GB News his fiscal plan “will be on the 23rd” of November in an interview on Tuesday. However, government sources are still saying that they are considering bringing it forward, and on Monday night, there were briefings from the sources close to the leadership that it would be this month. Liz Truss also said: “We’ve got the date of November 23. This is when we are going to set out the OBR forecast as well as the medium-term fiscal plan. Michael Gove, the former education secretary, has said free school meals could be extended to all families on universal credit for just £500m. I think it needs to be stressed that interventions by the state at critical moments in order to improve the welfare of all its citizens are not socialists. Conservative care about the community and care about public health interventions, he told an Onward panel on school food and poverty. It seems to me this is a more than worthwhile intervention considering some of the other police choices in front of us. Iain Duncan Smith has said it would be wrong for the government not to increase benefits in line with inflation. In a warning to Liz Truss’s government as she considers increasing the value of universal credit benefits from April by less than the rate of inflation for September this year, he said putting more money in lower-income households’ pockets would help grow the economy. “If you do want growth the group that is most likely to spend the money that you give to them is the group we’re talking about [lower-income households].” “If you want the economy to grow... the money you give to people through their benefits will end up almost certainly back in the economy in double quick time. So there is a positive to this.” Duncan Smith said he resigned in 2016 because he believed the government had “lost the plot” on the balance between support for working people and those out of a job, and that it would be best for the government to look at support for households in the round. The former Conservative leader said the government needed to provide extra support for those in the most difficult circumstances during the cost of living crisis, and that it made little sense to offer a real-terms cut in the value of support for the poorest. The chief executive of Shell has said governments may need to tax energy companies further to fund efforts to protect the “poorest” people from soaring bills. Ben van Beurden, the outgoing boss of the oil and gas company, told an energy conference in London: “One way or another there needs to be government intervention. Protecting the poorest, that probably may then mean that governments need to tax people in this room to pay for it. “I think we just have to accept as a society – it can be done smartly and not so smartly. There is a discussion to be had about it but I think it’s inevitable.” Last week EU ministers agreed to tap windfall profits of companies and redirect them to customers and businesses as part of an initial energy package. The EU executive hopes to raise €140bn (£121bn) through the levies. The bloc also set a goal to reduce power consumption. Tory members have been using a meeting with their party’s chairman to vent their frustration at MPs affecting their local campaigning efforts. One Conservative member told Jake Berry they are “sick and tired” of having to answer questions about MPs’ actions while canvassing for local votes. Another said that “what was going on down in London” - hinting at the scandals which brought down Boris Johnson’s government - had turned a previously safe seat in their area into a marginal one. At a Conservative party conference fringe event where members were able to meet the new party chairman, Woking borough councillor Melanie Whitehand said: “I am sick and tired, when we go around canvassing, every time what gets pulled up is what is happening in government.” “Although we say local issues for local politics, it absolutely gets drowned out by whatever the MPs are doing in the chamber.” She added that MPs were “selfish” and “not paying mind” to the Tory party members who helped get them elected.” Berry replied that “every member of parliament should be canvassing regularly with their council team”, as he does. He said: “I don’t have to rely on my council colleagues coming to me and saying: ‘Do me a favour, will you? Just shut up in Westminster and will you let us get on with winning our local election’, because I hear it directly from the voters.” The new chair of parliament’s environment, food and rural affairs committee (EFRA) has made a veiled reference to Carrie Johnson, who lobbied her husband Boris for animal welfare legislation when he was prime minister. Talking about rural voters being turned off the previous administration, Sir Robert Goodwill told a Countryside Alliance event: We need to reassure that while before the people who held sway with the previous administration here in the UK in terms of animal rights, that the view of the minority will be listened to, and support them when you start talking about people’s right to shoot. The panel pointed out that in some rural areas according to YouGov the conservatives are polling in the 20s at the moment and labour are polling in the 40s. MP Fay Jones said the recent debate about the new farming subsidies in the Conservative party had been “deeply unhelpful” but added that the party should “not be dancing to the tune of environmental NGOs”. Liz Truss gave broadcast interviews today as she visited a construction site in Birmingham with her chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng. Asked if she had confidence in her chancellor, the prime minister twice refused to say so. Here she is being interviewed by Sky News: Kwasi Kwarteng’s longest public appearance at the Conservative party conference will not be on the main stage, where he spoke for 20 minutes on Monday, but at a fringe event hosted by two thinktanks on Tuesday afternoon. For an hour, the “person responsible for the UK’s economic future”, as the event bills it, will outline his vision in a conversation with the TaxPayers’ Alliance and the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA). It will be longer than his 25-minute “mini-budget” speech and his “quarter of an hour – or maybe a bit longer” with party donors after the mini-budget. Mark Littlewood, the director general of the IEA, will be one of Kwarteng’s interviewers, speaking to the man responsible for implementing “Trussonomics”. The IEA has faced criticism over a lack of transparency over its donors, and a 2019 Guardian investigation found it had historically issued publications arguing climate change is either not significantly driven by human activity or will be positive. Another charity has joined calls for reassurances that benefits will not face what effectively will be cuts if increases do not keep pace with inflation. Brian Dow, the deputy chief executive of Rethink Mental Illness, said: The chancellor yesterday pledged to always be on the side of those who need help the most, but this is contradicted by the prime minister’s failure to commit to uprating benefits in line with inflation – the bare minimum government could do to show it recognises the hardship faced by people bearing the brunt of the cost of living crisis. We’re growing ever more concerned that there is a lack of understanding at the heart of the debate about who is going to be impacted by this. Sir Iain Duncan Smith has called for a further taper rate reduction and suggested the government should invest in universal credit. Speaking at a fringe event at the Tory conference, the Conservative former leader and work and pensions secretary said he was “pleased” former chancellor Rishi Sunak lowered the taper rate, adding: “I think it should come lower in due course.” He went on: There’s not a better incentive than if we think for people as we have been arguing this week that lower taxes produce growth, then why would it be different for people on benefits? If you have a lower withdrawal rate then they’re more likely to be proactive, more likely to get on, more likely to be able to be productive etc. The Liberal Democrats have made calls for Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng to have their pay docked following their “gross mismanagement of the public finances”. The party says it will table a censure motion in parliament calling for action against the prime minister and the chancellor. Truss would lose £40,000 and Kwarteng £33,750 under the proposal, the Lib Dems add. The motion states: That this house censures the chancellor of the exchequer and the prime minister, for their handling of the UK’s public finances, which has dramatically increased households’ mortgage costs and threatened pension funds; and believes the government should halve the chancellor’s additional ministerial salary, and halve the prime minister’s additional salary this year, as a result of this gross mismanagement of the public finances. Away from the Tory Party conference, the chair of the Covid-19 public inquiry has said that bereaved families and those who suffered will be at the heart of its inquiries, as she promised to be “fair” and “thorough”. Former court of appeal judge Lady Heather Hallett opened the inquiry in London saying she planned to investigate the UK’s preparedness for a pandemic, the government’s response, and its impact on patients, NHS and social care staff and the public. A minute’s silence was held for those who lost their lives, with Hallett saying: There’s one word that sums up the pandemic for so many, and that is the word ‘loss’. Although there were positive aspects of the pandemic, for example, the way in which communities banded together to help each other and the vulnerable, millions of people suffered loss, including the loss of friends and family members; the loss of good health - both mental and physical; economic loss; the loss of educational opportunities and the loss of social interaction. Those who are bereaved lost the most. They lost loved ones and the ability to mourn properly. Hallett said the inquiry would analyse how the Covid pandemic unfolded and would determine whether the “level of loss was inevitable or whether things could have been done better”. Referring to the controversy surrounding Partygate, a member of the audience at a Tory conference fringe event on rebuilding trust after the Johnson era has claimed that a “drinking culture” within the civil service was at fault and needed to be cleaned up. Responding to him, Dave Penman of the FDA union said: I was a civil servant and while I was in the civil service over 20 years ago alcohol was banned in most departments. I think what we saw in Partygate was an issue about No 10, not the civil service. Jeremy Wright, a Tory MP and former minister, backs him up: Every trade has some people who drink too much to cope with the pressure. There are frankly some politicians who drink too much and that includes ministers. Not while they are making decisions but after they have made decisions. The same event was told that trust among the public towards government was at a level that was last seen in the aftermath of the Iraq war. “The Blair years were a really good example of people saying: well they are not going to be any different,” said Dr Susan Hawley of Spotlight on Corruption, who also warned that polling had shown some very authoritarian instincts and reactions from the public in the wake of the decline in trust. Challenged over whether borrowing to buy years’ worth of gas at almost record-high prices is a good deal, Truss has told broadcasters in Birmingham: I have not signed any deal. But what I’m saying is that Britain’s energy security is vital and what we will be doing is always looking for value for money, of course we will, but it’s important that we have that long-term energy security. Asked if the markets will be happier with more borrowing, Truss said: This is speculation, you know, no deal has been signed. But as I’m very clear about, we are completely focused on fiscal discipline. We will be bringing down the debt as a proportion of GDP over the medium term, but making sure we’ve got energy security is clearly vital for our country. Civil servants are tired of ministers saying one thing in private about the work of civil servants and then “denigrating” them in public, a fringe event on rebuilding trust after the Johnson era has been told by the head of a union which represents senior civil servants. Two things could be done that would help rebuild trust among civil servants, said Dave Penman, the general secretary of the FDA union That is: stop attacking them and introduce the sort of independent and transparent process that the committee for standards in public life have talked about and which has been introduced elsewhere. Penman also recalled the reports that Downing Street at the time of Boris Johnson’s premiership had a “hit list” of permanent secretaries it would like to replace. Something that had come up “time and time again” was the conduct of some ministers in the workplace, said Penman, instancing Jacob Rees-Mogg’s post-it notes on the desks of civil servants who were working at home or were not in the office due to other duties at that time. Rees-Mogg was called “condescending” earlier this year after leaving notes deemed to be passive-aggressive on civil servants’ desks in an effort to stop them working from home. As part of his campaign to push workers back into offices, the cabinet minister has toured Whitehall buildings and published a league table of government departments based on how many staff are present. Referring also to the most serious of allegations about the behaviour of ministers and MPs, he added: As we saw in the scandal that erupted around Westminster around the MeToo movement there are times when politicians’ conduct falls below that which is acceptable in any workplace but they are not employees and it is a process essentially of self-regulation. Liz Truss has said that the government is looking at long-term energy contracts with other countries to secure supply. Asked if she is contemplating buying many years’ worth of Norwegian gas at close to current prices, she told broadcasters in Birmingham: What I have said is, first of all, we will move forward on our own energy security, so that’s more renewables here in the UK, it’s more nuclear power here in the UK, and it’s also moving forward faster with using North Sea facilities. But we are looking at long-term energy contracts with other countries because as well as making sure we’ve got a good price, energy security is vitally important. And we never want to be in a position again where we’re dependent on authoritarian regimes for our energy. That’s why we’re in the situation we are now. Jeremy Wright, a Tory MP on the panel here at the Tory conference discussion on rebuilding trust after ‘the Johnson era’, says that he “fervently hopes” that the new prime minister will appoint a new ethics advisor. Wright, the Conservative member of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, says however that the process of appointment needs to be regulated “Not that the PM cannot choose who they want but that there should be methods to reassure people,” he says. The advisor should also be able to initiate their own investigations and determine if there has been a breach in the ministerial code. A reminder that Liz Truss refused to commit during the leadership to appointing an ethics adviser if she became prime minister, saying she has “always acted with integrity”. I think we’re going to hear some interesting contributions at this fringe during questions from the floor and when others on the panel come in. They include Dave Penman, the general secretary of the FDA union, which represents senior civil servants. It may feel like an age ago, but it was only in June of this year that Boris Johnson’s ethics advisor, Lord Geidt, dramatically quit after conceding the then prime minister may have broken the ministerial code over the Partygate scandal. Tory party activists, councillors and others have packed out a fringe event, where I’m now liveblogging from, on the topic of: “How can government rebuild trust after the Johnson era?” Dr Hannah White, acting director of the Institute for government, starts by reminding those present that the Johnson government was marked by a series of ethical scandals, which ultimately led to its downfall. Liz Truss has refused to commit to raising benefits in line with inflation, amid a fresh battle with MPs over cuts to spending including concern from among her cabinet. The prime minister said pensions would rise in line with inflation, having committed to the pensions “triple lock” during the leadership campaign. But she said people on welfare benefits were in a “different situation” and said they were more able to look for more work. “When people are on a fixed income, when they are pensioners, it is quite hard to adjust. I think it’s a different situation for people who are in the position to be able to work,” she told LBC. “What I want to do is make sure that we are helping more people into work.” She told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme ministers were “going to have to make decisions about how we bring down debt as a proportion of GDP in the medium term … I am very committed to supporting the most vulnerable.” A real-terms cut to benefits would be a direct cut to support for dying people, an end of life charity has said in response to the prime minister’s comments this morning on whether or not the government will increase benefits in line with inflation. Dr Sam Royston, director of policy and research at the end of life charity Marie Curie, said: 90,000 people die in poverty each year in the UK. And terminally ill people of working age are at particular risk. For many terminally ill people, a cut in support midst of a cost-of-living crisis would effectively remove any quality of life they hoped to have in their final weeks. Lord Frost laughed when he was asked about the apology offered by arch Brexiter Steve Baker to Ireland and Brussels for the way that the MP and some of his colleagues behaved over the past six years. In fact, claimed Frost, the UK had been “the victim of poor behaviour from the EU in Ireland”. Steve has his own way of these things. An honest assessment is that things could have been done differently on both sides. I think the UK has been the victim of poor behaviour from the EU in Ireland and there are things on reflection that we would have done differently. I don’t think it helps to rake over things the whole time and the important thing is to try and find an agreement if they possibly can. Lord Frost, the former Brexit negotiator, has said that he worries that a “weak start” is going to “discredit the agenda” of the Truss government. He was speaking this morning on LBC, where he was asked about the prospect that backbenchers could force future U-turns from the government. Well this is the problem now. I worry that this rather weak start is going to discredit the whole agenda, that every time we try and do anything that there is going to be a coalition against this. I think the only way to deal with that is to pause, explain and set out what needs to be done in a more thoughtful way. Former Conservative leader William Hague said that he hoped the government could learn from the U-turn on income tax and the political chaos of recent days. He told Times Radio: Maybe the government are beginning to learn, after a very terrible start, that they do have to look ahead and anticipate these problems.” Unlike some other party members, Lord Hague did not suggest that defeat at the next election was inevitable for the government. The whole political situation in this country is very fluid. And if I was the Labour party, I would not be confident I’ve got people excited yet about what a Labour government could do. There is still a lot to play for. But he said that Liz Truss’ team needs to learn the “right lessons” from the mini-budget debacle. They can either look at what’s happened over the 45p tax rate and say: ‘Oh, we had to give way on that so we’ve got to be adamant about everything else that we first thought otherwise we’re going to look weak’, but that would be a disastrous approach. Or they can say: ‘Well, maybe we should now really look ahead and not dig any more holes an climb into them and let’s be careful now’ and they really need to take that approach on a whole range of subjects because we’re coming into a very difficult period as a country and in the whole world anyway. Ahead of her speech today to the Conservative party conference, the home secretary has said she would examine the possibility of giving anonymity to suspected criminals after concern over the identification and treatment of high-profile people wrongly accused of sexual abuse. Suella Braverman made the pledge after criticising the “media circus” surrounding accusations against the singer Cliff Richard and the former MP Harvey Proctor, which both said had ruined their lives. Braverman told a Young Conservatives audience at the party conference in Birmingham that “trial by media will only undermine our justice system”. Asked about the treatment of Richard and Proctor, both of whom were cleared of any wrongdoing after facing high-profile claims, she said: We have had some high-profile instances where the media circus around a suspect who has not been charged has been devastating. I think coverage of people prior to charge can be very, very damaging, particularly if the charges are not pursued or if they are dropped later on. Kwasi Kwarteng’s decision to bring forward his debt-cutting plan could help to calm markets and mean smaller future interest rate rises than would otherwise have been the case, according to the Tory chair of parliament’s influential Treasury watchdog. Mel Stride, a Conservative MP and the chair of the Treasury committee, said moving the government’s fiscal statement to October from 23 November, could restore some confidence, depending on the content of the plan and the detail of the new forecasts from the Office of Budget Responsibility. The pound rose to a two-week high above $1.14 on Tuesday as Kwarteng prepared to announce an earlier date to set out his plans to cut debts. Stride said that if the plans were well received, the Bank of England might opt for a smaller rate rise at its next meeting on 3 November. Truss was asked about her views on what she has described as “obstacles to growth” replying that she was intent on pressing ahead with plans to remove “top-down” housing targets. It’s wrong that how houses are built is centrally directed. Instead we are setting up new investment zones, which are places that people want homes to be built and they want businesses to be built. It’s an approach based more on local consent than centrally based targets. She was also asked if she had the courage to tell a Tory conference that more immigrants would be needed to do the jobs that were needed in the UK? Truss said that Suella Braverman, the home secretary, was looking at the ensuring that the immigration provided what was needed and if that meant bringing in more highly skilled workers then it should be the case That is the balance that she needs to strike. Yes there is more that we can do to get the highly skilled people we need in our economy but we also need to train more people. A large number of people had become “economically inactive” during Covid and it was important to get them back to work, she added. Yet another Tory MP, Caroline Noakes, has popped up to draw a line in the sand over the question of raising benefits in line with inflation. “How is the government going to re-establish its financial credibility?,” Truss was asked on the Today programme. Pointing again to the government’s measures to alleviate the expected rises in energy costs, Truss said: “I do think we need to recognise first of all that people are struggling and it is a difficult time. I have every sympathy and I am doing all I can as prime minister to address that.” Nick Robinson came in at this point to say that this was all very well, but the increase in mortgage costs had wiped out the gains on energy for many people. She replied Every single household benefits from our energy price guarantee and of course we had to act very quickly as a government to deal with that and of course it has meant extra borrowing and I acknowledge that we should have done more to lay the groundwork. Will she admit that it was a mistake? There is always balance to be struck and we do need to get things done but we are also a listening government. We reflect on where things could have been done better. Truss was asked about the announcement this week by a major financial advice firm, deVere Group, that it was cancelling all of its UK property investment projects due to the ongoing heightened “economic upheaval”. Would the government bring forward plans forward its fiscal statement to provide calm to investors and others? We are working very closely with the OBR. It’s important that we have a forecast to go with that plan and that’s something the chancellor is working on. As things stand the Guardian understands Kwasi Kwarteng will speed up plans for a new fiscal statement, expected to be focused on spending and deregulation. It will now take place later this month, rather than 23 November, accompanied by new forecasts from the Office of Budget Responsibility, in another move designed to restore market stability. The focus on the government’s 45p tax rate was “becoming a distraction,” Liz Truss has told BBC Radio 4 in the full interview which she recored on Monday at the request of her office. Asked about the fear and anxiety – as well as material consequences for large numbers of mortgage holders – generated for millions of people by Kwasi mini-budget, Truss replied Well, I have already admitted that we should have done a better job at laying the ground for that but I think what would have been completely wrong is us not to act. She continued to insist that “the biggest part of the package was the energy price cap. Pressed on the plan to cut 45p rate of income tax for higher earners, now scrapped, she replied that “the whole issue about the 45p has become a distraction from the core part of the package.” Pressed about the mini-budget’s other taxes, which are still tp be paid for, she replied: In the case of corporation tax we are not talking a cut. We are talking about not raising a tax and what I believe is wrong is that going into a slowing global economy, when Britain is trying to attract investment from around the world, we would put up our corporation tax rate to considerably higher than the rate in Ireland, the same rate as in France. Here are some of the key events as well as interesting-looking fringe events scheduled for today at the Tory conference in Birmingham. Headline speakers later include the home secretary, Suella Braverman, who will use her conference speech to set out her intention to bring in new laws to make it easier to deport people who come to the UK illegally. The home secretary will promise to allow “the kind of immigration that grows our economy” but “end abuse of the rules” as she addresses activists at the Conservative party conference. 9.30am: Andrew Griffith, financial secretary to the Treasury, will speak alongside Lord Frost at an even on domestic investment. 10.30am: An event entitled “After the Johnson era, how can the government rebuild trust?” Speakers will include Tory MP Jeremy Wright. 1pm: Michael Gove will speak at an event called: How can health revitalise the economy?’ 4pm: Main speakers in a session entitled: Delivering Better Public Services | Foreign Affairs Speakers include the health secretary, Thérèse Coffey; the home secretary, Suella Braverman; the transport secretary, Anne-Marie Trevelyan; the education secretary, Kit Malthouse; and the justice secretary, Brandon Lewis. The foreign secretary, James Cleverly, will also set out foreign policy priorities. Cabinet minister Penny Mordaunt has told Times Radio that benefits should rise with inflation: Mordaunt, one of Truss’s vanquished rivals during the Tory leadership race, said: I’ve always supported - whether it’s pensions, whether it’s our welfare system - keeping pace with inflation. It makes sense to do so. That’s what I voted for before. In a potentially key intervention that will be picked over for its contrast to the carefully chosen words this morning from the prime inister, Mordaunt added: We want to make sure that people are looked after and that people can pay their bills. We are not about trying to help people with one hand and take away with another. Senior Conservative officials have accused West Midlands police of failing to do enough to keep protesters away from delegates at the party conference, a leaked letter reveals. The disclosure comes just hours after the police were forced to lock down the conference in central Birmingham for several hours after a security scare. Police say they have been shortchanged by over £500,000 on the costs of keeping the conference in Birmingham secure. Jake Berry, the Conservative party chair, and Darren Mott, party chief executive, sent a letter on Sunday evening to the police and crime commissioner for the West Midlands raising “serious concerns” over security around the conference. The Guardian’s political editor, Pippa Crerar, has written a piece which delves in to the behind-the-scenes events which led to the government’s u-turn on the 45 pence tax rate. As early as Friday, Truss and her No 10 team were calling round Tory MPs. She spoke to one former cabinet minister just as they were door-knocking constituents. I told her I’d just been told how unfair it was that we were protecting the rich while my constituent was worried about paying their mortgage. Some MPs suspected something was up when the Tory whips failed to do their regular weekend ring-round to test the mood. “It seemed odd, especially after such a turbulent week,” said one. “But it also meant that they didn’t know if they had the numbers to get the policy through the Commons.” Good morning from the Conservative party conference on the day the spotlight is falling on a fresh battle between Liz Truss and Tory rebels – this time over the level of benefits. It’s only a day after the government was forced into a humiliating U-turn on plans to abolish the top rate of income tax and the date of a new mini-budget. This morning Truss is doing a broadcast round where she has refused to rule out real-terms benefit cuts to help pay for her government’s plans She told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that there is a need to be “fiscally responsible” amid suggestions benefits will not rise in line with inflation. She said: We are going to have to make decisions about how we bring down debt as a proportion of GDP in the medium term. I am very committed to supporting the most vulnerable, in fact in addition to the energy price guarantee we’re also providing an extra £1,200 to the poorest households. So we have to look at these issues in the round, we have to be fiscally responsible. Asked by the Today programme’s Nick Robinson about how she can guarantee that pensions will rise with inflation and not benefit payments, Truss replied the government is looking “at all of these issues very carefully” and an announcement “will be made in due course”. But with Tory MPs plotting, the Guardian understands the chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, will speed up plans for a new fiscal statement, expected to focus on spending and deregulation. It will now take place later this month, rather than on 23 November as previously scheduled, accompanied by new forecasts from the Office of Budget Responsibility, in another move designed to restore market stability. Senior MPs warned of further rebellions over reductions in public spending, especially on benefits, which the chancellor has declined to rule out.

Thank you for reading -- we’ll be back tomorrow. Good night! - JK Reuters has unearthed an error made by Boris Johnson’s government when it slapped sanctions on five private Russian banks, including Rossiya Bank, which the government said was “privately owned by elite Russian billionaires with direct links to Putin” (the two largest state banks were spared from sanctions, for now). The sanctions document mistakenly listed Rossiya Bank’s address as “Neglinnaya, 12 Moscow, 107016, Russia”. It is, in fact, is the address of Russia’s central bank –– known in Russian as “Bank Rossiya,” which was founded in 1860. Rossiya Bank, the private bank created in 1990, is based in St Petersburg. This is thought to be an error - there is no suggestion that the central bank has been sanctioned, Reuters said. Our economics editor Larry Elliott has written this analysis: Ukraine crisis: sanctions against Russia come at a cost to the west. After all the tough talk of the past month, the sanctions imposed on Russia by the west are unlikely to lose Vladimir Putin much sleep. The response to Boris Johnson’s announcement that five of the less important Russian banks and three individuals would be targeted was: is that it? The most dramatic news was Germany’s decision to halt approval of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia to western Europe. That will have an impact, but may end up affecting Germany more than it does Russia. The message from western capitals was that it was the plan all along to start small and then ratchet things up if Putin refuses to back down. Ben Wallace, the UK defence secretary, said there were several options to choose from. Even though things are a bit calmer, tensions remain high. Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at the financial services firm Spartan Capital Securities in New York, told Reuters: The bottom line is that fear factor remains elevated and until we get some sort of a clearer picture of what Putin may or may not do, the market is just going to stay in a state of confusion. Crude oil prices have given up some of their gains, after Brent crude, the global benchmark, pushed over $99 a barrel this morning. The last time it was at this level was in early September 2014. Brent crude is now trading at $96.95 a barrel, up 1.6% while US light crude is up 2.2% at $93.1 a barrel. Russ Mould, investment director at the investment firm AJ Bell, said: Oil and gas shed some of their gains from earlier in the day when it became clear that sanctions would not reach key Russian exports of raw materials (or at least not yet). Some calm has returned to financial markets, after Russia said it would only recognise the Donetsk and Luhansk territories’ independence within the boundaries that the Moscow-backed separatists currently control, and as Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy played down the prospect of a large-scale conflict with Russia. Asian shares recorded some chunky losses, with Japan’s Nikkei losing 1.7% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng tumbling 2.7%. The main European stock markets in Germany, France, Spain and Italy all slid more than 2% in early trading but later clawed back most of their losses. The FTSE 100 index in London closed 11 points lower at 7,495.97, a 0.16%% drop. Germany’s Dax lost 0.4% while France’s CAC slipped 0.16%, and Italy’s FTSE MiB and Spain’s Ibex were flat. The rouble has recovered from a near two-year low after suffering its biggest one-day drop, of 3.3%, since the outbreak oof the coronavirus pandemic on Monday. The Russian currency fell to 81 against the dollar and is now trading at 79.18. Russian stock markets also staged a small comeback after earlier losses, with the dollar-denominated RTS index and the rouble-denominated Moex index on the Moscow exchange both rising 1.6% this afternoon. Shares in Russia’s largest lender Sberbank rose 1.3% (after an earlier gain of 5%) while the second-biggest bank VTB was up 1.7%, after they escaped British sanctions. They were not on the list of five banks that are to be sanctioned by the UK. However, the two state-backed banks are among a number of Russian companies that have secondary listings in London, and their London-listed shares are still down, albeit not nearly as much as earlier. Sberbank fell 1.4% in London after plunging 13% this morning while VTB has lost 1.6%. State-backed oil and gas producer Gazprom fell 3.4% after an earlier loss of 8%, while Rosneft ended the day nearly 8% lower and Lukoil closed down 5.3%. Shares in PAO Novatek, the largest gas producer in Russia not directly controlled by the Russian state, dropped 7.3% in London. Gennady Timchenko, a close ally and friend of Vladimir Putin, is one of three Russian oligarchs who appeared on today’s UK sanctions list, and owns a stake in Novatek. In total, 31 Russian companies are listed on the London Stock Exchange, to raise money and give international investors easier access. Two FTSE 100 companies whose assets are based in Russia, the steelmaker Evraz reversed earlier losses and gained 5.4%, while the gold miner Polymetal rose 2.8%. Today’s CBI survey revealed that the largest number of British manufacturers plan to raise prices in the next three months than at any point since 1976, underscoring the inflationary pressures hitting the UK economy. With energy prices rocketing and wages on an upward path, the CBI said four-fifths of firms expect to increase the cost of manufactured goods in the next three months. Not since the oil shocks of the mid-1970s has such a broad swathe of the manufacturing sector found itself needing to increase prices, pushing a net balance to +77% of firms that say prices will need to rise, up from +66% in January, according to the business lobby group. The Centre for Economics and Business Research, a UK think tank, is warning on the impact on western living standards, already under pressure, from rising inflation and potentially slower growth as a result of the Ukraine crisis. Any international action will likely not only add to the current inflationary binge, possibly bringing inflation close to 10% in the main Western economies, but also should slow down growth quite rapidly. World GDP growth in 2022 had been forecast to be about 4% at the turn of the year. Rising inflation has been edging this down and it might fall as low as 2% with the inflationary spur from the conflict with Russia if severe sanctions cause a much more serious spike in energy prices, pushing oil towards $130 and gas to 300p a therm with corresponding moves in metal prices. This would mean no growth at all for the rest of the year and possibly with some quarters of contraction so getting close to a recession (on the technical definition of two consecutive quarters with negative growth). Perhaps the biggest issue that will determine how severely the West is affected by the issues with Russia is whether there is the cohesion and willpower to put up with sanctions on the scale that might eventually affect Russia. The analysis above suggests that action could be costly, particularly for living standards that are already under pressure. Similar to the UK and eurozone, the US economy has bounced back from the Omicron wave this month, according to a monthly survey from IHS Markit. However, inflation has also picked up: prices charged for goods and services in the US rose at a record pace as companies continued to pass on higher cost burdens to their clients. Flash US Composite Output Index at 56.0 (51.1 in January). 2-month high Flash US Services Business Activity Index at 56.7 (51.2 in January). 2-month high Flash US Manufacturing PMI at 57.5 (55.5 in January). 2-month high Flash US Manufacturing Output Index at 52.5 (50.5 in January). 2-month high Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said: The pace of economic growth accelerated sharply in February as virus containment measures, tightened to fight the Omicron wave, were scaled back. Demand was reported to have revived and supply constraints, both in terms of component availability and staff shortages, moderated. With demand rebounding and firms seeing a relatively modest impact on order books from the Omicron wave, future output expectations improved to the highest for 15 months, and jobs growth accelerated to the highest since last May, adding to the upbeat picture. The service sector rebounded especially impressively, accompanied by a more muted upturn in manufacturing. Goods producers remain hamstrung by supply shortages which, although easing to the lowest since last May, continued to severely limit production growth, resulting in a further large rise in backlogs of work. Wall Street (which was closed for Presidents Day yesterday) has opened lower. S&amp;P 500 down 23 points, or 0.5%, at 4,325 Dow Jones down 192 points, or 0.56%, at 33,886 Nasdaq down 132 points, or nearly 1%, at 13,415 Russian sanctions: who has been hit and who might be next? My colleague Jasper Jolly writes: The UK sanctions list cited Timchenko’s shareholding in Bank Rossiya. However, he is also a board member and shareholder of PAO Novatek, the largest gas producer in Russia not directly controlled by the Russian state. Novatek is among 31 Russian companies whose shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange, giving international investors easier access. The price of its London-listed shares dropped by 8% on Tuesday, a much steeper drop than shares in Novatek’s main listing in Moscow, which fell by only 1.2%, suggesting concerns about the London listing. Timchenko was the founder of Gunvor Resources, a major commodities trading company based in Geneva. However, Timchenko sold his shares in Gunvor in 2014 when he was sanctioned by the US following Russia’s annexation of the Crimea region of Ukraine. Bill Browder, a former investor in Russia who campaigns for global anti-corruption laws, described the UK’s sanctions as “pretty tepid if you ask me” and highlighted the absence of Russia’s two biggest state-controlled banks, Sberbank and VTB, in a post on Twitter. GSK has revealed that its consumer healthcare business will be called Haleon after its planned spinoff and London stock market listing this summer. Its brands include Sensodyne toothpaste and Voltaren and Panadol painkillers. The drugmaker said: Haleon (pronounced “Hay-Lee-On”) is inspired by the merging of the words ‘Hale’, which is an old English word that means ‘in good health’ and Leon, which is associated with the word ‘strength’. The business has grown in size after merging with consumer product portfolios from Novartis and Pfizer, and now generates annual sales of £10bn. Brian McNamara, chief executive designate of Haleon, said: Introducing Haleon to the world marks another step in our journey to become a new, standalone company. Our name is grounded in our purpose to deliver better everyday health with humanity and to be a world leader in consumer healthcare. We are on track to launch Haleon in mid-2022 and our business momentum is strong. We look forward to updating investors and analysts more on this at our capital markets event at the end of February. Emma Walmsley, GSK’s chief executive, reiterated that Haleon had “strong prospects forgrowth, and through listing will unlock significant value for GSK shareholders”. She has been under pressure from the activist investor Elliott Management, a New York hedge fund, to explore a sale of the business, rather than a spin-off. Our economics editor Larry Elliott has spoken to Kristalina Georgieva, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund. He asked her about Russia and she expressed concerns about the possible impact on the global economy. She said: It is very concerning. It adds to uncertainty at a time when there is plenty of it, because we are not yet done with the pandemic and because the path to recovery for many countries is a difficult one. Georgieva said the tension had already had an impact on Ukraine through investors becoming more “hesitant” and said sanctions would have an impact on Russia and neighbouring countries. I anticipate an impact on Russia and through it an impact on Central Asia and the Caucasus - countries more dependent on economic ties with Russia. On the impact on the global economy, Georgieva said it would depend on how the crisis unfolded. I still hope there is a path to avoid a more dramatic impact. A more profound development could put pressure on energy prices to go higher. It is happening at a time when there are more risks for the world economy. Aggravating those risks is in nobody’s interests. The FTSE 100 index is holding on to its meagre gains, trading 17 points, or 0.2%, higher at 7,501, while Europe’s other main indices are flat to slightly lower. In London, the Russian miner Evraz fell more than 4% this morning but is now the top riser, up 4.8% at 280p. Jess Ralston, analyst at the energy and climate intelligence unit, a non-profit organisation, warned about the impact on UK (and European) households: Gas prices are already surging and with Germany putting a halt to Nord Stream 2, the gas crisis now looks almost certain to last for years, not months. Given the global nature of gas markets, the UK’s dependence on gas for heating and power will leave UK bill payers on the hook for Putin’s incursion into Ukraine. The government will increasingly feel the pressure to shield households in the long-term by insulating more homes, speeding the switch over to electric heat pumps and getting on with delivering the net zero policies that will wean us off volatile gas and protect us from future crises. Here is our full story on Germany stopping the certification process for the controversial Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in reaction to Russia’s recognition of the self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk in east Ukraine, by our man in Berlin, Philip Oltermann. Germany’s chancellor Olaf Scholz described Putin’s recognition of the Russian-controlled territories as a “grave breach” of international law that broke with decades of agreements between Russia and the west. “The situation today is fundamentally different,” he said. European natural gas contracts rose 9.5% to €78 a megawatt hour after the announcement from Scholz. The UK has imposed sanctions on five Russian banks and three high-net worth individuals, including Vladimir Putin’s close ally Gennady Timchenko, a Russian oligarch and billionaire businessman. The move comes after the Russian president ordered troops into eastern Ukraine last night, and formally recognised the territories of Donetsk and Luhansk as independent states. The banks are: Rossiya, IS Bank, General Bank, Promsvyazbank and the Black Sea Bank. The other individuals are Igor Rotenberg and Boris Rotenberg, who together own the SGM Group, which is Russia’s biggest construction firm in the oil and gas industry. Boris Johnson told parliament: This is the first tranche, the first barrage of what we are prepared to do. Any assets they hold in the UK will be frozen and the individuals concerned will be banned from travelling here. We must now brace ourselves for the next possible stages of Putin’s plan. Putin is establishing the pretx for a full-scale offensive. Britain has also previously threatened to block Russian companies from raising capital in London and to expose what Johnson calls the “Matryoshka dolls of Russian-owned companies”. More on Dave Ramsden’s comments from Joanna Partridge, who is at the National Farmers’ Union’s annual conference: Inflation, rising energy prices and the intensification of the crisis in Ukraine are among the string of challenges facing farmers and businesses in the current “age of uncertainty”, according to Bank of England policymaker Sir David Ramsden. Speaking to English and Welsh food producers at the annual conference of the National Farmers’ Union, the Bank’s deputy governor said “on inflation I haven’t seen such a challenging set of circumstances as this”. He added: The shock of the decision to leave EU, then the pandemic two years ago, now the energy price shock and intensification of the crisis in Ukraine, are creating uncertainty about where we go next. This does feel like the age of uncertainty. Fruit grower Ali Capper, chair of English Apples and Pears, told Ramsden that farmers in her sector are facing significantly higher costs this year, and will potentially have to pay workers 40% higher wages in 2022 than a year earlier. He said: The shocks that are coming in terms of fertiliser prices and other input prices are very, very significant. You are facing much higher inflation rates than I am seeing as a monetary policymaker in the economy as a whole. He said the best thing which could be done by the Bank - which expects inflation to peak at around 7.25% in April when the impending rise in the energy price cap takes effect - was to stick to its plans to maintain financial stability. Ramsden, whose mother was raised on a Welsh hill farm, also revealed he had watched TV presenter Jeremy Clarkson’s attempts to become a farmer on series Clarkson’s Farm, where Clarkson was surprised that he was judged to be a key worker during Covid. European shares have see-sawed: they are now back in the red with the exception of the UK’s FTSE 100 index, which is 21 points ahead at 7,505, a 0.28% gain. Meanwhile, Bank of England deputy governor Dave Ramsden said that there will be further interest rate rises in the months to come as the central bank responds to soaring inflation. But he said the longer-term path was hard to predict because of heightened uncertainty, including the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Ramsden said in a keynote speech at the National Farmers’ Union’s annual conference: Some further modest tightening in monetary policy is likely to be appropriate in the coming months. The word ‘modest’ is significant here though – I do not envisage Bank Rate rising to anything like its pre-2007 level of 5% or above, let alone to the kind of levels we used to see before the monetary policy committee was formed in 1997. New shocks can arise – we did not foresee the recent rise in energy prices, and as we meet today the crisis in Ukraine is intensifying – and so we should remain humble about the possibility that things might turn out differently. [This] makes it particularly difficult to make predictions about where monetary policy might be headed in the medium term. Investors are expecting a further rate hike after the Bank’s next scheduled meeting on 17 March, following two increases in February and December, to 0.5% now. Financial markets have priced in rates rising to nearly 2% by the end of the year. UK inflation jumped to 5.5% in January, its highest level in nearly three decades, and the Bank expects it to peak at 7.25% in April when a 54% hike in household energy bills comes into effect. Germany has taken steps to halt the process of certifying the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia, chancellor Olaf Scholz said today, as the West started taking punitive measures against Moscow over the Ukraine crisis, AP reports. Scholz told reporters in Berlin that his government was taking the measure in response to Moscow’s actions in Ukraine. The decision is a significant move for the German government, which had long resisted pulling the plug on the project despite pressure from the United States and some European countries to do so. Washington has for years argued that building another pipeline bringing natural gas from Russia to Germany increases Europe’s reliance on Russian energy supplies. Scholz said that the government had decided to “reassess” the certification of the pipeline, which hasn’t begun operating yet, in light of the latest developments. “That will certainly take time, if I may say so,” he said. Germany meets about a quarter of its energy needs with natural gas, a share that will increase in the coming years as the country switches off its last three nuclear power plants and phases out the use of coal. About half of the natural gas used in Germany comes from Russia. As a reminder, you can follow the latest developments in our Ukraine crisis live blog: BREAKING: Germany has pulled the plug on the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, according to the chancellor Olaf Scholz. The UK and Europe’s main stock markets have turned positive after suffering heavy losses (of more than 2% on the German, Italian and Spanish stock indices) in early trading. The UK’s FTSE 100 is up 29 points, or 0.4%, at 7,513 while the other exchanges are broadly flat. Brent crude, the global benchmark for Russia’s main export (oil), ventured above $99 a barrel earlier but is now trading at $98.15, up 2.9%. Russia’s two main stock indices are still trading lower. The dollar-denominated RTS index has fallen 3.5% after yesterday’s 13.2% plunge, while the rouble-denominated Moex index is down 3.86% following last night’s 10.5% drop. The Russian rouble fell to a near two-year low of 81 to the dollar, but has now recovered to 78.88. Ukraine’s hryvnia currency has fallen to a seven-year low, trading at 28.9 to the dollar. Here is our full story on what’s going on in financial markets. And a round-up of our other main stories: HSBC boosted its banker bonus pool by nearly a third after a global recovery from the Covid crisis helped profits more than double last year. The London-headquartered bank increased its staff bonus pool to $3.5bn (£2.6bn), a move it said was justified due to its strong financial performance and the need to compete for bankers in an “extraordinarily competitive labour market”. The UK government has recorded the first monthly budget surplus since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, despite a weaker than expected January performance as rising inflation pushed up debt interest costs. The Office for National Statistics said public sector net borrowing was in surplus of £2.9bn last month – the first month in which income outstripped expenditure since January 2020. Hundreds of thousands of tonnes of surplus food that could be going to hungry families is going to waste as supermarkets restrict who their suppliers can give it to, according to food distribution charities. Several independent charities, which are grouped together under the Xcess network, say they struggle to source unwanted edible food from manufacturers and processors because of supermarkets’ rules about the handling of their own-label products. The number of women in FTSE 100 boardroom roles has jumped to 39.1% from 12.5% 10 years ago, data has revealed, even as equality charities said progress for women in senior leadership roles was severely lagging. And in our Suisse secrets series, our banking correspondent Kalyeena Makortoff has looked at how Swiss banking secrecy enabled an unequal global financial system. There are fresh calls on the UK government to clamp down on Russian influence in UK finance and politics. The UK capital is also known as “Londongrad”. Last month ministers were criticised by MPs from all parties for failing to tackle London’s reputation as a money-laundering hub used by Russian oligarchs, criminals and kleptocrats. Caroline Lucas, Green MP for Brighton Pavilion, and a former party leader, has tweeted: Russia’s move against Ukraine has massively increased the uncertainty around the economic outlook for the eurozone, according to the European Economic Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni. He said at an economic conference today that “uncertainty remains around us,” adding: The violation of international law through Russian recognition of two separate territories in Ukraine will strongly increase this uncertainty. The European Commission already cut its growth forecast for the 19-nation currency bloc to 4% this year from 4.3% earlier this month, citing a new wave of Covid-19 infections, soaring energy prices and ongoing supply chain problems. German business morale improved in February across all sectors, according to a closely-watched monthly survey from the Munich-based Ifo institute. Its business climate index rose to 98.9 from an upwardly revised 96.0 in January, marking the highest level since August. This was better than economists had expected. Commerzbank’s chief economist Jörg Krämer said: The results of the February Ifo survey are a clear sign that the German economy will benefit massively from the easing of the coronavirus crisis in the coming months. However, the Ukraine crisis hangs over Europe’s largest economy “like the sword of Damocles,” experts said. Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe told Reuters that “the uncertainty will increase massively” and the biggest risk for German companies comes from soaring energy prices. “That would be poison for the [economic] recovery.” ING economist Carsten Brzeski said: We don’t want to speculate about the next steps in the Russia-Ukraine crisis, but it is clear that the new uncertainty will weigh on business sentiment, dent purchasing power if energy prices continue to increase, and could eventually also, temporarily, subdue business investment. Natural gas prices jumped 7%, despite assurances from the Russian president that Russia will continue to deliver uninterrupted natural gas supplies to world markets. He made the pledge in a letter to an energy conference in Doha. British wholesale gas for next-day delivery rose 7% to 183p per therm this morning. The United States and its European allies are set to announce fresh sanctions on Russia today, after Vladimir Putin ordered Russian troops to march into eastern Ukraine. Fears of supply disruption have sent London-traded metal prices surging. Aluminium hit a more than 13-year high of $3,350 a tonne while benchmark nickel prices reached the highest level since August 2011. Oil prices are trading at seven-year highs and Brent crude is fast approaching $100 a barrel. The global benchmark has jumped 3.8% to $99.04 a barrel, the highest since September 2014, while US light crude is 5.2% higher at $95.81 a barrel. Experts are saying that oil could easily go through $100 and push towards $120 a barrel. The last time Brent was at (and above) $100 a barrel was in early September 2014. Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, said: The intensifying crisis between Russia and Ukraine has raised concerns about the supply disruptions that would ensue as sanctions look set to cripple Russia, the world’s second largest oil exporter and the world’s top natural gas producer. If Putin continues his aggression and the threat of war becomes a reality, oil prices could easily push beyond $100 towards $120 a barrel to fresh highs not seen since 2014. Not only are geopolitical tensions supporting the uptrend but the fundamentals of supercharged demand post COVID coupled by constrained supply from OPEC+ continue to support more bullish price action ahead. London-listed Russian companies have suffered heavy share losses in recent hours. The FTSE 100 steelmaker Evraz, which is incorporated in London but has significant operations in Russia, is among the top fallers on the blue-chip index, trading nearly 4% lower. It is 29% owned by Roman Abramovich, the Russian owner of Chelsea football club. Some 31 Russian companies are listed on the London Stock Exchange. Some which have their primary listing in Moscow have secondary listings in London, to raise money here. They range from state-backed oil and gas producers Rosneft and Gazprom, to state-run banks VTB and Sberbank, to independent mining companies like Norilsk Nickel that have no state ownership. In London, Rosneft shares lost more than 7% this morning and later traded 3.7% lower, while Lukoil lost 6.2%, and Gazprom tumbled 8.1%. VTB Bank lost 9.2% and Sberbank plunged 13%. The mining group Norilsk Nickel fell 3.5%. Neil Shearing, group chief economist at Capital Economics, said: The economic and market consequences of a war between Russia and Ukraine will depend on the severity of the conflict, and the response of the West. But in most cases the economic impact on countries beyond Russia and Ukraine is likely to be limited. The most significant consequence is likely to be that it will add to inflation pressures this year. At the risk of stating the obvious, the biggest economic impact will be on Ukraine. The country’s balance sheet is extremely fragile, and some form of external financial assistance and/or debt restructuring is likely to be needed over the coming months. Depending on the evolution of the conflict, this could be challenging to co-ordinate. The impact on Russia’s economy will depend in large part on the response of Western governments. It’s balance sheet is stronger than at the time of the 2014 Crimea crisis - external debt is lower, and financial linkages with other major advanced economies are smaller. The imposition of sanctions will still have an impact on the economy, but all other things being equal this is likely to be smaller than in 2014-15 (when GDP fell by ~2.5% and the country experienced a financial crisis). Shearing said the biggest impact on other countries is likely to come through commodity prices. In a worst case scenario, we estimate that oil prices could rise to $120-140pb. European natural gas prices are also likely to rise further. Were this to happen, it would add around 2%-pts to headline inflation (relative to our current baseline) in advanced economies this year, with Europe hit particularly hard. In normal times, central banks would tend to look through an energy-led rise in inflation, but given the current high rates of inflation, and corresponding concerns about it feeding higher inflation expectations, it’s possible that this adds to the list of reasons for policymakers to raise interest rates. Finally, while a lot of bad news is now priced into Russian financial markets, this doesn’t appear to be the case elsewhere. Most of the sell-off in global equities this year can be attributed to the hawkish shift by the world’s major central banks. This suggests that there is still significant downside for global stock markets (and upside for safe havens, including US Treasuries) if the conflict escalates. It could also reverse this year’s pattern of European equities outperforming those in the US. Russian stocks have notched up further losses. The dollar-denominated RTS index on the Moscow stock exchange fell as much as 6.4% to its lowest level since November 2020. It is now down 5.2% after yesterday’s 13.2% drop, while the rouble-based MOEX index has lost 4%, following yesterday’s 10.5% decline. Gold, a traditional safe-haven investment, has climbed in recent days and reached $1,910 an ounce, a gain of 0.2%. Silver prices are also up, by more than 1%. However Bitcoin, the world’s best-known digital currency, has fallen 0.4% to $36,913. At the opening bell, the FTSE 100 index in London lost 110 points and is now 1.4% lower at 7,380, a 105 point fall. France’s CAC fell 2.3%, while Germany’s Dax, Spain’s Ibex and Italy’s FTSE MiB all tumbled by 2.5%. The rouble has fallen sharply to 80.8 against the dollar, from levels around 70 four months ago. This is likely to fuel inflation, one of Russians’ main worries, and further drag down living standards. After yesterday’s 3.3% fall, the rouble is down a further 1.2% against the dollar this morning, and went as low as 80.97, a level last seen in March 2020. Against the euro, it has also lost 1.2% to 91.2. Ukraine’s hryvinia currency weakened more than 1% this morning, slipping to 28.9 against the dollar. It has lost about 6.5% since the start of the year as investors have pulled money out of the country. Russian bonds have also sold off, sending their yields soaring. Yields (the return to an investor from the bond’s coupon, or interest, payments) on Russia’s 10-year benchmark OFZ bonds hit 10.79% this morning. The cost of insuring Russian sovereign debt against default has soared to its highest level since early 2016. Five-year credit default swaps, which are used by investors to hedge against risk, jumped to 327 basis points, according to Reuters and data from IHS Markit –- the first time the 300 basis point threshold has been breached since April 2016. The UK government has recorded the first monthly budget surplus since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, despite a weaker than expected January performance as rising inflation pushed up debt interest costs, reports our economics correspondent Richard Partington. The Office for National Statistics said public sector net borrowing, excluding the nationalised banks, was in surplus of £2.9bn last month – the first net positive month for the public finances since January 2020. Although this was £5.4bn less than borrowed in January 2021, it was still a £7bn smaller surplus than in the same month in 2020 before the onset of Covid-19. City economists had forecast a surplus of £3.5bn. January is typically a net positive month for the public finances due to the timing of self-assessed income tax payments. Hinting at tough measures in the forthcoming budget next month, Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, said: We provided unprecedented support throughout the pandemic to protect families and businesses and it has worked, with the UK seeing the fastest economic growth in the G7 last year. But our debt has increased substantially and there are further pressures on the public finances, including from rising inflation. Keeping the public finances on a sustainable path is crucial so we can continue helping the British people when needed, without burdening future generations with high debt repayments. National insurance is set to go up in April. British health secretary Sajid Javid said Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has already begun so Britain will impose sanctions on Russia. Reuters reported that tanks and other military vehicles have moved through the separatist-controlled city of Donetsk after Putin formally recognised two breakaway regions as independent states, and ordered the deployment of Russian forces to “keep the peace”. Speaking on Sky News, Javid said: You can conclude that the invasion of Ukraine has begun. The Russians, President Putin, has decided to attack the sovereignty of Ukraine and its territorial integrity. Boris Johnson is due to address parliament on Ukraine later today. Javid said sanctions would be announced in the statement to parliament. I’m sure that we’ll make those sanctions as targeted as possible to the people that are responsible for this flagrant violation of international law. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The deepening Ukraine crisis has sent global stocks tumbling and crude oil surging. Last night, Russian president Vladimir Putin ordered his military to enter the Russian-controlled areas of southeast Ukraine. In a lengthy televised address, he had recognised the territories of Donetsk and Luhansk as independent states. Washington, European and other countries have condemned the move and threatened to impose tough sanctions. Boris Johnson is chairing a meeting of the UK’s emergency Cobra committee this morning to sign off a package of sanctions against Russia. The initial signs were that the package would target “those complicit in the violation of Ukraine’s territorial integrity”. You can read more on our Ukraine crisis live blog. Financial markets are in for a torrid day. In Asia, Japan’s Nikkei lost 1.7%, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng tumbled 2.9%, the Shanghai Composite Index fell just over 1% and South Korea’s Kospi dropped 1.35%. European and US markets are also braced for heavy losses at the opening bell. On oil markets, Brent crude is marching towards $100 a barrel amid supply fears. It has gained more than $2, or 2.2%, to $97.51 a barrel while US light crude has jumped $3.60 to $94.67 a barrel, a gain of nearly 4%. Viktor Szabo, an emerging market portfolio manager at abrdn in London, told Reuters last night: It is probably an understatement to say that it will be an ugly day [on the markets]. I was hoping we weren’t going to get here, but this is a significant step. Russian markets were still trading when Putin announced his decision live on television following phone calls to the leaders of Germany and France. The rouble dropped 3.3%, falling past 80 against the dollar, while Moscow’s stock markets plummeted to their lowest level in over a year. The dollar-denominated RTS index ended the day 13.2% lower while the rouble-based MOEX Russian index lost 10.5%.

The environmental organisation is calling for parts of the energy charter treaty (ECT) to be scrapped to prevent fossil fuel companies from using the multilateral agreement to take governments to court over green policies. The group has warned that unless the ECT undergoes a fundamental overhaul in talks this week, it risks undermining the European green new deal, which is to be unveiled on Wednesday by Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European commission. The ECT was set up after the end of the cold war to protect western energy companies as they started to invest in former Soviet states. However, energy companies are increasingly using the treaty to challenge governments’ new climate policies. The ECT would also threaten a Labour government’s plans to nationalise large parts of the energy industry that are owned by foreign companies covered by the treaty. City lawyers have said Labour’s plan to pay a discount to nationalise foreign-owned energy networks and the big six energy suppliers would run the risk of a legal battle in European tribunals. Paul de Clerck, the economic justice coordinator at Friends of the Earth Europe, said the treaty was outdated and “a boon to dirty fossil fuel companies”. “As soon as people hear about this obscure pact undermining the public interest and the fight against climate change, they will be outraged. Either the EU and member states fundamentally revise it, or pull out,” he said. Friends of the Earth Europe is one of 260 civil society organisations and trade unions that have warned the ECT is incompatible with climate action because it contains measures to protect energy investments even where they contradict climate goals. The environmental groups say the treaty is being used by large fossil fuel companies to to take national governments to court over decisions to phase out dirty energy. The German government became embroiled in a legal battle with the Swedish utility company Vattenfall over Berlin’s decision to halt nuclear power generation in the wake of the Fukushima disaster. The Dutch government may also be taken to court by the German fossil fuel company Uniper if it moves ahead with plans to phase out coal-fired power generation by 2030. Freek Bersch, a campaigner for Friends of the Earth Netherlands, said the ECT has already played a part in slowing down the Dutch coal phase-out because of “fear of high claims, like from Uniper”. A spokesman for Labour said last month that the party has consulted “with a number of lawyers” about the ECT and it was confident that the party would “deliver the changes that the electorate wants”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2020/aug/09/is-this-the-end-for-king-coal-in-britain","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2020-08-09T05:31:28Z","webTitle":"Is this the end for ‘king coal’ in Britain?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/aug/09/is-this-the-end-for-king-coal-in-britain","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2020/aug/09/is-this-the-end-for-king-coal-in-britain","fields":{"headline":"Is this the end for ‘king coal’ in Britain?","bodyText":"Britain achieved an unlikely status as a power provider last year. Its annual consumption of coal plunged to the lowest level in 250 years. According to figures released last week, a mere 8 million tonnes were incinerated in UK factories and power plants. That is roughly the same amount that was burned nationally in 1769, when James Watt was patenting his modified steam engine. That invention helped to spark the Industrial Revolution and triggered a massive rise in annual coal use in Britain, which soared to well over 200 million tonnes by the mid-20th century. Now levels have plummeted back to their original pre-revolution state. King coal – once the undisputed ruler of British industry – has finally been dethroned. It has been an extraordinary transformation. Britain evolved into a world power thanks to its use of coal. It was the first western nation to mine it and burn it on a large scale, and it was the first to fill its cities with polluted smog, factories and power plants as a result. Coal runs along a deep, dark vein through British history. “For centuries, Britain led the world in coal production,” says Barbara Freese in her book about the dark stuff, Coal: A Human History. “It triggered the Industrial Revolution and created an industrial society the likes of which the world had never seen.” Or, as George Orwell put it in his 1937 essay, Down the Mine: “Civilisation … is founded on coal. The machines that keep us alive, and the machines that make machines, are all directly or indirectly dependent upon coal.” That was then, of course. Today, coal has long lost its lustre, to say the least. Its name evokes images of grimy poverty while its links to deadly air pollution, and its role in the dangerous overheating of our climate, have made it an increasingly unpopular source of energy in the UK. It provided Britain with enormous power but at an exorbitant cost in terms of pollution and the diseases – asthma, cancer, and heart and lung ailments – that emerged in its wake. Other countries – Germany, Poland, China among them – still burn coal in significant quantities. But the nation that first took advantage of it, and which built an empire using the industrial might it conferred, has now emphatically turned its back on coal. “Coal use in the UK had been declining for some time but over the past few years it has dropped like a stone,” says Simon Evans of Carbon Brief, the climate change website. “Clean air acts, the end of steam trains, the rise of North Sea oil and of course increasing awareness of coal’s role in raising temperatures in the atmosphere have all played a part. “However, the rate at which we have abandoned the use of coal over the past five years has been extraordinary,” adds Evans, whose analysis of coal use for Carbon Brief last week revealed its return to 18th-century levels. “In 2014, we used 84 million tonnes of coal. In 2019 that was down to 8 million tonnes. That is a drop of 84% in coal use in five years, and that is astonishing.” This meant only a handful of power plants still burned coal in the UK, and all of them were destined for closure in the next few years, he added. Coal beds were laid down between 290 and 360 million years ago in a geological age known as the Carboniferous period, a name – coined by English geologists William Conybeare and William Phillips in 1822 – that simply means “coal-bearing”. During the Carboniferous period, plants covered the landscape, and when they died they formed layers of organic material in oxygen-poor swamps. First they were converted into peat, and then, after millions of years of deep burial, into coal, a combustible black rock containing traces of hydrogen, sulphur, oxygen and nitrogen. Coal was burned in hearths and fireplaces in Roman times but it was not fully exploited until the 18th century, when improvements to the technology of steam engines saw them replace waterwheels, windmills and horses as the nation’s main providers of power. These refinements culminated in Watt’s invention of the separate condenser, which transformed the efficiency of steam engines and led to their widespread use in textile mills, mines and dozens of other heavy industries. Thousands of steam engines – all powered by burning coal – were installed across the country within a few years. In the early 19th century, steam engines were further developed and used to transport goods and humans. Railways spread across the nation. Then, in 1882, Holborn viaduct power station, the world’s first coal-fired power plant, began to generate electricity for public use in London. Other cities followed suit. Coal was beginning to embed itself in the fabric of British life. Over the years, coal continued to strengthen its grip on Britain, dampened only by disruptions such as miners’ strikes or the great depression, until, by the 1950s, the UK was utterly reliant on it for its energy and heating. Britons burned it in grates to heat their homes, shovelled it into the furnaces of huge generating plants to make electricity, made steel with it and used it as the fuel to run the nation’s railways – just as it had done for the previous 100 years. But change was in the air. Yellow smog generated by coal fires hung over cities in increasingly thick blankets. This culminated in the great smog of London that enveloped the city for five days in December 1952, bringing life in the capital to a standstill while killing thousands from bronchitis, pneumonia and other respiratory illnesses in the process. The Clean Air Act of 1956 was a direct response to the great smog. It encouraged householders to use other fuels – gas, electricity or less-polluting solid fuels – to heat their homes and stop using coal. Ironically, coal use reached around 210 million tonnes that year, its peak consumption over the past two centuries. That was also the year the UK established the world’s first civil nuclear programme, opening a nuclear power station at Windscale, in Cumbria. It would be downhill for Britain’s black gold from then on. Next came the railways. In the 1960s, diesel and electric trains were introduced on the simple grounds that they were more efficient and far cleaner to operate. The end for steam came on 11 August in 1968, when the last mainline passenger train to be hauled by steam locomotive power left on an excursion from Liverpool to Carlisle and back. Slowly, the need to burn coal to run British industry was being scaled down. The next watershed occurred in 1984, with the strike that brought defeat for the National Union of Mineworkers and triggered a series of widespread colliery closures across the country. Then the UK electricity industry was privatised in the early 1990s, and the “dash for gas” began. Regulations limiting the burning of gas to make electricity were relaxed, and dozens of new power plants were built to turn North Sea gas into electricity, raising its share of UK electricity capacity from 5% to around 30%. And finally, there has been the recent, extraordinary growth in renewable energy plants, including vast offshore windfarms, that now provide 37% of our electricity. They have provided the final, fatal blow to coal burning in this country, after 250 years. “The challenge for the next few years is to get rid of coal completely, and then after that it will be to reduce the amount of gas that’s burned to make electricity in generators,” said Professor Keith Bell of the University of Strathclyde, co-director of the UK Energy Research Centre. “We should look at last year as marking the beginning of the end for fossil fuels as sources of energy for electricity generation, and not before time.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2020/mar/15/writers-join-campaign-to-save-derek-jarmans-cottage","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2020-03-15T08:43:52Z","webTitle":"‘It’s not just a cottage, it’s a shrine.’ Writers join bid to save Derek Jarman’s last home","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/15/writers-join-campaign-to-save-derek-jarmans-cottage","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2020/mar/15/writers-join-campaign-to-save-derek-jarmans-cottage","fields":{"headline":"‘It’s not just a cottage, it’s a shrine.’ Writers join bid to save Derek Jarman’s last home","bodyText":"With just two weeks to go until its fate is decided, leading artists have waded into the campaign to save for the nation a fisherman’s shack on a bleak strip of coastline a stone’s throw from a nuclear power station. Prospect Cottage in Dungeness, Kent, was the home of the filmmaker, artist and writer Derek Jarman, and has become a place of pilgrimage for those drawn to its stark beauty and enchanting shingle garden. But the cottage will be sold to a private buyer unless £3.5m can be found by 31 March. It is being sold after the death in 2018 of Keith Collins, Jarman’s partner, to whom he left the cottage. A crowdfunding campaign launched in January and spearheaded by the charity Art Fund, has raised more than £2,750,000. At the launch of the fund, actress Tilda Swinton, Jarman’s close friend and collaborator, said: “First and foremost, the cottage was always a living thing, a practical toolbox for his work.” Last week, costume designer Sandy Powell auctioned the cream suit she wore to the Oscars, which has been signed by 300 Hollywood stars, for £16,000. But with £750,000 still to find, there are concerns the target may be missed, a scenario that has dismayed Jarman’s many fans. “To me, Prospect Cottage was another manifestation of his visionary, Blakean self,” said the actor Simon Callow. “In its sparseness and formality, he was showing us the world in a grain of sand, holding infinity in the palm of his hand. It’s the sort of creation that a 17th-century radical, a leveller or a digger, a ranter or a muggletonian might have made – a vision of a better world, which was always on Derek’s mind, even as the molten lava of his rage at the fuck-up of a world made by other people erupted. I guess Prospect was his sanity, his lodestone in a frequently appalling world.” The author Philip Hoare, who is curator of Queer Nature, a forthcoming exhibition of Jarman’s Prospect Cottage work at the John Hansard Gallery in Southampton, said the cottage could be considered Jarman’s greatest work and described it as a “tarry wonder-miracle”. “It looks like an overgrown garden shed, till you step inside and realise what a queer Tardis it is – a little bit of the Renaissance dropped into the Dungeness desert, as dark as the backrooms of Heaven, glittering like one of his film sets,” he said. Jarman, who died of an Aids-related illness in 1994, drew strength from his garden: his diary was published as Modern Nature in 1991. “I first read Modern Nature when I was a teenager and was bewitched by his account of making a garden in the face of his own oncoming death,” said novelist Olivia Laing . “We never think of Jarman as a nature writer, but to my mind he’s the best, not least because he understands nature is inseparable from politics and that it includes sex. He’s funny and erudite, knowledgeable about old roses and medieval history, but also bursting with gossip and capable of conveying instances of sublime, dreamlike beauty.“ “One of the things I find most inspiring about him is that he refuses boundaries. He didn’t want to be confined by any single discipline, leaping between styles and subjects in a way that feels radical even now. I wish he was still here, but his house and garden remain, an emblem of his life, a site of experiment and openness and restless creativity. As a writer I feel very strongly that we need Derek’s energy in the world right now. Prospect Cottage must be saved.” The novelist Alan Hollinghurst, who went to the same school, Canford, as Jarman, who was 10 years older than him, recalled “this glamorous old boy who hated the school” and described Prospect Cottage as having an aura. “It’s long had a shrine-like atmosphere, in a strange quasi-religious way. Jarman was perpetually indulgent.It has a much bigger meaning than merely itself – a sort of countercultural shrine. It would be a terrible loss.” The £3.5m would preserve and secure the upkeep of the cottage and garden. In addition, Jarman’s cottage archive, including his sketchbooks and garden plans, would be made available to the public. A residency programme for artists, writers, gardeners, filmmakers and academics would also be established. “More than 5,000 people have so far generously donated,” said Stephen Deuchar, director of Art Fund. “We need one last big push, and earnestly welcome donations both large and small.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/live/2022/sep/29/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-pressure-grows-to-declare-russia-terrorist-state-norway-beefs-up-security-at-gas-sites","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-29T18:00:13Z","webTitle":"UN chief warns Putin that annexing Ukraine territory is a ‘dangerous escalation’ with ‘no legal value’ – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/sep/29/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-pressure-grows-to-declare-russia-terrorist-state-norway-beefs-up-security-at-gas-sites","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/sep/29/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-pressure-grows-to-declare-russia-terrorist-state-norway-beefs-up-security-at-gas-sites","fields":{"headline":"UN chief warns Putin that annexing Ukraine territory is a ‘dangerous escalation’ with ‘no legal value’ – as it happened","bodyText":"It’s 9pm in Kyiv. That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, and the Russia-Ukraine war live blog today. Here’s where we stand: Russian forces may face “imminent defeat” in the key north-eastern city of Lyman as Ukrainian soldiers continue their counteroffensive in the east of the country, according to a US thinktank. The Institute for the Study of War, citing Russian reports, said the defeat would allow Ukrainian troops to “threaten Russian positions along the western Luhansk” region. Alexander Petrikin, the pro-Russian head of the city administration, admitted the situation has grown “difficult” for Russian forces trying to hold the territory. Ukrainian forces have secured all of Kupiansk and driven Russian troops from their remaining positions on the east bank of the river that divides the north-eastern Ukrainian city. Most of Kupiansk, a strategic railway junction, was recaptured earlier this month as part of a stunning counteroffensive by Ukrainian troops in the north-east of the country. AFP reports that those Russian troops who held out on the east bank of the Oskil river have been driven out. Vladimir Putin will sign treaties on Friday annexing territories in occupied Ukraine, the Kremlin has said. The Russian president is expected to sign into law the annexations of the Ukrainian regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, where Russia held fake referendums over the last week in order to claim a mandate for the territorial claims, in a major escalation of Russia’s seven-month-old war. The UN’s secretary general, António Guterres, has warned Russia that annexing Ukrainian regions would mark a “dangerous escalation” that would jeopardise the prospects for peace in the region. Any decision to proceed with the annexation of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions of Ukraine “would have no legal value and deserves to be condemned”, Guterres told reporters. There are indications that Russia might limit the movement of Ukrainians living in the occupied territories after it announces their annexation. Ukrainians have been told that from Saturday they will need to apply for a pass from the occupying authorities. This comes as the exiled Luhansk regional governor, Serhiy Haidai, said Russia had prevented about 1,000 Ukrainians from crossing the border into Latvia. Finland is closing its border to Russian tourists after Vladimir Putin’s partial mobilisation order prompted large numbers of people to flee the country. From midnight Finnish time (9pm GMT), Russian tourists holding an EU Schengen visa will be turned away unless they have a family tie or a compelling reason to travel. More than half of Russians felt fearful or anxious after President Vladimir Putin’s mobilisation announcement, according to a new poll. The poll by the independent Levada Centre showed 47% of respondents said they had felt anxiety, fear or dread after hearing that hundreds of thousands of soldiers would be drafted to fight in Ukraine. Sabotage is the most likely cause of leaks in two Baltic Sea gas pipelines between Russia and Europe, European leaders have said, after seismologists reported explosions around the Nord Stream pipelines. Suspicion immediately turned to potential culprits – with fingers pointed at Russia, whose pipelines were hit, suggesting a further weaponisation of energy supplies to Europe in the midst of the conflict in Ukraine. Nato vowed a “united and determined response” to what it described as “deliberate, reckless and irresponsible acts of sabotage”. Swedish authorities have reported a fourth leak on one of the two Nord Stream pipelines that EU leaders believe became the subject of sabotage at the start of the week. The two leaks in Swedish waters were close to each other, with one rupture, on Nord Stream 2, causing a circle of bubbles at the surface of about 900 metres in diameter, and the other, coming from a leak in Nord Stream 1, a circle of about 200 metres. Gas is likely to stop leaking from the damaged Nord Stream 1 pipeline on Monday, according to the pipeline’s operator. A spokesperson for Nord Stream AG said it was not possible to provide any forecasts for the pipeline’s future operation until the damage had been assessed. The Kremlin has said incidents on the Nord Stream gas pipelines in the Baltic Sea look like an “act of terrorism”. The Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said a foreign state was probably responsible for the incident, which resulted in leaks at the pipelines linking Russia to Europe. Russia’s foreign ministry claimed the “incident on the Nord Stream occurred in a zone controlled by American intelligence”. The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, announced an eighth package of sanctions, including a draft sanctions law seen by the Guardian designed to “make the Kremlin pay” for the escalation of the war against Ukraine. Hungary “cannot and will not support” energy sanctions in the package, said Gergely Gulyas, the chief of staff to the prime minister, Viktor Orbán. An EU official said an agreement on the next sanctions package is expected before next week’s EU summit, or at least major parts of the package. Russia is escalating its use of Iranian-supplied “kamikaze” drones in southern Ukraine, including against the southern port of Odesa and the nearby city of Mykolaiv. It is estimated that hundreds of weapons may now have been deployed by the Kremlin in Crimea and other occupied areas of the south. Thank you for following along. I’ll be back tomorrow. Ukrainian forces have secured all of Kupiansk and driven Russian troops from their remaining positions on the east bank of the river that divides the north-eastern Ukrainian city, AFP reports. Most of Kupiansk, a strategic railway junction, was recaptured earlier this month as part of a stunning counteroffensive by Ukrainian troops in the north-east of the country. Some Russian troops had held out on the east bank of the Oskil River, across a smashed road bridge. Civilians fled into Ukrainian territory as heavy day and night shelling continued. US prosecutors unsealed criminal sanctions violation charges against Oleg Deripaska, a Russian billionaire who was among two dozen allies of Vladimir Putin blacklisted by Washington over Moscow’s alleged meddling in the 2016 US presidential elections. The indictment filed in Manhattan federal court accused Deripaska of sanctions violations for retaining three female co-defendants who provided or arranged a variety of services for his benefit. Deripaska, 54, could not immediately be reached for comment. “As today’s charges reveal, while serving the Russian state and energy sector, Oleg Deripaska sought to circumvent US sanctions through lies and deceit to cash in on and benefit from the American way of life,” said deputy attorney general Lisa Monaco. But shell companies and webs of lies will not shield Deripaska and his cronies from American law enforcement, nor will they protect others who support the Putin regime. The Department of Justice remains dedicated to the global fight against those who aid and abet the Russian war machine.

Speaking to reporters, Guterres said: Any decision to proceed with the annexation of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions of Ukraine would have no legal value and deserves to be condemned. If Russia moves ahead with its plans to annex four Ukrainian regions, it would “prolong the dramatic impacts on the global economy, especially in developing countries, and hinder our ability to deliver life-saving aid across Ukraine and beyond”, Guterres added. Preparations are under way for tomorrow’s ceremony in Moscow where President Vladimir Putin will sign a decree to formally annex four occupied regions of Ukraine. The Russian capital’s Red Square has been sealed off ahead of the ceremony, which is due to take place at the Kremlin’s St George’s Hall tomorrow afternoon. Italians living in Russia should consider leaving the country, the Italian embassy in Russia has said. Italian expatriates in Russia “are recommended to consider whether their stay is necessary, and if not, to leave the country”, the embassy said in a statement, warning that getting out was becoming increasingly difficult. It also noted the “dizzying increase in the already high cost” of flights out of Russia, and reported long queues at border crossings with some neighbouring countries. Here’s more on Vladimir Putin’s accusation that the west is ready to provoke “colour revolutions” and a “bloodbath” in any country. The Russian leader was speaking in a televised meeting with intelligence chiefs of former Soviet countries, where he said conflicts in countries of the former USSR, including Ukraine, were the result of the collapse of the Soviet Union. Putin said: It is enough to look at what is happening now between Russia and Ukraine, and at what is happening on the borders of some other CIS countries. All this, of course, is the result of the collapse of the Soviet Union. The region has recently seen clashes between the two Central Asian countries of Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, and fighting between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Putin pointed fingers at the west, saying it was “working on scenarios to fuel new conflicts” in the post-Soviet space. More than half of Russians felt fearful or anxious after President Vladimir Putin’s mobilisation announcement, according to a new poll. The poll by the independent Levada Centre, conducted from 22-28 September, showed 47% of respondents said they had felt anxiety, fear or dread after hearing that hundreds of thousands of soldiers would be drafted to fight in Ukraine. Another 13% said they had felt anger, while 23% said they had felt pride in Russia. Billboards are popping up across Moscow paying tribute to the “heroes of Russia” amid Vladimir Putin’s mobilisation order. From the BBC’s Will Vernon: When Ilya returned from work on Wednesday, his wife was waiting for him with his military draft papers. Ilya said he quickly packed his bags and left the next morning for his local recruitment centre in Irkutsk, a city on Lake Baikal in Siberia. “When the motherland comes calling, you have to answer,” the 27-year-old bus driver said in a brief phone interview from a training ground near the southern city of Rostov. I decided that I am not going to dodge the draft and will defend the country. Vladimir Putin’s mobilisation order has triggered a run for the borders by tens of thousands of men of fighting age who are unwilling to participate in Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. But, contrasting starkly with the mile-long lines to get out, videos show men across the country, to the applause of their wives and mothers, boarding buses that will take them to training centres, in what is likely to be a one-way journey for many. The men are evidence of some public backing for the war on Ukraine and of the growing polarisation in the country, said Denis Volkov, of the Levada Centre, an independent polling agency. “The nation has split, and mobilisation has further exacerbated existing divisions,” Volkov said. The western-oriented, more modern, urban segment of the population wants to leave and is against the draft. But there is still a large core of men that will not avoid the draft. They are often less educated, poorer and more reliant on the state. Read the full story here: Here’s more on the Ukrainian advance towards the occupied city of Lyman in the eastern Donetsk region. The situation has grown “difficult” for Russian forces trying to hold the territory, according to the Russian-backed leader of the city. In a video update, Alexander Petrikin, the pro-Russian head of the city administration, said: Today, September 29. The situation in the city is difficult. Ukrainian militants keep shelling Krasny Liman [Lyman in Ukrainian] and Krasny Liman district. Russian forces may face “imminent defeat” in the key north-eastern city of Lyman as Ukrainian soldiers continue their counteroffensive in the east of the country, according to a US thinktank. The Institute for the Study of War, citing Russian reports, said Ukrainian forces have taken more villages around Lyman, about 100 miles (160km) south-east of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city. Russian military bloggers discussed Ukrainian gains around Lyman “with increased concern” on Wednesday, “suggesting that Russian forces in this area may face imminent defeat”, it said. Russian forces captured Lyman, a key railway juncture, in May. The institute said a possible collapse of the Lyman pocket would allow Ukrainian troops to “threaten Russian positions along the western Luhansk” region. It said: The collapse of the Lyman pocket will likely be highly consequential to the Russian grouping in northern Donetsk and western Luhansk oblasts and may allow Ukrainian troops to threaten Russian positions along the western Luhansk oblast border and in the Severodonetsk-Lysychansk area. Additional Russian losses would further erode morale amid the country’s mobilisation, the institute said. It added that Russian authorities continue to send “newly mobilised and undertrained” recruits to reinforce “severely degraded remnants of various units”. These units include ones that were previously considered to be Russia’s most superior fighting forces, it said. Vladimir Putin has accused the west of being ready to provoke “colour revolutions” and a “bloodbath” in any country. The Russian president, who did not name a specific country or provide any evidence, was speaking via video link with the heads of the intelligent services of the ex-Soviet Commonwealth of Independent States.

The head of Ukraine’s presidential administration, Andriy Yermak, has said six Ukrainians have been exchanged in a prisoner swap. The six included two civilians who were arrested and taken to Russia because of content on their phones, and four Ukrainian soldiers who fought in Mariupol. They have been returned to Ukraine. Russia is escalating its use of Iranian-supplied “kamikaze” drones in southern Ukraine, including against the southern port of Odesa and the nearby city of Mykolaiv. It is estimated that hundreds of weapons may now have been deployed by the Kremlin in Crimea and other occupied areas of the south. A report drawn up by an international working group on sanctions concluded Russia should now be declared a “state sponsor of terrorism”. The head of the office of the Ukrainian presidency, Andriy Yermak, called for sweeping American and European sanctions targeting Moscow. Hello everyone, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong still with you to bring you all the latest developments from Ukraine. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. Russia’s RIA Novosti news agency is reporting that a drone was dropped on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant by Ukrainian forces, but there was no significant damage. It quoted Yevhen Balitsky, the head of the Russian-imposed authority in occupied Zaporizhzhia, saying: The hit is not in the reactor itself, nothing threatens the reactor. We are talking about auxiliary infrastructure. The firefighters have left, they are now finishing the extinguishing. I was informed that the issue does not pose a great danger in terms of nuclear threat. Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s spokesperson Sergii Nykyforov has said on Facebook that Ukraine’s president has called an emergency meeting. He posted: President Volodymyr Zelenskiy convenes an urgent meeting of the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine tomorrow. Agenda and other details will be announced later. Finland is closing its border to Russian tourists after Vladimir Putin’s partial mobilisation order prompted large numbers of people to flee the country. From midnight Finnish time (9pm GMT), Russian tourists holding an EU Schengen visa will be turned away unless they have a family tie or compelling reason to stay. Matti Pitkäniitty, the head of the international affairs unit at the Finnish border guard, said each passenger seeking to enter Finland from Russia would be asked: “Why are you entering Finland? Do you have some kind of valid reason: family members? study? some business that must be handled at the moment?” … And if not, then the entry is refused.” Entry will also be permitted for humanitarian reasons, such as patients with an established relationship with Finnish doctors. In an interview with the Guardian, he said the restrictions were necessary because entry for Russians with Schengen visas was harming Finland’s international reputation and undermining its support for Ukraine. In this situation where we have Russia attacking Ukraine and Ukrainians don’t have a possibility to go abroad and have a nice meal and enjoy life. So the big dilemma is why can Russians [do this]? For at least two decades, middle-class Russians from St Petersburg have been frequent travellers to Finland, using fast roads to go shopping and enjoy other leisure activities. Since the invasion of Ukraine and subsequent EU ban on flights to and from Russia, Russians have also used Finland as a transit country to reach other European destinations. Russians will be allowed to claim asylum in Finland, a process that may require them to stay in state accommodation and restrict their freedom of movement, Pitkäniitty said. In a question and answer document about the scheme, the Finnish government acknowledged that “it will become more difficult for people” seeking asylum and said it was studying the introduction of a humanitarian visa. Under EU law, the Finnish government can prevent entry to non-EU citizens if it perceives “a threat to international relations”. “The government has concluded that tourism from Russia to Finland is a threat to Finland’s international relations,” a government document states. Separately, Finnish authorities announced this week they were moving ahead with plans to build a fence along the southern parts of its 1,340km (830 mile) border with Russia. Pitkäniitty said the fence – likely to be constructed from metal, topped with barbed wire and lined with surveillance equipment – would be built along 130km to 260km of the shared border. The plans, agreed in July, predate the Russian mobilisation and were a response to growing “instrumentalisation of migration”, he said. Finnish officials believe their fenceless border is a vulnerability, after observing how Belarus’s authoritarian government lured migrants from the Middle East to EU borders in Poland and Lithuania, in apparent retaliation against EU sanctions against Minsk. “The fact that we don’t have any fencing at the border may become a pull factor,” Pitkäniitty said. Gas is likely to stop leaking from the damaged Nord Stream 1 pipeline on Monday, according to the pipeline’s operator. It was not possible to provide any forecasts for the pipeline’s future operation until the damage had been assessed, a spokesperson for Nord Stream AG told Reuters. The company said it would only be able to carry out such an assessment once it had been able to reach the area. A spokesperson said: Until there are some results from an assessment of the damage, no forecasts can be made. The damage assessment can be carried out on the spot as soon as we manage to approach the area. At the moment it is a restricted zone. On state TV channel Russia 24, a countdown clock to President Vladimir Putin’s annexation of four territories from Ukraine features prominently on the screen. From BBC Monitoring’s Russia specialist, Francis Scarr: Germans have been urged to save gas regardless of chilly weather after figures showed above-average energy usage, despite repeated pleas for restraint. Klaus Mueller, head of Germany’s top energy regulator, said in a statement: Without significant reductions, including in private households, it will be difficult to avoid a gas shortage this winter. A reduction of at least 20% in energy usage is needed to avoid shortages, the agency said. Mueller added: Gas must be saved, even if it gets even colder towards winter. This will depend on each and every one of us. The head of Ukraine’s presidential administration, Andriy Yermak, has said six Ukrainians have been exchanged in a prisoner swap. The six included two civilians, who were arrested and taken to Russia because of the content on their phones, and four Ukrainian soldiers, who fought in Mariupol. They have been returned to Ukraine. “Negotiations are difficult work, and the best reward for it is the freedom of Ukrainians,” wrote Yermak on Telegram. The Kremlin has said that incidents on the Nord Stream gas pipelines in the Baltic Sea look like an “act of terrorism”. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said a foreign state was probably responsible for the incident which resulted in leaks at the pipelines linking Russia to Europe. In his daily press briefing, Peskov said: It’s very difficult to imagine that such a terrorist act could happen without the involvement of a state. His remarks came after the Swedish coastguard reported it had discovered a fourth gas leak on the damaged Nord Stream pipelines. Peskov added: This is an extremely dangerous situation that requires urgent investigation. He said such an investigation “required the cooperation of several countries” but denounced an “acute shortage of communications and unwillingness of many countries to contact” Russia. Meanwhile, Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, called for an international investigation into the incident to be “objective”. Swedish authorities have reported a fourth leak on one of the two Nord Stream pipelines that EU leaders believe became the subject of sabotage at the start of the week. The two leaks in Swedish waters were close to each other, “in the same sector”, a coastguard officer told Svenska Dagbladet newspaper. Dagens Nyheter reported that one rupture, on Nord Stream 2, was causing a circle of bubbles at the surface of about 900 metres in diameter and the other, coming from a leak in Nord Stream 1, a circle of about 200 metres. There are indications that Russia might limit the movement of Ukrainians living in the occupied territories after it announces their annexation. Ukrainians writing on a Telegram group for people leaving the occupied territories have been told that from Saturday, 1 October, they will need to apply for a pass from the occupying authorities. Those crossing have reported queues hundreds of cars long, waiting to enter Ukraine through the only official checkpoint for civilians located in the Zaporizhzhia region. This comes as the exiled Luhansk regional governor, Serhiy Haidai, said on Thursday that Russia has prevented about 1,000 Ukrainians from crossing the border into Latvia. Haidai wrote on Telegram that the people had travelled from Russian-occupied Ukraine through Russia. Earlier this week, the NGO Helping to Leave, which helps evacuate Ukrainians from the occupied areas, also reported that Ukrainians attempting to cross into the European Union from Russia had been stopped by the Russian security services. Nato has said leaks from the Nord Stream gas pipelines appeared to be “deliberate acts of sabotage” and vowed a “united and determined response” to any attacks on their critical infrastructure. In a statement, the alliance said: All currently available information indicates that this is the result of deliberate, reckless, and irresponsible acts of sabotage. These leaks are causing risks to shipping and substantial environmental damage. We support the investigations underway to determine the origin of the damage. The alliance was “committed to prepare for, deter and defend against the coercive use of energy and other hybrid tactics”, the statement continued. Any deliberate attack against Allies’ critical infrastructure would be met with a united and determined response Finland’s border guard force has confirmed that it will shut its border to Russian tourists from midnight local time, announced by the government earlier today. The inflow of Russians is now seen as endangering Finland’s international relations, foreign minister Pekka Haavisto told reporters. Hungary will not support the EU’s proposed new round of sanctions against Russia if they include energy sanctions, a government official has said. The EU executive proposed on Wednesday an eighth round of sanctions against Russia, including capping the price of Russian oil and imposing further curbs on hi-tech trade. The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said the new sanctions were designed to “make the Kremlin pay” for the escalation of the war against Ukraine. She promised the EU would introduce a price cap on Russian oil to “help reduce Russian revenues and keep the global market stable”. Gergely Gulyas, chief of staff to Hungary’s prime minister Viktor Orbán, told a briefing: Hungary has done a lot already to maintain European unity but if there are energy sanctions in the package, then we cannot and will not support it. We are waiting for a final, full list of sanctions and then we can negotiate about it. Hungary cannot support energy sanctions. From makeup and cigars, to washing machines and toilet paper, the list of goods affected by European Union sanctions against Russia is about to get a lot longer. Items targeted for export or import bans are listed in a draft sanctions law seen by the Guardian, following the announcement of headline measures by the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, on Wednesday. The EU executive has proposed capping the price of Russian oil and imposing further curbs on hi-tech trade, as part of its eighth round of sanctions to “make the Kremlin pay” for the escalation of the war against Ukraine. Other proposals include a ban on EU nationals serving on the boards of Russian-state companies, a provision that would catch the former German chancellor Gerhard Schröder. Since then further details have emerged of EU goods that will be banned from export to Russia. The commission wants to stop the sale of European appliances, including dishwashers and washing machines, because officials believe the Russian army is raiding such products for their chips, because they have run out of semiconductors. The EU also wants to tighten import curbs on goods generating income for Russia, ranging from wood, pulp and paper, cigarettes and cosmetics. Bags and suitcases, telephones and cars, paper and newsprint, women’s clothes, makeup and shaving products feature on a long list of items subject to trade restrictions that also includes many industrial goods, tools and chemical substances. But a proposal to stop the EU from importing Russian diamonds has come unstuck, a move widely seen as appeasing Belgium, one of the world’s biggest traders of the stones. Belgian diplomats insisted they had no intention to block the inclusion of diamonds, but other member states believe Belgium’s objections meant the stones were removed from the list. The Commission “explains that … it affects one member state, so let’s forget about it,” said a diplomat who was unimpressed by the decision. EU ambassadors will discuss the plans on Friday, with the aim of reaching a quick agreement. The measures must be agreed by unanimity to come into force. Russia is reportedly escalating its use of Iranian-supplied “kamikaze” drones in southern Ukraine, including against the southern port of Odesa and the nearby city of Mykolaiv, amid estimates that hundreds of weapons may now have been deployed by the Kremlin in Crimea and other occupied areas of the south. The drones – also known as loitering munitions – have also been used against Ukrainian artillery positions in the country’s east, including in the Kharkiv region. Britain’s Ministry of Defence first noted the Russian use of the Iranian supplied weapons in mid-September. Able to remain airborne for several hours and circle over potential targets, the drones are designed to be flown into enemy troops, armour or buildings, exploding on impact – explaining their description as kamikaze drones. On Tuesday Ukrainian armed forces said they had successfully shot down three more Iranian suicide drones that attacked Mykolaiv region. A day before Ukraine’s air force spokesperson Yuriy Ihnat suggested Iran may have supplied “several hundred” of the weapons to Russia. Read the full story here: Vladimir Putin’s decision to formally incorporate Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine marks the largest forcible annexation in Europe since the second world war, the Economist’s Shashank Joshi writes. The total area set to become de facto part of Russia amounts to more than 90,000 square km, or about 15% of Ukraine’s total area – equal to the size of Hungary or Portugal. Finland will close its border to Russian tourists from midnight local time (2100 GMT), the Finnish government has announced. The announcement by Finland’s foreign minister Pekka Haavisto comes after Vladimir Putin’s decision to order a mobilisation prompted a flood of Russians to flee the country. The move is expected to lead to a significant drop in cross-border traffic, Haavisto told a news conference. Entry for family visits, as well as for work and studies, will still be permitted, he added. Here’s more from the Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, who has announced that President Vladimir Putin will hold a signing ceremony tomorrow to add four territories of Ukraine into Russia. A signing ceremony will take place at 3pm Moscow-time (1200 GMT) on Friday “on agreements on the accession of new territories into the Russian Federation”, Peskov said. Agreements will be signed “with all four territories that held referendums and made corresponding requests to the Russian side,” Peskov said. The total area set to become de facto part of Russia amounts to about 15% of Ukraine and includes an estimated 4 million people. The so-called referendums in the occupied regions of Ukraine have been denounced by the west as illegal and illegitimate. Following the signing ceremonies in the Kremlin, Putin will give a major speech and will meet with Moscow-appointed administrators of the Ukrainian regions, the Kremlin said. The Kremlin’s announcement that Russia will formally annex four more areas of Ukraine comes after so-called referendums in those occupied regions that have already been denounced by Kyiv and the west. Once annexed, Russia’s leadership has said it will consider attacks on the Russian-controlled areas a direct attack on Russia. Announcing the so-called referendums in the Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson regions of Ukraine last week, Vladimir Putin threatened to respond with nuclear weapons if Russia’s national security was threatened. The so-called referendums, held over four days in the Russian-occupied regions, concluded on Tuesday and, as predicted, the results reported by Russian state media showed overwhelming support for joining Russia. Residents who escaped to Ukrainian-held areas in recent days have told of people being forced to mark ballots in the street at gunpoint. Footage on social media shows Russian-installed officials taking ballot boxes from house to house with armed men in tow. On Wednesday, the Russian-installed administrations of the four Ukrainian provinces formally asked Putin to incorporate them into Russia. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has described them as “an imitation of referendums” and vowed to “defend” Ukrainian citizens in Russian-occupied regions. Vladimir Putin will sign a decree annexing four occupied regions in Ukraine tomorrow, the Kremlin has announced. Russian state-owned news agency Tass cites Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, as saying that the ceremony of the signing of agreements into the Russian Federation will be held on Friday at 3pm Moscow time. The Russian president will hold a signing ceremony in the Kremlin, after which he is expected to give a major speech and meet with Moscow-appointed administrators of the Ukrainian regions, Peskov said. Hello everyone, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong with you today to bring you all the latest from the Russia-Ukraine war. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. Sweden’s coast guard earlier this week discovered a fourth gas leak on the damaged Nord Stream pipelines, a coast guard spokesperson told the Svenska Dagbladet newspaper. Politicians across Europe have warned that the suspected sabotaging of the two Nord Stream pipelines could herald a new stage of hybrid warfare targeting vulnerable energy infrastructure in order to undermine support of Ukraine. Norway’s prime minister, Jonas Gahr Støre, said his country would step up its military presence at Norwegian installations after the country became Europe’s largest supplier of natural gas. Denmark’s foreign minister, Jeppe Kofod, has said that “intentional” explosions caused the leaks in the Nord Stream pipelines, and that it was an “unprecedented” attack. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, has proposed a fresh round of sanctions on Russia designed “to make the Kremlin pay” for escalating the conflict in Ukraine. The proposed eighth package of “biting” sanctions includes a cap on the price of Russian oil and further curbs on hi-tech trade. An EU official has given a briefing to Reuters saying that an agreement on the next sanctions package against Russia is expected before next week’s EU summit, or at least major parts of the package. On Moscow’s Red Square, giant video screens have been set up, with billboards proclaiming “Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson – Russia!” Russian state Duma deputies have been invited to an event at the Kremlin with Vladimir Putin for 3pm on Friday 30 September. It will possibly be the moment that the Russian president addresses in public the next stage of the inevitable annexation of Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson from occupied Ukraine. The UK ministry of defence has claimed in its latest intelligence briefing that more men have now likely fled conscription from Russia’s partial mobilisation than Russia initially used in its invasion force of Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said overnight Ukraine will “act to protect our people” in Russian-occupied regions after what he described as “an imitation of referendums”. Ukraine’s foreign ministry said Kyiv and its allies “condemn such actions of Russia and consider them null and worthless”. Britain’s prime minister, Liz Truss, told Zelenskiy in a phone call yesterday that the UK would never recognise Russian attempts to annex parts of Ukraine, Downing Street said. The EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, also denounced the “illegal referenda and their falsified outcome” in Ukraine. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later. Léonie Chao-Fong will be here shortly to continue our coverage. The RIA Novosti news agency in Russia is reporting that “State Duma deputies received an invitation to the Kremlin for an event on 30 September with the participation of Russian President Vladimir Putin”. RIA states that the state duma deputy Denis Parfyonov said the event would start at 3pm Moscow time (1pm BST). There has been considerable speculation about when Putin might respond in public to the so-called results of the “referendums” staged by Russian proxy authorities in occupied Ukraine. Oleksandr Stryuk, mayor of Sievierodonetsk, has posted an update to Telegram with some images claiming to be from Russian attacks overnight on the city of Orikhiv. He said: Private houses suffered numerous destructions. As a result of the shelling, there were fires with a total area of tens of square metres. Firefighters quickly contained the fire. According to available information, there are no victims. Today, the occupier again shelled the city of Huliaipole. Three houses were destroyed. The enemy continues the policy of terror and intimidation. Objects of civil infrastructure are targets every time. The claims have not have been independently verified. Over in Greece the Ukrainian president has been speaking about the importance of democracy in tyrannical times, Helena Smith reports from Athens. Addressing the 10th Athens Democracy Forum, Volodymyr Zelenskiy underlined it was unity that reinforced democracy and unity that would ultimately ensure its success. People feel that right now something is happening that could become decisive in the centuries-old confrontation between democracy and tyranny,” he said as the Forum opened in the Greek capital on Wednesday evening. And it is precisely in this address, precisely to the Athens Democracy Forum, that I want to say that I am sure: we will be able to guarantee the future of democracy, we will be able to protect it. We will, because we know what gives democracy strength, what serves as its heart, ensuring the supply of freedom, like blood, to every part of a democratic society – to every person. This is unity. Unity is the most important thing. Zelenskiy, who was awarded the 2022 City of Athens Democracy prize in the name of the people of Ukraine by the mayor, Kostas Bakoyannis, insisted that the unity the west had shown in the face of Russian brute force was reflected in the setbacks the Russian military had suffered on the battlefield. Continuing his address he said: We see this now in the war that Russia has waged against our people and against our common democratic system. The greater unity we have, the more tangible Russian defeats are. Democracy does not live in the government offices or even in the parliament hall. Democracy lives between people. And that is why it is so important that there are no isolated groups in societies – be it the ruling group, or any other privileged groups, or any unintegrated minorities. After the full-scale invasion of Russia into Ukraine, we managed to achieve the greatest unity of Europe and the democratic community of the whole world in decades. But the greatest does not mean the maximum. We have a lot to do to further strengthen our unity. And every such step to strengthen is a step to protect democracy. Not just somewhere, not just in some country, but in general – for all of us and for our children. For all free nations. Forever free. Greece has stalwartly stood by its Nato and EU allies in opposing Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine despite what were once strong ties with fellow Orthodox Russia. Athens’s stance has infuriated Russia with the two sides exchanging sharp words and anti-Putin graffiti appearing in the Greek capital. Zelenskiy ended his speech thanking the country for its “significant support.” “It is with great honour that I accept the award of the city of Athens for the Ukrainian people, for our people, for their contribution to the protection of democratic values.,” he said. Earlier we reported a brief statement from the Russian foreign ministry that the Nord Stream incident occurred in areas under the control of US intelligence. [See 8.15am] Reuters is now carrying the quote from the foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova. She said: It happened in the trade and economic zones of Denmark and Sweden. They are Nato-centric countries. They are countries that are completely controlled by the US intelligence services. Zakharova offered no evidence for the Danish and Swedish governments being “completely controlled by the US intelligence services”. The Nord Stream incident happened in international waters, and not within the territorial waters of Sweden or Denmark. Sweden is not yet a member of Nato. Here are some of the latest images sent to us from Ukraine over the newswires. An EU official has given a briefing to Reuters saying that an agreement on the next sanctions package against Russia is expected before next week’s EU summit, or at least major parts of the package. The official went on to tell the agency that they expected the summit to focus on the recent “referendums” carried out by proxy-Russian authorities in occupied areas of Ukraine, possible annexations by Russia, Russia’s nuclear threats and the disruption to the Nord Stream pipelines. EU leaders are also expected to discuss different ideas for energy price caps at the summit, which the EU official expects to be a tense one “as we are in difficult times”. Hungary’s Viktor Orbán has already indicated he is unlikely to back another tranche of sanctions, and recently announced a “national consultation” to see if EU sanctions against Russia had the backing of the Hungarian people. Given the tricky nature of pulling off a sabotage attack against the Nord Stream pipelines undetected, most analysts agree that only state actors could have carried it out. Russia has been keen to cast the blame in the direction of the US. This morning the Russian foreign ministry has, according to the RIA Novosti news agency, issued a brief statement saying that the “incident on the Nord Stream occurred in a zone controlled by American intelligence”. Overnight the Russian embassy in the US issued a statement on Telegram again drawing attention to “the promises made by President Biden to ‘bring an end’ to the Nord Stream 2 project”, and saying: We note the attempts by some US legislators to put blame on Russia for the incidents. Perhaps, they have a better view from the top of Capitol Hill. But if that is the case, they must also have seen the US warships’ activities at the very site of the Russian infrastructure disruption just the day before. Or noticed drones and helicopters fly over there. Or observed US navy exercises with underwater explosives that have been conducted in the same area some time ago. What is obvious to us is that those who ponder about the incident seem to forget to ask the main question: who benefits from the pipelines’ rupture? For our part, we insist on the need for a comprehensive and objective examination of the circumstances of the unprecedented attacks on Russian pipelines. Russian sources have repeatedly referenced the words of Joe Biden and his administration earlier this year as the US and Germany threatened that Nord Stream 2 would not be opened if Russia invaded Ukraine. In January the state department spokesperson Ned Price said: “I want to be very clear: if Russia invades Ukraine one way or another, Nord Stream 2 will not move forward. I’m not going to get into the specifics. We will work with Germany to ensure it does not move forward.” Several days later, on 8 February, at a joint press event with the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, Biden said the pipeline project would be ended if Russia put troops on the ground in Ukraine, saying: “If Russia invades, that means tanks or troops crossing the border of Ukraine again, then there will be no longer a Nord Stream 2. We will bring an end to it.” Denmark’s foreign minister, Jeppe Kofod, has said that “intentional” explosions caused the leaks in the Nord Stream pipelines, and that it was an “unprecedented” attack. He told viewers of Sky News in the UK: It’s clear we all need to be very aware of our critical infrastructure, when it comes to energy and other infrastructure, so we all take, I think, the right precautionary steps. Because it is unprecedented, as I’ve said, we haven’t seen that type of attack on infrastructure. Saying that Danish authorities were working closely with their neighbours, Nato and the EU, he added: “We all have to look out for our critical infrastructure.” He went on to tell viewers that it emphasised the need to end dependency on Russian energy, saying: It has been clear for us for a long time in Denmark, and also now for the rest of Europe, that we need to get out of any dependence on Russian energy, whether it’s gas, coal or oil, and we’re working very hard to obtain that objective in Europe. Denmark is doing its part, where we will focus a lot in investing massively in renewable energy, not least the offshore wind and other type of renewables, and also energy efficiency. So that is a course we will not change.” Ed Davey, a former energy minister in the UK and currently leader of the Liberal Democrats, the fourth largest party in the House of Commons, has said he believes it is likely that the Nord Stream pipeline will never reopen. He told viewers of Sky News in an interview that the leaks in the pipelines were “potential Russian terrorism”. He said: I think we should be very concerned. Listening to Polish and Danish ministers they do suspect this was an act of Russian terrorism, and that it’s another threat from the Kremlin to Europe’s energy supplies. But we need to stand bold against Russia supporting Ukraine. And one thing that is some good news is that the pipeline from Norway to Poland that we so long argued for, the so-called Baltic gas pipeline, is going to now open earlier than originally planned. He went on to say: I personally think it’s likely that Nord Stream may never reopen, and therefore the energy policy of Europe, of our country, working with our European colleagues, needs to assume that we need to get off Russian energy as fast as possible. That will be good for our security. It would ultimately calm the markets, and reduce prices for people, reduce people’s bills, and it would help us tackle climate change. This post was amended at 2.55pm on 29 September. It initially said that the Liberal Democrats were “the third largest political party in the UK’s parliament”, and then was amended to say that they were “the fourth largest political party in the UK’s parliament”. The Liberal Democrats are the fourth largest party in the House of Commons. They are the third largest political party by representation in both the House of Commons and the House of Lords. Russian news agency Interfax is reporting another arson attack, citing the military commissar of the Novosibirsk region Evgeny Kudryavtsev. It reports he posted to his Telegram channel: On 29 September at 6.25am an attempt was made to set fire to the military commissariat for the Kirovsky and Leninsky districts of the city of Novosibirsk. Molotov cocktails were thrown into two windows, which caused a fire with an area of 0.5 square metres from the outside, which was promptly eliminated. Vyacheslav Volodin, chair of the Russian state Duma since 2016, has posted a reminder on Telegram that people should not be fleeing Russia to avoid mobilisation, saying: Citizens who are registered with the military, from the moment mobilisation is announced, are prohibited from leaving their place of residence without the permission of the military commissariats. There is such a norm of the law, and all those liable for military service should be guided by it. This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog in London. You can contact me at martin.belam@theguardian.com The UK Ministry of Defence has published its latest analysis on Ukraine. Here are its key points: In the seven days since President Putin announced the ‘partial mobilisation’ there has been a considerable exodus of Russians seeking to evade call-up. Whilst exact numbers are unclear, it likely exceeds the size of the total invasion force Russia fielded in February 2022. The better off and well educated are over-represented amongst those attempting to leave Russia. When combined with those reservists who are being mobilised, the domestic economic impact of reduced availability of labour and the acceleration of ‘brain drain’ is likely to become increasingly significant. Sweden’s coast guard earlier this week discovered a fourth gas leak on the damaged Nord Stream pipelines, a coast guard spokesperson told the Svenska Dagbladet newspaper. “Two of these four are in Sweden’s exclusive economic zone,” the spokesperson, Jenny Larsson, told the newspaper. The two other holes are in the Danish exclusive economic zone, according to a translation of the report published by Reuters. The European Union suspects sabotage was behind the gas leaks on the subsea Russian pipelines to Europe and has promised a “robust” response to any intentional disruption of its energy infrastructure. The United States announced on Wednesday that it is doubling the number of deadly Himars rocket systems sent to Ukraine as part of a new military aid package worth $1.1 billion, reports AFP. Here are some further details: The 18 additional multiple rocket systems, which have pinpoint accuracy and have been used by Ukraine to wreak havoc on high-value Russian targets such as command posts and ammunition dumps, will be sent over the medium- and long-term, the Pentagon said. Instead of weapons taken from existing stockpiles, this package will consist of newly procured arms, and the Himars alone could “take a few years”, according to a senior Pentagon official. So far, 16 Himars have been deployed by the Ukrainians, and the rocket systems have been credited with playing a key role in recent counteroffensives against the invading Russians. The latest package of orders for US military suppliers also includes 150 armored vehicles, 150 tactical vehicles for towing weapons, trucks and trailers, and systems to help Ukraine defend against Russia’s Iranian-made drones increasingly deployed on the battlefield, according to a Defense Department statement. The new package took the total US military aid to Ukraine since the Russians invaded in late February to $16.2 billion. On Moscow’s Red Square, giant video screens have been set up, with billboards proclaiming “Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson – Russia!” Moscow stands poised to formally annex a swath of Ukraine following so-called referendums that have been denounced by the west. Residents who escaped to Ukrainian-held areas in recent days have told of people being forced to mark ballots in the street by roving officials at gunpoint. The head of the upper house of the Russian parliament said it could consider the incorporation of the four regions on 4 October, three days before the Russian president, Vladimir Putin’s 70th birthday, reports Reuters. Russian milbloggers (military personnel who write blogs) discussed Ukrainian gains around Lyman with increased concern on Wednesday, suggesting that Russian forces in this area may face imminent defeat, according to the US-based Institute for the Study of War. In its latest briefing, it says: Several Russian milbloggers and prominent military correspondents claimed that Ukrainian troops advanced west, north, and northeast of Lyman and are working to complete the envelopment of Russian troops in Lyman and along the northern bank of the Siverskyi Donets River in this area. Russian mibloggers stated that Ukrainian troops are threatening Russian positions and lines of communication that support the Lyman grouping. The collapse of the Lyman pocket will likely be highly consequential to the Russian grouping in northern Donetsk and western Luhansk oblasts and may allow Ukrainian troops to threaten Russian positions along the western Luhansk Oblast border and in the Severodonetsk-Lysychansk area. It adds the Russian ministry of defence “has not addressed current Russian losses around Lyman or prepared for the collapse of this sector of the frontline, which will likely further reduce already-low Russian morale.” Russian military authorities previously failed to set sufficient information conditions for Russian losses following the first stages of the Ukrainian counteroffensives in Kharkiv Oblast, devastating morale and leading to panic among Russian forces across the Eastern axis. The subsequent ire of the Russian nationalist information space likely played a role in driving the Kremlin to order partial mobilization in the days following Ukraine’s initial sweeping counteroffensive in a haphazard attempt to reinforce Russian lines. Future Ukrainian gains around critical areas in Donetsk and Luhansk oblast may drive additional wedges between Russian nationalists and military leadership, and between Russian forces and their superiors. It is now 7.45am in Ukraine. Here is a summary of the latest developments: The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, has proposed a fresh round of sanctions on Russia designed “to make the Kremlin pay” for escalating the conflict in Ukraine. The proposed eighth package of “biting” sanctions includes a cap on the price of Russian oil and further curbs on hi-tech trade. Politicians across Europe have warned that the suspected sabotaging of the two Nord Stream pipelines could herald a new stage of hybrid warfare targeting vulnerable energy infrastructure in order to undermine support of Ukraine. Norway’s prime minister, Jonas Gahr Støre, said his country would step up its military presence at Norwegian installations after the country became Europe’s largest supplier of natural gas. A report drawn up by an international working group on sanctions concluded Russia should now be declared a “state sponsor of terrorism” and had reached the legal definition of a terrorist state under US and Canadian law. The head of the Office of the Ukrainian Presidency, Andriy Yermak, called for sweeping American and European sanctions in light of the report, after Ukraine accused Russia of sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines. Moscow is poised to formally annex Russian-occupied regions after so-called referendums that have been denounced by the west. The Russian-installed leaders of the Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions in Ukraine have formally asked President Vladimir Putin to annex the occupied territories into Russia. Russia’s foreign ministry said action would be taken soon to meet the “aspirations” of four occupied Ukrainian regions to become part of Russia. Once annexed, Russia’s leadership has said it will consider attacks on the Russian-controlled areas as a direct attack on Russia. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy says Ukraine will “act to protect our people” in Russian-occupied regions after what he described as “an imitation of referendums”. Ukraine’s foreign ministry said Kyiv and its allies “condemn such actions of Russia and consider them null and worthless”. Britain’s prime minister, Liz Truss, told Zelenskiy in a phone call that the UK would never recognise Russian attempts to annex parts of Ukraine, Downing Street said. The EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, also denounced the “illegal referenda and their falsified outcome” in Ukraine. Gas prices have risen on fears that Russia could halt supplies to Europe through Ukraine, adding to turmoil caused by damage to the Nord Stream pipelines. The statement came after the discovery of leaks on the two Nord Stream gas pipelines near the Danish island of Bornholm in a suspected act of sabotage. The Kremlin dismissed claims that Russia was behind the attack on the Nord Stream gas pipelines, describing them as “quite predictable and also predictably stupid”. Authorities in the Russian region of North Ossetia, which borders Georgia, are reportedly putting in place travel restrictions to prevent people fleeing to Georgia to avoid conscription. The report by the Moscow Times cites the head of the region, Sergey Menyaylo, as saying that more than 20,000 people had entered Georgia through the section of the border in just the past two days. The US embassy in Moscow has issued a security alert and urged American citizens to leave Russia immediately. In a statement on its website, it warned that dual Russian-US nationals may be called up as part of the Russian government’s mobilisation. US citizens should not travel to Russia and that those residing or travelling in the country should depart Russia immediately while limited commercial travel options remain, it said. The governments of Romania, Bulgaria and Poland are urging any citizens that remain in the Russian Federation to leave urgently. That may be in anticipation of border crossings becoming much more difficult as routes out close and more people flee forced mobilisation in Russia. Russian authorities say they are establishing checkpoints at some of the country’s borders to forcibly mobilise Russian men seeking to avoid the draft by fleeing the country. Social media footage shows military vehicles moving toward the border, reportedly to establish the mobilisation checkpoint. Russia is mounting a more substantive defence than previously as Ukraine attempts to press forward “on at least two axes east”, according to the UK’s Ministry of Defence. Heavy fighting continued in the Kherson region, where the Russian force on the right bank of the Dnipro remained vulnerable, it said in its latest intelligence update. Ukrainian authorities say they have identified five Russian soldiers who allegedly shot at civilian cars in the Kyiv region during the first days of the war. The Russian soldiers are charged with killing five people, and injuring a further six, who were trying to flee Hostomel on 25 February, a day after Russia invaded."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/dec/03/mini-nuclear-power-stations-uk-government-funding","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-03T15:43:07Z","webTitle":"UK government to release funding for mini nuclear power stations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/03/mini-nuclear-power-stations-uk-government-funding","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/dec/03/mini-nuclear-power-stations-uk-government-funding","fields":{"headline":"UK government to release funding for mini nuclear power stations","bodyText":"Ministers are expected to back the first generation of small nuclear power stations in Britain with tens of millions of pounds this week, in an attempt to give the UK a competitive edge on the technology and provide a new source of clean power. Rolls-Royce and a host of US and Chinese companies have been lobbying and waiting for the support since George Osborne first promised them a share of £250m two years ago. Now, after industry frustration at huge delays to the government’s competition to find the best value “small modular reactor” (SMR), funding to develop and test the power stations will be confirmed. The energy minister, Richard Harrington, is expected to announce support for the embryonic technology on Thursday, industry figures told the Guardian. The funding is likely to be up to £100m, one source said. Small modular reactors provide about a tenth of the power of a conventional large nuclear power station, such as the one EDF is building at Hinkley Point C in Somerset. But their backers pitch them as a cheaper and quicker way to generate the new, low-carbon power the UK needs. Rolls-Royce has been publicly and privately lobbying the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) over its SMR design, which it positions as an industrial opportunity for Britain that would generate thousands of UK jobs. The firm argues that with electric cars likely to drive up future energy demand, the reactors will become a vital part of national infrastructure. The BEIS announcement is long overdue, as Harrington admitted at an industry conference in June. Several sources told the Guardian that the industry had been angered by government vacillation on whether to throw its weight behind the technology. “They have blown a bit hot and cold on SMRs. There’s a sense that if we’re going to be part of this, we need to get on with it quite quickly,” said one. Another source said: “The way this has dragged on has hacked off the better ones [SMR developers].” They added that while the funding was welcome, it was expected to be a relatively small sum and they were unsure it would be enough to make a difference. “It’s a pretty half-hearted, incredibly British, not-quite-good-enough approach,” they said. The funding is designed to help Rolls and other consortia, including the US companies NuScale and Terrapower and the controversial Chinese firm CNNC, undertake the research and development for a small nuclear power station to be built in the UK. It is not yet clear who will win a share of public funds, or how the pot will be carved up between the 33 participants in the SMR competition. Government officials have repeatedly made it clear that developers will only get financial help if they can prove their SMR will be affordable and competitive with rival energy sources. The earliest an SMR is thought likely to be ready for deployment in the UK is around 2030. One union said the technology warranted the government’s backing. Justin Bowden, the GMB national secretary for energy, said: “Nuclear new build is absolutely vital as part of a balanced energy mix that is safe, secure and reliable. “SMRs should form part of that. Depending on who may or may not go on to build them, there is an obvious benefit in terms of UK infrastructure jobs and an economic boost.” The former energy secretary Lord Howell gave his backing to the reactors at a recent House of Lords event, where advocates and critics debated the technology. “The obvious way forward is through the sequential construction of a new series of smaller modular reactors of the kind now being developed by Rolls-Royce in the UK, and also in China and in America,” said Howell. However, energy experts said the case for SMRs was far from proved, especially given the falling cost of alternatives such as offshore windfarms. Paul Dorfman, a research fellow at University College London, said: “The real question the government must ask is this: given the ongoing steep reduction in all renewable energy costs, and since SMR research and development is still very much ongoing, by the time SMRs comes to market, can they ever be cost competitive with renewable energy? The simple answer to that is a resounding no.” An energy industry source also questioned how credible most of the SMR developers were. “Almost none of them have got more than a back of a fag packet design drawn with a felt tip,” the source said. A BEIS spokesperson said: “We are currently considering next steps for the SMR programme and will communicate these in due course.” • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2019/jun/12/angus-taylor-wont-rule-out-reversing-nuclear-energy-ban-if-business-case-stacks-up","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2019-06-12T06:37:20Z","webTitle":"Angus Taylor won't rule out reversing nuclear energy ban if business case stacks up","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jun/12/angus-taylor-wont-rule-out-reversing-nuclear-energy-ban-if-business-case-stacks-up","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2019/jun/12/angus-taylor-wont-rule-out-reversing-nuclear-energy-ban-if-business-case-stacks-up","fields":{"headline":"Angus Taylor won't rule out reversing nuclear energy ban if business case stacks up","bodyText":"The energy minister, Angus Taylor, has not ruled out the Morrison government reversing the nuclear energy ban, if a “clear business case” showed the economics were sound as he dodged questions about how Australia would meet its Paris agreement targets. The first energy battle of the new parliament comes from within the party room, with a group of Queensland MPs, emboldened by that state’s strong showing for the Coalition in the May election, leading a push to have nuclear energy reconsidered as part of Australia’s power plan. While a peak lobby group representing the sector says a carbon price would be needed for nuclear to be an economically viable alternative, Australia’s law against nuclear power is another impediment. But Taylor says the government would consider nuclear power if the economic case stacked up. “I think, again, the prime minister has made many questions on this in the lead up to the election … right now it is illegal to build a nuclear power station and as he has said when there is a very clear business case which shows the economics of this can work, we are more than willing to consider it,” he said. Pushed on what that business case would look like, Taylor said he would not give “a lecture on business cases”. “I mean it is pretty straight forward, I mean the prime minister answered this question on a number of occasions before the election, there needs to be a clear business case,” he said, before being asked directly if the government would change the law in the event a case presented itself. “As I say, let’s not put the cart before the horse, if there is a clear business case there is a clear business case,” he said. The nuclear question is not the only quandary facing the Morrison government in the energy space, as discussions over the rules for the Paris emissions reduction target continue within the international community. The main debate centres around whether countries which exceeded their Kyoto targets can use the excess abatement as credit towards their Paris targets. In Australia, that amounts to about 367 megatonnes, which Taylor has previously described as “relatively small” in terms of the nation’s carbon budget, but “apocalyptic” to the economy if not used. Repeatedly asked what the government’s plan was in the event it was decided carryover credits could not be used, Taylor did not have an answer and instead reiterated that Australia had met its past targets. “The plan is clear, we have as a result of our actions, ensured that there is less carbon dioxide equivalent, in the atmosphere, than would have been the case,” he said. “… We have exceeded the Kyoto targets, we are expected to exceed the Kyoto targets by 367 million tonnes in 2020. The result of that is there is less carbon dioxide equivalent in the atmosphere parts per million than there otherwise would be, because of the hard work of Australians. “I have watched, I have watched, right across Australia, businesses, farmers, small and large, drive emissions reductions through all sorts of means, energy-efficiency initiatives, and the outcome has been extraordinary. I mean, there were a lot of people telling us we weren’t going to reach our Kyoto targets, but we’ve done it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/sep/23/ukraine-war-latest-news-referendums-to-start-in-occupied-regions-zelenskiy-urges-russian-protests","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-23T19:43:06Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: Russians flee to avoid draft as west says Putin faces ‘major challenges’ to recruit 300,000 – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/sep/23/ukraine-war-latest-news-referendums-to-start-in-occupied-regions-zelenskiy-urges-russian-protests","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/sep/23/ukraine-war-latest-news-referendums-to-start-in-occupied-regions-zelenskiy-urges-russian-protests","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: Russians flee to avoid draft as west says Putin faces ‘major challenges’ to recruit 300,000 – as it happened","bodyText":"It’s nearly 11pm in Kyiv. Here’s where things stand: The United States is prepared to impose additional economic costs on Russia in conjunction with American allies if Russia moves forward with Ukraine annexation, the White House announced Friday. Russia has been planning what the US has described as sham referendums in portions of eastern Ukraine in what is seen as a step toward annexing these territories. Finnish ministers on Friday evening announced that the government will prohibit Russian tourists from crossing its borders over the next few days. “The aspiration and purpose is to significantly reduce the number of people coming to Finland from Russia,” president Sauli Niinistö told state broadcaster Yle. Russia will continue its communication with the United Nations about a deal to export grain from Ukrainian ports, but says concrete results are needed, Tass news agency cited a senior official as saying on Friday. It also cited deputy foreign minister Sergei Vershinin as saying Russia had a positive assessment of the UN’s efforts to resume the export of Russian fertilizers. Ukraine said on Friday it had shot down four Iranian-made “kamikaze” drones used by Russia’s armed forces, prompting President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to complain that Tehran was harming Ukrainian citizens. Ukraine and the United States have accused Iran of supplying drones to Russia, something Tehran has denied. Zelenskiy has asked his foreign ministry to respond to the use of Iranian equipment, spokesman Serhii Nykyforov said. The United States is prepared to impose additional economic costs on Russia in conjunction with American allies if Russia moves forward with Ukraine annexation, the White House announced Friday. Russia has been planning what the US has described as sham referendums in portions of eastern Ukraine in what is seen as a step toward annexing these territories. “We know that these referenda will be manipulated,” said White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, Reuters reports. Finland will close its borders to Russian tourists after Russian president Vladimir Putin issued a mobilization order earlier this week. Finnish ministers on Friday evening announced that the government will prohibit Russian tourists from crossing its borders over the next few days. “The aspiration and purpose is to significantly reduce the number of people coming to Finland from Russia,” president Sauli Niinistö told state broadcaster Yle, the Financial Times reports. The decision comes after traffic at Russian border crossings with Finland surged after the mobilisation order sparked fears that men of fighting age in Russia would be ordered to the frontlines of the Ukrainian war. In recent weeks, Finland has come under enormous pressure from its EU neighbors after it refused to follow suit in the paths of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland in banning Russian tourists from entering their borders. Russia will continue its communication with the United Nations about a deal to export grain from Ukrainian ports, but says concrete results are needed, Tass news agency cited a senior official as saying on Friday. It also cited deputy foreign minister Sergei Vershinin as saying Russia had a positive assessment of the UN’s efforts to resume the export of Russian fertilizers. The Russian foreign ministry said in a statement on Friday that its foreign minister Sergei Lavrov and UN secretary general Antonio Guterres “discussed in detail the implementation of the Istanbul agreements on exports of Ukrainian foodstuffs from Black Sea ports and on unimpeded exports of Russian agricultural products and fertilizers.” The statement added that Russia and the UN reaffirmed “mutual commitment to preserve the central coordinating role of the international organization.” Ukraine said on Friday it had shot down four Iranian-made “kamikaze” drones used by Russia’s armed forces, prompting President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to complain that Tehran was harming Ukrainian citizens, Reuters reports. Ukrainian forces in southern Ukraine said that they had shot down the Shahed-136 unmanned aerial vehicles over the sea near the Odesa port. Ukraine and the United States have accused Iran of supplying drones to Russia, something Tehran has denied. Zelenskiy has asked his foreign ministry to respond to the use of Iranian equipment, spokesman Serhii Nykyforov said. “Such actions by Iran are considered as steps against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine and also against the lives and well being of Ukrainian citizens,” he said in a statement. Military experts say the drones would be useful to Russia for both reconnaissance and as loitering munitions that can bide their time in locating and engaging suitable targets. On Friday, a video posted online by an officer of the Ukrainian Armed Forces showed another long-range drone, the Mohajer-6, shot down by Ukrainian forces and afloat in the sea. It’s 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Long lines of vehicles continue to form at Russia’s border crossings on the second day full day of Vladimir Putin’s military mobilisation. The Russian president’s decision to announce the first mobilisation since the second world war has led to a rush among men of military age to leave the country, with some men waiting over 24 hours or resorting to using bicycles and scooters to skip the miles-long queue of traffic jams. Traffic into Finland across its south-eastern border with Russia continues to be busy, the Finnish border force said. The Finnish government has announced it will “significantly restrict the entry of Russian citizens” after the country saw a boom in Russian travellers over its eastern border following Vladimir Putin’s mobilisation orders. Finland will now restrict new visas, the government said in a statement, citing “serious damage to Finland’s international position”. It comes as thousands of men across Russia have been handed draft papers after the mobilisation announcement. Among those called up since Putin’s announcement on Wednesday were Russians detained while protesting against the mobilisation, the independent OVD-Info protest monitoring group said. Ukraine’s armed forces said it has liberated another settlement in the Donetsk region and improved their positions around the eastern town of Bakhmut. The village of Yatskivka in Donetsk region is now in Ukrainian hands, according to Oleksii Hromov, deputy head of the operations directorate of the general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces. The governor of the Kharkiv region Oleh Synyehubov has said 436 bodies have been exhumed from a mass burial site in the eastern city of Izium. Thirty of the bodies bore visible signs of torture in the burial site in Kharkiv, a region held largely by Russian forces before a Ukrainian counteroffensive this month, Synyehubov told reporters, adding that three more grave sites have been located in areas retaken by Ukraine. The UN has said its investigators have concluded that Russia committed war crimes in Ukraine, including bombings of civilian areas, numerous executions, torture and horrific sexual violence. The team of three independent experts had launched initial investigations looking at the areas of Kyiv, Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Sumy regions where they were “struck by the large number of executions in the areas that we visited”, and the frequent “visible signs of executions on bodies, such as hands tied behind backs, gunshot wounds to the head, and slit throats”. So-called “referendums” are under way in areas of Ukraine occupied by Russian troops, with residents told to vote on proposals for the four Ukrainian regions to declare independence and then join Russia. The polls in Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia provinces are due to run until Tuesday and appear to be a thin attempt to provide cover for illegal annexation of the regions by Moscow. Ukrainians living in areas occupied by Russian troops are being forced to vote in “referendums” organised by pro-Moscow authorities, according to Ukrainian officials. Some residents are ignoring the “referendums”, Andriy Yusov, a Ukrainian defence intelligence official, told CNN. Ukraine’s state security service (SBU) has claimed the Russian-backed separatist-held so-called Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) planned to allow teenagers under the age of 18 to cast their votes. The “referendums” have been widely condemned in the west as illegitimate. Britain’s ambassador to Ukraine, Melinda Simmons, described the “sham referenda” as “a media exercise” by Russia for whom the outcomes have been “almost certainly already decided”. Nato described the “referendums” as Moscow’s “blatant attempts at territorial conquest” and said they have no legitimacy. G7 leaders said they would never recognise the “sham” referendums in a joint statement. China’s foreign minister Wang Yi has told his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba that the “sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries must be respected”. The meeting between Wang and Kuleba took place on the sidelines of the UN general assembly in New York, and was the first since Russia invaded Ukraine. Kuleba said Wang had “reaffirmed China’s respect for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity”. The Group of Seven (G7) countries said they will never recognise Russia’s “sham” referendums in a joint statement. “Referendums” held in four Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine were an attempt by Moscow to create a “phony” pretext for changing the status of Ukrainian sovereign territory, the statement said. G7 leaders said: We will never recognise these referenda which appear to be step toward Russian annexation and we will never recognise purported annexation if it occurs. Russian men are beginning to be drafted into the army to help Russia’s war with Ukraine after Vladimir Putin announced a partial mobilisation on Tuesday. The Russian president claimed the mobilisation would involve drafting 300,000 men who had previous combat experience, although reports suggest drafts have been sent to students and people with no prior military training. Ukrainians living in areas occupied by Russian troops are being forced to vote in “referendums” organised by pro-Moscow authorities, according to Ukrainian officials. Andriy Yusov, a Ukrainian defence intelligence official, told CNN: There is no referendum as such. It is imitation. Local residents are ignoring it. Some people are simply forced to vote. There were buses of people brought it from Crimea to cast ballots. Ukraine’s state security service (SBU) has said it obtained copies of documents showing that the Russian-backed separatist-held so-called Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) planned to allow teenagers under the age of 18 to cast their votes in the “referendum”. The SBU report said: The invaders hope to expand the ‘electoral base’ supporting the accession of the eastern part of Ukraine to the Russian Federation and involve local residents aged 13 to 17 in pseudo-voting. Sped-up footage appears to show long lines of vehicles at a checkpoint on the Russia-Georgia border, a popular route used by Russians to leave the country. Vladimir Putin’s decision to announce the first mobilisation since the second world war has led to a rush among men of military age to leave Russia. Usually sleepy border crossings into Kazakhstan and Mongolia have also been overwhelmed by the sudden influx of Russians looking for a way out. Ukraine’s armed forces said it has liberated another settlement in the Donetsk region and improved their positions around the eastern town of Bakhmut. The village of Yatskivka in Donetsk region is now in Ukrainian hands, according to Oleksii Hromov, deputy head of the operations directorate of the general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces. The situation further south around Bakhmut was “difficult but under control,” Hromov said in a briefing in Kyiv, adding that Russia “continued to conduct offensive actions in order to expel our units” from their positions around Bakhmut and elsewhere along the front lines in Donetsk. The Finnish government has announced it will “significantly restrict the entry of Russian citizens” after the country saw a boom in Russian travellers over its eastern border following Vladimir Putin’s mobilisation orders. Finland will now restrict new visas, the government said in a statement, citing “serious damage to Finland’s international position”. The move comes a day after Finland’s prime minister Sanna Marin said Russian “tourism and travel has to be stopped” after the number of Russians entering the country doubled on Thursday, a border agency spokesperson told AFP. “The fear is that we end up being the only border country through which it’s possible to travel from Russia to Europe with a Schengen visa granted by another country,” Finland’s foreign minister, Pekka Haavisto, told local media on Wednesday. A former Nato secretary general has slammed the French president, Emmanuel Macron, for his diplomatic efforts in response to the war in Ukraine. The comments by Anders Fogh Rasmussen, a former Danish prime minister, came after criticism about how Macron kept an open line with Vladimir Putin even after the invasion of Ukraine. In June, the French president said Putin had made a “historic and fundamental” error in invading Ukraine but that “we must not humiliate Russia”. Macron’s efforts were a failure and “deeply harmful” for Ukraine, Anders Fogh Rasmussen said in an interview with French magazine Le Point. Rasmussen said: Macron astonished us at the beginning of the crisis with his, to say the least, unique and critical statement that Putin should not be humiliated and offered an exit ramp. Such statements were disastrous and deeply harmful. With minimal preparation, armed soldiers standing guard and the booms of war often audible in the distance, so-called referendums got under way on Friday in areas of Ukraine occupied by Russian troops. Residents in Russian-controlled parts of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions were told to vote on proposals for the four areas to declare independence and then join Russia. The polls have been widely condemned in Kyiv and the west as illegitimate, and appear to be a thin attempt to provide cover for the illegal annexation of the regions by Moscow. They were hastily organised after being announced earlier this week, and are due to run until Tuesday. President Vladimir Putin has indicated that Russia plans to claim the territories after the voting formalities are over, and he threatened on Wednesday that Moscow would be prepared to defend its gains using all available means, including nuclear weapons. The Guardian spoke to several people in the occupied city of Kherson via secure messaging apps on Thursday and Friday, who all reported a lack of activity on the ground. “I don’t know anyone who is planning to go this weekend and vote. I am against annexation, but why even bother voting? Everything is already decided for us – I am sure they will count the votes the way it pleases them. It is all pointless,” said Svitlana, who described herself as a largely apolitical stay-at-home mother. Read the full story here: It’s 6pm in Kyiv.

Western officials believe that Russia “will face major challenges” to mobilise 300,000 more people to its armed forces. Russia has faced problems with training and equipment throughout the conflict so far, and the officials said that would almost certainly extend to newly pressed recruits unless the Kremlin waits several months before deploying them on the front line in Ukraine.

I’m on Twitter or you can email me. Muslim clerics are urging Uzbeks not to join Russia’s war in Ukraine, warning that to do so would be against the Islamic faith. Members of some “terrorist organisations” were attempting to recruit Muslims to fight in the conflict in Ukraine under the pretext of “jihad” or holy war, the Muslim board in Uzbekistan said. But in reality, it was not permissible for a Muslim to participate in any military action except to defend their homeland, it said. The statement by Uzbekistan’s top religious authority came after Russia offered fast-track citizenship to foreigners who sign up to join its army, part of a broader drive to strengthen its military. Uzbekistan’s state prosecutors have warned its citizens not to join foreign armies, saying that those fighting in military conflicts abroad face criminal prosecution under Uzbek law. A video circulated on social media earlier this month showed two Uzbeks captured in fighting between Ukrainian and Russian forces. The detainees said they were recruited in Moscow. The United Nations has said its investigators have concluded that Russia committed war crimes in Ukraine, including bombings of civilian areas, numerous executions, torture and horrific sexual violence. The UN has made the investigation of human rights violations in the war a priority and in May its top human rights body mandated a team of experts to begin work in the country. Since then, UN investigators, have risked their own lives to collect evidence of crimes perpetrated against civilians, including in areas still threatened by enemy forces or laid with mines. The team of three independent experts on Friday presented their first oral update to the UN human rights council, after it launched initial investigations looking at the areas of Kyiv, Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Sumy regions, adding that it would broaden its inquiries. The team of investigators visited 27 towns and settlements, as well as graves and detention and torture centres; interviewed more than 150 victims and witnesses; and met with advocacy groups and government officials.

The Russian president’s decision to announce the first mobilisation since the second world war has led to a rush among men of military age to leave the country, likely sparking a new, possibly unprecedented brain drain in the coming days and weeks. Witnesses on the border with Georgia, a popular route used by Russians to leave the country, said that some men resorted to using bicycles and scooters to skip the miles-long queue of traffic jams. Footage from the scene circulating on social media appears to confirm these reports. “I have been waiting in my car since Thursday afternoon,” said Anton, who declined to give his surname fearing it might complicate his travel. “Everyone is worried that the border will be closed by the time we get anywhere close to it,” he added. Usually sleepy border crossings into Kazakhstan and Mongolia have also been overwhelmed by the sudden influx of Russians looking for a way out. Russian international borders remain open for now, but there are widespread fears Putin will impose martial law next week in an effort to prevent a further outflow of men from leaving the country. Read more of Pjotr Sauer and Dan Sabbagh’s report here: Border queues build as people flee Russia to escape Putin’s call-up Roman Starovoyt, the governor of Russia’s Kursk region, has announced extra payments for people from his region who are mobilising to fight in Ukraine. He opens his message on Telegram: The first groups of mobilised [soldiers] from the Kursk region are sent to replenish the ranks of the Russian army. I instructed to prepare additional support measures for our fighters in addition to federal payments. He then goes on to detail a series of regular additional payments, before concluding: Some of the necessary documents have already been signed, the rest I instructed to prepare as soon as possible. Payments will also be received by those Kursk people who have already signed contracts or have been mobilised. The Kursk region borders the north-east of Ukraine. This is from Dan Sabbagh, the Guardian’s defence and security editor: Western officials believe that Russia “will face major challenges” to mobilise 300,000 more people to its armed forces and that the country’s military will struggle to train and equip any new recruits unless the Kremlin waits several months before deploying them on the front line in Ukraine. The intelligence experts acknowledged that the true recruitment target could be higher, but although some reports have suggested the Kremlin’s real goal is to mobilise 1million, the officials reiterated in a briefing on Friday that it was their belief it will be very hard for Russia to reach 300,000, never mind any larger figure. When pressed, one official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that 300,000 was “an immense number of people to then try to get in any sense of semblance to be able to fight in Ukraine”. The official added: “The authorities will face major challenges even in mustering this number of personnel.” Russia has faced problems with training and equipment throughout the conflict so far, and the officials said that would almost certainly extend to newly pressed recruits. “We think that they will be very challenged in training, let alone equipping such a large force quickly,” the official said. Recruits will likely be issued “old stuff and unreliable equipment,” they said. Western officials believe there was a clear regional bias in Russian recruitment, focusing on poor and minority areas in the country’s east - and avoiding the country’s middle class urban centres. “We are not as yet seeing at the moment, recruiting teams in St. Petersburg or Moscow,” an official said. Western officials are not keen to engage particularly with recent nuclear threats issued by Vladimir Putin, but they did say they believed that it was not necessarily the case that any Ukrainian territory annexed in the coming days through so-called referendums and weeks would be deemed as covered by its nuclear umbrella. “Russian red lines are not necessarily where they say they are,” the official said, and that “there are parts of the territory that Russia now controls which are of greater strategic significance to Moscow than others”. Although the locations were not spelled out, the Kremlin has long placed a high value on Crimea as well as the parts of Donetsk and Luhansk provinces occupied since 2014. The Russian central bank has issued a statement welcoming the announcement earlier that key workers in the financial, IT and communications sectors are to be excluded from Russia’s partial mobilisation by the ministry of defence. [See 10.16am] Reuters quotes the statement saying: Employees who are engaged in critical areas will remain in their positions so the financial system can continue to work smoothly, people can receive their salaries, pensions and social benefits on time, card payments and transfers work and new loans can be issued. Reuters is carrying a little more detail on those quotes from Russian deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov. It quotes him saying: We are not threatening anyone with nuclear weapons. The criteria for their use are outlined in Russia’s military doctrine. We hope the Biden administration is also aware of the danger of an uncontrolled escalation of the conflict in Ukraine. Reuters notes that under Russia’s nuclear doctrine, use of nuclear weapons is permitted if Moscow feels it faces as “existential threat”. Here are the words – in translation – that Vladimir Putin said in his address. Nuclear blackmail was also launched. We are talking not only about the shelling of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is encouraged by the west, which threatens a nuclear catastrophe, but also about the statements of some high-ranking representatives of the leading Nato states about the possibility and admissibility of using weapons of mass destruction against Russia – nuclear weapons. For those who allow themselves to make such statements about Russia, I would like to remind you that our country also has various means of destruction, and for some components more modern than those of the Nato countries. And if the territorial integrity of our country is threatened, we will certainly use all the means at our disposal to protect Russia and our people. This is not a bluff. And those who try to blackmail us with nuclear weapons should know that the weathervane can turn and point towards them. Russia’s deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov said Moscow was not threatening anybody with nuclear weapons, Russian state media reported. Ryabkov was also cited as saying that open confrontation with the US and Nato alliance was not in Russia’s interests. A video shows Russian men who have been called up as part of Vladimir Putin’s mobilisation being told by an officer that the “games are over”. The officer is heard telling the draftees that they will receive two weeks of training before they are sent to the front. The governor of the Kharkiv region Oleh Synyehubov has said 436 bodies have been exhumed from a mass burial site in the eastern city of Izium. Thirty of the bodies bore visible signs of torture in the burial site in Kharkiv, a region held largely by Russian forces before a Ukrainian counteroffensive this month, Synyehubov told reporters alongside the region’s police chief, Volodymyr Tymoshko. Three more grave sites have been located in areas retaken by Ukrainian forces, he added. Britain’s ambassador to Ukraine, Melinda Simmons, has condemned the “sham referenda” in areas of Ukraine occupied by Russian troops. The outcome of these “referendums” in Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia provinces on whether to declare independence and join Russia has been “almost certainly already decided”, Simmons wrote on Twitter. She described the polls, which have been widely condemned in the west as illegitimate, as “a media exercise designed to pursue further an illegal invasion by Russia”. Olga Chyzh, an assistant professor in the department of political science at the University of Toronto, writes for us today about how Vladimir Putin needs nothing short of a miracle to avoid a devastating defeat in Ukraine. Desperate times call for desperate measures and Putin did not disappoint when he announced a partial military mobilisation earlier this week, she writes. At the same time, the self-proclaimed leaders of the occupied Ukrainian territories have rushed to schedule the dates of the sham referendums on whether to join Russia. If mobilising more troops is key to winning the war, then why has Putin waited this long? Why didn’t he declare mobilisation at the first sign that his “three-day war” plan had hit snags? He waited so long that a longtime member of his inner circle, Ramzan Kadyrov, went on the record calling on him to escalate. Putin has been hesitant because he knows mobilisation is risky. If all goes to plan, mobilisation could help quickly replenish Russian troops in occupied territories and stop Ukrainian advances. In the medium-to-long term, it could significantly increase Russia’s capacity for a new successful offensive, and with that, force Ukraine to accept peace on Russia’s terms. Read the full opinion piece here: Traffic into Finland across its south-eastern border with Russia continues to be busy following President Vladimir Putin’s order for a partial military mobilisation. The Finnish border force has published figures showing the number of Russian citizens entering the country at border crossings on Finland’s eastern border. Six thousand four hundred and 70 Russians arrived in Finland across the land border on Thursday, it said. China’s foreign minister Wang Yi has told his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba that the “sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries must be respected”. The meeting between Wang and Kuleba took place on the sidelines of the UN general assembly in New York, and was the first since Russia invaded Ukraine. Wang was cited by Chinese state media as saying that all efforts conducive to peaceful settlement of the Ukraine crisis must be supported. The meeting took place as voting in “referendums” began in the Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine – Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia provinces. Wang told Kuleba that the “sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries must be respected... the legitimate security concerns of all countries must be taken seriously, and all efforts that are conducive to the peaceful settlement of the crisis must be supported,” the Chinese foreign ministry said in a statement. Wang also told his Ukrainian counterpart that “China has always been committed to promoting peace talks, never stands idly by, never adds fuel to the fire and never takes advantage of the situation for self-interests”, it said, adding: China always stands on the side of peace, and will continue to play a constructive role. Following the meeting, Kuleba wrote on Twitter that Wang “reaffirmed China’s respect for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity”. Wang also restated China’s “rejection of the use of force as a means of resolving differences”, Kuleba added. Hello everyone. It’s Léonie Chao-Fong here, taking over the live blog from Martin Belam to bring you the latest developments from the Russia-Ukraine war. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. Russian forces have forcibly deported between 900,000 and 1.6 million Ukrainians, the US ambassador to the UN’s human rights council, Michele Taylor, said. Speaking to the UN council, Taylor urged a UN-mandated commission to examine “the growing evidence of Russia’s filtration operations, forced deportations and disappearances”. She said: Numerous sources indicate that Russian authorities have interrogated, detained and forcible deported between 900,000 and 1.6 million Ukrainian citizens. Ukraine and its allies have accused Russian troops of transporting their citizens to “filtration camps” before forcibly relocating them to Russia. The Kremlin has dismissed these allegations as “fantasy”. It would be cynical to see Saudi Arabia’s efforts to secure the release of international prisoners held by Russian proxies in Ukraine as an attempt to improve the country’s image after the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, its foreign minister has said. Adel al-Jubeir said on Friday Riyadh had first approached the UK government in April, shortly after Aiden Aslin, a British citizen, and others were captured at Mariupol, and had acted for compassionate reasons, hoping to negotiate their release. Asked if it was a rare opportunity to repair relations with the west, the minister said: I think that’s a very cynical view. What we saw, what the kingdom’s leadership saw, was an opportunity to achieve a humanitarian breakthrough to facilitate the return of these detainees to their families. And that’s the motivation. Saudi Arabia, which has sought to take a softer stance on Russia following the outbreak of the war, has previously said Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was involved in a major diplomatic effort that also appears to have involved the former Chelsea football club owner and billionaire Roman Abramovich. One of the five Britons released, Shaun Pinner, recognised Abramovich on the plane flying them out from Russia to Riyadh earlier this week and approached him to ask if he was the former football club owner, according to a report in the Sun. Another of those released, John Harding, recounted the exchange that followed between the two men. “He went over to him on the plane and asked where he was from and Roman said ‘London’. “Then Shaun said, ‘You really look like Roman Abramovich’ and he replied, ‘That’s because I am him, sir’. He couldn’t believe it.” Read the full story here: Pro-Russian authorities in four regions of occupied Ukraine – Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia – have been conducting widely-condemned “referendums” on whether the regions desire to be annexed by the Russian Federation. Nato has condemned the plans to hold “referendums”, describing them as Moscow’s “blatant attempts at territorial conquest”. The “sham referenda” have no legitimacy, the alliance said. Referenda plans have been widely condemned as illegitimate and a precursor to illegal annexation. Voting is also taking place for displaced Ukrainian citizens within the territory of Russia. Mykhailo Podolyak, adviser to the head of the office of Ukraine’s president, described the votes as a “propaganda show”, saying “there is no legal action called a ‘referendum’ in the occupied territories.” Ivan Fedorov, Ukraine’s elected mayor of Melitopol, has said “participation in a pseudo-referendum is the worst betrayal”. Serhai Haidai, Ukraine’s governor of Luhansk, said that all those involved in running today’s “referendums” will be punished. The UK’s MoD says that “the battle situation remains complex” on the ground, but that “Ukraine is now putting pressure on territory that Russia considers essential to its war aims”, with fighting along the Oskil River, and a Ukrainian assault on the town of Lyman, Donetsk, which Russia captured in May. Russia’s ministry of defence has issued a statement to say that people working in key roles in the country’s information technology, financial and communications sectors will be exempt from the partial mobilisation announced earlier this week. Volodymyr Zelenskiy appealed directly to Russians in his address on Thursday evening, calling on them to protest mobilisation, fight back, or run away. Those who did not “are already complicit in all these crimes, murders and torture of Ukrainians. Because you were silent,” the Ukrainian president said. Thousands of men across Russia have been handed draft papers after the mobilisation announcement. Among those called up since Putin’s announcement on Wednesday were Russians detained while protesting against the mobilisation, the independent OVD-Info protest monitoring group said. The Kremlin has dismissed reports of an exodus of Russian men of fighting age as “exaggerated”. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, also declined to deny Russian media reports that some anti-mobilisation protesters detained on Wednesday night had been given draft papers, saying: “This is not against the law.” Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, also denied reports that an undisclosed clause in Putin’s mobilisation decree provided for 1 million reservists to be enlisted to fight in Ukraine. “This is a lie,” Peskov said in response to a report by Novaya Gazeta. Estonian prime minister Kaja Kallas told her nation overnight that power blackouts are possible if Russia kicks the Baltic states from the joint power grid. The Swiss government has condemned what it described as “sham referendums” taking place today in four areas of occupied Ukraine – Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. Reuters reports that the Swiss government said they were illegal under international law, and that yesterday it summoned the Russian ambassador over the matter. Here are some images from inside Russia, where people in Volgograd are voting in the “referendum” on whether the self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic should be annexed by the Russian Federation. Russia’s ministry of defence has issued a statement to say that people working in key roles in the country’s information technology, financial and communications sectors will be exempt from the partial mobilisation announced earlier this week. It says: To ensure the operation of certain hi-tech industries, as well as the financial system of the Russian Federation, it was decided not to recruit citizens with higher education in the relevant specialties and areas of training, working in accredited organisations operating in the field of information technology and involved in the development, implementation, maintenance and operation of solutions in the field of information technology and ensuring the functioning of the information infrastructure. The statement goes on to list sectors including telecoms and financial services and those working on the technical side of media organisations where people can apply to be exempted from mobilisation. Ivan Fedorov, Ukraine’s elected mayor of Melitopol, has written on Telegram urging residents of the occupied areas of Ukraine not to co-operate with the “referendums” being held by the Russian-imposed authorities in those regions, He writes: We call on the residents of the occupied territories not to participate in the pseudo-referendum in any way. Participation in it is to support the bloody plan to escalate the war against Ukraine, to voluntarily become part of a closed totalitarian society, to assume part of the responsibility for war crimes, to agree to the mobilisation of men aged 16-55 to replenish the cannon fodder of the Russian Army, to commit a criminal offence He added, “most importantly, participation in a pseudo-referendum is the worst betrayal”, saying: Don’t open the door to agitators. Do not go to the polling stations. Completely ignore the entire election process. Stay as far as possible from Russian military and enemy equipment. Our heroic armed forces of Ukraine will definitely liberate all occupied territories from racism. Here are a couple of images of the “voting” that is taking place in occupied Luhansk today. The pictures show members of the armed forces of the chiefly unrecognised self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic casting their votes at a military unit in Luhansk. Former Italian premier Silvio Berlusconi appears to have made a sympathetic interjection on the war on behalf of Russian president Vladimir Putin. Reuters quotes him saying overnight that “Putin was pushed by the Russian people, by his party, by his ministers to invent this ‘special operation’,” Berlusconi said, using the Russian wording for the war. Moscow’s plan was originally to conquer Kyiv “in a week”, replace Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy with “a government of decent people” and get out “in another week”, he added. “I haven’t even understood why Russian troops spread around Ukraine while in my mind they should have only stuck around Kyiv,” Berlusconi insisted. In a message on Telegram, Serhai Haidai, Ukraine’s governor of Luhansk, has said all those involved in running today’s “referendums” in occupied areas of Ukraine will be punished. He described them as “elections without elections”, and referring to the suggestion that officials are going house-by-house to enable people to vote from home, Haidai said “they fill out some pieces of paper in kitchens, in apartments and yards. It looks extremely strange. It does not smell like privacy.” He also suggested that part of the operation was also to establish people who might be available for conscription, saying “apartment-by-apartment/yard patrols – this is purely for the purpose of checking apartments to identify men. the occupiers are just looking for ‘cannon fodder’.” Sir Mark Lyall Grant, a former permanent representative of the UK to the UN has been interviewed on Sky News television in the UK. He said Russia’s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov gave an “Alice in Wonderland” kind of address to the UN about Russia’s position. He told viewers: I think we’re entering a very dangerous period now. You’ve got the mobilisation of at least 300,000 servicemen, you’ve got the sham referenda in four occupied territories now in eastern Ukraine, and you got the increasingly violent rhetoric, made explicit by Dmitry Medvedev, the number two if you like in Russia, yesterday, saying that Russia would be prepared to use nuclear weapons to defend its territory. I think it has now become clear what Putin’s plan is. He will annex these lands on the back of the sham referenda over the next few days, claim that they are now in Russian territory, and that therefore any attack on that territory is an attack on Russia itself. Mykhailo Podolyak, adviser to the head of the office of Ukraine’s president, has tweeted to reiterate Ukraine’s position on the “referendums” that have started today under Russian control in occupied Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. He has tweeted: Today, there is no legal action called a “referendum” in the occupied territories. There is only – 1. Propaganda show for z-conscription. 2. The territory of Ukraine that needs an immediate release. Oleh Synyehubov, governor of Kharkiv, has issued an update on the overnight situation in his region on Telegram. In his message he says “the enemy continued to terrorise the civilian population of Kharkiv oblast, shelling settlements adjacent to the contact line and the border with the Russian Federation. There are victims, including children.” He reports that three people were injured in Kupyansk, including “two children - a boy and a girl, seven years old. Doctors assess their condition as moderate”. Synyehubov said that a 51-year-old man was killed by shelling in Kharkiv district. He also reported two people injured by mines, repeating a warning to “remember the high mine danger and to be very careful. Do not touch suspicious objects and do not move around places that could potentially be mined.” The casualty claims have not been independently verified. Estonian prime minister Kaja Kallas told her nation overnight that power blackouts are possible if Russia kicks the Baltic states from the joint power grid. Reuters reports she said “We must also be prepared for Russia might disconnect Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania from their electricity grid. It would be wise to be prepared for possible power outages – that includes public authorities, companies, and every individual.” She called on Russian citizens living in Estonia to ignore any summons to fight in Ukraine: “do not go, because there is no turning back”. That “one million” figure that keeps recurring in some reports about a potential ceiling for the number of people mobilised by Russia comes from news reports yesterday in the independent Novaya Gazeta Europe that the seventh paragraph of the mobilisation decree, which is the only bit of the document that has not been made public, contains that figure in secret. This has been denied as “a lie” by the Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, and defence minister Sergei Shoigu gave the figure for mobilisation as 300,000, but the rumours persist. The RIA Novosti news agency reported yesterday: The seventh point is hidden in the document, which attracted the attention of journalists. As Peskov explained, this paragraph is for official use, so he cannot disclose its content. The spokesperson clarified that it was about the number of conscripts. As Swedish journalist Carl Fridh Kleberg notes, the easiest way for the Russian government to quash the rumours would be to end the public redaction of that part of the decree. The Sky News correspondent Alex Rossi is in Russia, and he has just offered this analysis of the situation from Moscow where he is based. He told viewers in the UK: Certainly on the ground in terms of ordinary people here what’s rattling people a great deal is this partial mobilisation. According to the defence ministry that could see something like 300,000 people drafted into the meat grinder in Ukraine. But I think people are extremely worried. If you talk to NGOs, human rights organisations, they say that they have been contacted by large numbers of people who are extremely concerned that their rights are going to be violated and they will be drafted. Now the defence ministry says that it is only people who’ve had previous active military experience, but anecdotally, we’re seeing that that isn’t the case either. And some people say that as many as a million people could be affected by this. Now again, anecdotally, we are seeing larger numbers of people trying to get out of the country. There have been reports of large queues at the borders of neighbouring countries like Finland’s young man of conscripts age trying to get out. Also we are seeing that the price of airline tickets out of Russia to countries that you don’t need a visa to, they are also increasing in price dramatically as well. So it is hard to say at this point what effect this will have on Russian society, but certainly, all the signs are it could be fairly corrosive. It is something that Vladimir Putin had so far resisted doing, calling people up into what is effectively a war, but what he is still calling a “special military operation”. Mykhailo Fedorov, the digital minister in Ukraine, has responded to Russia’s partial mobilisation with a tongue-in-cheek fundraising appeal to make sure that every new Russian soldier has their own Ukrainian drone to deal with. He tweeted: Ukrainian soldiers are not concerned about Putin’s mobilisation. They are getting their job done. Still for Army of Drones it’s a new challenge: to ensure enough of UAVs for everyone ‘mobilised as a gesture of goodwill’. Here are some of the latest images sent to us over the newswires from Ukraine. The self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) that occupies parts of eastern Ukraine has issued overnight casualty figures. It claims that “eight people received injuries of varying severity”, 15 houses were damaged and “seven people died (including two teenagers born in 2008)“ after Ukrainian forces fired into territory which the DPR claims to control. The DPR is recognised as a legitimate authority by only three UN member states: Russia, Syria and North Korea. The claims have not been independently verified. The British Ministry of Defence has giving its latest intelligence update on how it sees the situation on the ground in the war. It says that “the battle situation remains complex” but that “Ukraine is now putting pressure on territory that Russia considers essential to its war aims”, with fighting along the Oskil River, and a Ukrainian assault on the town of Lyman, Donetsk, which Russia captured in May. This is Martin Belam in London with the live blog now for the next few hours. You can reach me at martin.belam@theguardian.com If you missed Ukraine’s response to the news of mobilisation: the country’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy appealed directly to Russians in his address on Thursday evening, calling on them to protest, fight back, or run away. Those who did not “are already complicit in all these crimes, murders and torture of Ukrainians. Because you were silent,” he said. 55,000 Russian soldiers died in this war in six months. Tens of thousands are wounded and maimed. Want more? No? Then protest. Fight back. Run away. Or surrender to Ukrainian captivity. These are options for you to survive. Russia’s decision on mobilisation is a frank admission that their regular army, which has been prepared for decades to take over a foreign country, did not withstand and crumbled. And now, due to mobilisation, Russia’s war against Ukraine for the majority of Russian citizens is not something on TV or on the internet, but something that has entered every Russian home. Zelenskiy has published the address on Telegram. A number of Russian media outlets are now reporting that voting has begun in “referendums” in the Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia provinces. Luhansk mayor Sergey Haidai claimed in a Telegram post that Russian forces were coercing residents to vote and forbidding them from leaving the area. “According to available information, the occupiers are creating armed groups to go around homes and force people to participate in the so-called ‘referendum’,” he said. At some businesses, he said, “those who will not take part in the voting will be automatically dismissed from their jobs”. Elsewhere, “authorities forbade the local population to leave the city between September 23 and 27”. Secretary of the Zaporizhzhia city council Anatoly Kurtev said on Friday that “preparation and holding of the so-called ‘referendum’ … intensified”. “Local residents are promised cash rewards and household appliances for providing passport data and obtaining citizenship of the Russian Federation,” he said. The Guardian has not been able to independently verify those reports. Traffic into Finland across its south-eastern border with Russia continues to be busy, the country’s border guard told Reuters on Friday, adding that the number of Russian citizens entering more than doubled on Thursday compared with the week before. Russian state media is reporting that voting has begun in some of the regions of Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine where Putin announced referendums this week. The Tass news agency says: “Voting began at 08:00 in the DPR and LPR, as well as in the Kherson region and in the liberated territories of the Zaporozhye region.” The “referendums” have been decried as illegal and a “sham” by Ukraine and the west. A little more detail on the referendums that Russia has said it will hold in occupied regions of Ukraine, from Russian state media via AFP. In the eastern Donetsk and Lugansk regions – which Putin claimed before the invasion were “independent” from Ukraine – – residents will have to answer if they support their “republic’s entry into Russia”, according to Russian state news agency Tass. Ballots in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions ask: “Are you in favour of secession from Ukraine, formation of an independent state by the region and its joining the Russian Federation as a subject of the Russian Federation?” Votes would be collected by Russian-selected authorities going door-to-door for the first four days, and polling stations would be open on the final day, Tuesday. The referendums have been decried as farcical, a sham and illegal by Ukraine and the west. They are reminiscent of the 2014 referendum that led to the Crimean peninsula in Ukraine being annexed by Russia. That vote – criticised internationally as rigged – had an official result of 97% in favour of formal annexation. The conscription drive under way in Russia is “unlikely to generate effective soldiers and is prompting significant domestic backlash for little gain,” thinktank the Institute for the Study of War has said in its latest Russian offensive campaign assessment, released a few hours ago. According to the ISW and Guardian reports, Russian authorities have already begun breaking their commitments to restrict conscription to men with military experience, and not to draft Russian students. Footage out of Russia shows military police pulling students from lessons, reportedly for mobilisation, ISW reports. In Moscow, hundreds gathered to protest after Putin announced the mobilisation. Police officers reportedly began giving draft notices to all those they detained. “The Kremlin’s heavy-handed approach to mobilisation is prompting public anger and distrust across Russia,” ISW writes. In Moscow, our correspondent Andrew Roth has been documenting the aftermath of Putin’s announcement that Russia would begin conscripting its citizens to fight in the invasion of Ukraine. Summons delivered to eligible men at midnight. Schoolteachers pressed into handing out draft notices. Men given an hour to pack their things and appear at draft centres. Women sobbing as they sent their husbands and sons off to fight in Russia’s war in Ukraine. The first full day of Russia’s first mobilisation since the second world war produced emotional showdowns at draft centres and even signs of protest, while it appears Russia could be considering far more than the 300,000 new conscripts claimed by the defence minister, Sergei Shoigu. Read the full report here: Preparations have begun in four Russian-occupied territories to hold ‘referenda’ on whether to become part of Russia. The Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia provinces represent about 15% of Ukrainian territory. Voting there is due to run from Friday to Tuesday. The results are seen as a foregone conclusion in favour of annexation, and Ukraine and its allies have already made clear they will not recognise the results. Good morning. I’m Tess McClure, and will be with you for our live coverage as Europe wakes up. It’s 7.30AM in Kyiv. Here are the latest developments: Four areas of Ukraine controlled by Russia and pro-Moscow forces are preparing to hold referendums on joining Russia. Voting in the Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia provinces, representing around 15% of Ukrainian territory, is due to run from Friday to Tuesday. Nato has condemned plans to hold “referendums” on joining the Russian Federation in Russian-occupied regions in Ukraine, describing them as Moscow’s “blatant attempts at territorial conquest”. The “sham referenda” have no legitimacy, the alliance said. Referenda plans have been widely condemned by the West as illegitimate and a precursor to illegal annexation. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has called on Russians to resist the partial military mobilisation announced by Vladimir Putin, which has sparked protests and a fresh exodus out of Russia. The Ukrainian president said in his daily address on Thursday: “55,000 Russian soldiers died in these six months of war … Want more? No? Then protest, fight back, run away, or surrender” to the Ukrainian army. Thousands of men across Russia have been handed draft papers after the mobilisation announcement. Among those called up since Putin’s announcement on Wednesday were Russians detained while protesting against the mobilisation, the independent OVD-Info protest monitoring group said. The Kremlin has dismissed reports of an exodus of Russian men of fighting age as “exaggerated”. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, also declined to deny Russian media reports that some anti-mobilisation protesters detained on Wednesday night had been given draft papers, saying: “This is not against the law.” Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, also denied reports that an undisclosed clause in Putin’s mobilisation decree provided for 1 million reservists to be enlisted to fight in Ukraine. “This is a lie,” Peskov said in response to a report by Novaya Gazeta. Traffic at Russian border crossings with Finland and Georgia surged after the mobilisation announcement sparked fears that men of fighting age would be called to the frontlines in Ukraine. Prices for one-way flights out of Moscow to the nearest foreign locations rose above $5,000 (£4,435), with most air tickets sold out for the coming days. Photos showed long tailbacks at border crossings with Finland and Georgia. In response, Finland’s prime minister said her government was considering ways to sharply reduce Russian tourism and transit through Finland. “The government’s will is very clear: we believe Russian tourism [to Finland] must be stopped, as well as transit through Finland,” Sanna Marin told reporters. Putin is giving directions directly to generals in the field, CNN reported. The direct orders from the Russian president to generals “hints at the dysfunctional command structure” that has affected Russian forces on the battlefield, according to two sources familiar with American and western intelligence who spoke to CNN. Many of the Ukrainians exchanged in the largest prisoner swap with Russia since the beginning of the invasion show signs of violent torture, the head of Ukraine’s military intelligence said on Thursday. On Wednesday, Ukraine announced the exchange of a record-high 215 imprisoned soldiers with Russia, including fighters who led the defence of Mariupol’s Azovstal steelworks that became an icon of Ukrainian resistance. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, has strongly rebuked Russia for “totally unacceptable” nuclear threats. Speaking at the start of a UN security council meeting the day after Putin raised the stakes in his invasion of Ukraine, Guterres said Moscow’s plans to annex parts of Ukraine were a “violation of the UN charter and of international law”. The Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orban, wants European Union sanctions on Russia lifted by the end of the year, a pro-government daily newspaper said. Orban, a Putin ally, has frequently railed against the sanctions imposed on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. Five Britons released from Russia are meeting their families after several months of captivity in which it was feared they would be executed for fighting for Ukraine. A major diplomatic effort was behind the release of the five Britons who, together with two Americans, a Moroccan, a Croat and a Swedish national, were released by Russia to Saudi Arabia on Wednesday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2020/may/17/letters-isolated-in-care-home-lockdown-hell","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2020-05-17T05:00:50Z","webTitle":"Isolated in care home lockdown hell | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/17/letters-isolated-in-care-home-lockdown-hell","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2020/may/17/letters-isolated-in-care-home-lockdown-hell","fields":{"headline":"Letters: isolated in care home lockdown hell","bodyText":"Nicci Gerrard is right to draw attention to the damage imposed on care home residents with dementia by isolating them from family and friends (“How did we end up turning our care homes into jails of enforced loneliness?”, Comment). The needs of care home residents with hearing loss are also in danger of being overlooked. There is no requirement for homes to maintain the hearing aids of their residents and some homes lack staff with the necessary skills. Even before the virus struck, some residents were left incommunicado for weeks at a time in a personal lockdown hell. Research shows that hearing loss increases substantially the risk of dementia and grassroots voluntary organisations across the country testify to the patchy provision available. When will the government act? Wally Harbert Frome, Somerset Nicci Gerrard’s article resonated with my experience of trying to stay in touch with my 93-year-old father. He is in a care home, and has dementia. He isn’t allowed out of his small room, and over the past seven weeks I have noticed a marked deterioration in his mental health. Covid-19 is indirectly hastening his demise. Josephine Howell Great Baddow, Essex Asylum seekers ignored I read with interest the article by Helena Smith about the low rate of the pandemic in Greece (“Greeks marvel at British Covid chaos as their lockdown lifts after just 150 deaths”, News). However, she does not mention that there are 37,427 asylum seekers in five of Greece’s islands (Chios, Kos, Leros, Lesbos and Samos), with facilities for only 6,095. They are kept literally as prisoners, living in sub-standard accommodation, without an entitlement to health services. The Human Rights Watch representative, Belkis Wille, declared last month that the situation in the islands is approaching a human catastrophe. The EU has provided Greece with funding to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic, but the Greek government is not even attempting to improve the inhuman conditions in the camps. It is estimated that another 100,000 refugees live in mainland Greece. They may be living in better conditions than those left on the islands, but most of them too are in poor accommodation where the sanitary conditions are conducive to the spread of coronavirus. Professor Shulamit Ramon The University of Hertfordshire Hatfield, Herts Road closures just the start I read with excitement your coverage of the announcement that roads around schools are to be closed to keep everyone safer (“Roads near schools to close at peak times”, News). While I welcome any steps to reduce traffic on the school run, having successfully delivered one of the UK’s first traffic-free schools I’m afraid that closing roads alone will not have the desired impact. At Ysgol Hamadryad in Cardiff, we decided from the outset to build a sustainable travel school. We worked closely with parents on mapping suitable routes and identifying any barriers to such travel. These included dangerous road junctions, lack of access to cycles/scooters, lack of confidence among children and timing challenges. We delivered a range of measures, including: a walking bus that runs every day of the year; cycling and scooting lessons from year one; plenty of bike and scooter parking; driving and parking restrictions in the immediate vicinity; working out particularly challenging road junctions; support for parents to access low-cost bikes and scooters. In our first six months of operation, some 98% of children’s journeys to the school were active. My plea to schools that will hopefully follow our example is to consider all aspects of travel to school, not just closing roads. By doing so, we can ensure that sustainable school runs are the future for all schools. Dr Dafydd Trystan, chair of governors Ysgol Hamadryad, Cardiff Nuclear power? No thanks Your business leader urges massive government intervention in support of new – as-yet not even designed – military-derived “small modular reactors” from Rolls Royce (“Government could save jobs at Rolls – if it reacts quickly”). Yet wind and solar energy prices are dropping precipitously. The British Isles have some of the best renewable resources in the world. There is no technical reason why the UK could not be fully and economically powered this way – more quickly creating far greater employment, with more secure export prospects. Even well established forms of nuclear are rapidly declining in competitiveness worldwide. The nuclear industry has a track record of catastrophically expensive hype and disappointment on speculative new ventures like this, so there are no rational grounds to divert investment or employment away from renewables in the way you urge so strongly.

The late Leslie Lever, Labour MP for Manchester Ardwick, and later life peer, used to tell a story in the Commons’ tea room about an encounter during the 1950 general election campaign, when he had made a fiery socialist speech at an open-air meeting in Manchester. As the meeting broke up, he was approached by an elderly gent, who said to him: “I used to believe all this stuff, but I don’t any more.” “What’s your name?” Lever asked. “Victor Grayson,” he replied, and slipped into the crowd. If true, this would appear to corroborate the view that he was not murdered, but escaped into anonymity.

But most often the only maths we need to make sense of them is simple arithmetic. Far more important are our critical faculties, all too often switched off at the first sniff of a figure. It’s easy to be hoodwinked by big numbers in particular. But are they really so big? Compared with what? And what is being assumed? A government announcement of an extra £Xm a year will look far less impressive if divided by 60 million (the British population) and/or 52 (weeks in the year). That’s quite apart from the fact that it was probably trumpeted last week already, as part of another, bigger number. Never invent a big figure when a small one will do. Totting jail sentences together (“the six men were jailed for a total of 87 years”) is meaningless as well as irritating. Similarly, saying that something has an area the size of 150 football pitches, or is “eight times the size of Wales”, is cliched and may not be helpful. Be wary of using different ways of reporting comparable figures within a story. It is easier for readers to compare 6% and 10% than to compare 6% and one in 10. Here is an easy three-point guide to sidestepping common “mythematics” traps: 1 Be careful in conversions, don’t muddle metric and imperial, or linear, square and cubic measures. Square miles and miles square are constantly confused: an area 10 miles square is 10 miles by 10 miles, which equals 100 square miles. 2 Be extremely wary of (or don’t bother) converting changes in temperature; you run the risk of confusing absolute and relative temperatures, eg while a temperature of 2C is about the same as 36F, a temperature change of 2C corresponds to a change of about 4F. 3 When calculating percentages, beware the “rose by/fell by X%” construction: an increase from 3% to 5% is a 2 percentage point increase or a 2-point increase, not a 2% increase the Nupes An alliance of leftwing political parties in France.

Joe Biden has said Donald Trump is “an embarrassment” for refusing to concede the election. The president-elect has vowed to move forward with the transition despite Trump lawsuits, Republican obstruction and attempts to mount a blockade of the mechanisms of the presidential succession. The General Services Administration run by a Trump appointee has yet to recognise Biden as the president-elect. Until the decision is made Biden’s staff cannot meet with their counterparts in the White House and other federal agencies, begin background checks for potential appointees or receive security briefings. But Biden said: “We don’t see anything slowing us down, quite frankly.” Mike Pompeo, Donald Trump’s secretary of state – America’s most senior diplomat – has given a bizarre press conference in which he pretended Donald Trump had not been defeated, instead foreshadowing a “smooth transition to a second Trump administration”. Boris Johnson has phoned Biden with congratulations on becoming president-elect – but the PM’s congratulatory message on Twitter accidentally contained hidden text congratulating Trump instead. A mail worker who made voter fraud claims that were seized upon by Republicans is understood to have admitted he was lying after being interviewed by US Postal Service investigators. Meanwhile supreme court proceedings have begun to determine the future of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, which the Trump administration is trying to have struck down. Two conservative judges have indicated that while parts of the healthcare regime may be unconstitutional, those parts are “severable” and can be removed while leaving the rest of it in place. * * * Coronavirus latest – University students in England will be given a six-day window next month in which to travel home before Christmas, with mass testing carried out on campus beforehand. They will leave on staggered departure dates from 3 December to 9 December under plans just announced by the Department for Education (DfE). Students testing positive would need to self-isolate for 10 days. It has emerged that a care home called police when a woman denied visits to her 83-year-old husband for eight months sneaked in to get him out. After discussions involving police and health officials he was allowed to be taken out the next day. The case highlights the dilemma that coronavirus precautions pose for care homes and families, which MPs are due to debate in parliament today. The US has recorded its seventh straight day of 100,000 new cases.

It would cover foods deemed too fatty, salty or sugary but there are concerns it might affect not only traditional “junk food” but things like avocados, jam and cream.

Judge Brenda Penny declined to suspend James Spears from the role he has held since 2008 when Britney was struggling with her mental health. Britney Spears’s attorney, Samuel D Ingham, told the Los Angeles hearing: “My client has informed me that she is afraid of her father. She will not perform again if her father is in charge of her career.” James Spears’s attorney said he had a perfect record as his daughter’s conservator, which had seen her net worth go from debt to well over $60m, and he was motivated by “a fierce desire to protect her from those trying to take advantage of her”. The judge ordered that as requested by Britney a corporate fiduciary, the Bessemer Trust, would be added as co-conservator over her estate. * * * Power to ban foreign buyouts – Ministers are seeking sweeping powers to block takeovers by Chinese and other foreign companies on national security grounds. A bill is due to be published today that would let ministers retrospectively halt acquisitions up to five years after a deal is concluded. Some Conservative backbenchers want amendments to prevent takeovers on human rights grounds as well. Nils Pratley, the Guardian’s finance editor, writes that even before Huawei and 5G, the mood had cooled towards Chinese investment in Britain’s infrastructure, and nuclear power is one area where the effects will be felt: “The extreme laissez-faire approach has had its day.” * * * Biden brings climate cheer – Preparations for the next vital UN summit on the climate, one of the last chances to set the world on track to meet the Paris agreement, have been given a boost by the election of Joe Biden as US president. In the last few weeks China, the EU, Japan and others have committed to long-term targets on greenhouse gas emissions under the Paris climate agreement, which Biden has vowed the US will rejoin once Donald Trump is gone. The UN Cop26 summit, intended for this year before Covid happened, is to be held in 2021 in Glasgow. Jonathan Watts lists some of the obstacles to a global green recovery that will remain even in the post-Trump era, from China’s funding of dirty industries to big carbon’s lobbying power in Europe and, in the UK, climate sceptics in Boris Johnson’s inner circle.

The front-page picture is the FA boss Greg Clarke who has had to resign after insensitive comments about the race, gender and sexuality of players. The Times has “NHS plans to vaccinate one million every week” and the Express says “NHS vow: we’ll get vaccine out by Christmas”. The i has “Vaccine challenge revealed”, as in the scale of it. The Metro says “Don’t screw it up!”, reporting predictions by the coronavirus taskforce member Sir John Bell of an end to the pandemic by spring “provided [the government] don’t screw up the distribution of the vaccine”. The Telegraph says “Vaccine drive to get under way on Dec 1”. Polls are on the nose after the US election but that doesn’t deter the Mail from reporting its own: “UK says yes to jab … but you go first Boris!” – a sentiment that does not seem to arise from concern for the PM’s health.

The Queensland National, who replaced Matt Canavan in the portfolio after Canavan resigned to back Barnaby Joyce’s unsuccessful tilt at the party leadership, told Guardian Australia: “I think the taxation levels are reasonable where they are, and it will be steady as she goes.” Pitt acknowledged there were calls to overhaul the tax regime, with concerns Australians are not being properly compensated for the extraction of the country’s abundant natural resources, but he said “there are also expert views around saying we should increase the GST, or change a whole pile of other policies, but that’s not the government’s position”. The new resources minister also called for: An expansion of Australia’s controversial coal seam gas industry, including the contentious Santos project in north-west New South Wales, arguing the industry had worked to fix problems and “the technology is proven”. “I think we should open up Narrabri and others,” Pitt said. “If we can drive down domestic gas prices, everyone’s lives are made easier, particularly business.” More exploration of carbon capture and storage, even though CCS has not been commercially viable despite years of development. Pitt said there were “real opportunities” with the technology that could be combined with ultra super critical coal plants to reduce emissions. He said he was firmly technology-neutral when it came to power generation, but “coal will continue to be an important part of not only the economy, but what happens in regional areas for a long time to come”. While he was supportive of the coal industry, Pitt declined to express a view about the viability of the Collinsville coal-fired power plant proposal that has split the government. He also declined to say whether the government would indemnify the project against future carbon risk. Scott Morrison has left open the option of his government indemnifying the plant from future carbon risk, and politically connected power baron Trevor St Baker told Guardian Australia no project at that scale could proceed without an indemnity from the commonwealth. But Pitt said those were issues for his colleague, the energy minister, Angus Taylor, and he said he would not be in a position to have an informed view about whether or not Collinsville stacked up until the feasibility study was completed. “That’s why we are doing the study,” he said. “I can’t assess the feasibility of the project until that is completed.” Pitt has previously advocated consideration of nuclear power in Australia, but declined to repeat that view now he was in the resources portfolio. He said it would be up to Taylor if nuclear proceeded in Australia, and he said it would certainly not proceed unless there was bipartisan support. He said he accepted the science of climate change, but declined to express a view about whether global heating was fuelled by human activity. Pitt said there was “no doubt” the climate was changing, but the focus now should be on building resilience, and on technological solutions to lowering emissions. Pitt said he has never held the view that “we should be pouring unrestricted amounts of all sorts of bits and pieces, not just CO2 or greenhouse gases, into the atmosphere”. Pitt’s comments came as Australia’s chief scientist, Alan Finkel, told the National Press Club Australia’s energy sector was already well on the way with the transition to low emissions energy. But he said while renewable technologies were “being scaled up, we need an energy companion today that can react rapidly to changes in solar and wind output”. Finkel said Morrison had nominated gas as the transitional fuel “in the short term”. But he declared the “hero” of the transition would be hydrogen. In parliament, Taylor said the government was committed to rolling out bilateral agreements with the states to guide the energy transition, like the $2bn deal unveiled recently with New South Wales that Canberra says will boost gas supply. But he said for that deal to be replicated, the states “must do the right thing”. “When it comes to those deals, whether it’s NSW or Victoria, the principle is very simple,” Taylor said. “No gas, no cash.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2019/dec/04/swansea-tidal-power-project-launches-11th-hour-1m-fundraising-drive","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2019-12-04T00:01:36Z","webTitle":"Swansea tidal power project launches 11th-hour £1m fundraising drive","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/04/swansea-tidal-power-project-launches-11th-hour-1m-fundraising-drive","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2019/dec/04/swansea-tidal-power-project-launches-11th-hour-1m-fundraising-drive","fields":{"headline":"Swansea tidal power project launches 11th-hour £1m fundraising drive","bodyText":"The developers of a pioneering tidal power project in Swansea Bay have launched an 11th hour bid to raise over £1m to keep the project afloat. The company has just over three months to raise enough cash to pay for the development costs of the £1.3bn project before its funds risk running dry in March. Tidal Lagoon Power, the Swansea-based developer, hopes to raise “a relatively modest” £1.2m to undertake crucial planning work to prevent its development consent expiring in the middle of next year. The funds will be used to cover the cost of lawyers and planning consultants needed to complete the final applications before reaching the “cliff-edge” deadline in June. If the make-or-break fundraising fails the company would be unable to undertake the work, and its permission to develop the project would be revoked a few months later. Mark Shorrock, Tidal Lagoon Power’s chief executive, said the company must “remove the cliff edge from Swansea Bay tidal lagoon’s planning permission” if it hopes to save the project. “No amount of political will can resurrect this vital pathfinder project if the planning permission is allowed to lapse. That is why we’ve launched our new fundraise today,” he said. “By raising a relatively modest sum we can retain for the UK the option of large-scale, multi-generational tidal power.” Shorrock vowed in February this year that Tidal Lagoon Power would reboot the scheme with the support of local businesses after failing to convince Conservative ministers to hand the project a subsidy deal. The company now plans to approach “high net-worth individuals” to stump up £2.50 per share, at a minimum subscription of £500, to top up the six-figure sum pledged by Tidal Lagoon Power’s existing investor base. Shorrock has already spent about £37m of investor funds on the project. Swansea Bay is aiming to generate 530 gigawatt hours (GWh) of electricity a year – enough for light and power for 155,000 homes – with turbines working 14 hours a day. The project has grown since its initial plan with the addition of floating solar panels to generate an extra 200GWh of electricity a year and help lower the overall cost. The company clinched permission to develop the ambitious tidal lagoon project in 2015 but last summer ministers rejected its calls for a subsidy contract which would cost energy bill payers three times as much per unit of electricity as new nuclear power. Greg Clark, the former business secretary, told the Commons in June last year it would be “irresponsible to enter into a contract” with Tidal Lagoon Power because of its high costs. The tidal lagoon project has found favour with the Labour party, which has promised to revisit the plans as part of its leader Jeremy Corbyn’s plan to “transform” the UK into a low carbon, green economy. The project also has the support of Plaid Cymru, which believes the project could help reinvigorate the Welsh economy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/dec/14/plans-for-major-nuclear-power-station-in-wales-win-green-light-wylfa-anglesey","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-14T12:07:52Z","webTitle":"Plans for major nuclear power station in Wales win green light","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/dec/14/plans-for-major-nuclear-power-station-in-wales-win-green-light-wylfa-anglesey","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/dec/14/plans-for-major-nuclear-power-station-in-wales-win-green-light-wylfa-anglesey","fields":{"headline":"Plans for major nuclear power station in Wales win green light","bodyText":"Plans for a major new nuclear power station in Wales have taken a crucial step forward as UK regulators approved the project. The Office for Nuclear Regulation and two other government bodies gave the green light on Thursday for the Japanese reactor design for Horizon Nuclear Power’s plant at Wylfa, marking the end of a five-year regulatory process. Duncan Hawthorne, Horizon’s chief executive, said: “This is a huge milestone for Horizon and a major leap forward for us in bringing much-needed new nuclear power to the UK.” Attention will now turn to financing the Hitachi-backed project on the island of Anglesey, which was the site of Britain’s oldest nuclear plant until it closed two years ago. During a visit by UK ministers to Japan last December, it emerged that London and Tokyo were considering public financing for Wylfa. This would be a significant break with the UK government’s previous approach. Hitachi has already spent £2bn on development. Last week the consortium said it needed a financial support package by mid-2018 or it could stop funding development. Japan’s Toshiba has bowed out of the race to build nuclear plants in the UK, confirming last week that a South Korean nuclear firm had been chosen to buy its venture to build a plant in Cumbria. If Horizon is successful with Wylfa, it hopes to build a second new nuclear power station at Oldbury in Gloucestershire. The plants will use Hitachi’s advanced boiling water reactor (ABWR), which has been approved for use at Wylfa. The Welsh plant would have a capacity of 2.7GW, similar to the 3.2GW of the nuclear power station that EDF is building at Hinkley Point in Somerset. Mark Foy, chief nuclear inspector at the Office for Nuclear Regulation, said: “The completion of the generic design assessment of the UK ABWR is a significant step in our regulation of the overall process to construct this type of reactor in the UK, ensuring that the generic design meets the highest standards of safety that we expect in this country.” Ministers said last week that nuclear can and would compete with rival technologies, such as offshore wind, the price of which has reached a record low. Richard Harrington, energy minister, said it was “very naive” and “very simplistic” to suggest that because the guaranteed price for wind was lower there would be no more nuclear projects."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/apr/10/russia-ukraine-war-latest-zelenskiy-pushes-for-oil-embargo-to-curb-russias-sense-of-impunity-uk-pledges-to-send-more-arms-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-11T03:12:27Z","webTitle":"War latest: Pope Francis calls for Easter ceasefire – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/apr/10/russia-ukraine-war-latest-zelenskiy-pushes-for-oil-embargo-to-curb-russias-sense-of-impunity-uk-pledges-to-send-more-arms-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/apr/10/russia-ukraine-war-latest-zelenskiy-pushes-for-oil-embargo-to-curb-russias-sense-of-impunity-uk-pledges-to-send-more-arms-live","fields":{"headline":"War latest: Pope Francis calls for Easter ceasefire – as it happened","bodyText":"This blog has now closed. You can follow the latest updates on our new blog. Officials said a grave with dozens of Ukrainian civilians was found in the village of Buzova near Kyiv this weekend, the latest such discovery as Russian forces retreat from their offensive on the capital and shift their assault to the east. Buzova is 20 kilometres south-west of Bucha, where dozens of civilians were found dead after Russian forces withdrew at the end of March. Taras Didych, head of the Dmytrivka community that includes Buzova and several other nearby villages, told Ukrainian television that the bodies were found in a ditch near a petrol station, according to Reuters. The number of dead is yet to be confirmed. The news agency AFP has accompanied a hospital train evacuating 48 wounded and elderly patients from eastern Ukraine to the western city of Lviv. Organised by the medical charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF), Sunday’s evacuation was the first from the east since a Russian strike killed 57 people among thousands waiting for the train at the eastern railway station of Kramatorsk on Friday. Air raid sirens have been sounding across Ukraine as the time in Kyiv approaches 5am. Russian ally Serbia took the delivery of a sophisticated Chinese anti-aircraft system in a veiled operation this weekend, amid Western concerns that an arms buildup in the Balkans at the time of the war in Ukraine could threaten the fragile peace in the region, the news agency AP reports. Media and military experts said Sunday that six Chinese Air Force Y-20 transport planes landed at Belgrade’s civilian airport early Saturday, reportedly carrying HQ-22 surface-to-air missile systems for the Serbian military. The Chinese cargo planes with military markings were pictured at Belgrade’s Nikola Tesla airport. Serbia’s defense ministry did not immediately respond to AP’s request for comment. The arms delivery over the territory of at least two NATO member states, Turkey and Bulgaria, was seen by experts as a demonstration of China’s growing global reach. “The Y-20s’ appearance raised eyebrows because they flew en masse as opposed to a series of single-aircraft flights,” wrote The Warzone online magazine. “The Y-20s presence in Europe in any numbers is also still a fairly new development.” Serbian military analyst Aleksandar Radic said that “the Chinese carried out their demonstration of force.” Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic all but confirmed the delivery of the medium-range system that was agreed in 2019, saying on Saturday that he will present “the newest pride” of the Serbian military on Tuesday or Wednesday. He had earlier complained that NATO countries, which represent most of Serbia’s neighbors, are refusing to allow the system’s delivery flights over their territories amid tensions over Russia’s aggression on Ukraine. Although Serbia has voted in favor of UN resolutions that condemn the bloody Russian attacks in Ukraine, it has refused to join international sanctions against its allies in Moscow or outright criticize the apparent atrocities committed by the Russian troops there. Back in 2020, US officials warned Belgrade against the purchase of HQ-22 anti-aircraft systems, whose export version is known as FK-3. They said that if Serbia really wants to join the European Union and other Western alliances, it must align its military equipment with Western standards. The Chinese missile system has been widely compared to the American Patriot and the Russian S-300 surface-to-air missile systems although it has a shorter range than more advanced S-300s. Serbia will be the first operator of the Chinese missiles in Europe. Serbia was at war with its neighbors in the 1990s. The country, which is formally seeking EU membership, has already been boosting its armed forces with Russian and Chinese arms, including warplanes, battle tanks and other equipment. In 2020, it took delivery of Chengdu Pterodactyl-1 drones, known in China as Wing Loong. The combat drones are able to strike targets with bombs and missiles and can be used for reconnaissance tasks. There are fears in the West that the arming of Serbia by Russia and China could encourage the Balkan country toward another war, especially against its former province of Kosovo that proclaimed independence in 2008. Serbia, Russia and China don’t recognize Kosovo’s statehood, while the United States and most Western countries do. If you’re just joining us, here’s a quick recap of what’s been happening over the past 24 hours Vladimir Putin has appointed a new general to direct the war in Ukraine as his military shifts plans after a failure to take Kyiv. Alexander Dvornikov gained prominence while leading the Russian group of forces in Syria. The general is likely to usher in a fresh round of “crimes and brutality” against civilians, the US said. Karl Nehammer, the Austrian chancellor, plans to speak about alleged war crimes in Bucha during his visit to meet Putin on Monday. Nehammer will be the first European leader to meet the Russian president since Russia invaded Ukraine in February. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy hit back against Russian propaganda on war crimes, the invasion of Crimea and the downing of MH17, saying: “They say about the murders in Bucha that it is not them, but allegedly us, although it is obvious to everyone that people were killed while the Russian army controlled the city … The Russian militaries have already lied to the fact that even after more than six weeks of war, they claim that they did not hit any of the civilian objects. Do you know why this is so? Because it’s cowardice.” Zelenskiy welcomed talks with the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, on war crimes and sanctions against Russia, adding: “I am glad to note that the German position has recently changed in favour of Ukraine.” Germany has been under pressure to wean itself off Russian energy and had also been criticised earlier in the war for its failure to supply weapons to Ukraine, a policy that has since been reversed. Russian forces pounded eastern Ukraine with heavy shelling over the weekend, killing 10 civilians, including a child and wounding 11 others around Kharkiv. The airport in the east-central Ukrainian city of Dnipro was also destroyed. Ramzan Kadyrov, the powerful head of Russia’s republic of Chechnya, has said that there will be an offensive by Russian forces not only on the besieged port of Mariupol, but also on Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities. Kadyrov, who has descrived himself as Putin’s “foot soldier”, said there should be no doubt about Kyiv: “I assure you: not one step will be taken back.” Nearly 3,000 people were evacuated on Sunday through humanitarian corridors, including 213 from Mariupol, said Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk. Pope Francis has called for an Easter ceasefire to allow for a push for peace in Ukraine, calling the war a “folly” that was leading to “heinous massacres” and “atrocious cruelty” against defenceless people. A total of 1,222 bodies have been found in the region around the capital, Kyiv, so far, Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, said. Ukrainian authorities are investigating 5,600 cases of alleged war crimes committed by Russian troops since the invasion began. Ukraine’s economy is expected to collapse by 45.1% this year, far worse than predicted, the World Bank reported in a dire forecast as the conflict drags on. The United Nations refugee agency calculates that more than 4.5 million Ukrainian refugees have fled Ukraine since the invasion began. Russian armed forces are seeking to strengthen troop numbers with personnel discharged from military service a decade ago, as losses mount. The White House has renewed its condemnation of the Russian targeting of Ukrainian civilians as war crimes, citing recent events including Friday’s missile strike on a railway station as “cruel and criminal and evil”. The death toll from Kramatorsk train station attack has risen to 57, Ukraine said. More than 3,500 pro-Ukrainian demonstrators took to the streets of Germany in response to a motorcade of about 600 pro-Russian protesters in 400 cars flying Russian flags. More from the 60 Minutes interview, in which Zelenskiy says Ukraine is bracing for a “new wave of this war” in the south and east of the country, where Russia has been massing its forces for an expected imminent assault: We don’t know how much [Russian weaponry] there will be. But we understand that there will be many times more than there is now. [All] depends on [how fast] we will be helped by the United States. To be honest, whether we will be able to [survive] depends on this. I have 100% confidence in our people and in our armed forces. But unfortunately, I don’t have the confidence that we will be receiving everything we need. When asked if he was ready to give up any part of Ukraine in exchange for peace, the president said, “Had we been willing to give up our territory, there would have been no war,” but also acknowledged that “this is life. Different things happen.” Overall we are not ready to give away our country. I think we have already given up a lot of [lives]. So, we need to stand firm for as long as we can. But this is life. Different things happen,” he said. This issue would definitely be raised in the course of negotiations. We understand the Russian side. We understand one of their provisions that is always talked about is to recognize Crimea as Russian territory. I will definitely not recognize that. [And] they would really like to take the southern parts of our country. I clearly understand that questions like this will be raised [in negotiations] – if there ever are any. But we were not ready to give up our territory from the beginning. Had we been willing to give up our territory, there would have been no war.” Ramzan Kadyrov, the powerful head of Russia’s republic of Chechnya, has said that there will be an offensive by Russian forces not only on the besieged port of Mariupol, but also on Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities, Reuters reports. “There will be an offensive ... not only on Mariupol, but also on other places, cities and villages,” Kadyrov said in a video posted on his Telegram channel. “Luhansk and Donetsk - we will fully liberate in the first place ... and then take Kyiv and all other cities.” In an interview with CBS’ 60 minutes broadcast on Sunday, Zelenskiy said that the world bore responsibility for what is happening in Ukraine. I remember, all of us remember, books about the second World War, and about the devil in uniform – Adolf Hitler. Are those countries who did not participate in the war responsible? The countries who let German forces march throughout Europe? Does the world carry responsibility for the genocide? Yes. Yes, it does,” he said. “When you [have the ability to] close the sky – yes it’s scary, that a world war could start. It’s scary. I understand [that]. And I cannot put pressure on these people because everyone is afraid of war. But whether the world [is responsible] for this, I believe so, yes. I believe so. Stand in front of the mirror every day and ask yourself, were you able to do something? Or were you unable to do something? You will find the answer in the mirror to this question, and to another question – who are you?” Russian forces bombarded eastern Ukraine over the weekend ahead of an expected onslaught. In Kharkiv, the country’s second largest city, at least 10 civilians were killed including a child. Here are a selection of recent images from the city. More from the Institute for the Study of War assessment which notes that Russia is reportedly offering cash bonuses to incentivise forces withdrawn from northeastern Ukraine to reenter combat operations. Radio Svoboda published images of a document on April 10 that it reported was issued by the Russian Ministry of Defense on April 2 offering specific bonuses for Russian troops in Ukraine. The document specifies large payments including 300,000 rubles for destroying a fixed-wing aircraft, 200,000 for destroying a helicopter, and 50,000 for armored vehicles and artillery. Radio Svoboda stated the payments are intended to coerce units withdrawn from the Kyiv, Chernihiv, and Sumy regions to reenter combat. We have previously reported several instances of Russian soldiers refusing orders to return to Ukraine after being pulled back. It also says that Russian forces are “implementing increasingly draconian measures to conscript previously ineligible personnel”. The Ukrainian Military Intelligence Directorate (GUR) reported on April 10 that Russian forces are now conscripting previously ineligible categories of people, including those with childhood disabilities and workers in protected industries. The GUR reported that DNR/LNR authorities are enabling traffic inspectors to issue on-the-spot conscription notices and are establishing checkpoints on key highways. DNR and Russian military police are additionally reportedly destroying documents granting exemptions — such as medical records or work certificates — to forcibly conscript people. Russian forces have made territorial gains in Mariupol in the past 24 hours and have bisected the besieged port city from its centre to the coast on Sunday, the Washington-based think tank Institute for the Study of War has said in its latest assessment of the conflict. The move has isolated the remaining Ukrainian defenders in two main locations: the main port of Mariupol in the southwest and the Azovstal steel plant in the east, it said. Other key points from the assessment were: Russian forces again made little to no progress in frontal assaults in the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts but continue to cohere further reinforcements. Maxar Technologies satellite imagery captured hundreds of Russian vehicles in Kharkiv Oblast redeploying to support Russian operations near Izyum. Ukrainian counterattacks may threaten Kherson city in the coming days or weeks. A bit more from Zelenskiy’s speech earlier, in which he said he was grateful for the recent change in Germany’s position towards the conflict. I spoke today with Chancellor of Germany Olaf Scholz. About how to bring to justice all those guilty of war crimes. How to strengthen sanctions against Russia and how to force Russia to seek peace. I am glad to note that the German position has recently changed in favor of Ukraine. I consider it absolutely logical. Because this course is supported by the majority of the German people. And I am grateful to them. But I expect that everything we agreed on will be implemented. And this is very important,” Zelenskiy said. Germany has been under pressure to wean itself off Russian energy and had also been criticised earlier in the war for its failure to supply weapons to Ukraine, a policy which has since been reversed. At the end of last week, Scholz said his country would stop using Russian coal by the middle of this year and Russian oil by the end of the year. However, speaking at a joint press conference with UK prime minister Boris Johnson, he declined to endorse Johnson’s claim that Germany would stop importing Russian gas by the middle of 2024. Germany depends on Russia for 55% of its gas and 34% of it oil. Hello, this is Helen Livingstone bringing you the latest from the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In its latest intelligence update, the UK’s Ministry of Defence says that further evidence of alleged Russian war crimes continues to emerge after the withdrawal of Russian forces from northern Ukraine. “This includes the reported discovery of a makeshift grave containing deceased Ukrainian civilians near Burzova,” it wrote. “Allegations of sexual violence perpetrated by Russian military personnel persist,” it added. Prior to his address, Zelenskiy said he signed a decree awarding “18 defenders of Ukraine. Five servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, three employees of the State Service of Special Communication and Information Protection of Ukraine, ten police officers”. In his latest address, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy hit back against Russian propaganda: They say about the murders in Bucha that it is not them, but allegedly us. Although it is obvious to everyone that people were killed while the Russian army controlled the city. They say about the missile strike at Kramatorsk that it is not them, but allegedly us. Although it was their propagandists who announced this strike. Although missiles flew from the territory under their control. And about any of our destroyed cities, about any of our burned villages, they say the same thing, that it is not them either, but allegedly us. The Russian militaries have already lied to the fact that even after more than six weeks of war, they claim that they did not hit any of the civilian objects! Do you know why this is so? Because it’s cowardice... They seized Crimea - and we are allegedly to blame. They destroyed normal life in Donbas - and we are allegedly to blame. They shot down a Malaysian Boeing - and we are allegedly to blame. They have been killing people and children on our land for eight years - and we are allegedly to blame. They destroyed the most powerful industrial region in Eastern Europe - and we are allegedly to blame. Zelenskiy said that he was grateful for servicemen, who are defending Ukraine and fighting back Russian troops, first responders and those who “restore life” in recently liberated territories, and also to “those who ensure our victory in the information confrontation”. He said he was thankful “to all journalists, to editors, to the information marathon “United News”, to all our websites, to all media representatives that do not allow Russian propaganda to win”. “The truth will win,” he said. “Ukraine will win!” The European Union may re-evaluate its goals to transition to renewable energy as it aims to phase out Russian oil and gas imports. “What we will do in the next couple of weeks is work towards what I call the Repower EU initiative, and as part of that we want to accelerate the energy transition. So in that context we might revisit our targets,” the EU’s climate policy chief, Frans Timmermans, told reporters. The EU may aim to hit a “higher percentage of renewable energy for 2030”, Timmermans said, during a visit to Cairo, Reuters reported. Currently, the EU goal is to transition to 40% renewables by 2030. Here are some of the key developments of the day: Russian forces pounded eastern Ukraine with heavy shelling over the weekend, killing 10 civilians, including a child, and wounding 11 others around Kharkiv. The airport in the east-central Ukrainian city of Dnipro was also destroyed. Vladimir Putin has appointed a new general to direct the war in Ukraine as his military shifts plans after a failure to take Kyiv.

My colleague Maanvi Singh will have more on the latest developments in Ukraine Ukraine’s economy is expected to collapse by 45.1% this year, far worse than predicted, the World Bank reported in a dire forecast as the conflict drags on. Meanwhile, Russia is expected to see an 11.2% decline in GDP, AFP reported, with the entire region suffering economic consequences from the war, which has caused more than 4 million Ukrainians to flee and sent grain and energy prices soaring. “The results of our analysis are very sobering. Our forecasts show that the Russian invasion in Ukraine has reversed the region’s recovery from the pandemic,” said Anna Bjerde, the World Bank vice-president for Europe and Central Asia. The World Bank expects emerging and developing countries in Europe and Central Asia to contract by 4.1% this year because of the conflict, a scenario twice as bad as the pandemic-induced recession in 2020. Russian forces pounded eastern Ukraine with heavy shelling over the weekend, killing 10 civilians, including a child, and wounding 11 others around Kharkiv, Ukrainian officials said. “The Russian army continues to wage war on civilians due to a lack of victories at the front,” Oleg Synegubov, the Kharkiv region’s governor, posted on Telegram on Sunday. Russia has been gathering forces in the east for a major assault, Ukraine says, after failing to take any major cities since it launched its invasion in February. Ukrainian leaders have called for civilians to flee as Russia intensifies its assault in the east of the country, but tens of thousands have been unable to evacuate. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, said 2,824 people were evacuated on Sunday through humanitarian corridors, including 213 from Mariupol, which has been under siege for weeks. Residents of the besieged Luhansk region would be able to evacuate with nine trains ready for civilians, the region’s governor, Serhiy Gaidai, announced on Telegram. The majority of Americans support sending more weapons to Ukraine, according to a new poll from CBS News, and further sanctioning Russia. The poll, conducted last week, found that 72% of those surveyed agreed the US should send weapons and supplies to Ukraine while 78% support economic sanctions on Russia. Of those surveyed, 74% agreed the US should increase sanctions on Russia. Joe Biden has pledged “further defence cooperation” to Ukraine and the US has already made available $1bn (£760m) worth of military lethal weapons, including Stinger anti-aircraft systems Javelin missiles, light anti-armour weapons. A resident of Bucha shared a grim account of the murder of her 26-year-old nephew at the hands of Russian forces. Natasha Alexandrovna told the Guardian that Russian soldiers abducted her nephew, Volodymyr Cherednichenko, from his home after examining his phone, which contained photos he had taken of a Russian military column that Ukrainian forces had wiped out. More from Guardian foreign correspondent Luke Harding: They escorted her nephew, dressed in a T-shirt and slippers, to No 6, a yellow-painted cottage. Alexandrovna said she peered over the picket fence, half up a tree, and eavesdropped on the conversation. “He was crying and sobbing. They’d done something bad to his hand. He was cradling it. He told them repeatedly: ‘I don’t know any fascists.’” Later the soldiers shoved Cherednichenko into their armoured personnel carrier, which was parked in the property’s apple orchard. His mother brought him a warm coat and shoes. “They told us they were taking him into town for further interrogation and would bring him back after three days,” Alexandrova said. “Nadezhda begged them. She pleaded: ‘Return my son to me.’” For three weeks there was no news. On 29 March, Russian forces withdrew from the Kyiv region, in a staggering setback for Moscow’s plan to conquer Ukraine. It seemed Putin had reckoned on a quick victory that would remove President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and his pro-western government. Instead, his forces got bogged down and sustained massive casualties. Given an order to retreat, the troops rolled chaotically out of Ivan Franko Street and headed north, back towards the Belarusian border. They left behind smashed-up cars adorned with the letter V, a military symbol, some of them flattened by tanks after drunken joyrides. And a lot of bodies. One was found in a dank garden cellar in the neighbouring street, at the bottom of a brick staircase. It was a young man: Cherednichenko. “He was wearing the same coat his mother gave him,” Alexandrova said. More than 3,500 pro-Ukrainian demonstrators took to the streets of Germany in response to a motorcade of about 600 pro-Russian protesters in 400 cars flying Russian flags. Police said the protests were broadly peaceful, Reuters reported, but fences were put up to separate pro-Russian protesters from the rival demonstration. Pro-Russian demonstrators said the motorcade was protesting against discrimination Russian citizens in Germany have experienced since Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. In Frankfurt, the pro-Russian group marched with a banner that read “Truth and diversity of opinion over PROPAGANDA”. The death toll from the missile strike on the Kramatorsk train station has risen to 57, Ukraine said on Sunday. More than 100 people were wounded, said Pavlo Kyrylenko, the Donetsk region governor. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has referred to the violence at the station, where thousands of civilians were attempting to flee to safety, as a Russian war crime. The US has also blamed Russia for the attack. Moscow has denied responsibility. Karl Nehammer, the Austrian chancellor, plans to speak with the Kremlin about alleged war crimes in Bucha during his visit with Vladimir Putin on Monday, AFP reports. Nehammer will be the first European leader to meet the Russian president since Russia invaded Ukraine in February. The Austrian chancellor organized the meeting during a recent visit to Ukraine, a spokesperson said, adding that Nehammer wants “to do everything so that progress towards peace can be made” even if the chances are minimal. On a visit to Ukraine this weekend, Nehammer toured Bucha, where mass civilian graves and street killings by Russian forces were discovered last week. Ukraine carried out the first staff rotation at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in three weeks, the country told the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on Sunday. Russian troops left the power station north of Kyiv earlier this month, after occupying the area for more than a month, and headed toward the border with Belarus, Ukraine’s state nuclear energy company said. The site’s analytical laboratories for radiation monitoring were “destroyed and the analytical instruments stolen, broken or otherwise disabled”, Ukraine told the IAEA. “While it is very positive that Ukrainian authorities are gradually restoring regulatory control of the Chernobyl site, it is clear that a lot of work remains to return the site to normality,” Rafael Mariano Grossi, the IAEA director general, said in a statement. I’m Dani Anguiano and I’ll be bringing you the latest developments in the war in Ukraine over the next few hours. Russia is boosting its campaign to recruit men who are not eligible for conscription to fight in the eastern Donbas region, according to Ukraine’s military intelligence service. Posting an update on Telegram, the agency said that employees of “strategic enterprises” are now being drafted. They were previously exempt from active service. Russia aims to mobilise around 1,700 employees of the Alchevsk steelworks, it said, as well as powerline maintenance workers in the locality. Earlier, Ukrainian presidential advisor Mykhaylo Podolyak told Ukraine that it must push back enemy forces in the eastern Donbas region in order to bolster negotiating power for President Volodmyr Zelenskiy. That’s all from me, Jenn Selby, today. My colleague Dani Anguiano is taking over now. The newly appointed general in command of Russia’s military campaign in Ukraine is likely to usher in a fresh round of “crimes and brutality” against civilians, the US has said. Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser in Washington, said the appointment of Alexander Dvornikov as theatre commander of Russian forces in Ukraine could not disguise the strategic failure of Vladimir Putin’s war so far. Ukraine will never be subjugated to Russia; it doesn’t matter which general President Putin tries to appoint,” he told CNN. Dvornikov’s appointment follows the withdrawal of Russian forces from around the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. Dvornikov, 60, came to prominence at the head of Russian troops in Syria in 2015-16, when there was particularly brutal bombardment of rebel-held areas, including civilian populations, in Aleppo. Read the full story here: The Austrian chancellor, Karl Nehammer, will travel to Russia on Monday to meet Vladimir Putin, an Austrian government spokesperson has said, according to Reuters. Nehammer appeared in Kyiv on Saturday to meet the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and tour the nearby town of Bucha, where mass civilian graves were discovered last week. He promised more Austrian support for the country’s armed forces, including rescue vehicles and fire trucks. Nehammer also pledged to donate more fuel. He said sanctions against Russia would only escalate until the war stops. The US is committed to providing Ukraine with “the weapons it needs” to defend itself against Russia, the national security adviser Jake Sullivan has said. Speaking on the ABC programme This Week, Sullivan said: “We’re going to get Ukraine the weapons it needs to beat back the Russians to stop them from taking more cities and towns where they commit these crimes.” The Kremlin continues to reject allegations of war crimes by Ukraine and western allies. On the NBC News show Meet the Press, Sullivan said the Biden administration was working “around the clock to deliver our own weapons … and organising and coordinating the delivery of weapons from many other countries.” His pledge follows a £100m commitment to military and financial aid made to Ukraine by the UK on Friday. About 600 pro-Russia protesters in a 350-car motorcade set off on a demonstration in Hanover, in the north of Germany, on Sunday. A counter-demonstration of around 700 people supporting Ukraine in the city centre also took place, local police said. According to Reuters, the motorcade was protesting against discrimination against Russian citizens in Germany since Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. People also gathered to show their support for Russians at a demonstration in Frankfurt. The protesters marched under the motto “against baiting and discrimination of Russian-speaking fellow citizens/against war”. Germany has a sizeable Russian minority that grew substantially through immigration after the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1989. About 235,000 Russian citizens live in the country, according to government statistics from late 2020. About 135,000 Ukrainians lived in Germany before Russia’s invasion, according to the figures, but an additional 300,000 have arrived as refugees since then. The United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR) calculates that more than 4.5 million Ukrainian refugees have fled Ukraine since the invasion began on 24 February. It said the total was 4,503,954, up more than 62,291 on the previous day. It said Europe had not seen mass displacement of its kind since the second world war. About 90% of those who have left the country are women and children. Men aged between 18 and 60 have been banned from leaving the country in most circumstances and urged to join the resistance movement. Poland hosts the largest number of refugees from Ukraine; 2,593,902 people have crossed the border into the neighbouring country since the start of the war. Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, has said 1,222 bodies have been found in the region around the capital, Kyiv, so far. Ukrainian authorities are investigating 5,600 cases of alleged war crimes committed by Russian troops since the invasion began. They have identified more than 500 suspected war criminals, including high-ranking military and government officials in Russia. Speaking to Sky News, she said: “What we see in all regions of Ukraine is war crimes, crimes against humanity, and we do everything to fix it.” Venediktova added that she had evidence of Russia’s involvement in the missile attack on a train station in Kramatorsk. Russia has denied responsibility for the strike, which killed more than 50 people on Friday. The White House has renewed its condemnation of the Russian targeting of Ukrainian civilians as war crimes, citing recent events including Friday’s missile strike on a railway station as “cruel and criminal and evil”. However, it stopped short of classifying the attacks as genocide. Joe Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, took to US political shows on Sunday to decry Russia’s “systematic targeting of civilians, the grisly murder of innocent people, the brutality, the depravity” in Ukraine. He said recent atrocities “absolutely constitutes war crimes”. Asked during CNN’s State of the Union whether he believed recent attacks could be described as anything but genocide, Sullivan replied: “The label is less important than the fact that these acts are cruel and criminal and wrong and evil, and need to be responded to decisively.” Read the full story here: A health worker has described the harrowing aftermath of the maternity hospital attack in Mariupol on 9 March – and the moment her own medical facility was taken over by Russian soldiers. Alina Buzunar was forced to tell the husband of a woman who came looking for her following the bombardment that she had died, and took the man to the morgue to identify the body. “He was absolutely calm until he found her,” she said. “Because he told us that until the last, he hoped it was not her. Then he cried a lot, it was a very sad situation.” Staff had been sheltering in the basement when, on 11 or 12 March, they heard gunshots. “Russian soldiers said: ‘Lie down on the floor or we will start throwing grenades at you,’ and that’s when they came into the hospital,” she said. “They talked to the management, who asked them not to interfere with the work of the hospital. The main thing they asked of us was not to leave. They said that anyone who did would be shot.” Read the full story here: In a televised appearance, the Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhaylo Podolyak told the nation that “Ukraine is ready for big battles” against Russia. He said the country must push back enemy forces in the eastern Donbas region in order to bolster negotiating power for Volodymyr Zelenskiy before peace talks could take place with Vladimir Putin. The Interfax news agency quoted Podolyak as saying: “Ukraine is ready for big battles. Ukraine must win them, including in the Donbas. And once that happens, Ukraine will have a more powerful negotiating position. “After that the presidents will meet. It could take two weeks, three.” The US lawmaker Liz Cheney has said European countries need to “understand that they’re funding that genocidal campaign” by continuing to buy oil and gas from Russia. Cheney told CNN’s State of the Union programme that missile strike on the Kramatorsk Ukrainian train station this week “clearly is genocide”. At least 52 people died on Friday, including children, and dozens were injured, after Russian forces carried out a missile strike on the railway station as civilians were trying to flee the fighting. Cheney said: I understand the economic consequences to countries in Western Europe if they were to impose a kind of oil and gas embargo that the US has imposed against Russian oil and gas – but they need to do it. Cheney, a Wyoming Republican, added: “They need to understand that every single time, every single day that they are continuing to import Russian oil and gas, they’re funding Putin’s genocide in Ukraine.” It’s Jenn Selby here, taking over from my colleague Alexandra Topping for the next two hours. The British government is facing fresh calls to reveal the identities of eight Russian oligarchs now under sanctions who were allowed to buy “golden visas” to live in the UK. Stephen Kinnock, the shadow minister for immigration, is demanding that the home secretary, Priti Patel, name the eight Russians on the sanctions list and publish a long-withheld report on the now scrapped visa purchase programme. The government closed the “tier 1 investor visa” scheme in February as diplomatic relations with Russia came under severe strain. A week later, Russia invaded Ukraine, prompting the US, EU and UK to impose sanctions on many of Russia’s richest people to try to put pressure on Putin’s regime. Read the full story here: Vladimir Putin has appointed a new general to direct the war in Ukraine as his military shifts plans after a failure to take Kyiv, according to a US official and a European official. Army Gen. Alexander Dvornikov, commander of Russia’s southern military district, has been named theatre commander of Russia’s military campaign in Ukraine, according to senior sources. The White House national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said: “No appointment of any general can erase the fact that Russia has already faced a strategic failure in Ukraine.” Sullivan described the general as having a record of brutality against civilians in Syria and said “we can expect more of the same”. Speaking to CNN’s State of the Union, he said: This general will just be another author of crimes and brutality against Ukrainian civilians. And the United States, as I said before, is determined to do all that we can to support Ukrainians as they resist him and they resist the forces that he commands. Dvornikov gained prominence while leading the Russian group of forces in Syria, where Moscow has waged a military campaign since 2015 to shore up President Bashar Assad’s regime during a devastating civil war. Dvornikov, started his career as a platoon commander in 1982. He fought during the second war in Chechnya and took several top positions before being placed in charge of the Russian troops in Syria in 2015. In 2016, Putin awarded Dvornikov the Hero of Russia medal, one of the country’s highest awards. Dvornikov has served as the commander of the Southern Military District since 2016, reported the Association Press. A European official told CNN that the appointment “speaks to a Russian acknowledgement that it is going extremely badly and they need to do something differently” . “They do things in the same old way,” the official added. CNN reports: Dvornikov, 60, was the first commander of Russia’s military operations in Syria, after Putin sent troops there in September 2015 to back the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. During Dvornikov’s command in Syria from September 2015 to June 2016, Russian aircraft backed the Assad regime and its allies as they laid siege to rebel-held eastern Aleppo, bombarding densely populated neighborhoods and causing major civilian casualties. The city fell to Syrian government forces in December 2016. Russian forces have used a similarly heavy-handed approach in parts of Ukraine, striking residential buildings in major cities and demolishing much of the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has said the decision by Germany and France not to allow Ukraine to join Nato in 2008 was a “strategic mistake”. In a Sunday morning interview on NBC’s Meet the Press, Kuleba said: The strategic mistake that was made in 2008 by Germany and France who rejected the efforts of the United States and other allies to bring Ukraine in, is something that we are paying for. It’s not Germany or France that are paying the cost for this mistake, it’s Ukraine. If we were a member of Nato, this war wouldn’t take place. He added: Ukraine won the battle for Kyiv. Now another battle is coming. The airport in the east-central Ukrainian city of Dnipro was destroyed in a Russian strike, the head of the Dnipropetrovsk regional military administration, Valentyn Reznichenko said on Sunday. And one more attack on the airport in Dnipro. There is nothing left of it already. The airport and the infrastructure nearby have been destroyed. But rockets keep flying. Reznichenko said information about casualties was being clarified. The airport has been hit by Russian forces before - Reznichenko said on March 15 that a Russian missile strike had taken out the runway and damaged a terminal building. Lesia Vasylenko, a Ukrainian MP, said on Twitter: Russia artillery attack on Dnipro airport leaves no infrastructure and destroys everything around the airport. Such a shame, as the airport was completely renovated just last year. All the investments and all the efforts completely wrecked In a late-night address after meeting the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, the Ukrainian president said Russia’s aggression was not, and has never been, limited to Ukraine. The whole of Europe was the target, said Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Saturday, as he again urged the west to impose a total embargo on Russian energy products and to supply Ukraine with more weapons: Yurii Sobolevskyi, deputy head of the Kherson regional council, said locals held a “peaceful rally” Sunday in the Russian-occupied city of Kherson that was dispersed by Russian forces. Posting on Facebook he said: Today in Kherson a peaceful rally took place in front of the Yubileiny concert hall to commemorate the victims of Russian aggression,” he said on Facebook. “As expected, the occupiers dispersed it. He said locals were participating in rallies at “great risk,” facing down intimidation and the threat of disappearance. The Guardian was not immediately able to verify the rally or its turnout. Also on Sunday the general staff of the armed forces of Ukraine on Sunday said Russians in the town of Nova Kakhovka in Kherson region had used local printing houses to prepare brochures, booklets and posters in preparation for an apparent referendum on the establishment of a so-called “Kherson People’s Republic”. CNN reported: Separatists in eastern Ukraine held referendums in 2014 on the formation of “people’s republics,” in voting that was dismissed by Ukraine and Western countries as a sham. Serhii Khlan, a member of the Kherson regional council, said Russian sympathizers holding Russian tricolor flags had tried to organize a rally in the city of Nova Kakhovka, posting a photo on Facebook that he said showed a very small turnout compared with a pro-Ukrainian rally. “This is all you need to know about the probability of a Kherson People’s Republic in the Kherson region,” he said. “This will not happen, because this is Ukraine!” Volodymyr Zelenskiy has tweeted that he has discussed possible new sanctions on Russia, as well as defence and financial support for Ukraine, in a phone conversation with the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz. He said: Had a phone conversation with @OlafScholz. We emphasized that all perpetrators of war crimes must be identified and punished,” Zelenskiy said on his official Twitter account. We also discussed anti-Russian sanctions, defence and financial support for Ukraine. Pope Francis has called for an Easter ceasefire to allow for a push for peace in Ukraine at a service for tens of thousands of people at Saint Peter’s Square in the Vatican today. The pope called the war a “folly” that was leading to “heinous massacres” and “atrocious cruelty” against defenceless people. Without naming Russia directly, he asked: What victory is there in planting a flag on a pile of rubble? Russian armed forces was seeking to strengthen troop numbers with personnel discharged from military service a decade ago, as losses mount from its invasion of Ukraine, British military intelligence said on Sunday. Russian forces are also trying to recruit from the unrecognised Transnistria region of Moldova, said the Ministry of Defence in a regular bulletin on Twitter. Sir Geoffrey Nice QC, who led the prosecution of the former Serbian president Slobodan Milošević at the international criminal tribunal, has called for Russia to be kicked off the UN security council – or be stripped of veto powers. Speaking on Times Radio, he said: A very important step that should be taken is to kick Russia off the security council, or withdraw its veto, or in some other way stop it from having the power to stop itself being tried. That power, just think about this, is the equivalent of Hitler being given the veto power in 1944 to say who would be tried at Nuremberg in 1946.” He added: “Saying that the present system is a bit broken or incomplete doesn’t mean to say we should not put all our effort into ensuring that it is improved ... “Another way is to ensure that after this conflict ends that identified Russian potential defendants are handed over by Russia.” The international community may be more willing to take the step now, he said, because the Russian invasion of Ukraine has shaken the world by bringing it to the brink of nuclear disaster and forcing it to look at the shortcomings of the current system. Ukraine is accusing Russian forces who occupied the former Chernobyl nuclear power plant of stealing deadly radioactive substances from research laboratories. In an update posted on Facebook, the State Agency for Managing the Exclusion Zone claimed that Russian soldiers had entered the storage area of the Ecocentre research base and taken 133 toxic materials. “Even a small part of this activity is deadly if handled unprofessionally,” the agency said. It added that the location of the stolen substances is “currently unknown”. “The degree of preservation and safety of calibration sources and sample radioactive solutions is impossible to be established, and the condition of the damaged will be determined after the appropriate inventory and measurements are carried out.” The statement has not been independently verified. It follows comments made by German Gulashchenko, Ukraine’s energy minister, on Friday after he visited the exclusion zone. He said that Russian troops had exposed themselves to “shocking” levels of nuclear radiation. “They dug bare soil contaminated with radiation, collected radioactive sand in bags for fortification, breathed this dust,” Gulashchenko said via Facebook. He predicted that some of the soldiers may only have a year to live due to the exposure. It’s Jenn Selby here, taking over from by colleague Alexandra Topping for an hour. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has used his Saturday late night address to say that Russia is targeting “the whole European project”. In his late-night address to Ukrainians on Saturday, the Ukrainian president said Russian aggression “was not intended to be limited to Ukraine alone” and the “entire European project is a target for Russia”. Zelenskiy said it was the “moral duty of all democracies, all the forces of Europe, to support Ukraine’s desire for peace”, adding that the country was ready to simultaneously fight and look for diplomatic ways to put an end to the war. Zelenskiy’s address came as civilians continued to flee eastern parts of the country before an expected onslaught and firefighters searched for survivors in a northern town no longer occupied by Russian forces. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk announced nine corridors for evacuation in a Telegram post. Officials have said a grave with dozens of Ukrainians civilians was found in Buzova village near Kyiv, the latest such discovery as Russian forces retreat from their offensive on Kyiv and shift their assault to the east. Boris Johnson’s visit to the Ukrainian capital Kyiv “very timely and very important”. said Ihor Zhovkva, a senior diplomatic adviser to Zelenskiy. The UK prime minister “did not come empty handed”, with the pair discussing various types of support the UK could offer, including anti-ship missiles and financial support. He called for more weapons. The Ukrainian military’s latest operational report said Russian forces are attempting to break through the Ukrainian defences in Izum in Kharkiv, east Ukraine, while also attempting to establish full control over the city of Mariupol. Satellite images released by US private space technology company Maxar Technologies show an eight-mile-long military convoy moving south through the eastern Ukraine town of Velkyi Burluk on 8 April. The town sits to the east of Kharkiv, close to Ukraine’s border with Russia. The Russian ministry of defence claimed missile strikes in Ukraine’s Dnipropetrovsk, Mykolaiv and Kharkiv regions. A new grave with dozens of civilian Ukrainians was found on Saturday in Buzova, a liberated village near the capital Kyiv that was occupied by Russian forces for weeks, according to a local official. Taras Didych, head of the Dmytrivka community that includes Buzova and several other nearby villages, told Ukrainian television that the bodies were found in a ditch near a petrol station. The number of dead is yet to be confirmed. He said: Now, we are returning to life, but during the occupation we had our ‘hotspots’, many civilians died. The Guardian could not immediately confirm the report. In televised remarks the Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak has said Volodymyr Zelenskiy would likely meet with Vladimir Putin only after an expected major battle for the eastern Donbas region. Ukraine is ready for big battles. Ukraine must win them, particularly in Donbas. And after that, Ukraine will get a more powerful negotiating position, from which it can dictate certain conditions. After that, the presidents will meet. That may take two or three weeks. Moscow has turned its gaze on the Donbas, where a major offensive is thought to be imminent. More on the nine evacuation corridors agreed for Sunday: Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk announced the nine corridors in a Telegram post (see 08.29) Here are the details: One corridor will operate in the Donetsk region from Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia, by private vehicle only. Three other corridors have been established to the Zaporizhzhia region from Berdiansk, Tokmak and Energodar, running by both bus and private transport. No corridor from the southern city of Melitopol In the Luhansk region, five corridors will be operational. They will all run to Bakhmut from: Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, Popasna, Hirske and Rubizhne. Regional officials have urged the evacuation of civilians from eastern Ukraine in advance of what expected heavy fighting. The Russian ministry of defence said on Sunday that its forces had carried out missile strikes in Ukraine’s Dnipropetrovsk, Mykolaiv and Kharkiv regions. Defense ministry spokesman Maj Gen Igor Konashenkov said in a statement: During the night in the village of Zvonetske - Dnipropetrovsk region - high-precision sea-based missiles destroyed the headquarters and base of the Dnipro nationalist battalion, where reinforcements from foreign mercenaries arrived the other day. High-precision air-launched missiles in the area of the settlement of Stara Bohdanivka, Mykolaiv region and at the Chuhuiv military airfield [in Kharkiv region] destroyed launchers of Ukrainian S-300 anti-aircraft missile systems identified by reconnaissance. The Guardian could not immediately verify those claims. The Russian military has repeatedly claimed it is targeting “foreign mercenaries” and “nationalist” formations in Ukraine and denies targeting civilian infrastructure, despite evidence to the contrary. Earlier on Sunday Valentyn Reznichenko, head of the Dnipropetrovsk regional military administration in east-central Ukraine, said there had been a series of strikes around the region over the past 24 hours. He said: There were sirens almost every hour and, unfortunately, there are incoming shells in different areas. He added that a Russian strike on the regional capital of Dnipro had destroyed infrastructure, leaving one person injured, with rescuers working for hours to extinguish a fire. Reznichenko said a rocket hit an industrial facility in the Pavlohrad district, to the east of Dnipro, destroying the premises and causing a fire while a farming building was burned down in the Dnipo district. No casualties were reported in either incident, he said. In Germany Bild is reporting that 15 German “Marder” light tanks could be ready to deliver to Ukraine in four months, with 35 delivered by the end of the year. But as Politico Europe reporter Hans von der Burchard asks: will this be too late? UK policing minister Kit Malthouse has said Britain could impose sanctions on Russian troops and generals suspected of committing war crimes in Ukraine. Speaking on Sky News’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme Malthouse said that it was important that evidence of atrocities was gathered as “assiduously as possible” as the conflict continues. While that is ongoing we can take action domestically around sanctions we are able to put on individuals, including combatants, leading generals and others involved in it, to signal our recognition of their part in this dreadful, dreadful assault upon a free democratic country. Malthouse called Boris Johnson’s walkabout with Volodymyr Zelensky through the streets of Kyiv during a surprise visit on Saturday “quite a remarkable moment”. Answering criticism (including by shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper this morning - see this post at 11.12 ) Malthouse said progress admitting Ukrainian refugees to the UK had been disappointing but was now “motoring” . He said: I know that people are disappointed with the progress of the visa regime. The Home Secretary has been out this week expressing her frustration and regret that it hasn’t been quicker. Iryna Veneditktova, Ukraine’s prosecutor general, has told Sky News today that Russia has committed war crimes across Ukraine Veneditktova told Sky News: This morning we have 1,222 dead people in the Kyiv region only. Of course, what we saw on the ground in all regions of Ukraine is war crimes, crimes against humanity, and we do everything to fix it. Referring to the missile attack on a railway station in the Ukrainian city of Kramatorsk which killed more than 50 people, Veneditktova said: Absolutely, it’s a war crime. It was a Russian missile which killed more 50 people. These people just wanted to save their lives. They wanted to be evacuated with kids. It was women, it was children, and they just wanted to save their lives. More pictures are emerging of Russian destruction in the villages near Kyiv: Yvette Cooper, the UK’s shadow home secretary, was also on the BBC One’s Sunday Morning show this morning, as well as Sky. She described delays in Ukrainian refugees getting UK visas as “a total nightmare” and said Labour would only apply security checks to those coming into the UK. Cooper told the BBC it was “totally shameful” that only 1,200 people have arrived under the Homes for Ukraine scheme despite 200,000 people offering to give a refugee a home. She told Sky that there should be an emergency Visa, which would “essentially” be a emergency visa with security checks. That’s what we need to do. You don’t need a lot of this additional fees or requirements, for example, to come on the homes for Ukraine scheme, Ukrainian families are supposed to prove their residence as to where they were living before the first of January. So people are uploading utility bills or other kinds of details that then has to be checked by caseworkers that then adds to delays. The point about security checks is ministers and officials have themselves admitted you can do them on the spot. You can do them within a matter of hours, so there’s absolutely no excuse for these weeks of delays. The head of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Ukraine has said today that his team was unable to reach the besieged city of Mariupol last week despite trying for five days. Pascal Hundt told Sky News: The security conditions were not good, the security guarantees we got were were not good either, so at around 20 kilometres from Mariupol we had to go back. The Red Cross gathered refugees on the way and private cars joined the convoy under the organisation’s flag, with more than 1,000 people finally reaching Zaporizhzhia. Hundt said: Many more of such operations will need to take place in the coming days, in the coming weeks. It’s urgent and we really are in contact with the Russian authorities with the Ukrainian authorities to ensure that safe passage is being provided to these people so that they can move freely and safely to a much safer place. Hundt also said that following the deadly missile attack on a railway station at Kramatorsk, had worsened the situation with more people using private cars rather than trains to escape the Russian advance. Addressing the “free people of a brave country”, Zelenskiy said: That is why it is not just the moral duty of all democracies, all the forces of Europe, to support Ukraine’s desire for peace. This is, in fact, a strategy of defence for every civilized state. In his video address, Zelenskiy thanked the leaders of Britain and Austria for their visits to Kyiv on Saturday and pledges of further support, AP reports. He also thanked the European Commission president and Canada’s prime minister for a global fundraising event that brought in more than 10 billion euros ($11 billion) for the millions of Ukrainians who have fled their homes. Zelenskiy repeated his call for a complete embargo on Russian oil and gas, which he called the sources of Russia’s “self-confidence and impunity.” He said: Freedom does not have time to wait. When tyranny begins its aggression against everything that keeps the peace in Europe, action must be taken immediately. In an interview with the Associated Press’ inside his heavily guarded presidential office complex, Zelenskiy said he was committed to negotiating a diplomatic end to the war even though Russia has “tortured” Ukraine. He also acknowledged that peace likely will not come quickly. Talks so far have not included Russian President Vladimir Putin or other top officials. He said: We have to fight, but fight for life. You can’t fight for dust when there is nothing and no people. That’s why it is important to stop this war. Zelenskiy noted the increased support but expressed frustration when asked if weapons and equipment Ukraine has received from the West is sufficient to shift the war’s outcome. He said: Not yet. Of course it’s not enough. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy gave his late-night address on Saturday. In it he says Russia’s aggression is not, and has never been, limited to Ukraine, and the whole of Europe is a target. Zelenskiy again urged the west to impose a total embargo on Russian energy products and to supply Ukraine with more weapons. Russia’s use of force was “a catastrophe that will inevitably hit everyone”, he added. With Russian forces gathering in the east of the country, Zelenskiy said Ukraine was ready for a tough battle. He added: This will be a hard battle, we believe in this fight and our victory. We are ready to simultaneously fight and look for diplomatic ways to put an end to this war. Ukrainian negotiator Mykhailo Podolyak said Zelenskiy and Vladimir Putin would not meet until after Russia was defeated in the east. One of Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s advisers has called Boris Johnson’s visit to the Ukrainian capital Kyiv “very timely and very important”. Speaking on BBC One’s Sunday Morning Ihor Zhovkva, a senior diplomatic adviser to Zelenskiy, said that the UK prime minister “did not come empty handed”, with the pair discussing various types of support the UK could offer, including anti-ship missiles and financial support. Zhovkva said the anti-ship missiles would help defend cities like Odesa under attack by Russian warships. The message from Zhovkva was clear. Ukraine needed “weapons, weapons and more weapons”, he said. A UK crossbench peer offering her home to a fleeing Ukrainian family has said the UK’s visa scheme is “unwelcoming” and adding to refugees’ trauma. Lady Finlay is offering space in her Cardiff home to a mother and two children, but has been waiting for three weeks for their visas to be cleared through the Homes for Ukraine scheme, PA reports. Her husband, Professor Andrew Finlay, spent eight hours filling out forms for their visa applications on 18 March, the day the scheme launched, she said. The father of the family, who were already known to her and her husband, is a doctor and has remained in Kyiv, she said. The couple has also submitted an application for him in the event he also leaves Ukraine due to injury or other reasons. Finlay added: He’s decided to stay to serve his country and he’s basically entrusted his wife and two children to us. We’ve said we will do whatever is needed for however long to support them, and we know that it might be years. Each of the family’s four applications had to be made separately. And despite repeated efforts in person at a visa information centre and over the phone, the only official response has been four separate emails on Thursday to say each applicant is “in the system” to be processed. She said: The silence is awful... nobody can help me find out what’s happened to these people’s applications. I think there is a failure of recognition that this uncertainty is adding to the trauma that these people have already experienced. These aren’t just pieces of paper, these are people... and these are people who have lost everything. We need to provide an environment where they know that they are welcome and they are safe - how can they feel welcome? The message from the system is that the country is not welcoming them. Finlay described the preparations she and her husband have taken to make their home welcoming to the family - including clearing space in their kitchen, installing a radio which can be tuned into Ukrainian radio and washing soft toys for the younger child. Finlay said the Home Office was “not functioning as it should”. This feels as if it’s totally reactive, as if nobody had looked carefully at the visa application processes over recent years and said: ‘in the event of a major conflict in the world, where all of a sudden, we have to deal with a mass migration of people, how are we going to do it?’ A government spokesperson said: We continue to process visas for the Homes for Ukraine scheme as quickly as possible, but accept progress has not been quick enough. The Home Office has made changes to visa processing - the application form has been streamlined, Ukrainian passport holders can now apply online and do their biometrics checks once in the UK, and greater resource has gone into the system. PA has a moving story of the reception two men who drove two ambulances full of medical supplies into Ukraine. Charles Blackmore, a British executive who founded commercial intelligence specialists Audere International in 2015, drove one of the two vehicles from the UK to Lutsk via Warsaw, arriving in the Ukrainian city on Friday evening. Blackmore was moved to do something more personal after speaking to his American friend Herb Holtz, whose grandfather left Ukraine in 1905. Speaking from Warsaw’s Chopin Airport on his way back to the UK, he told the PA news agency that the pair had been given an “incredible reception” by the while Ukrainians welcomed them with speeches, and patriotic songs. He said: When you drive through checkpoints, when you drive through cities in curfew, when 70% of the city of Lutsk - which is 200,000 people - have left the city, you’re going into a ghost town. And when you see what is happening, to be able to bring the aid to the people was a very important journey. Audere, which provides intelligence to parties wishing to make overseas investments, has already been active in the effort in Ukraine since the start of Russia’s invasion, helping with evacuations and conducting five resupply operations. Blackmore said: We had been involved in evacuating people out of Afghanistan last August. We did not expect some seven months later to be involved in a second evacuation, this time in Europe. But when it happened we decided that we did actually want, and we had the right operating template, to be able to contribute to the humanitarian aid, to the evacuation and to providing support for the Ukrainian people. The company has delivered two tonnes of food and 300 litres of liquids, as well as essential items like first aid and clothes, and extensive medical supplies. Blackmore said he was moved to do something more personal after speaking to his American friend Holtz. He said, ‘I want to do something meaningful. ‘My grandfather was Ukrainian, he left in 1905. I want to do something more than write a check’. So I said, ‘Let’s buy a couple of ambulances, one each, and let’s both first take them down, take them into Ukraine, and see the end result’. The ambulances were sourced were sourced via a charity in the UK and filled with two tonnes of medical supplies. And although they were delivered to Lutsk, in western Ukraine, Blackmore said he had been assured the vehicles and supplies would be going “right to the front line” including Bucha. Blackmore said the Ukrainians “really appreciate” the help and support coming from the UK. He said: What impressed us most was the cheerfulness and the resolve of the Ukrainian people. And it’s very important that we stand even closer behind them and give them the more support and we’re going to look to do that ourselves. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk has said that Kyiv has agreed the use of nine humanitarian corridors to help people to escape heavy fighting in the east of the country, including in private cars from Mariupol. In a statement on her Telegram channel on Sunday Vereshchuk said: All the routes for the humanitarian corridors in the Luhansk region will work as long as there is a ceasefire by the occupying Russian troops. A total of 4,553 people were evacuated from Ukrainian cities through humanitarian corridors on Saturday, fewer than the 6,665 who escaped on Friday, Vereshchuk said on Saturday. Good morning from London, I’m Lexy Topping and I’ll be keeping you up to date on news coming out of Ukraine today. Please do get in touch if you want to draw attention to any news we may have missed - I’m on alexandra.topping@theguardian.com, and @lexytopping on Twitter. My DMs are open. Quick snap here from Josep Borrell, the EU’s foreign policy chief. “Ukraine will prevail and rise back even stronger. And the EU will continue to stand by you, every step of the way,” Borrell tweeted this morning. It is 10am on Sunday in Ukraine as the country braces for an escalation in attacks in the east and evacuations of civilians continue. Here’s where things stand: A recently discovered grave with dozens of Ukrainian civilians has been found in Buzova, a liberated village near the capital Kyiv, local officials said. Residents in the besieged region of Luhansk in eastern Ukraine will be able to evacuate the area today with nine trains ready for civilians to flee, the regional governor has said. A school and several apartment buildings were hit by shelling in the Luhansk and Dnipro regions early on Sunday morning, wounding one person and causing a fire, officials said. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has warned his country “does not have time to wait”, while pushing for an oil embargo on Russia in his latest national address. “Oil is one of the two sources of Russian self-confidence, their sense of impunity,” he said. Zelenskiy said his country is ready for a tough battle with Russian forces amassing in the east of the country. “This will be a hard battle; we believe in this fight and our victory. We are ready to simultaneously fight and look for diplomatic ways to put an end to this war.” The British prime minister, Boris Johnson, pledged a major new infusion of British arms and financial aid during a surprise trip to Kyiv on Saturday. Johnson said the UK and its partners and allies will provide support so that “Ukraine will never be invaded again”. The UK confirmed it will send 120 armoured vehicles and new anti-ship missile systems. Johnson praised Zelenskiy’s “resolute leadership” and “invincible heroism”. “[Vladimir] Putin’s monstrous aims are being thwarted,” Johnson said. The reputations of the Russian president and his government have been “permanently polluted” by war crimes against civilians in Ukraine, he added. Russia’s withdrawal from northern Ukraine has left evidence of “disproportionate targeting” of civilians, mass graves, the use of hostages as human shields, according to the latest British intelligence report. The report also claimed Russian forces continue to use improvised explosive devices (IEDs) to inflict casualties, lower Ukrainian morale and restrict freedom of movement. In response to mounting losses, the Russian armed forces are seeking to bolster troop numbers with personnel discharged from military service since 2012, the UK’s ministry of defence said. The Ukrainian military said its soldiers thwarted eight Russian attacks in Donetsk and Luhansk regions, according to its latest operational report as of 6am this morning. Officials claim Russian forces are attempting to break through the Ukrainian defences in Izum in Kharkiv, east Ukraine, by relocating additional units to the area. Satellite images released by US private space technology company Maxar Technologies show a 13km-long (8miles) military convoy moving south through the eastern Ukraine town of Velkyi Burluk, east of Kharkiv, on 8 April. Unconfirmed reports allege that another top Russian general has died in battle in Ukraine. Colonel Alexander Bespalov, the commander of the 59th Guards Tank Regiment, was reportedly killed and a funeral was held on Friday in the Russian city of Ozersk, according to local media reports. Nato is working on plans for a permanent military presence on its border in an effort to battle future Russian aggression, the Telegraph is reporting, citing Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg. Some of the latest images to come out of Ukraine today highlight the continued destruction inflicted upon cities across the country. Nato is working on plans for a permanent military presence on its border in an effort to battle future Russian aggression, The Telegraph is reporting, citing Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg. Nato was “in the midst of a very fundamental transformation” that will reflect “the long-term consequences” of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s actions, Stoltenberg said in an interview with the newspaper. “What we see now is a new reality, a new normal for European security. Therefore, we have now asked our military commanders to provide options for what we call a reset, a longer-term adaptation of Nato,” it cited Stoltenberg as saying. Stoltenberg, who recently said he would extend his term as head of the alliance by a year, also said in the interview that decisions on the reset would be made at a Nato summit to be held in Madrid in June. The Ukrainian military has just published its latest operational report as of 6am this morning. Officials claim Russian forces are attempting to break through the Ukrainian defences in Izum in Kharkiv, east Ukraine, by relocating additional units to the area while also attempting to establish full control over the city of Mariupol. A partial blockade of Kharkiv and shelling of the city continues, Ukraine’s general staff of the armed forces said. Satellite images released by US private space technology company Maxar Technologies show an eight-mile-long military convoy moving south through the eastern Ukraine town of Velkyi Burluk on 8 April. The town sits to the east of Kharkiv, close to Ukraine’s border with Russia. The “constant arrival of wounded [Russian] soldiers” is putting strain on medical staff and overwhelming medical supplies, the Ukraine defence report added. In the absence of a stable supply of spare parts and units, Russian troops are forced to “work around the clock” to restore and repair equipment, officials claimed. In the Luhansk region, the measures of Russian-occupation administrations on forced mobilisation of the population in temporarily occupied territories are being strengthened. According to the report, in the territory of Donetsk and Luhansk regions, Ukrainian soldiers thwarted eight Russian attacks, destroyed four tanks, eight units of armoured vehicles and 13 air targets including three aircraft, one helicopter, five UAVs and four winged missiles. A school and several apartment buildings were hit by shelling in Ukraine’s Luhansk and Dnipro regions early on Sunday morning, wounding one person and causing a fire, officials said. A school and a high-rise apartment building were shelled in the city of Sievierodonetsk in the besieged region of Luhansk, the region’s governor said. Several apartments burned down and residents were evacuated from the building. “Two high-rise buildings in a new district of the city, as well as a high school building came under heavy fire from the Russian army,” Serhiy Gaidai wrote on Telegram. “Fortunately, no casualties,” he added. In the central city of Dnipro, one person was wounded when a building was hit. The shelling sparked a fire that was eventually put out, regional governor Valentyn Reznichenko said in a seperate post. A missile hit a building in the Pavlograd district of the Dnipro, Reznichenko said. The Guardian could not immediately confirm the reports. Residents in the besieged region of Luhansk in eastern Ukraine will be able to evacuate the area today with nine trains ready for civilians to flee, the Luhansk regional governor has said. Serhiy Gaidai announced the news in an update on Telegram early this morning, with most trains set to leave for cities in the west such as Lviv. We are receiving unconfirmed reports that another top Russian general has died in battle in Ukraine. Colonel Alexander Bespalov, the commander of the 59th Guards Tank Regiment, was reportedly killed in battle by Ukrainian defence forces. It would be the ninth colonel Russian president Vladimir Putin has lost since Russian invaded Ukraine on 24 February. A funeral was reportedly held for Bespalov on Friday in the Russian city of Ozersk, according to local media reports. Ukraine’s ministry of defence estimates that Russia has lost more than 19,000 personnel. In response to mounting losses, the Russian armed forces is seeking to bolster troop numbers with personnel discharged from military service since 2012, according to the latest British intelligence report. Efforts to generate more fighting power also include trying to recruit from the unrecognised Transnistria region of Moldova, the report added. An earlier report said Russia’s withdrawal from northern Ukrainian has left evidence of “disproportionate targeting” of civilians, mass graves, the use of hostages as human shields. Russia’s departure from northern Ukraine leaves evidence of the disproportionate targeting of non-combatants including the presence of mass graves, the fatal use of hostages as human shields, and mining of civilian infrastructure. Russian forces continue to use IEDs to inflict casualties, lower morale, and restrict Ukrainian freedom of movement. Russian forces also continue to attack infrastructure targets with a high risk of collateral harm to civilians, including a nitrate acid tank at Rubizhne.” An earlier report claimed Russian forces continue to use improvised explosive devices (IEDs) to inflict casualties, lower morale, and restrict Ukrainian freedom of movement. Towns and villages surrounding Kyiv have been left reeling after Russia’s failed campaign to seize the capital. The Russian retreat has revealed scores of civilian deaths and devastation inflicted upon homes, apartment buildings and civilian infrastructure. Images from Borodianka, about 50km north-west of Kyiv, reveal the extent of the destruction. Ukraine is ready for a tough battle with Russian forces amassing in the east of the country, president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Saturday. In case you missed his earlier news conference, the president warned that while the threat to the capital had receded, it was rising in the east. This will be a hard battle, we believe in this fight and our victory. We are ready to simultaneously fight and look for diplomatic ways to put an end to this war.” Ukranian negotiator Mykhailo Podolyak said Zelenskiy and Russian president Vladimir Putin would not meet until after the country defeated Russia in the east, which would bolster its negotiating position. We are paying a very high price. But Russia must get rid of its imperial illusions,” he said, according to the Interfax Ukraine news agency. Air-raid sirens sounded in cities across eastern Ukraine, which has become the focus of Russian military action after the withdrawal from around Kyiv. Ukrainian officials have urged civilians in the east to flee. A recently discovered grave with dozens of Ukrainian civilians has been found in Buzova, a liberated village near the capital Kyiv, local officials said. Taras Didych, head of the Dmytrivka community that includes Buzova and several other nearby villages, told Ukrainian television that the bodies were found in a ditch near a petrol station. The number of those who died is yet to be confirmed. “Now, we are returning to life, but during the occupation we had our ‘hotspots’, many civilians died,” Didych said. The Guardian is not able to immediately verify the reports. Many towns and villages surrounding the capital, including Makariv, Bucha, Irpin and Dmytrivka, sustained heavy casualties during the first month of war. As the towns revert back to Ukrainian control, discoveries of mass graves and civilian casualties have triggered a wave of international condemnation, in particular over deaths in the town of Bucha, northwest of the capital. Boris Johnson has pledged a major new infusion of British arms and financial aid to help counter the expected deadly new phase in Russia’s military offensive during a surprise trip to Kyiv on Saturday. After meeting with Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Johnson said: Ukraine has defied the odds and pushed back Russian forces from the gates of Kyiv, achieving the greatest feat of arms of the 21st century. It is because of president Zelenskiy’s resolute leadership and the invincible heroism and courage of the Ukrainian people that Putin’s monstrous aims are being thwarted. I made clear today that the United Kingdom stands unwaveringly with them in this ongoing fight, and we are in it for the long run. We are stepping up our own military and economic support and convening a global alliance to bring this tragedy to an end, and ensure Ukraine survives and thrives as a free and sovereign nation.” No 10 said Britain would send 120 armoured vehicles and new anti-ship missile systems to Ukraine. The missiles can do serious damage to Russian warships and could be used to tackle the Russian navy siege of Black Sea ports. The UK pledged £100m in military assistance last week, including another 800 anti-tank missiles, more anti-aircraft weapons, “suicide drones”, which hover over the battlefield before attacking a target, and helmets, body armour and night-vision goggles. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy delivered another signature national address, noting that his country “does not have time to wait” while pushing for an oil embargo on Russia. Ukraine does not have time to wait. Freedom does not have time to wait. When tyranny launches aggression against everything that keeps peace in Europe, action must be taken immediately. It is necessary to act in a principled fashion. And the oil embargo should be the first step. At the level of all democracies, the whole civilised world. Then Russia will feel it. Then it will be an argument for them - to seek peace, to stop pointless violence.” The Ukrainian president urged for “more painful restrictions” on Russia’s cash flow, primarily upon oil and gas. First of all this applies to the oil business. The democratic world can definitely give up Russian oil and make it toxic to all other states. Oil is one of the two sources of Russian self-confidence, their sense of impunity.” Zelenskiy also pushed for gas sanctions, saying over time this “will also be shut down”. “It’s just inevitable. Not only for safety, but also for environmental reasons,” he added. It is 8.30am on Sunday in Ukraine as the country braces for an escalation in attacks in the east and evacuations continue. Here’s where things stand: Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has warned his country “does not have time to wait” while pushing for an oil embargo on Russia in his latest national address. “Oil is one of the two sources of Russian self-confidence, their sense of impunity,” he said.

Five people have been killed in east Ukraine shelling, according to the Donetsk governor. Four were reported killed in the city of Vugledar, and one in the town of Novomikhaylovka. Towns and villages surrounding Kyiv have been left reeling after Russia’s failed campaign to seize the capital. In the town of Borodianka, north-west of Kyiv, rescue teams are sorting through the rubble of houses destroyed in Russian bombardments, looking for those missing. Ukraine carried out a prisoner exchange with Russia on Saturday, the third such swap since the start of the war, with 12 soldiers confirmed to be coming home, the Ukrainian deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, wrote online. A total of 4,553 people were evacuated from Ukrainian cities through humanitarian corridors on Saturday, fewer than the 6,665 who escaped on Friday, Vereshchuk said. Ten humanitarian corridors to evacuate people from embattled areas across the country had been agreed on Saturday. The European Commission is pledging €1bn to support Ukraine and countries receiving refugees fleeing the war following Russia’s invasion, said the commission’s president, Ursula von der Leyen. The Czech Republic has delivered tanks, multiple-rocket launchers, howitzers and infantry fighting vehicles to Ukraine among military shipments that have reached hundreds of millions of dollars and will continue, two Czech defence sources told Reuters. The Austrian chancellor, Karl Nehammer, met Zelenskiy earlier on Saturday, following a visit to the city of Bucha to the north-west of Kyiv, where mass civilian graves and street killings by Russian forces were discovered last week. Russia has reorganised the command of its battle operations in Ukraine, installing a new general with extensive experience in Russian operations in Syria, according to western officials. The commander of Russia’s southern military district, Gen Alexander Dvornikov, now leads the invasion. “It speaks to a Russian acknowledgement that it is going extremely badly and they need to do something differently,” an official told CNN while a seperate source told the BBC: “We would expect the overall command and control to improve.” Ukraine has banned all imports from Russia, one of its key trading partners before the war with annual imports valued at about $6 billion, and called on other countries to follow suit. Ukraine’s minister for economic development and trade, Yulia Svyrydenko, made the announcement in a statement on Saturday. Nato is working on plans for a permanent military presence on its border in an effort to battle future Russian aggression, The Telegraph is reporting, citing Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg. Protesters staged a self-described “die-in” outside Downing St in London on Saturday, holding ‘babies’ and signs covered in fake blood in protest against the massacre in the town of Bucha. A similar protest took place outside the White House in Washington D.C."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2019/nov/12/morecambe-voters-tell-us-which-issues-will-decide-this-election","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2019-11-12T13:55:25Z","webTitle":"Morecambe voters: tell us which issues will decide this election","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/12/morecambe-voters-tell-us-which-issues-will-decide-this-election","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2019/nov/12/morecambe-voters-tell-us-which-issues-will-decide-this-election","fields":{"headline":"Morecambe voters: tell us which issues will decide this election","bodyText":"The Guardian will be reporting from Morecambe and Lunesdale next week ahead of the General Election, as part of a series of pieces from across the country focused on finding out what matters to the people who live there.

Our live coverage continues here: We’ve just got some video showing a military base on fire near Kyiv after a reported airstrike on Monday night. The base is located in the city of Brovary, 25km north-east of the capital. There are reports of air-raid sirens in several Ukrainian cities on Tuesday morning as the nations braces itself for another day of bombing by Russian forces. The Kyiv Independent media outlets says the sirens are going off in Rivne west of Kyiv, along with Ternopil, Vinnytsia and Volyn. British prime minister Boris Johnson is due to fly to Nato’s border with Russia on Tuesday, pledging that Vladimir Putin will “feel the consequences” for invading Ukraine. Boris Johnson will travel this morning to meet counterparts in Poland and Estonia and visit British troops as he pushes for western unity in punishing the Russian president for starting a conflict that has taken “hundreds” of lives in only five days. Before his trip to eastern Europe, Johnson urged allies to “speak with one voice” to ensure “Putin must fail”. Johnson said: Alongside all our international allies the UK will continue to bring maximum pressure to bear on Putin’s regime to ensure he feels the consequences of his actions in Ukraine. We speak with one voice when we say, Putin must fail. Russian troops based in the country’s far east are heading for manoeuvres closer to Europe, the Interfax news agency quoted Russia’s eastern military district as saying on Tuesday. The troops will hold drills in the Astrakhan province which lies on the border between the European and Asian parts of Russia, and will train in long-distance movements of military units, among other tasks, the district command said. And Sony has joined Disney and Warner by suspending the release of new films in Russia. The company said its latest release, Morbius, would be among those put on hold in Russia. Mastercard said late on Monday US time that it has blocked multiple financial institutions from its payment network as a result of sanctions imposed on Russia over Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. Mastercard will continue to work with regulators in coming days, the company said in a statement. It also promised to contribute a $2m for humanitarian relief. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has fallen behind schedule thanks to fierce local resistance, and multiple Russian equipment and logistics failures, according to a classified US government briefing attended by US senator Chris Murphy. 1/Confirmation that the Russians have fallen behind their timeline. Ukrainian resistance has been fierce and there have been multiple Russian equipment and logistics failures. In a series of tweets in the last hour, Murphy adds that the defence department and the homeland security department are pushing hard for Congress to approve Joe Biden’s plan for at least $6.4bn in supplemental funding to help Ukraine, which will require cooperation from both parties. He adds that it is expected that the fight for Kyiv will be “long and bloody”. 2/DoD and DHS are pressing hard for Congress to end the continuing resolution and get a budget passed. There is no way for our national security agencies to be nimble enough to support Ukraine if they are operating on the 2020/21 budget. 3/ The ability to keep supply lines running to Ukraine remains alive, but Russia will try to encircle and cut off Kiev in the next several weeks. The fight for Kiev will be long and bloody and Ukrainians are rapidly preparing for street to street combat. 4/ The U.S. and allies are coordinating to not only freeze the assets of Putin and his oligarch allies, but to seize those assets as well. This is likely a further step than Putin’s inner circle anticipated. Some of Britain’s biggest businesses have already pulled out of Russia in what is a highly significant move for UK plc. Shell and BP have both profited enormously from their joint ventures in Russia’s huge oil fields but they have now withdrawn. Our business team looks at the “great decoupling” of British business here, while our business commentator Nils Pratley argues that there is no going back for the oiil giants. The rush to disinvest from Russia is impressively quick since it’s possible to imagine an alternative script in which the oil companies’ boards tried to buy time by issuing woolly “all options are open” statements. A definitive statement to sell its 20% stake in Rosneft (in BP’s case) and ditch all partnerships with Gazprom (Shell’s position) leaves no ambiguity. There can be no going back. The sanctions arraigned against Russia seem to spread by the hour, with Hollywood film studios Disney and Warner the latest organistations to cut ties with Vladimir Putin’s state. The Walt Disney Co said on Monday US time that it is pausing the release of theatrical films in Russia, starting with the upcoming Pixar release, Turning Red. Within hours, WarnerMedia said it would pause this week’s release of The Batman in Russia. “We will make future business decisions based on the evolving situation” Disney said in a statement. “In the meantime, given the scale of the emerging refugee crisis, we are working with our NGO partners to provide urgent aid and other humanitarian assistance.” The Ukrainian Film Academy created an online petition that called for an international boycott of Russian cinema and the Russian film industry following the invasion. Still on the space theme, AFP reports that Nasa is looking at how it can manage the international space station without Russian help. The collapse of the rouble provided a big talking point in Monday’s coverage and was followed by a dramatic doubling of interest rates by the Central Bank of Russia to protect the currency. Our Moscow correspondent Andrew Roth went out on the streets to talk to people trying to withdraw money from the banks “before it was worth zero”. The country could soon be facing a severe recession and one businessman told Andrew: “I’m going to tell them that we are going into a crisis that we have never experienced before. It’s like flying on a plane with no engines or the engines are on fire.” The rouble relatively stable in early trading on Tuesday at around 105 to the US dollar. But this chart has a dramatic graph shwoing how far the rouble has crashed in value against the greenback in the past decades. Here’s our latest roundup of what we know so far about day six of the invasion of Ukraine: Ukraine has received donated Starlink satellite internet terminals from SpaceX. “Starlink here. Thanks, @elonmusk,” Ukraine’s vice prime minister, Mykhailo Fedorov, tweeted, days after asking SpaceX’s billionaire chief executive officer Elon Musk for help. The terminals look like home satellite television dishes and can provide relatively fast internet service, by residential standards, by connecting to a fleet of satellites in low orbit. Fedorov’s tweet included a picture of the back of a military-looking truck, loaded with terminals. Musk tweeted back, “You are most welcome”. Taiwan has sent 27 tonnes of medical supplies to Ukraine, the government announced on Tuesday, saying it was extending a helping hand as a member of the “democratic camp” in the international community, Reuters reports. Taiwan has joined with Western allies in putting sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, and expressed cross-party sympathy for the Ukrainian people, seeing parallels with what Taipei views as Beijing’s threats against the island. Taiwan’s foreign ministry said the supplies left on Monday night on a flight to Frankfurt and will be sent onwards to Ukraine via “appropriate routes and channels”. There’s a lot of focus in the British press on Tuesday morning about the deaths of children in Russian bombardment of cities, as some of the front pages show below. Worth flagging then that the Guardian’s Emma Graham-Harrison, who is in Kyiv, filed this very powerful report on the impact on children on Sunday, including the story of a 10-year-old girl called Polina who was allegedly killed by “Russian saboteurs”. Here’s a new video in which Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Ukraine’s president, says Russia continued to bomb Ukrainian cities on Monday while negotiations to end the conflict were taking place on the Belarus border. Zelenskiy also accused Russia of committing war crimes in Kharkiv and said his country had applied to join the European Union. The United States has promised more sanctions against Russia and more weapons for Ukraine’s military, according to Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba. After speaking on the phone to US secretary of state Anthony Blinken, Kuleba has tweeted that “US support for Ukraine remains unfaltering”. “I underscored that Ukraine craves for peace, but as long as we are under Russia’s assault we need more sanctions and weapons. Secretary assured me of both. We coordinated further steps.” Satellite images taken on Monday show a Russian military convoy north of Kyiv that stretches for about 40 miles (64 km) in an area north-west of Kyiv. It is substantially longer than the 17 miles (27 km) reported earlier in the day, according to the US company Maxar, Reuters reports. Maxar, which filed a series of satellite images on the Russian military buildup on the Ukraine border, also said additional ground forces deployments and ground attack helicopter units were seen in southern Belarus, less than 20 miles (32 km) north of the Ukraine border. • This post was amended on 2 March 2022 because unlike story text, the heading referred to a “tank column”. Ukraine’s ambassador to the United Nations, Sergiy Kyslytsya, has read aloud a text message exchange between a Russian solider in Ukraine and his mother before he was killed. When the mother purportedly asks her son if he is still in the Crimea on training exercises he tells her: “Mama, I’m in Ukraine. There is a real war raging here. I’m afraid,” the message allegedly reads, adding that “we are bombing all the cities”, “even civilians”. More from Kharkiv, where Monday saw some very heavy bombardment. The BBC Ukrainian service report that contains quotes from the city’s mayor saying nine people have been killed also quotes a city official saying on Telegram that “dozens” of bodies could be seen in the city’s streets. He called it a “war crime”. In quotes also reported by Agence France-Presse, Oleg Sinegubov, head of the Kharkiv military state administration, said the Russians had bombarded civilian areas where there was no critical infrastructure or armed forces. He estimated “there are 11 dead and dozens wounded”. He added: Dozens of dead civilians are lying in the middle of the streets, there are very seriously injured. Affected cars along with passengers burned to the ground. What is happening in Kharkiv now is a war crime! It is a genocide of the Ukrainian people. The struggle continues! We will survive, residents of Kharkiv region, we help each other, we are one! Hello. I’m Martin Farrer taking over the reins from Sam Levin. There are more details coming out about the bombing of Kharkiv. The city’s mayor, Igor Terekhov, says at least nine people have been killed and 37 wounded in one day after the shelling in the city, according to CNN and the BBC. “Today alone, 37 people were injured, including 3 children. Four people came out of the bomb shelter to collect water and died. A family, two adults and three children were burned alive in a car. It’s really horrible,” Terekhov said, according to the BBC’s Ukrainian service. “The city of Kharkiv has never known such destruction in recent history,” the Kharkiv mayor said. Some key developments: Russian forces have launched rocket attacks that killed “dozens” of civilians in Ukraine’s second city of Kharkiv, and began a renewed assault on the capital Kyiv. The international criminal court’s prosecutor is seeking the court’s approval to investigate alleged war crimes in Ukraine. Russia used a vacuum bomb on Monday in its invasion of Ukraine, according to Oksana Markarova, the Ukrainian ambassador to the US. The office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has reported at least 406 civilian casualties, including at least 102 dead. Canada will supply upgraded ammunition and anti-tank weapons to Ukraine, prime minister Justin Trudeau said. The Ukrainian president has called for a no-fly zone for Russian missiles, planes and helicopters following the attack on Kharkiv. Fifa and Uefa have suspended Russia’s national and club teams from all international competitions until further notice. The office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has reported at least 406 civilian casualties, including at least 102 dead. “The real figure could be considerably higher, as many reported casualties have yet to be confirmed,” said Martin Griffiths, under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator, briefing the Security Council from Geneva. At least 160,000 people have been internally displaced, and the actual figure could be substantially higher. The 102 fatal victims includes seven children, the UN high commissioner for human rights, Michelle Bachelet, said earlier: More from Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s video address late Monday night, via the AP: Zelenskiy says Russian troops have intensified shelling of Ukraine, calling it an effort to force his government into making concessions during talks held Monday. In a video address, Zelenskiy says that “the talks were taking place against the backdrop of bombing and shelling of our territory, our cities. Synchronizing of the shelling with the negotiating process was obvious. I believe Russia is trying to put pressure (on Ukraine) with this simple method.” The president did not share details about the talks, but said he was not prepared to make concessions “when one side is hitting each other with rocket artillery”, the AP said. The Ukrainian president has called for a no-fly zone for Russian missiles, planes and helicopters following the attack on Kharkiv. Volodymr Zelenskiy said Russia had carried out 56 rocket strikes and sent 113 cruise missiles over five days. Earlier on Monday, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the administration did not support a no-fly zone ban, since it would draw the US into direct military conflict with Russia: “It would essentially mean the US military would be shooting down planes, Russian planes,” Psaki said on MSNBC. “That is definitely escalatory... That is not something the president wants to do.” Russia used a vacuum bomb on Monday in its invasion of Ukraine, according to Oksana Markarova, the Ukrainian ambassador to the US. Markarova raised questions about whether this was prohibited by the Geneva convention, after briefing members of the US Congress, Reuters reported. “The devastation that Russia is trying to inflict on Ukraine is large.” Vacuum bombs are “high-pressure explosives” that can have hugely destructive impacts. The laws of war prohibit “indiscriminate attacks”, as Human Rights Watch (HRW) explained in its recent breakdown of relevant international law. “Indiscriminate attacks are those that strike military objectives and civilians or civilian objects without distinction. Examples of indiscriminate attacks are those that are not directed at a specific military objective or that use weapons that cannot be directed at a specific military objective.” HRW also noted restrictions on the use of explosive weapons in populated areas, and that “heavy artillery and aerial bombs (weapons with a wide blast radius)” can pose “the gravest threats to civilians in contemporary armed conflict”. More background here from the Guardian’s Peter Beaumont on the weapons Russia is deploying: Canada will supply upgraded ammunition and anti-tank weapons to Ukraine, prime minister Justin Trudeau told reporters in Ottawa. “Canada will continue to deliver support for Ukraine’s heroic defense against the Russian military,” he said, according to Reuters. “We are announcing our intention to ban all imports of crude oil from Russia, an industry that has benefited President Putin and his oligarchs greatly.” Canada had sent non-lethal support to Ukraine earlier and has backed sanctions against Russia. Canada’s foreign minister on Sunday had also left the door open for citizens of Ukrainian descent to join the new foreign legion and take up arms against Russia. “We understand that people of Ukrainian descent want to support their fellow Ukrainians and also that there is a desire to defend the motherland and in that sense it is their own individual decision,” Mélanie Joly told reporters. “Let me be clear: we are all very supportive of any form of support to Ukrainians right now.” Ukraine’s president is temporarily lifting the requirement for entry visas for any foreigner willing to join Ukraine’s International Defense Legion and fight on Ukraine’s side against invading Russian troops, the AP reports. Volorymyr Zelenskiy’s decree takes effect Tuesday and will remain in effect as long as martial law is in place. The call for for foreign volunteers comes after Russian forces launched rocket attacks that killed “dozens” of civilians in Kharkiv and renewed its attack on the capital Kyiv. US senator Dick Durbin is requesting that the White House grant “temporary protected status” to Ukrainians currently in the US, NBC News reported. The Senate majority whip, who is also chair of the judiciary committee, told reporters that there are 29,500 Ukrainians in the US on visas, including tourists and students. Temporary protected status would allow them to remain without risk of deportation, if their visas run out. He said he was sending a letter to the Biden administration making the request. “Some of them – the visas have expired and they’re supposed to return to Ukraine. That’s unacceptable under the current circumstances,” the Democratic senator told reporters, adding that he believed Republicans would support his calls as well. Facebook and Instagram are blocking access to Russian state media outlets across the European Union, the social media parent company Meta, has announced. Nick Clegg, the company’s head of global affairs, said it had received requests from multiple governments and the EU to take steps against state-controlled Russian media outlets RT and Sputnik: Meta said it had uncovered a “relatively small” disinformation network targeting Ukraine, made up of about 40 accounts, pages and groups on the two social media platforms, reported the Guardian’s technology editor, Dan Milmo. The network ran websites posing as independent news entities and created fake personas across social media including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, Telegram as well as Odnoklassniki and VK in Russia, Meta said. Here’s more reporting on life in Ukraine as local residents shelter in bunkers to keep safe, from the Guardian’s Ekaterina Ochagavia and Katie Lamborn: From inside a makeshift bunker in the basement of their block of flats in Kharkiv, eastern Ukraine, Olia and her neighbours give an insight into their lives as they reach day five of heavy shelling from Russian forces. Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second biggest city, was the focus of dozens of Grad missiles targeting civilian areas in an apparent change of tack by Moscow. Olia, a young artist, reflects on the conflict so far and explains how she is keeping her spirits up. As Ukrainians across the country evacuate amid Russia’s full-out attacks, African, Caribbean, and Asian citizens have faced discrimination at the Ukraine-Poland border, denied entry into Poland. From the Guardian’s Emmanuel Akinwotu and Weronika Strzyżyńska: A deluge of reports and footage posted on social media in the past week has shown acts of discrimination and violence against African, Asian and Caribbean citizens – many of them studying in Ukraine – while fleeing Ukrainian cities and at some of the country’s border posts. They are among hundreds of thousands of people trying to escape the country as civilian casualties and destruction mount. The Nigerian government has condemned the treatment of thousands of its students and citizens fleeing the war in Ukraine, amid growing concerns that African students are facing discrimination by security officials and being denied entry into Poland. A deluge of reports and footage posted on social media in the past week has shown acts of discrimination and violence against African, Asian and Caribbean citizens – many of them studying in Ukraine – while fleeing Ukrainian cities and at some of the country’s border posts. More than half a million people have fled Ukraine since the Russian invasion began last week, according to the UN’s refugee agency, UNHCR. The Nigerian president, Muhammadu Buhari, said on Monday: “All who flee a conflict situation have the same right to safe passage under UN convention and the colour of their passport or their skin should make no difference,” citing reports that Ukrainian police had obstructed Nigerians. “From video evidence, first-hand reports, and from those in contact with ... Nigerian consular officials, there have been unfortunate reports of Ukrainian police and security personnel refusing to allow Nigerians to board buses and trains heading towards Ukraine-Poland border,” he said.

More on what the experience is on-the-ground for Ukrainian people: From the Kyiv Independent’s Illia Ponomarenko: Sitting alone in a wartime city in the night, sipping iced whiskey, listening to the sound of air raid sirens roar, looking into the dark of the street. I will never forgive them for what they did to the Kyiv we love. More on the US expelling 12 Russian diplomats: US officials have said that the Russian diplomats “have abused their privileges” by engaging in espionage that is harmful to national security, calling the expelled diplomats “intelligence operatives.” From journalist Jack Detsch: The White House further confirmed that that expulsion of said diplomats has been in the works for months, reported Reuters. The US has ordered 12 Russian diplomats at the United Nations to leave by 7 March, reported Reuters. At a news conference held by Vasily Nebenzya, Russia’s ambassador to the UN, Nebenzya took a phone call and confirmed shortly afterwards that 12 diplomats had been declared “persona non grata” by US authorities and instructed to leave by 7 March, according to the New York Times. Nebenzya called the expulsion of Russian diplomats a “gross violation” of the US’s position as the UN host country. “There are a lot of countries that understand what the Russian position is and what it is doing and why,” said Nebenzya. More on Turkey banning all warships from crossing the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits leading to the Black Sea from the Guardian’s Ruth Michaelson: Turkey controls the straits under the 1936 Montreux Convention, which stipulates that in a time of war Turkey may block access to warships belonging to states bordering the Black Sea, providing they are not returning to their permanent bases there. Turkish officials including Çavuşoğlu declared yesterday that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine constitutes a war, a shift in tone after officials previously described it as a “military operation,” even while condemning Russia’s actions. According to the convention, Black Sea nations must notify Turkey eight days in advance of their warships, including submarines, transiting the straits while warships belonging to other nations require 15 days notice. The decision to block ships could affect an estimated 16 Russian warships and submarines currently in the Mediterranean, some of which are part of their Black Sea fleet. Following a meeting of his cabinet, Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan stated earlier today that “we have decided to exercise the authority granted to our country by the Montreux Convention regarding vessel traffic on the straits in order to prevent the escalation of the crisis.” Erdogan has repeatedly offered to mediate between Russia and Ukraine, amid efforts to maintain its alliances with both parties. Turkey imports roughly a third of its natural gas from Russia and previously bought Russia’s S400 missile defense system, but has recently enhanced its economic and defense ties to Ukraine, including selling Kyiv Turkish Bayraktar TB2 drones. “Throughout this process, we have maintained our multifaceted diplomatic initiatives uninterruptedly to ensure peace and stability, and we continue to do so,” said Erdoğan. The international criminal court’s prosecutor is seeking the court’s approval to investigate alleged war crimes in Ukraine, reports Reuters. Prosecutor Karim Khan spoke on Friday, expressing his concerns about Russia’s war on Ukraine and saying that the court could investigate war crimes arising from the invasion. “The next step is to proceed with the process of seeking and obtaining authorisation from the pre-trial chamber of the court to open an investigation,” said Khan today about seeking approval to investigate. Lithuania previously called on the ICC to open an investigation into war crimes committed by Russia and Belarus in Ukraine, with Lithuania’s prime minister, Ingrida Simonyte, telling the Washington Post: “What Putin is doing is just a murder and nothing else, and I hope he will be in The Hague.” Several presidents of EU member states have published an open letter calling for Ukraine’s swift candidacy into the EU. The letter reads as follows: We, the Presidents of the EU member states: the Republic of Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, the Republic of Estonia, the Republic of Latvia, the Republic of Lithuania, the Republic of Poland, the Slovak Republic, and the Republic of Slovenia strongly believe that Ukraine deserves receiving an immediate EU accession perspective. Therefore, we call on the EU Member States to consolidate highest political support to Ukraine and enable the EU institutions to conduct steps to immediately grant Ukraine a EU candidate country status and open the process of negotiations. In this critical moment, we reiterate our full solidarity with Ukraine and its People. The open letter follows an appeal earlier today from Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy for Ukraine to be granted EU membership immediately under a special procedure, with Ukraine formally applying for membership. Turkey has warned both Black Sea and non-Black Sea countries not to pass warships through its Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits, reported Reuters. Turkey’s foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, spoke on the decision today, reported Turkey’s state news agency, Anadolu, saying: We implemented what Montreux says, and we will do so from now on. There has been no request for passage through the straits until today. The 1936 Montreux Convention, which Çavuşoğlu refers to, allows Turkey to restrict naval transit on its straits during wartime, though allowing warships to return to their registered bases. At least four Russian ships were waiting on Turkey’s decision to cross from the Mediterranean Sea. The launch of a joint Europe-Russia space mission to Mars due this year is now “very unlikely”, says the European Space Agency, due to sanctions linked to Russia’s declaration of war on Ukraine, reports the Associated Press. The agency said after a meeting of officials from its 22 member states that it was assessing the consequences of sanctions for its cooperation with Russia’s Roscosmos space agency. “The sanctions and the wider context make a launch in 2022 very unlikely” for the Europe-Russia ExoMars rover mission, the agency said in a statement. The launch was already postponed from 2020 due to the coronavirus outbreak and technical problems. It was due to blast off from the Baikonur spaceport in Kazakhstan in September, using a Russian Proton rocket. Postponing a launch often means waiting for months or years until another window opens when planets are in the right alignment. The goal is to put Europe’s first rover on the red planet to help determine whether there has ever been life on Mars. A test rover launched in 2016 crash-landed on Mars, highlighting the difficulty of putting a spacecraft on the planet. Read the full article here. Here is a round-up of the latest headlines: Dozens of people have been killed and hundreds more wounded in rocket strikes by Russian forces on the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, the Ukrainian interior ministry has said. Blasts were heard in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv. About 90 miles (150km) north-east of Kyiv in Chernihiv, a missile reportedly hit a residential building in the city centre, causing a fire to break out. High-level talks between Ukraine and Russia that took place on the border with Belarus on Monday morning ended without a breakthrough. Both sides agreed to keep the negotiations going and a second round of talks could take place in the coming days. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, spoke with the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, in a phone call on Monday, where he reiterated demands to halt Russia’s offensive in Ukraine. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said he had signed an official request for Ukraine to join the EU. A senior EU official said leaders may discuss the possibility of Ukrainian membership at an informal summit in March. The EU is preparing to grant Ukrainians who flee the war the right to stay and work in the 27-nation bloc for up to three years, EU officials said. Ukraine’s western allies increased weapons transfers in support of the country. Finland agreed to ship 2,500 assault rifles and 1,500 anti-tank weapons. Fifa and Uefa have suspended Russia’s national and club teams from all international competitions until further notice due to the country’s invasion of Ukraine, the two football bodies said in a joint statement. The International Olympic Committee’s executive board also recommended that international sports federations ban Russian and Belarusian athletes and officials from competing in events. That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, for now. I’ll be back tomorrow. My colleague Gloria Oladipo will be along shortly to continue bringing you all the latest news from Ukraine. In the UK, Labour MPs who equivocate over blame for the Russian invasion of Ukraine have no place in the party, Keir Starmer has told his MPs, a direct threat that any future statements will lead to suspension of the whip. Speaking at a private meeting of Labour MPs on Monday, the Labour leader said that MPs should talk up the founding of Nato in the same breath as the NHS – as a key Labour achievement. Starmer said: Labour’s commitment to democracy, the rule of law and the sovereignty of independent nations is unshakable. Vladimir Putin is attacking all those things. Nato is defending them. There are groups in this country who haven’t seemed to understand that difference. There will be no place in this party for false equivalence between the actions of Russia and the actions of Nato. But Starmer said that MPs should be honest that economic sanctions “will have a knock-on effect here” and said that the UK government should cancel the increase in national insurance contributions from April. The idea that Rishi Sunak and Boris Johnson’s tax rise on working people can still go ahead in April now is just laughable. Satellite imagery taken on Monday showed that Russian ground forces continued to move closer to Ukraine’s capital with a military convoy that stretched over 17 miles, Reuters reports. According to the private US company Maxar Technologies Inc, the satellite images show the convoy on the eastern edge of Antonov airport – containing hundreds of armoured vehicles, tanks, towed artillery and logistics support vehicles – continuing to move south towards Kyiv. Finland will provide weapons and ammunition to Ukraine, the country’s prime minister, Sanna Marin, has said. The shipment will include 2,500 assault rifles, 150,000 bullets, 1,500 anti-tank weapons and 70,000 food packages, Finland’s defence minister, Antti Kaikkonen, added. Speaking after a government meeting today, Kaikkonen told reporters: The anti-tank weapons can be used to fight armoured vehicles. Kaikkonen hinted yesterday that the Finnish government was considering scrapping Finland’s long-standing policy of not allowing weapons to be exported to war zones. The minister also said that Finland, which is not a Nato member and shares a long border with Russia, had given the green light to Estonia to send previously Finnish-owned field guns to Ukraine. Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, has appealed directly to Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine, saying they would receive full amnesty and monetary compensation if they voluntarily laid down their weapons. In a Twitter, Reznikov writes: Those of you who do not want to become a murderer and die can save yourselves. Russia’s stock market will remain closed on Tuesday, Russia’s central bank has confirmed. The bank initially delayed trading on Moscow’s stock exchange on Monday until at least 3pm local time, before saying it would stay closed all day. It has now said trading will not resume on 1 March. The European parliament will adopt a resolution on Tuesday calling on EU institutions to work towards granting EU candidate status to Ukraine and in the meantime to continue to work towards integration into the EU single market, the Guardian’s Daniel Boffey writes. The call from MEPs follows images from Kyiv of president Volodymyr Zelenskiy signing a formal letter of application for EU membership. An EU official has explained the process. The letter of application is written to the president of the council of the EU which is currently held by France. Member states, the European parliament and national parliaments are then informed of the application by the council. A meeting of the 27 EU affairs ministers, known as the general affairs council, needs to take a decision to formally seek the European Commission’s opinion on the application. It would normally take 15 to 18 months for the commission to issue its opinion, although that period could be significantly shortened “depending on the political considerations”, the official said. There is a pre-accession period of varying length, during which the candidate country adapts its institutions, standards and infrastructure to enable it to meet its obligations as a member state. The accession process involves compliance with the accession criteria including adoption and implementation of EU law. More than 360,000 people have already fled their homes in Ukraine since the beginning of Vladimir Putin’s invasion, according to the UN refugee agency, and more than 4.5 million more could follow if the fighting spreads. But among the bloodshed, moments of hope and defiance from the nation stood out and captured hearts and minds around the world, encapsulating the Ukrainian people’s resilience and determination. Turkey’s president, Tayyip Erdoğan, has said Turkey cannot abandon its ties with Russia or Ukraine, adding that Ankara would implement a pact on maritime passage from its straits to prevent an escalation of the war, Reuters reports. Turkey described Russia’s invasion as a “war” on Sunday, which allowed it to invoke articles under a 1936 international accord that will limit the passage of some Russian vessels from Turkish straits. Turkey shares a maritime border with Ukraine and Russia and has good ties with both. Speaking after a cabinet meeting, Erdoğan criticised what he called the “indecisive” stance by the US and western powers to Ukraine’s invasion, saying the approach was a sign of a failing international order. He said Turkey would not compromise from its commitments to its alliances, including Nato, but that it could also not turn back on “national interests” in its region. He repeated that he found the Russian invasion unacceptable. Fifa and Uefa have suspended all Russian clubs and national teams from all of their competitions, Uefa has confirmed. A statement by Uefa says all Russian teams, whether national representative teams or club teams, shall be suspended from participation in both Fifa and Uefa competitions until further notice. Football is fully united here and in full solidarity with all the people affected in Ukraine. Both presidents hope that the situation in Ukraine will improve significantly and rapidly so that football can again be a vector for unity and peace amongst people. Talks between Ukraine and Russia that took place earlier today were “very difficult”, the Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said. Podolyak described the Russian side as “extremely biased”. Russian forces could become more aggressive and try to encircle Kyiv in the coming days, Reuters quotes a senior US defence official as saying. The official told reporters that Russian troops were about 16 miles from Kyiv’s city centre. We expect that they’re going to want to continue to move forward and try to encircle the city in the coming days. The official, who was speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the US believes stiff Ukrainian resistance has slowed the progress of Russian troops and planning failures have left some Russian units without fuel or other supplies. One of the things that could result is a reevaluation of their tactics and the potential for them to be more aggressive and more overt, in both the size and scale of their targeting of Kyiv. Ukraine has demanded that Russia be expelled from the International Police Criminal Organization, commonly known as Interpol, accusing it of abusing the organisation and using it to target political opponents worldwide and in Ukraine, the Guardian’s Ruth Michaelson writes. The Ukrainian minister of internal affairs, Denis Monastyrsky, demanded Russia’s immediate expulsion. “Russia should be expelled from Interpol for violating its basic principles and massive misuse of tools and services to cover up its crimes and persecute political enemies, particularly in Ukraine,” the Ukrainian broadcasting organisation Hromadske reported. The Guardian has approached Interpol for comment. Interpol is a supranational police force focused on information-sharing among its 195 member states, primarily through its “red notice” system intended to alert member nations about the cross-border movement of criminals. In recent years it has increasingly drawn criticism for abuse of the red notice system by oppressive regimes including Russia, with anti-democratic nations using it to flag political dissidents in exile or escaping abuse rather than those proven to commit crimes. The former US ambassador to Moscow Michael McFaul said that Russia should be expelled from Interpol in 2018, when critics warned that doing so risked turning it into a haven for criminals. It is unclear how the process to expel a member state from Interpol’s general secretariat could work, or whether a similar action has ever been taken before. Currently North Korea is the only large country that is a member of the United Nations but not part of Interpol. Taiwan has long campaigned to be readmitted to Interpol, after it was forced to withdraw when China became a member in 1984. “There’s process in having Russia suspended from Interpol, but throwing them out to me seems unlikely,” said Ben Keith, a barrister specialising in Interpol and extradition at International Human Rights Advisors. “We don’t know how or why Syria were suspended and then allowed back in again. It’s like trying to throw Russia out of the United Nations, it’s just not realistic,” he said. Syria was quietly readmitted to Interpol in October last year. Home secretary Priti Patel told parliament today that “the Ukrainian government has today requested that the Russian government be suspended from its membership of Interpol and we will be leading all international efforts to that effect.” Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, has shared a photograph of the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, formally asking to join the European Union. Large explosions have been heard in Kyiv, according to reports. Air raid sirens have also been reported across the Ukrainian capital. The EU has formally approved making available €500m to finance the provision of equipment and supplies to the Ukrainian armed forces, including – for the first time – lethal weapons, our Brussels bureau chief, Daniel Boffey, reports. Josep Borrell, the EU’s high representative for foreign affairs, said: Following the request by the Foreign Affairs Minister of Ukraine, we are immediately responding by mobilising the European Peace Facility for two emergency assistance measures to finance the supply of lethal and non-lethal material to the Ukrainian army. This is the first time in history that the EU will be providing lethal equipment to a third country. We are doing everything we can to support Ukraine, we stand by the Ukrainian people. EU member states have also approved a proposal to deny permission to land in, take off from or overfly their territories to any aircraft operated by Russian air carriers, including as a marketing carrier, or to any Russian registered aircraft, or to non-Russian registered aircraft which are owned or chartered, or otherwise controlled by a Russian legal or natural person. Finally, it will be prohibited to make transactions with the Russian Central Bank or any legal person, entity or body acting on behalf or at the direction of the Russian Central Bank. The UK’s foreign secretary, Liz Truss, announced further economic sanctions on Monday to cripple Russian state companies and banks, the Guardian’s Jessica Elgot writes. Truss said she would legislate to introduce new powers to prevent Russian banks from clearing payments in sterling, measures that will be applied to Russia’s largest bank, Sberbank. There will be a full asset freeze on three additional Russian banks – Otkritie, Sovcombank and VEB. Legislation will ban the Russian state from raising debt in the UK and Russian companies – more than 3m in total – will be prevented from accessing UK capital markets. There will also be an export ban further imposed across a number of key sectors including microelectronics, marine and navigation equipment. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said he had written to all UK ports asking them not to provide access to any Russian flagged, registered, owned, controlled, chartered or operated vessels. Truss reiterated that she had a “hit list” of oligarchs who would face further sanctions and said the UK was also looking to go further than individuals. She said the UK would “target the families of oligarchs, the people that work for them, the people who support them and the people who enable them,” a hint at the disquiet of the use of London law firms, banks and reputation agencies.

Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said he has signed a request for Ukraine to join the European Union, Reuters reports. EU leaders may discuss the possibility of Ukrainian membership at an informal summit in March, according to a senior EU official. The official said: I think one of the reasons that this is important for President Zelenskiy is also potentially in some of the discussions with Russia on a way out. But he added that no process had been started yet. On the application (of Ukraine for EU membership) I think it’s important not to get ahead of ourselves. It obviously has not yet been received, but this whole question of the Ukraine situation is something that’s very much on the minds of the leaders. Talks between Russian and Ukrainian officials have ended at the Belarusian border, the Russian state news agency Tass cited a source as saying. Ria news agency quotes a Ukrainian official as saying that both sides will return to their respective capitals for further consultations, before participating in a second round of talks. The next round of Ukraine-Russia talks will be held in coming days, the Belarusian state news agency cited the Russian delegation as saying. The Russian delegation told Belta that they had “identified certain points from which we can predict general positions”. Russia’s actions in Ukraine are being “distorted and thwarted”, Russia’s UN ambassador, Vasily Nebenzya, has said. Speaking at the United Nations, Nebenzya blamed the crisis on Ukraine and claimed it had been unwilling to engage in dialogue. Nebenzya said: The root for the current crisis lies in the actions of Ukraine itself. For many years it sabotaged and flouted its direct obligations under the Minsk package of measures. He continued: Just recently there was a hope that in Kyiv they would reconsider and that they would indeed comply with what they signed on to in 2018. However, the latest confirmation from the senior leadership of the country was that Ukraine was unwilling to engage in this dialogue, and they were unwilling to take steps to grant special status to Donbas. Switzerland, a favourite destination for Russian oligarchs, has set aside its tradition of neutrality and announced that it will adopt all the sanctions already imposed by the European Union on Russia. Following a government meeting on Monday, Switzerland’s president, Ignazio Cassis, said the country would immediately freeze the assets of Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, the prime minister, Mikhail Mishustin, and the foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, as well as all 367 individuals sanctioned last week by the EU. Cassis told reporters today: This is a big step for Switzerland. In a statement, the Swiss government said it will implement the sanctions in coordination with the EU, adding that these were “primarily goods and financial sanctions”. In so doing, Switzerland is responding to the serious violations of international law for which these individuals are responsible. At the request of the Ukrainian government, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, has spoken to his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, the Élysée Palace has said in a statement: The president reiterated the international community’s demand that [Russia] halt its offensive against Ukraine, and reaffirmed the necessity of immediately establishing a ceasefire. With ceasefire talks between Kyiv and Moscow under way on the Belarus border, Macron also asked Putin to ensure that for the duration of the negotiations all strikes and attacks on civilians and their homes would be halted, civilian infrastructure would be preserved, and all main roads – particularly the road south out of Kyiv – would remain safe to use. Putin “confirmed his willingness to commit to all three points”, the Élysée statement said. Macron also called on Putin to ensure international humanitarian law was respected and civilian populations and aid transports protected, and asked the Russian president to “stay in touch over the coming days to avoid the situation worsening”. Priti Patel, the UK home secretary, is currently talking about the proposals for Ukrainians wanting to come to the UK. She summarises the rules in place. Some requirements and salary threshold have already been lowered, she says. She says an extra 100,000 Ukrainians will be able to come to the UK as a result of her changes. Patel says some MPs are calling for visa waivers for Ukrainians. But she says she will not agree to that. She says biometric checks are an essential part of the system. She says, on the basis of security advice, they need to stay. She says Russians are infiltrating Ukrainian forces, and extremist groups are active in the war zone. The UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, is due to speak shortly in the House of Commons. You can follow her statement on our UK politics live blog: The BBC is reporting that Fifa is set to suspend Russia from international football. This hasn’t yet been confirmed, but would follow the announcement by several countries that they would refuse to play a Russian team. In further evidence that Putin’s invasion of Ukraine is radically changing European views, a survey for the Finnish public broadcaster YLE has found a majority of the country’s population is in favour of joining Nato for the first time. According to the poll, conducted last week over three days before and immediately after the attacks with a representative sample of nearly 1,400 people, 53% of Finns would now support Finland’s accession to Nato, with 28% opposed and 19% unsure. In 2017, the last time YLE’s market researchers polled on the same question, only 19% of Finns were in favour of joining the alliance, while a survey for private broadcaster MTV in January showed 30% supported membership. Juho Rahkonen, the pollster’s research director, said described the shift in public opinion as radical and historic. “Basically, the percentages of those in favour of Nato membership and those against have changed places,” Rahkonen said. Russia’s invasion has also increased support for Nato membership in Sweden, with a survey commissioned last week by Swedish public broadcaster SVT showing 41% in favour and 35% opposed. The Finnish poll suggested that if Sweden applied to join the alliance, support for Finnish membership would rise to 66%. Finland, an autonomous part of the Russian empire for more than a century until 1917, shares a 1,340km (833 miles) border with Russia, the longest of any EU state. Though not members, Finland and Sweden closely cooperate with Nato, allowing, among other things, the alliance’s troops to exercise on their soil. Helsinki and Stockholm have also substantially intensified their bilateral defence cooperation in the past years, and secured close military cooperation with the US, Britain and neighbouring Nato member Norway. Russia warned last week that if either country sought to join the alliance they would face “serious military-political consequences” from Moscow. Reuters’ military and intelligence correspondent reports that the EU has asked for satellite intelligence to be supplied to Ukraine, to enable it to monitor troop movements: Until this week, Daniel Mediakovskyi was a history student in the Ukrainian city of Lviv. Since Sunday, however, he has been sticking rubber bands and plastic tops on to home-made bombs. “It’s practical history. It’s time for this right now,” he explained, loading another molotov cocktail into a crate. Around him, about a dozen students and young creative professionals stood around a makeshift table. All wore masks and washing-up gloves. Each had a role in a busy production line. The basement bomb factory smelled strongly of petrol and paint remover – two molotov ingredients, along with polystyrene and silver dust. Mediakovskyi – who is 20 – said his mother had woken him early last Thursday to tell him Russia had invaded Ukraine. “I knew it was going to start. My hands started shaking,” he said. After spending a day doom-scrolling on social media, he decided he would try to help. “My parents know I’m volunteering. I haven’t told my granny. She’s worried enough about things already,” he admitted. He acknowledged that a molotov wouldn’t stop the mighty Russian army. But he stressed: “It will break Russian soldiers mentally, and show them they are not welcome here.” Canada’s foreign minister has left open the door for citizens of Ukrainian descent to join the new foreign legion and take up arms against Russian troops. “We understand that people of Ukrainian descent want to support their fellow Ukrainians and also that there is a desire to defend the motherland and in that sense it is their own individual decision,” Mélanie Joly told reporters on Sunday. “Let me be clear: we are all very supportive of any form of support to Ukrainians right now.” With 1.4 million residents of Ukrainian heritage, Canada has the largest diaspora populations outside of Russia. Canadian officials have advised against travel to the country due to the current conflict, but Joly’s comments on foreign fighters echo similar support from officials in both the UK and Latvia. Ukraine’s ministry of defence tweeted Monday they had already received “thousands” of requests by foreigners to join the fight. Swiss officials have concluded that Russia is unlikely to use its nuclear weapons against the West in a conflict over Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, Defence Minister Viola Amherd said on Monday. The comments came after Switzerland adopted EU sanctions against Russia. “We are, of course, looking at all scenarios, but our investigations indicate that the likelihood of these nuclear weapons being used is low,” she told a news conference in Bern. Russian rocket attacks killed dozens of people in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv as ceasefire talks between Kyiv and Moscow got under way, with the Kremlin facing unprecedented international sanctions that have created “a new economic reality” for Russia. After four days of fighting and a slower Russian advance than many expected, the Ukrainian interior ministry adviser Anton Herashchenko said Kharkiv had been “massively fired on”, leaving “dozens of dead and hundreds of wounded”. The news came hours after the Ukrainian presidency said it had begun negotiations with a Russian delegation on the border with Belarus, aimed at achieving “an immediate ceasefire and the withdrawal of Russian forces”. With fighting continuing around several cities and the Russian rouble in free fall, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, urged Russian troops to abandon their equipment and leave the battlefield to save their lives, claiming 4,500 were already dead. We visited the Przemysl train station, near the border between Poland and Ukraine. At platform number four, trains arrive with Ukrainian refugees fleeing the country. At platform number five, dozens of Ukrainians are instead returning to the country to join the fighting. They are Ukrainians living in Poland. A man in his 50’s says: We can’t stand by and watch. We are going back to Ukraine. We are going to fight. Google, Facebook, YouTube and Twitter must do more to tackle disinformation related to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the heads of government in Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia have said. In a joint letter to the chief executives of the four companies, the four prime ministers said criticised the tech giants for not doing enough to “address the Russian government’s unprecedented assault on truth”. The letter reads: Russia’s disinformation has been tolerated on online platforms for years; they are now an accessory to the criminal war of aggression the Russian government is conducting against Ukraine and the free world. They urged the companies to suspend the official accounts of Russian and Belarusian government institutions, state-controlled media and personal accounts of the countries’ leadership that consistently disseminate disinformation about the situation in Ukraine. Russia’s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov has cancelled his visit to the United Nations in Geneva due to “anti-Russian sanctions” imposed by EU countries, Russia’s mission in Geneva has said. Lavrov had been scheduled to address the UN human rights council and the conference on disarmament in person on Tuesday. But he has cancelled his trip “due to an unprecedented ban on his flight in the airspace of a number of EU countries that have imposed anti-Russian sanctions”, the mission tweeted. RIA news agency quoted a diplomatic source as saying the decision was because Lavrov’s plane would not be able to pass through airspace that the EU has closed to Russian airlines as part of sanctions against Moscow. A Ukrainian woman and her 15-year-old diabetic daughter say they are feeling increasingly distraught after escaping the conflict in Ukraine only to be blocked from a visa the UK government announced on Sunday evening for which they are eligible. Yakiv Voloshchuk, 60, a British citizen, rescued his wife, Oksana Voloshchuk, 41 and their daughter, Veronika Voloshchuk, from Poland on 26 February. He drove from his home in London to the Polish border and waited for them to get across Ukraine’s border with Poland. He then did a return 24-hour journey by road across Europe before reaching Paris on Sunday where he hoped he would get the green light from British officials to bring his wife and daughter on the last leg of the journey to the UK. The family hoped it would be straightforward to reach the UK, especially after the publication of new Home Office guidance giving permission for some immediate family members of British citizens to apply free of charge to join their loved ones in the UK. But when Oksana and Veronika tried to apply for the new visa online they were blocked from proceeding unless they paid thousands of pounds, even though the application is supposed to be free. “We just don’t know what to do,” Voloshchuk told the Guardian on Monday morning. “My wife’s bank account in Ukraine is frozen. We have booked into a hotel in Paris for a couple of days but I want to bring my family back to the UK to my home in London. “We are getting very worried about my daughter because she is type 1 diabetic and is running out of insulin. We also don’t have a lot of money for food. She needs to eat regularly.” There is great admiration in Brussels for the leadership of Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Sources disclosed that Zelenskiy had been forced to cut short a telephone conversation with president Charles Michel on Friday evening as his location appeared to be under attack. “The president had to cut the call short. He said, ‘Charles Charles Charles, I’ve got to stop, we are under fire’,” an EU official recalled. The European Union is preparing to grant Ukrainians who flee the war the right to stay and work in the EU for up to three years, Reuters reports. At least 400,000 Ukrainian refugees have entered the EU so far, EU home affairs commissioner Ylva Johansson said after a visit to a border crossing between Romania and Ukraine. We have to prepare for millions (to arrive in the EU). Ministers on Sunday asked Johansson to prepare proposals to trigger the EU temporary protection directive, drawn up after the 1990s war in the Balkans, but never used so far. Designed to deal with mass arrivals of displaced persons in the 27-nation bloc, the directive provides for the same level of protection in all EU states, including a residence permit and access to employment and social welfare. Johansson said she hoped EU interior ministers would agree by Thursday on the protection scheme for those fleeing Ukraine. The mayor of the Ukrainian city of Vasilkiv says residents are “dreaming of peace”, the Guardian’s Shaun Walker reports. I’ve been speaking to Natalia Balasynovych, the mayor of Vasilkiv, which came under heavy fire as Russian troops tried to disable the air defence system here and capture the airport over recent days. Asked what she would like to see at the peace talks between Russia and Ukraine currently taking place, Balasynovych said she believed most people in her town would accept a compromise to stop the war. We would like to see compromise but not a capitulation. Maybe neutral status for Ukraine, if it will stop them shooting now. Because to live like this is not possible. If they will offer us only the condition of capitulation then we have to fight to the end. But I would like our children never to wake up with these bombs. Our children will have serious trauma, and people are dreaming of peace already. People used to think about a new car or iPhone, but nobody was thinking about peace. But now, they are really dreaming of peace. When old people used to wish each other peace, we didnt understand the sense of this word. Now we really understand. Russia has closed its airspace to 36 countries, Russian state news agency Tass reports. Among those countries barred from using Russian airspace are the UK, Germany, France, Italy and Canada. The move follows the EU’s announcement yesterday that it would close its airspace to Russian airlines. EU chief Ursula von der Leyen said: We are proposing a prohibition on all Russian-owned, Russian registered or Russian-controlled aircraft. These aircraft will no more be able to land in, take off or overfly the territory of the EU. The US has suspended operations at its embassy in Minsk, Belarus, and non-emergency employees and family members are being authorised to voluntarily depart the US embassy in Moscow. In a statement on Monday, US secretary of state Antony Blinken said the decision was taken “due to security and safety issues stemming from the unprovoked and unjustified attack by Russian military forces in Ukraine”. US administration officials have been briefing this morning about the decision to block dollar assets of Russia’s Central Bank and its Direct Investment Fund this morning, before markets opened, the Guardian’s Julian Borger writes. One senior administration official said: We wanted to put these actions in place before our markets open because what we learned over the course of the weekend from our allies and partners was the Russian Central Bank was attempting to move assets and there would be a great deal of asset flight starting on Monday morning from institutions around the world. So we’re taking these actions in a way that they will be effective immediately. The official said about the planning behind these measures, which date back to the much more limited US sanctions imposed after the annexation of Crimea in 2014: When we took those actions, [the Russians] decided that they were going to try and build a war chest to try and defend against the actions that we may take, if they were to take further actions in Ukraine or elsewhere in the world. We knew that this existed and we knew that ultimately, one of the things that we would need to do to ensure that our sanctions would be effective is at some point to go after that war chest and that’s exactly what we’ve done today. The US is expanding sanctions on Russia’s central bank in a move that will block Americans from engaging in any transactions with it and freezing any assets it holds in the US. In a statement today, the US treasury department said the decision would apply to the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, Russia’s national wealth fund – which is run by a close ally of Vladimir Putin – and its ministry of finance. Secretary of the treasury Janet Yellen said: The unprecedented action we are taking today will significantly limit Russia’s ability to use assets to finance its destabilizing activities, and target the funds Putin and his inner circle depend on to enable his invasion of Ukraine. Today, in coordination with partners and allies, we are following through on key commitments to restrict Russia’s access to these valuable resources.” The EU has warned that Belarus could start hosting Russian nuclear weapons after a “very dangerous” decision at a referendum to drop the country’s non-nuclear status, AFP reports. The EU’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said: We know what does it mean for Belarus to be nuclear. It means Russia will put nuclear weapons in Belarus and this is a very dangerous path. The Kremlin has claimed that President Vladimir Putin placed Russia’s nuclear deterrence forces on high alert after statements from the UK’s foreign secretary Liz Truss, PA Media news agency reports. According to the Interfax news agency, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told a press briefing: Statements were made by various representatives at various levels on possible altercations or even collisions and clashes between Nato and Russia. We believe that such statements are absolutely unacceptable. I would not call the authors of these statements by name, although it was the British foreign minister. The website of Russian state news agency Tass was hacked on Monday with the site replaced with messages claiming Russian president Vladimir Putin is forcing them to lie, Reuters reports. According to Reuters, the message read: We urge you to stop this madness, do not send your sons and husbands to certain death. Putin is forcing us to lie and is putting us in danger … It’s not our war, let’s stop him! The message has since been removed. The website now says: “Sorry, the page you are looking for is currently unavailable. Please try again later.” Dozens of people have been killed and hundreds more wounded in rocket strikes by Russian forces on the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv on Monday morning, the Ukrainian interior ministry has said. Ukrainian interior ministry adviser Anton Herashchenko said in a post on Facebook: Kharkiv has just been massively fired upon by grads (rockets). Dozens of dead and hundreds of wounded. Roman Abramovich has accepted a Ukrainian request to help negotiate an end to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, his spokesperson has said. A spokesperson for the Chelsea football club owner said: I can confirm that Roman Abramovich was contacted by the Ukrainian side for support in achieving a peaceful resolution, and that he has been trying to help ever since. Considering what is at stake, we would ask for your understanding as to why we have not commented on neither the situation as such nor his involvement. The Jerusalem Post reports that Abramovich is in Belarus assisting in the Ukraine-Russia talks, at the request of Ukraine. The Guardian’s Italy and migration correspondent, Lorenzo Tondo, arrives at the main border crossing Poland and Ukraine. We arrived this morning in Medyka, a village in eastern Poland and the main border crossing Poland and Ukraine. More than 300,000 Ukrainians have left the country since the beginning of the Russian invasion. More than half went to Poland and the majority of them passed through Medyka. They are mostly women, with their children or grandchildren. There are also many foreigners, from the Congo, Morocco, Turkey, Ghana and Pakistan. Some were students in Kyiv universities, others worked in cities bombed by the Russians. Their fate is uncertain. It is unclear whether the Polish authorities will allow them to stay. Some would like to go back to their country. Others fear they will be sent back. As for the Ukrainians, the European Commission will soon ask member states to grant temporary asylum to all Ukrainians for up to three years. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has appealed to the European Union to allow Ukraine to gain membership immediately under a special procedure, as it defends itself from invasion by Russian forces. ‘Our goal is to be with all Europeans and, most importantly, to be equal. I’m sure that’s fair. I am sure we deserved it,’ he said in a speech shared on social media. Talks between Ukraine and Russia have begun, the foreign ministries of both countries have confirmed. Ukraine has said its goal for the talks is an “immediate ceasefire and withdrawal of Russian troops”. Its delegation includes several high-ranking officials, but not its president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, himself. The Kremlin has declined to comment on its aim in negotiations, but Russian negotiator Vladimir Medinsky has said Russia wants to reach an agreement that was in the interests of both sides. Hello. I’m Léonie Chao-Fong and I’ll be bringing you all the latest developments on the unfolding crisis in Ukraine. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. It has just gone 1pm in Ukraine. Here is a round-up of the latest headlines: Talks between Ukraine and Russia got under way on the border with Belarus this morning. Ukraine had agreed to talks with Russia “without preconditions”, the office of President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said yesterday. Recent British intelligence appears to corroborate a recent report from Ukraine’s military that Russia had “slowed down” its offensive. Britain’s defence ministry has said Russia’s advance on Kyiv has been slowed by logistical failures and fierce Ukrainian resistance. The Russian central bank has increased interest rates to 20% from 9.5% after the rouble plunged up to 40% on Monday in the wake of western sanctions. The EU is expecting Ukraine’s application to join the European Union “imminently” and officials in Brussels said “this will need to be assessed very rapidly by the council and the decision made as to whether to request an urgent opinion from the European Commission”. Residents in Mariupol this morning said the port city on the Sea of Azov was surrounded by Russian forces and under heavy attack. Amnesty International has condemned Russia’s reported use of cluster munitions in Ukraine, saying an attack on a pre-school “may constitute a war crime”. Russian invasion forces seized two small cities in south-eastern Ukraine and the area around a nuclear power plant, the Interfax news agency reported on Monday, but ran into stiff resistance elsewhere as Moscow’s diplomatic and economic isolation deepened. The UK government announced a slew of measures “to prohibit any UK natural or legal persons from undertaking financial transactions involving the Russian central bank, the Russian national wealth fund, and the country’s ministry of finance”. The Russian rouble plunged nearly 30% to an all-time low versus the US dollar on Monday as markets opened for trading on the first day after western nations announced punishing economic sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. The US stepped up the flow of weapons to Ukraine, announcing on Sunday it will send Stinger missiles as part of a package approved by the White House. At least 102 civilians in Ukraine have been killed since Russia launched its invasion last Thursday, with a further 304 injured, but the real figure is feared to be “considerably higher”, UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet said on Monday. An update from Ukraine’s interior ministry late last night said 352 Ukrainian civilians have so far been killed during Russia’s invasion, including 14 children.The ministry said a further 1,684 people, including 116 children, have been wounded. Blasts were heard in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv and in the major city of Kharkiv early on Monday morning, Ukraine’s state service of special communications reported. Meanwhile, about 150km north-east of Kyiv in Chernihiv, a missile reportedly hit a residential building in the centre of the city, causing a fire to break out, the agency added. About 800 people were arrested as Belarus voted to ditch its non-nuclear status in a referendum that raises the stakes at a time when the country has become a staging ground for the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the government said on Monday. Forty Ukrainian civil society groups have come together to call on the West to establish safe zones for refugees inside Ukraine, and provide technology to help document Russian war crimes as part of a plan to make Vladimir Putin and his inner circle face justice at the international criminal court. That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, for now. My colleague Léonie Chao-Fong will be along shortly to continue bringing you all the latest news from Ukraine. The EU is expecting Ukraine’s application to join the European Union “imminently” and officials in Brussels said “this will need to be assessed very rapidly by the council and the decision made as to whether to request an urgent opinion from the European commission”. Earlier today, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy had made a video address in which he appealed to the European union for urgent accession to the 27-member bloc for the country under special procedures. For Ukraine to become an EU member state it will go through a pre-accession period of varying length, during which the candidate country adapts its institutions, standards and infrastructure to enable it to meet its obligations as a member state. Albania, the Republic of North Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Turkey are currently candidate countries. Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich is trying to broker a peaceful end to the war in Ukraine, his spokesman said. The Russian-Israeli billionaire has come under pressure to speak out following the invasion of Ukraine by Vladimir Putin’s forces, PA Media reported. There have been calls in parliament for him to face sanctions as a major oligarch “with links to the Russian state”. A spokesman for the Chelsea owner said: I can confirm that Roman Abramovich was contacted by the Ukrainian side for support in achieving a peaceful resolution, and that he has been trying to help ever since. Considering what is at stake, we would ask for your understanding as to why we have not commented on neither the situation as such nor his involvement. Abramovich’s involvement followed a request from the Ukrainian film producer Alexander Rodnyansky. There were no further details about Abramovich’s role, although it was acknowledged his influence was “limited”. “I can confirm that the Ukrainian side have been trying to find someone in Russia willing to help them in finding a peaceful resolution,” Rodnyansky said. He added: They are connected to Roman Abramovich through the Jewish community and reached out to him for help. Roman Abramovich has been trying to mobilise support for a peaceful resolution ever since. Although Roman Abramovich’s influence is limited, he is the only one who responded and taken it upon himself to try. If this will have an impact or not, I don’t know, but I am in contact with (Ukraine president Volodymyr) Zelenskiy’s staff myself, and know that they are grateful for his genuine efforts. Abramovich stepped back from day-to-day running of Chelsea on Saturday night, handing stewardship to the west London club’s charitable foundation trustees. Amnesty International has condemned Russia’s reported use of cluster munitions in Ukraine, saying an attack on a pre-school “may constitute a war crime”. The human rights charity said “a 220mm Uragan rocket dropped cluster munitions on the Sonechko nursery and kindergarten in the town of Okhtyrka in Sumy Oblast” on Friday. It added: “The strike may constitute a war crime.” Amnesty said three people were killed in the attack, including a child, while another child was wounded, PA Media reported. Cluster munitions scatter or release smaller munitions or bomblets over a wide area, increasing the potential for casualties and damage. More than 100 countries have committed never to use the weapons under the Convention on Cluster Munitions, including the UK, but neither Russia nor Ukraine have signed the agreement. Agnes Callamard, secretary-general of Amnesty International, said: It is stomach-turning to see an indiscriminate attack on a nursery and kindergarten where civilians are seeking safe haven. Plain and simple, this should be investigated as a war crime. As this human tragedy unfolds in Ukraine, any person who commits war crimes should be held individually accountable before the International Criminal Court (ICC) or another international criminal justice process at the national or international level. It is imperative that UN member states and the ICC urgently consider how to ensure the timely and effective collection and preservation of evidence of any crimes under international law committed in Ukraine. Human Rights Watch said it has also identified examples of cluster munition use. The Kremlin has accused the European Union of hostile behaviour towards Russia, saying weapons supplies to Ukraine were dangerous and destabilising and proved that Russia was right in its efforts to demilitarise its neighbour. The west has stepped up arms supplies to Ukraine in order to help it defend against a Russian invasion that Moscow calls a “special military operation” aimed at protecting civilians, Reuters reported. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov declined to comment on the number of casualties Russian forces have suffered, or to elaborate on President Vladimir Putin’s instructions at the weekend for Russia’s nuclear deterrence forces to be placed on a “special regime”. PEN International, the literary and free expression organisation, has released a letter signed by 1,040 writers from around the world, expressing solidarity with writers, journalists, artists and the people of Ukraine. The letter condemns the Russian invasion and calls for an immediate end to the bloodshed, with signatories including Nobel laureates Sveltana Alexievitch, Orhan Pamuk, Maria Ressa, and Olga Tokarczuk. Among the writers who have signed it are Margaret Atwood, Salman Rushdie, Max Porter, Paul Auster and Edmund de Waal. It reads: To our friends and colleagues in Ukraine, We, writers around the world, are appalled by the violence unleashed by Russian forces on to Ukraine and urgently call for an end to the bloodshed. We stand united in condemnation of a senseless war, waged by President Putin’s refusal to accept the rights of Ukraine’s people to debate their future allegiance and history without Moscow’s interference. We stand united in support of writers, journalists, artists, and all the people of Ukraine, who are living through their darkest hours. We stand by you and feel your pain. All individuals have a right to peace, free expression, and free assembly. Putin’s war is an attack on democracy and freedom not just in Ukraine, but around the world. We stand united in calling for peace and for an end to the propaganda that is fuelling the violence. There can be no free and safe Europe without a free and independent Ukraine. Peace must prevail. Lithuania’s government has announced it will ask prosecutors at the international criminal court to investigate “war crimes and crimes against humanity in Ukraine”. “There is new material coming in every day, but we have enough of it by now to file the request,” Lithuanian prime minister Ingrida Simonyte said in a televised cabinet meeting. A Ukrainian MP who has taken up arms to defend the country’s capital city from the Russian invasion has said she will do so “as long as needed”. Kira Rudik, the leader of the Voice party in the Rada parliament, said she was confident she could shoot a Russian soldier if one came to her home. Her comments came as the economic toll of sanctions against Russia started to become clear, with the rouble falling by 26% against the US dollar after western nations moved to block Russian banks from the Swift global payment system. Speaking to BBC Radio Scotland on Monday, the MP said: I don’t have any plans to leave. This is my city, this is my country, and I plan to defend it for as long as will be needed. There is no chance that some Russian crazy dictator would be able to push me away from where I live and where I love. Rudik is one of many in Ukraine who have taken up the offer of arming themselves, with military forces looking to bolster key positions. “We received rifles in the Ukrainian parliament and for the last couple of days I was training to use it, so right now I’m pretty confident I would be able to shoot somebody if they come to my home,” she said. “I assembled a resistance crew which now consists of 15 people, and we were able to stand up for ourselves and help our army patrol the streets.” She predicted the invasion would last between 10 days and two weeks, due to Russia’s high casualties, low morale and unpreparedness for a drawn-out conflict. At least 102 civilians in Ukraine have been killed since Russia launched its invasion last Thursday, with a further 304 injured, but the real figure is feared to be “considerably higher”, UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet said on Monday. Bachelet, addressing the opening session of the Human rights council in Geneva, said: Most of these civilians were killed by explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and air strikes. The real figures are, I fear, considerably higher. Some 422,000 Ukrainians have fled their homeland, with many more displaced within the country, she told the Geneva forum which earlier agreed to hold an urgent debate on Ukraine later this week. Forty Ukrainian civil society groups have come together to call on the West to establish safe zones for refugees inside Ukraine, and provide technology to help document Russian war crimes as part of a plan to make Vladimir Putin and his inner circle face justice at the International Criminal Court. The appeal called the Kyiv Declaration has been put together by the groups in Kyiv and other cities coordinating via encrypted app’s, and face-to-face in underground shelters. The signatories include Ukrainian Helsinki Group for Human Rights, Come Back Alive, Ukraine Crisis Media Centre and Women’s Perspectives says the world has to act now before the Russians seize power. The Declaration is a sign that despite the huge practical difficulties Ukrainian civil society is still operating, largely supporting its government and trying to urge the West to maintain the momentum of its support. The six humanitarian demands include safe zones for refugees inside the country; the provision of anti-tank missiles; sanctions to be broadened to include a ban on energy trading with Russia; a faster crack down of the wealth of Russian oligarchs abroad including withdrawal of family visas; requisition fuel, logistics support and emergency medical equipment, such as field hospitals, mobile clinics and trauma supplies. It also calls for the supply of technology and support to human rights groups, as well as lawyers, recording Putin’s war crimes. Safe or buffer zones were set up in North East Syria in 2019 following an agreement between Turkey and Russia. A less consensual zone was declared by US Britain and France in Iraq to protect the Kurdish minority after the Gulf War of 1991, when the US, Britain and France declared two no-fly zones in the north and south. An imposed safe zone in Ukraine would require air power, something that so far has been ruled out by Nato leaders since it would take Nato into direct conflict with the Russian air force. Lyubov Maksymovych, Chair of Women’s Perspectives, said: We are issuing this declaration on behalf of Ukrainian women and men who stand together to fight for their liberty and freedoms. At this moment, it’s not too late to draw a line in the sand, here in Ukraine rather than through the centre of Europe - which is what will happen if we fail. We hope that western powers have learnt from the long failures of appeasement, and the obvious duplicity and inhumanity of Vladimir Putin. This is the most important declaration I have ever signed. If it is not answered, it could also be my last. Olga Aivazovska, Chair of Elections Watchdog Opora, said: Now is the moment the world must demonstrate its support not only for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, but also for the values of democracy, human rights and freedom. With the Kyiv Declaration, we ask for your help in defeating an autocratic dictator to defend not only Ukraine but the whole democratic world and the principles it is founded on. Oleksandr Pavlichenko, the Executive Director of Ukrainian Helsinki Group for Human Rights, said: Vladimir Putin and his henchmen believe they are above the law, that they can get away with this bloodshed because the world needs their gas and oil. We must prove them wrong. We must expose the truth. We must hold them to account in a court of law. Residents in Mariupol this morning said the port city on the sea of Azov was surrounded by Russian forces and under heavy attack. They were not able to confirm that Russian marines had landed on the coast and seized the port, home to Ukraine’s tiny fleet and the command ship Donbas. “We hear planes in the sky. It’s overcast and we can’t tell whether there are ours or Russians,” Anatoliy Lozar told the Guardian this morning, speaking from a Mariupol basement where he was sheltering with his family. Lozar said he was helping evacuate civilians following another night of heavy bombardment. He said Russian warplanes had bombed the village of Shyrokyne, 20km west of Mariupol, with Ukrainian soldiers wounded. The village on the frontline with the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic was still under Ukrainian control, he said. He added: “We have become the new Stalingrad. We are killing Russians. Some have been taken prisoner. Families are sheltering in basements. They are terrified by what is happening. Huge numbers of volunteers have been joining the army. We have weapons. We will fight to the last man.” Lozar said attempts had been made to evacuate the wounded by helicopters, which has come under Russian fire. He said some Russian diversionary groups had rented apartments inside the city ahead of the invasion and had been plotting attacks. Despite a slow start to its military offensive, and fierce Ukrainian resistance, Russia was getting closer to its strategic goal of capturing the 250km strip along the Sea of Azov, between the Crimean peninsula and Mariupol. Russian forces captured the small port city of Berdyansk last night, its mayor, Oleksandr Svidlo, confirmed last night, and took over the administration building. Video showed armoured vehicles marked with “Z” patrolling Berdyansk’s residential streets. Families have been torn apart in the conflict, as Ukrainian women and children left their husbands and fathers behind after the authorities ordered men aged 18-60 to stay and fight Russian forces. “We left dad in Kyiv and dad will be selling things and helping our heroes, our army, he might even fight,” Mark Goncharuk, a young boy choking with tears, said as he and his relatives fled the capital. Here is the full video. • This post was amended on 1 March 2022 to remove an incorrect reference to the Ukraine crisis as “the biggest European conflict since the second world war”. There was fighting around the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol throughout last night, Pavlo Kyrylenko, head of the Donetsk regional administration, said on television on Monday. He did not say whether Russian forces had gained or lost any ground or provide any casualty figures. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian negotiating team have arrived for talks with Russia on the border with Belarus, according to a tweet from the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence. This is the building where the crucial talks will take place... The Ukrainian president’s office has said it’s main aim for the talks is to secure a ceasefire and a complete withdrawal of Russian troops from the country. As Moscow’s economy appears to be going into meltdown, all European airspace is closed to Russian airlines, sanctions are proliferating, and Russian oligarchs are moving their superyachts out the harm’s way, it’s worth recalling a key theory of how authoritarian leaders hold on to power. This theory – known as “coup-proofing” – was popularised by Edward Luttwak in his book Coup D’Etat: A Practical Handbook. The essence of Luttwak’s argument is that non-democratic leaders require other tools than simply coercion to coup-proof their regimes. Crucially that includes securing broader support among financial, political and security elites by sharing the spoils and prestige. In the Russian context it’s always been clear that there are enormous financial benefits to supporting Putin for a small circle. But the benefits that a lot of other individuals lower down the food chain have enjoyed are now seriously under threat. Russian invasion forces seized two small cities in south-eastern Ukraine and the area around a nuclear power plant, the Interfax news agency reported on Monday, but ran into stiff resistance elsewhere as Moscow’s diplomatic and economic isolation deepened. Blasts were heard before dawn on Monday in the capital of Kyiv and in the major city of Kharkiv, Ukrainian authorities said. But, Russian ground forces’ attempts to capture major urban centres had been repelled, they added. Russia’s defence ministry, however, said its forces had taken over the towns of Berdyansk and Enerhodar in Ukraine’s south-eastern Zaporizhzhya region as well as the area around the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant, Interfax reported. The plant’s operations continued normally, it said. Ukraine denied that the nuclear plant had fallen into Russian hands, according to the news agency. About 800 people were arrested as Belarus voted to ditch its non-nuclear status in a referendum that raises the stakes at a time when the country has become a staging ground for the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the government said on Monday. The vote sparked the biggest protests in months as thousands took to the streets in Belarus, where President Alexander Lukashenko has imposed a sweeping crackdown on dissent after a contested election challenged his grip on power in 2020. The vote to change the constitution, passed by 65% according to official data, could see nuclear weapons on Belarusian soil for the first time since the country gave them up after the fall of the Soviet Union, Reuters reported. It comes at a time when Lukashenko has fallen in line behind Russian President Vladimir Putin’s military assault on Ukraine after earlier playing an intermediary role between the two neighbours. “Despite the numerous calls from destructive Telegram channels to destabilise the situation, which were spread by citizens outside the country, mass protests did not happen. Police officers were focused on prompt response and suppression of provocations,” the interior ministry said. The new constitution also gives powers to an assembly created by Lukashenko and populated by party loyalists, officials and pro-government activists, and gives lifetime immunity from prosecution to the president if he leaves office. On Sunday, speaking at a polling station, Lukashenko said that he could ask Russia to return nuclear weapons to Belarus. “If you (the west) transfer nuclear weapons to Poland or Lithuania, to our borders, then I will turn to Putin to return the nuclear weapons that I gave away without any conditions,” Lukashenko said. Russia is interested in coming to an agreement that is in the interests of both sides at talks with Ukraine, Russian negotiator Vladimir Medinsky claimed on Monday, as officials prepare to meet near the border. Medinsky said talks were expected to begin at 12pm local time (9am GMT). Ukraine had agreed to talks with Russia “without preconditions”, the office of President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said yesterday. Zelenskiy did not sound hopeful of success, but said: “Let them try so that later not a single citizen of Ukraine has any doubt that I, as president, tried to stop the war.” Hello. Tom Ambrose here. I’ll be bringing you the latest news from Russia’s war in Ukraine over the next couple of hours. We start with news that the British defence minister Ben Wallace has said he does not expect Vladimir Putin to use nuclear weapons in his pursuit of Ukraine. “We should be worried that a state like Russia believes that the rules don’t apply to them, whether that is invading Ukraine or using nerve agent in Salisbury, but fundamentally a deterrent is what it is, a deterrent,” Wallace told Times Radio. “As much as he might be ambitious for Ukraine, I don’t think he wants to go into that space.” It comes after Putin ordered his military to put Russia’s nuclear deterrence forces on high alert, in the latest signal from the Russian leader that he is prepared to resort to the most extreme level of brinkmanship is his effort to achieve victory. It is 9.30am in Ukraine. Here is where the crisis currently stands: Recent British intelligence appears to corroborate with a recent report from Ukraine’s military that Russia had “slowed down” its offensive. Britain’s defence ministry has said Russia’s advance on Kyiv has been slowed by logistical failures and fierce Ukrainian resistance. The Russian central bank has increased interest rates to 20% from 9.5% after the rouble plunged up to 40% on Monday in the wake of western sanctions. The UK government announced a slew of measures “to prohibit any UK natural or legal persons from undertaking financial transactions involving the Russian central bank, the Russian national wealth fund, and the country’s ministry of finance”. Meta Platforms, the company formerly known as Facebook, said a hacking group used Facebook to target a handful of public figures in Ukraine, including prominent military officials, politicians and a journalist. The Russian rouble plunged nearly 30% to an all-time low versus the US dollar on Monday as markets opened for trading on the first day after western nations announced punishing economic sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. The US stepped up the flow of weapons to Ukraine, announcing on Sunday it will send Stinger missiles as part of a package approved by the White House. A referendum in Belarus on Sunday reportedly approved a new constitution renouncing the country’s non-nuclear status at a time when the former Soviet republic has become a launchpad for Russian troops invading Ukraine, Russian news agencies report. A US official believes Belarus is preparing to send soldiers into Ukraine in support of the Russian invasion. The Washington Post spoke to an unnamed US administration official on Sunday evening who said the deployment could begin as soon as Monday. An update from Ukraine’s interior ministry late last night said 352 Ukrainian civilians have so far been killed during Russia’s invasion, including 14 children.The ministry said a further 1,684 people, including 116 children, have been wounded. Blasts were heard in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv and in the major city of Kharkiv early on Monday morning, Ukraine’s state service of special communications reported. Meanwhile, about 150km north-east of Kyiv in Chernihiv, a missile reportedly hit a residential building in the centre of the city, causing a fire to break out, the agency added. For any tips and feedback please contact me through Twitter or at samantha.lock@theguardian.com Recent British intelligence appears to corroborate with a recent report from Ukraine’s military that Russia had “slowed down” its offensive. Britain’s defence ministry has said Russia’s advance on Kyiv has been slowed by logistical failures and fierce Ukrainian resistance. The ministry said on Monday: The bulk of [President Vladimir] Putin’s ground forces remain more than 30km to the north of Kyiv their advance having been slowed by Ukrainian forces defending Hostomel airfield, a key Russian objective for day one of the conflict. Logistical failures and staunch Ukrainian resistance continue to frustrate the Russian advance.” Heavy fighting continues around Chernihiv, a city in northern Ukraine, and the north-eastern city of Kharkiv, the defence ministry said in an intelligence update posted on Twitter. Both cities remain under Ukrainian control, it said. According to the latest operational report released by the Ukrainian military this morning, Russia has “slowed down its offensive” after firing on military and civilian airfields, military control points, air defence facilities and critical infrastructure. The force added that Ukrainian artillery fire destroyed “more than five columns of enemy equipment and enemy manpower”. “The enemy is demoralised and bears heavy losses,” the general staff of the armed forces said. “Frequent cases of desertion and disobedience were noted. The enemy realised that propaganda and reality were different.” Meanwhile, the military said approximately 5,300 Russian personnel had died since the invasion begun, as well as the destruction of 191 tanks, 29 planes, 29 helicopters and 816 armoured fighting vehicles. The Guardian has not been able to independently verify these numbers. Tensions are rising at the £3bn Surrey estate in England where Russian oligarchs call home. The secretive owners of mansions at St George’s Hill will be nervous about making an appearance on Liz Truss’s hitlist after the foreign secretary warned rich Russians linked to Putin that the UK government “will come after you” and ensure oligarchs have “nowhere to hide”. Russians and those from former Soviet states own more than a quarter of the 430 luxurious homes in St George’s Hill, a heavily guarded 964-acre estate near Weybridge, Surrey, where mansions have changed hands for more than £20m each. Read the full story from the Guardian’s Rupert Neate below. The Russian central bank has increased interest rates to 20% from 9.5% after the rouble plunged up to 40% on Monday in the wake of western sanctions. More on the financial curbs announced in the UK this morning. The government said: The UK government will immediately take all necessary steps to bring into effect restrictions to prohibit any UK natural or legal persons from undertaking financial transactions involving the CBR, the Russian national wealth fund, and the ministry of finance of the Russian Federation.” Britain said there would be more designations announced this week. “These measures demonstrate our determination to apply severe economic sanctions in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,” finance minister Rishi Sunak said. “The Bank of England continues to take any and all actions needed to support the government’s response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine,” Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey said. The new sanctions also include new restrictions on Russian financial institutions and measures to prevent Russian companies from issuing transferable securities and money market instruments in the UK. Britain said it would have “a power to prevent designated banks from accessing sterling and clearing payments through the UK”. The UK government has just announced a slew of measures “to prohibit any UK natural or legal persons from undertaking financial transactions involving the Russian central bank, the Russian national wealth fund, and the country’s ministry of finance”. Specifically, it also aims to: prevent the Central Bank of Russia from using its foreign reserves of $630bn “in ways that undermine sanctions imposed by us and our allies”; stop designated banks from accessing sterling and clearing payments through the UK; strengthen significantly trade restrictions against Russia; prevent Russian companies from issuing transferable securities and money market instruments in the UK. The Moscow Exchange has also delayed the start of trading this morning. The exchange platform will open forex and money market trading at 10am Moscow time on Monday, three hours later than the usual opening time for the forex market, and will suspend trading on the forex repo market, the bourse said. The Belarusian currency and stock exchange similarly said it would push back the start of trading by one hour on Monday as the market braced for a huge sell-off. The news comes as the Russian rouble plunged to an all-time low on Monday, and the dollar soared against nearly all peers after western nations announced fresh sanctions to punish Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. Russia’s central bank confirmed on Monday it has ordered brokers to suspend the execution of all orders by foreign legal entities and individuals to sell Russian securities. The bank also said in a statement it had yet to decide whether to open markets other than the forex and money market on Monday. Powerful photos of Ukrainian citizens preparing homemade molotov cocktails to defend their territory are emerging. Below, a group of women use empty bottles and other materials in the city of Uzhhorod in western Ukraine. More than 90% of Ukrainians say they support president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, according to a poll conducted by the Rating Sociological group this weekend. According to the data compiled from 2,000 respondents from across Ukraine, 91% of respondents backed Zelenskiy, while 6% said they did not support him and 3% remained undecided. The support is a threefold increase from December last year. Residents in Crimea and the rebel-held areas in eastern Ukraine were excluded from the survey, according to the BBC. When asked about the chances of Ukraine being able to repel the Russian assault, 70% said they believed it was possible. The Belarusian foreign ministry has published a photo of the venue of today’s Russia-Ukraine negotiations. “In Belarus, everything is ready to host Russia-Ukraine negotiations. Waiting for delegations to arrive,” the ministry said in a tweet around 9am local time. It follows the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s announcement on Sunday that Ukrainian and Russian delegations will meet without preconditions at Pripyat in Belarus. Zelenskiy said he was not confident that any progress would be made, but that he would try. “I’ll say frankly, like always, that I don’t believe in the result of this meeting,” he said. “But let’s try, so that no citizen of Ukraine would have any doubt that I, as president, tried to stop the war when there was even a chance.” While thousands of refugees are fleeing Ukraine as Russia continues its invasion, others have sought to return to their embattled homeland from Poland – some to reunite with family, some to fight. “I am afraid, but I am a mother and I want to be with my children”, Lesa explained, as she readied herself to enter Ukraine, adding “it’s scary, but I have to”. Watch their stories in the video below. We also have a fantastic rundown from the Guardian’s Shaun Walker in Kyiv detailing the past week for those currently in Ukraine. It was a week of grim transformation for the lives of almost every Ukrainian, after Vladimir Putin’s decision to launch a ruthless assault on the supposed “brotherly nation” of Ukraine, which began in the early hours of Thursday morning. Hundreds of thousands have fled to the west of the country to avoid Putin’s advancing troops and missiles, with many spending long hours in queues at checkpoints on the way and at the borders with Poland and Hungary. Many more have stayed and made the decision to fight. “I’ll be honest, I’m really scared. It’s the first time I’ve held a gun,” said 50-year-old Alexander, brandishing a shotgun at a barricade near a village outside Kyiv on Saturday. Behind him, an elderly man looked out across nearby fields through a pair of binoculars, while women were preparing crates of molotov cocktails, as if it was the most natural thing in the world. Here’s a report from the Guardian’s diplomatic editor, Patrick Wintour, on how the phone has become the Ukrainian president’s most effective weapon. In a string of phone calls from a besieged Kyiv, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has persuaded the west to agree to a set of sanctions against Russia that were inconceivable a week ago. Sensing how European public opinion is responding to the bravery of his people, Zelenskiy has been constantly on the phone to western leaders, using his Twitter feed to cajole, encourage, scold and praise his allies. In the process, sanctions regarded as unthinkable a week ago have become a moral baseline. The pace at which the west has been agreeing to the new sanctions has also left the lawyers, officials and bankers gasping for air, officials admit, as they work under severe pressure to turn headlines into reality. One leader’s office said: “We are in awe of him. He may not eventually be able to save Ukraine, or change Russia, but he is changing Europe.” Read the full story here: Meta Platforms, the company formerly known as Facebook, said a hacking group used Facebook to target a handful of public figures in Ukraine, including prominent military officials, politicians and a journalist, amid Russia’s ongoing invasion of the country. Meta said in the last 48 hours it had also separately removed a network of about 40 fake accounts, groups and pages across Facebook and Instagram that operated from Russia and Ukraine targeting people in Ukraine, for violating its rules against coordinated inauthentic behaviour, Reuters reports. A Twitter spokesperson said it had also suspended more than a dozen accounts and blocked the sharing of several links for violating its rules against platform manipulation and spam. It said its ongoing investigation indicated the accounts originated in Russia and were attempting to disrupt the public conversation around the conflict in Ukraine. In a blog post on Monday, Meta attributed the hacking efforts to a group known as Ghostwriter, which it said successfully gained access to the targets’ social media accounts. Meta said the hackers attempted to post YouTube videos from the accounts portraying Ukrainian troops as weakened, including one video which claimed to show Ukrainian soldiers coming out of a forest and flying a white flag of surrender. The rouble plunged nearly 30% to an all-time low versus the US dollar on Monday as markets opened for trading on the first day after western nations announced punishing economic sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. The rouble dropped to as low as 119 per dollar, and was last down 28.77% at 118 from its closing price 83.64 on Friday. The sanctions include blocking some Russian banks from the Swift international payments system, leading investors to anticipate a run on the Russian currency as people try to change their money for dollars and other denominations. “The escalating crisis in Ukraine will force markets to price in a substantially higher geopolitical risk premium,” strategists at the Australian bank Westpac said on Monday. “The Ukrainian situation is volatile.” Amid the mounting tensions, western nations have said they will tighten sanctions and buy and deliver weapons for Ukraine, including Stinger missiles for shooting down helicopters and other aircraft. The US stepped up the flow of weapons to Ukraine, announcing on Sunday it will send Stinger missiles as part of a package approved by the White House. Germany also plans to send 500 Stingers and other military supplies. However, the Biden administration has said the US will not “put boots on the ground” and US Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield reiterated this stance in an interview with CNN on Sunday. “We will not give up the capital, Ukraine is already winning,” are the remarks Ukraine’s minister of defence has given this morning in response Russia’s attempt to break into the capital overnight. Oleksii Reznikov said it has so far been “96 hours of resistance” and “4 days of dedication, courage and faith” for the Ukrainian people, vowing his country will win the war. In an statement given late last night which has seen been published on the Ukrainian ministry of defence website, Reznikov said: “The enemy who came to our land will go in a known direction. Therefore, we advise the occupiers to go home. It’s not too late. “It is useless to intimidate Ukrainians. It will not be possible to break our defenders.” Amid reports of a referendum in Belarus approving a proposal to renounce its non-nuclear status, a US official believes Belarus is preparing to send soldiers into Ukraine in support of the Russian invasion. The Washington Post spoke to an unnamed US administration official on Sunday evening who said the deployment could begin as soon as Monday. It’s very clear Minsk is now an extension of the Kremlin,” they said. The Guardian has not been able to independently verify the claim. A referendum in Belarus on Sunday reportedly approved a new constitution renouncing the country’s non-nuclear status at a time when the former Soviet republic has become a launch pad for Russian troops invading Ukraine, Russian news agencies report. The move could theoretically allow Russia to place nuclear weapons on Belarusian soil for the first time since the country gave them up after the fall of the Soviet Union. The referendum result will come into force 10 days after its official publication, Russian news agency RIA Novosti reported. On Sunday, Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko said: “If you [the west] transfer nuclear weapons to Poland or Lithuania, to our borders, then I will turn to Putin to return the nuclear weapons that I gave away without any conditions.” According to RIA, the head of the Belarus central elections commission, Igor Karpenko, said that 65.16% of citizens voted for the amendments to the constitution in a referendum. This number was also reported in the Kyiv Independent newspaper, also citing that 65.16% of citizens allegedly supported these constitutional amendments. The west has already said it will not recognise the results of the referendum, which is taking place against the background of a sweeping crackdown on domestic opponents of the government. An update from Ukraine’s interior ministry late last night said 352 Ukrainian civilians have so far been killed during Russia’s invasion, including 14 children. The ministry said an additional 1,684 people, including 116 children, have been wounded. Blasts were heard in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv and in the major city of Kharkiv early on Monday morning, Ukraine’s state service of special communications reported. Kyiv had been quiet for a few hours prior to that, it said in a brief statement on the Telegram messaging app. “Explosions are heard again in Kyiv and Kharkiv. Before that, it was calm in the Ukrainian capital for several hours,” the agency said. The mood in the city, however, remains defiant. Meanwhile, about 150km north-east of Kyiv in Chernihiv, a missile reportedly hit a residential building in the centre of the city, causing a fire to break out, Ukraine’s state service of special communications also reported. “A rocket hit a residential building in the centre of Chernihiv. A fire broke out, two lower floors are on fire. The number of injured is currently unknown,” the agency said in a brief statement on the Telegram messaging app. The development follows reports from the Kyiv Independent newspaper of an air raid alert that sounded in the city about 4.30am local time with residents being urged to head to the nearest shelter. Hello it’s Samantha Lock with you as we unpack all the latest developments on the unfolding crisis in Ukraine. As dawn breaks in Kyiv and Ukrainians across the country wake for the fifth day since their Russian neighbour invaded, here is where the situation currently stands: For any tips and feedback please contact me through Twitter or at samantha.lock@theguardian.com Russian president Vladimir Putin ordered his military command to put nuclear deterrence forces on high alert, in response to what he called “aggressive statements” by Nato countries. The US condemned the order and said Putin was “manufacturing threats that don’t exist in order to justify further aggression”. The rouble plunged nearly 30% to an all-time low versus the US dollar on Monday as markets opened for trading on the first day after western nations announced punishing economic sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. The European Central Bank said on Monday morning that Sberbank Europe, a fully owned subsidiary of Sberbank Russia, which in turn is majority owned by the Russian state, is failing or likely to fail. Belarus reportedly approved in a referendum a new constitution renouncing the country’s non-nuclear status at a time when the country has become a launch pad for Russian troops invading Ukraine, Russian news agencies report. The move could theoretically allow Russia to place nuclear weapons on Belarusian soil for the first time since the country gave them up after the fall of the Soviet Union. The package of constitutional reforms also extended the rule of leader Alexander Lukashenko. Ukraine’s interior ministry says 352 Ukrainian civilians have been killed during Russia’s invasion, including 14 children. It says an additional 1,684 people, including 116 children, have been wounded. The ministry did not give any information on casualties among Ukraine’s armed forces. Ukraine’s deputy defence minister, Hanna Malyar, claimed Russian forces had lost about 4,300 servicemen, a figure it was not possible to verify independently. Satellite imagery taken on Sunday showed a large deployment of Russian ground forces including tanks moving in the direction of the capital Kyiv from approximately 40 miles (64 km) away. The city remains in Ukrainian hands. The images released by Maxar Technologies showed a deployment comprising hundreds of military vehicles and extending more than 3.25 miles (5km), the company said. The convoy contained fuel, logistics and armoured vehicles including tanks, infantry fighting vehicles and self-propelled artillery, it said. Ukraine has agreed to peace talks with Russia “without preconditions”, the office of Volodymyr Zelenskiy said. The Ukrainian president said he was not confident that any progress would be made, but “let’s try, so that no citizen of Ukraine would have any doubt that I, as president, tried to stop the war when there was even a chance”. British prime minister Boris Johnson said he called the Ukrainian president who said he believed the next 24 hours was a “crucial period” for Ukraine. Johnson said he would do all he could to help ensure defensive aid from the UK and allies reached Ukraine. The EU will buy weapons for Ukraine. Multiple European countries are offering military aid to Ukraine, including Sweden, which hasn’t sent weapons to a country in armed conflict since the Soviet Union’s invasion of Finland in 1939. The EU plans to close its airspace to Russian aircraft, including the private jets of Russian oligarchs. The bloc will also ban Russian-state backed television channels RT and Sputnik. A rare emergency special session of the UN general assembly is due to be held on Monday in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, marking the first time in 40 years the security council has made such a request. The UN refugee agency has said more than 368,000 people have fled Ukraine into neighbouring countries. Up to 4 million people could become refugees if the situation continues to worsen, the UN said. The World Health Organization warned that thousands of lives are at risk from falling Ukrainian oxygen supplies. Russian billionaires Mikhail Fridman and Oleg Deripaska have spoken out against Putin’s invasion. Fridman said: “I am deeply attached to Ukrainian and Russian peoples and see the current conflict as a tragedy for them both.” Deripaska called for peace talks to begin “as fast as possible”. Pope Francis said he was “heartbroken” by the war and appeared to take direct aim at Putin by condemning people who “trust in the diabolic and perverse logic of weapons”. The UK will send an additional £40m in humanitarian aid to Ukraine, while the US said it is sending nearly $54m (£40m) in new humanitarian aid Russian police detained more than 1,400 people at anti-war protests on Sunday, an independent monitoring organisation said, lifting the tally for crackdown arrests to over 4,000."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2019/oct/16/martin-forwood-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2019-10-16T15:24:48Z","webTitle":"Martin Forwood obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/16/martin-forwood-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2019/oct/16/martin-forwood-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Martin Forwood obituary","bodyText":"For 30 years Martin Forwood, who has died of cancer aged 79, was a thorn in the side of the huge Sellafield nuclear complex in Cumbria. With his unrivalled collection of original documents on the nuclear industry he was a more reliable source of information to journalists and campaigners than the government-owned industry British Nuclear Fuels, or anyone in Whitehall. But Martin was not just an armchair campaigner; he went in for many imaginative direct actions, including, in 2003, chaining himself to a railway line to halt a nuclear waste shipment from Italy destined for Sellafield. When he came up in court charged with a Victorian-era offence of obstructing the railway, which carried a potential sentence of life imprisonment, the judge acknowledged his sincerity, reduced the charge and fined him. Afterwards he collected some radioactive mud from the Esk estuary near Sellafield, fashioned it into something resembling a mud pizza and delivered it in a lead-lined suitcase to the Italian embassy in London. It was taken away by the Environment Agency, which tested it, found it was indeed radioactive and eventually, forced by its own regulations, returned it to Sellafield to be disposed of in the Drigg low level waste depository. On another occasion, donning a wetsuit on a dark night, Martin swam out to a nuclear waste ship anchored in Barrow harbour, fixing industrial magnets to the keel to show how vulnerable the ship was to terrorist attack. Next day he rang the harbour master to tell him about his action and navy divers removed the magnets. Security was stepped up but Martin was never charged; he suspected the authorities were too embarrassed to take things any further. For a man who had once been a servant of the state – as a detective in the Cheshire constabulary, a military policeman along the Berlin Wall, and a scientific officer for the Met Office – a career switch to undermining the establishment had previously seemed unlikely. His parents, Brittain Forwood, a farm manager, and his wife, Nan (nee McAfee), came from wealthy backgrounds; his great-grandfather was Sir William Forwood, a Liverpool shipowner and philanthropist. Born in Borth Wen, Anglesey, Martin went to Shrewsbury school and then joined the merchant navy as an officer cadet with the Clan Line shipping company, sailing repeatedly to the Bay of Bengal. Tiring of that life, he joined the Cheshire police force in 1959 before signing up with the Royal Military Police in 1963, which immediately posted him to Berlin. He did a three-year stint patrolling both the Berlin Wall and the border fence between East and West Germany, witnessing many failed attempts by East Germans to reach the west. He also periodically guarded Spandau prison and escorted its most celebrated prisoner, Rudolf Hess, to hospital. In Berlin in 1965 he married Ann Pasterfield and a year later left the army. Back in Britain he decided to take up mushroom farming at Blackwater in Cornwall, but was unable to make a go of it and, with a young family to support, soon signed up with the Met Office. After several postings around the country over a period of 10 years, including at the chemical weapons establishment at Porton Down, Wiltshire, he was eventually sent to Cumbria. When his marriage to Ann broke down he left the Met Office and began to work on local markets as a picture framer before opening up a shop in Millom, near Barrow. When Lee, the 12-year-old son of his new partner, Janine Allis-Smith, developed leukaemia in 1980 – one of a number of children in Cumbria to do so at the same time – local anti-nuclear campaigners suspected a connection with plutonium releases from Sellafield and formed a group that eventually became Cumbrians Opposed to Radioactive Environment (Core). Martin and Janine volunteered to help the group and began a long battle to get British Nuclear Fuels to stop discharging millions of gallons of liquid waste laced with plutonium into the Irish Sea. The uncovering of the leukaemia cluster led to campaigns by Greenpeace, and finally persuaded the government in the late 1980s to order the discharges to be dramatically reduced. For Martin, however, the concession was too little too late. Lee had survived but Martin had since come to the conclusion that Sellafield’s vast industrial complex, which employed 10,000 people but was producing nothing except spent uranium and plutonium for no useful purpose, should be shut down. He and Janine, supported by the Goldsmith Foundation, became full-time campaigners and ran the Core office in Barrow from the early 90s. They gathered official documents, received leaks of secrets, collected scientific evidence and assembled masses of reports from which they produced regular briefings for the media. Martin would patiently explain to journalists the workings of the nuclear industry, its many failed projects and its inability to deal with its waste. Despite his vehement opposition to nuclear power he was respected even by industry figures for his honesty and probity. The Sellafield Stakeholder group, a largely pro-industry committee that he quizzed at each of its meetings, gave him a standing ovation when he and Janine won an international award for his campaigning work – as well as some much-needed funds to carry on the work. In the year before his death he was boosted by the announcement that all nuclear reprocessing activity would end at Sellafield by 2020, and that plans for new reactors at the nearby Moorside nuclear power station had been abandoned. He is survived by Janine, by his daughters, Louise, Rebecca and Deborah, from his marriage to Ann, which ended in divorce, by Janine’s two sons, Lee and Steve, and by his sisters, Kate and Jane. • Martin Grant Forwood, anti-nuclear campaigner, born 4 May 1940; died 6 October 2019"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2022/jun/08/australia-live-news-update-energy-emergency-talks-anthony-albanese-indonesia-interest-rates-labor-coalition","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-06-08T08:35:44Z","webTitle":"Ministers to allow energy market operator to procure and store gas – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2022/jun/08/australia-live-news-update-energy-emergency-talks-anthony-albanese-indonesia-interest-rates-labor-coalition","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2022/jun/08/australia-live-news-update-energy-emergency-talks-anthony-albanese-indonesia-interest-rates-labor-coalition","fields":{"headline":"Ministers to allow energy market operator to procure and store gas – as it happened","bodyText":"That is where we will leave the live blog for Wednesday. Here’s what happened: Federal, state and territory energy ministers have agreed following an emergency meeting to allow the Australian energy market operator to store gas to combat price spikes, and to give regulators more power over the energy market to provide more transparency. The ministers have also agreed to advance a national transition plan. ANZ, NAB and Commonwealth Bank all followed Westpac and passed on the full rate rise announced by the Reserve Bank yesterday. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has vowed to review the former government’s decision to lease Port of Darwin to a Chinese company. The Nadesalingam family left Perth on their way back to the regional town of Biloela in Queensland after the new Labor government granted them bridging visas. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will be given more resources to deal with the massive rise in passport applications and the associated logjam it has created. The high court ruled that laws allowing dual nationals to be stripped of their Australian citizenship for suspected terrorist activities are unconstitutional. The high court also ruled that the detention of an Aboriginal non-citizen was not unlawful, because he was detained before a landmark decision that found they were beyond the reach of the aliens power. The chief executive of the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA), Martin Hoffman, resigned. Tasmania announced plans to raise the age of detention from 10 to 14. There were 59 Covid-19 deaths reported across Australia. You might have seen the family heading home to Biloela – the Nadesalingam family – previously referred to in our reportage as the Murugappan family. The family was known as the Murugappans for a number of years in Australia. We’ve asked the family, and they have asked to be known now, collectively, as the Nadesalingam family. There are four people in the family: Nadesalingam Murugappan (known as Nades), Kokilapathmapriya Nadesalingam (known as Priya) and their two Australian-born daughters, Kopika and Tharnicaa. Murugappan is Nades’s second name. It is common for Tamil families to use a patronymic naming convention, with the father’s first name taken as a second name by other family members. On whether the capacity market mechanism includes coal, Bowen says he supports new technologies, particularly storage technologies and renewables. He says the system will be expert-led and designed by the energy security board, which will have a draft out in the near future. He says having Aemo have some national gas storage would have helped alleviate the issues faced last week. He says the crisis is the result of poor planning under the previous government and if the new government implements its policies, he doesn’t accept that it’s inevitable that these crises will continue. Bowen: lack of planning led to crisis in energy market Bowen says ministers will work towards the national transition plan in the lead-up to the July meeting, saying the reason the crisis in the energy market has emerged is that there hasn’t been enough planning about the changes necessary. He said: We need more transmission, we need more renewables, we need more storage. Now we have the integrated systems plan in Australia. Which is a world’s best practice document in relation to energy to electricity transmission, about poles and wires and big transmission across the country. That’s a world class document. He said the integrated systems plan will become a national transition agreement. I stress this meeting was never designed to solve all the problems in one go, but it does give us more tools, gives the regulators more tools, to do the work that is necessary. We received very important and useful briefings from the regulators about the tools they would like. And we agreed to give them those tools. And also we made those other agreements that I’ve referred to. Energy minister Chris Bowen is speaking after the emergency meeting of state and territory energy ministers. He says they have received briefings from the regulator, the energy market operator, and the chair of the Energy Security Board. The ministers agreed that they would work to enhance the powers of the regulators to ensure that they have full transparency particularly in the gas market, and to ensure that all behaviour is in the best interest of the market and consumer at all times. He said there was “no silver bullet, no magic answers”. The Australian Energy Market Operator will be given powers to procure and store gas in situations such as the one faced last week. He said: There’s storage facilities around the country. We agreed to work to give AEMO that power and to give them that power expeditiously. Again, that won’t work today, but it will give us the capacity and the tools necessary to manage this crisis going forward. And to avoid crises like this into the future. Albanese vows to review low voter turnout in NT at last election The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has promised to review the Northern Territory’s low voter turnout at the last election, AAP reports. Albanese blamed the former Coalition government, saying it had restricted the electoral commission from enrolling voters in the territory’s two seats. “There was a deliberate policy of the former government to restrict people voting in the territory,” he told reporters in Darwin on Wednesday. “They ripped resources out of the electoral commission.” Just 66.79% of eligible voters cast a ballot in the seat of Lingiari, which covers most of the territory, at the 21 May election. The voter turnout was higher in Darwin, with the urban seat of Solomon recording a 79.48% turnout of eligible voters. However, it was still well below the national average of 89.20% according to data from the Australian Electoral Commission. Albanese said the former coalition government “restricted” the number of AEC workers enrolling voters. “It was an outrage what occurred and then there was a lack of resources to enable people to vote. That was a part of the former government’s design,” he said. “This was straight out of the right-wing Republican playbook. “My government will look at what we can do to make sure that every Australian, every Australian, no matter where they live, no matter who they are, have equal right to be on the role and equal right to vote.” The AEC has previously been accused of excluding some Indigenous Territorians from the electoral process because it won’t automatically enrol people without a postal address, saying it can’t send a written notice to them. The policy affects residents in remote Indigenous communities where homes don’t have mailboxes and most residents rely on a central postal address. The AEC estimates 85.8% of the NT’s eligible population are enrolled to vote. The energy ministers’ meeting has run a bit over time. Some reaction, though, from participants include, the vibe of the meeting was “very different”, and “very collegiate”, and “a huge change of tone”. The comparison is with the previous very irregular and infrequent meetings when Angus Taylor was the energy minister (and for reducing emissions and industry). New immigration minister ‘being briefed’ on options for Murugappan family The immigration minister, Andrew Giles, says he is thinking about how to resolve the Murugappan family’s plight. They’ve been put on bridging visas which allowed them to return to Biloela, but that is not permanent. Giles - who has the power to determine the next stage - says he is “being briefed on the options available” to allow the family to rebuild their lives in Biloela and will make a decision as soon as possible. Labour shortage and biosecurity among priorities for new agriculture minister The new agriculture minister has outlined the labour shortage, biosecurity and “skyrocketing” input prices as short-term priorities in his new portfolio, AAP reports. In his first major address as minister Murray Watt told a horticulture conference in Brisbane that climate change, sustainability and improving agriculture’s value were his longer-term concerns. “I already can see that workforce, biosecurity and input costs are probably the three most serious short term challenges ... We’re onto it ... and I’m up for any ideas,” Senator Watt said on Wednesday. He said he recognised farmers are on the front line of climate change and can take advantage of opportunities in agriculture “to make a buck out of making adjustments to deal with climate change”. He told more than 1000 producers while he’s not a farmer, “farming is in my blood” and his family had a long connection with agriculture. “I’d like to think myself as someone who is as comfortable in the city as I am in the country,” he said. The Queensland senator told the packed audience he realised the current labour shortage was a huge concern for the horticulture industry. “It’s arguably the single biggest challenge facing hort in particular in our country at the moment,” he said. Prior to the election. Labor committed to dumping the coalition’s “agriculture visa” in favour of expanding the Pacific Australia Labour Mobility scheme. Watt said feedback from stakeholders had been that the expansion of PALM is welcome but more is needed to attract skilled and semi-skilled workers to agriculture. “I’ll be frank with you. There’s more that we could be doing around that as the new government ... to solve those challenges,” he said. He wants to prioritise the training and employing of Australians in agriculture. “I am very much open to discussion with the industry about what else we can do around skilled migration in particular to meet some of the challenges that we have,” he said. Clean energy makes up more than a third of national market, report shows As the energy ministers huddle for their emergency/crisis/urgent (take your pick) but routine meeting this afternoon, Hugh Saddler, a well-regarded energy analyst, has released a monthly energy report with the Australian National University. Quite a few handy charts, including this one showing how the share of clean energy in the national electricity market (which should really be called the “eastern Australian grid”) has increased to more than a third. It’s notable, too, how renewables change over the season. Not surprisingly, there’s not a lot of solar in winter. Among the mainland states, South Australia is by far the most reliant on renewable energy. The report also notes how rising gas prices and the falling reliability of coal-fired power has sent prices in the national market soaring. “[O]ver the 12 months from May 2021 to May 2022, monthly median spot wholesale prices increased by over five times in Victoria and South Australia, six times in Tasmania and New South Wales, and seven times in Queensland,” the report said. “Average prices rose steadily for the whole period up to March 2021 and have increased drastically since then.” Finally, here’s the chart showing the availability of coal plants in the NEM. As the units age, they need more maintenance, and it probably won’t be surprising to see the time offline increasing over time, particularly as the schedule closure date approaches. Next to shut will be AGL’s Liddell power station in NSW’s Hunter Valley. One of the 1680 megawatt plant’s four units shut permanently in April, while a second unit had a “malfunction” three weeks ago and is not expected to return to service until the second half of July. The whole plant remains scheduled for permanent closure next April. The shadow assistant treasurer, Stuart Robert, has spoken to Sky News about the Murugappan family’s return to Biloela. Robert said: [The family] were found not to be owed protection by every court in the land. So on what basis is Mr Albanese very proud of his decision to give them [permanent residency]? What advice did he receive? Or did he just, under weight of public opinion, decide to sweep aside every court judgment and make this decision? And what impact will have this on the people smugglers networks? Noting here Robert said “PR” for permanent residency, but the family has only been given bridging visas so far. Robert said he “understands compassion – we should have enormous compassion – our hands should be filled with grace” but he was concerned the government may have made the decision without proper advice. Somehow, despite all the grace and compassion, Roberts settles on the formulation that “every court in the land” found the family were “not deserving of protection” – as if the fact it wasn’t owed as a minimum legal obligation is the beginning and end of the moral conversation about whether residency should be granted. Robert was also asked if Peter Dutton’s reshuffle had punished backers of Scott Morrison such as himself. He said: No, Mr Dutton has made that very clear that’s not the case. I’m joining Angus [Taylor] on the economic team as shadow assistant treasurer and shadow financial services minister, a role I’ve held in government. I’m looking forward to working with a great colleague, Angus, in that economic team. Peter and I are very close, as two of the most senior Queensland MPs in the state and we get on well. The National Australia Bank has become the last of the big four to announce they are raising their variable home loan rates after the RBA cash rate decision. Karen Andrews suggests high court decision on citizenship-stripping power is a test for Labor The Coalition has responded to the high court ruling striking down the home affairs minister’s powers to strip dual nationals of Australian citizenship for engaging in suspected terrorist activities. Remember, Labor members of the parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security warned these powers were likely unconstitutional before the Coalition passed them. A spokesperson for the shadow home affairs minister, Karen Andrews, said: The Coalition has never backed down from doing what is necessary to protect Australians from the threat of terrorism. How Labor responds to this will show if they can walk the walk or if they are all talk on national security. So the high court overturning Andrews’s decision to strip Delil Alexander of citizenship is a test for Labor? ANZ has become the third of the big four banks to raise home loan rates by the full RBA increase of half a percentage point. In a statement, the bank said the increase will be effective from 17 June and applies to all its variable interest home loan rates. On a $450,000 loan balance, monthly repayments will increase by $115 a month, ANZ said. The bank said it was reviewing the rates it offers from savings accounts, which in general across the banks have not kept up with the RBA’s increases, but will offer a new 2.25% rate for 11-month term deposits from next Monday. ANZ’s head of retail banking for Australia Maile Carnegie said: We know rate changes affect customers differently and some may be looking for support as they reorganise their household budgets, particularly if they haven’t experienced many rate increases before. With Westpac, CBA and now ANZ having jacked up rates, all eyes are now on NAB. Labor to bring forward bill to allow territories to pass assisted dying laws, minister says The new local government and territories minister, Kristy McBain, is on ABC Afternoon Briefing and has been asked about whether the Albanese government will give the ACT and NT the power to pass assisted dying laws, through the repeal of laws that restricted territory rights. She says she is looking forward to working with an expanded crossbench to bring forward a private member’s bill or private senator’s bill to repeal the laws. She said she has had initial discussions with ACT chief minister Andrew Barr and is hoping to have a discussion with NT chief minister Natasha Fyles. When it comes to a vote, she says it will be a conscience vote for Labor: But when that allows territories to make decisions which may be against the faith of some of our members, you can see how they end up conflicted, and that’s why if that private or private member’s or senator’s bill comes forward the Labor party would allow a conscience vote so it doesn’t go against somebody’s personal, religious or cultural beliefs. She says she isn’t sure of what the numbers in either chamber would be like but given the number of states that have already passed voluntary assisted dying laws she expects there would be enough to pass the law. McBain says she would vote in favour of the bill: My mum worked in aged care for the last 15 years of her career and I’ve had grandparents who have had terminal illnesses who have had to go through probably a difficult end to their lives and I think at the end of your life when you have a terminal illness you should be able to make a decision about when that ends for you. The assistant foreign affairs minister, Tim Watts, says the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will be “urgently increasing numbers of processing and call centre staff as quickly as staff can be recruited and trained” to deal with the delays in passport applications. There will be 35 call centre staff added this week, another 35 next week, and a minimum of 250 additional staff added over the next six weeks, Watts said. He said: Before the pandemic, there were around 7,000-9,000 applications per day. Recently, that has increased to around 10,000-12,000 per day, with many applications that weren’t lodged during the pandemic being lodged now. Yesterday, the number of applications reached a daily record of 16,417. This problem was predictable and is the result of the previous government dropping the ball and failing to properly plan for the surge in passport applications when borders re-opened. It shouldn’t be Australians who suffer the consequences of these failures. While it will take some time to get back on track, we will continue to work with DFAT to make sure the required resources are delivered. I urge Australians who are preparing to travel again to check the latest travel advice on Smartraveller. Labor warned over religious discrimination bill The peak body advocating for LGBTQI+ people has urged the federal government to strengthen protections for the community when it introduces laws to guarantee religious freedom, AAP reports. It comes after attorney general Mark Dreyfus told the ABC on Wednesday that draft legislation will be brought to parliament, but did not give a timeframe. “At its core, there is ... an appropriate structure of anti discrimination law, bringing in a prohibition on discriminating against people on the grounds of their religious belief,” he said. Equality Australia’s chief executive Anna Brown warned Labor against repeating the same “mistakes” of the Morrison government, which she said would have “wound back protections” for LGBTQIA people. The group says the government in its first 100 days should remove “outdated” exemptions it says are used by religious schools against gay teachers and students. “Labor must first act swiftly to fill gaps in protection for LGBTQ+ students and teachers in religious schools and extend those same protections to all staff working in any faith-based organisations, and LGBTQ+ people accessing services from religious providers,” Brown said. The Commonwealth Bank has become the second bank to pass on the RBA rate increase in full, after Westpac. The CBA increase will come into effect in just over a week. Energy ministers to discuss supply shortages and soaring prices Energy ministers gather at the top of the hour for their first conference (albeit on video) since the new federal government took office. It’s fair to say this time last week was a bit of scramble to secure energy supplies, particularly for gas. This afternoon, meanwhile, things are a bit more settled, with Queensland’s wholesale prices bouncing around a bit but were recently at zero cost: We look here at some of the key issues on the agenda of today’s meeting, including the case for a domestic gas reservation (likely to be promoted by Victoria), and also the Energy Security Board’s update on post-2025 market designs. The ESB’s presentation will likely discussion about a potential “capacity market”, for which new federal climate and energy minister Chris Bowen set some key tests last October. Bowen, though, has made a point since being sworn a week ago that he’s not in favour of “ad hocery” or “knee-jerk responses”. Let’s see whether the market avoids the types of spasms (think blackouts) that might prompt such a move. Thirty thousand NSW homes will receive free solar panel systems or be able to upgrade their appliances to energy-saving models in a bid to tackle rising energy prices, AAP reports. About one million low income earners in NSW, including concession, health care and DVA Gold Card holders, are already eligible for a scheme that provides $285 rebates on their annual power bills. Under the state government’s new $128m “energy bill buster” scheme, they will now be able to apply to trade in their rebates for a solar system to be installed at their homes. The government says solar power will save consumers $600 on power bills annually. People who can’t have solar panels installed, such as those living in apartments, can instead swap the rebates for up to $4,000 to upgrade their appliances. “This energy bill buster package is all about sending (Russian president Vladimir) Putin’s power prices packing,” NSW treasurer Matt Kean told reporters on Wednesday. There were a number of factors driving up the cost of power in the state, and the war in Ukraine was a significant factor in driving up gas prices, he said. Unscheduled outages at coal-fired power plants, along with the rise in gas prices, meant there was no cheaper alternative fuel source to fill the gap. Premier Dominic Perrottet said the opportunity to invest in green technology would ease the pressure on household power bills, while also being good for the environment. “We want to use the NSW budget to help families budgets and set up a brighter future for the people of our state.” The scheme will initially be rolled out to 30,000 households, and further funding of the scheme will be considered depending on the uptake. The Labor party said the government had failed to meet its promises on solar batteries made in the lead up to the last state election, creating a shortfall of more than 19,600 batteries. Girl dies after allegedly falling from moving vehicle in NT A seven-year-old girl has died after she allegedly fell from a moving vehicle in a remote part of central Australia, AAP reports. The girl was travelling with her father about 4pm on Sunday near Harts Range, northeast of Alice Springs, when the incident occurred, Northern Territory police said. “During the journey it is alleged she fell from the moving vehicle suffering serious head injuries,” a police spokeswoman said on Wednesday. The girl was flown to the Royal Adelaide Hospital for Women and Children where she died from her injuries on Monday. Major crash detectives have travelled to the area to investigate. The town of Harts Range and the neighbouring Indigenous community of Atitjere are located 215km from Alice Springs at the base of the Harts Ranges. United Airlines will fly direct from San Francisco to Brisbane International Airport three times a week from late October in a major aviation deal for the state. The Boeing 787 Dreamliners will offer around 40,000 international seats a year. Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said it was the first time the airline would fly to Queensland. The airline ... is the largest and longest-serving US carrier in the Australian market. This airline route is also of strategic importance for Queensland when it comes to growing our share of the international tourism market. San Francisco is a major hub for United with direct connectivity to 80 North American cities. By securing these flights, Queensland becomes an easy choice for thousands of visitors throughout the US. Just some more on treasurer Jim Chalmers’ earlier comments on aiming to hand down his first budget on 25 October, via AAP. Chalmers told a conference hosted by Sky News and the Australian he expected interest rate rises would dampen activity in the economy while affecting house prices and savings. They would also disproportionately affect the lowest income earners, he told Australia’s Economic Outlook 2022 conference on Wednesday. “All of this will flow through to the budget. They will put significant pressure on a budget that already has its share of difficulties, including a relatively significant structural deficit, and now with those higher borrowing costs,” Chalmers said. His comments came after the Reserve Bank of Australia raised the cash rate by a larger-than-expected 50 basis points at its monthly board meeting on Tuesday, and warned that further increases would be needed to contain inflation. Chalmers also warned there wouldn’t be “automatic upgrades” to the budget. “Commodity prices are helping but some of the other upgrades are not necessarily eventuating,” he said. “We have got a lot of pressures that weren’t in the budget that we inherited, like some of the ongoing costs with Covid-19.” Business Council of Australia chief executive Jennifer Westacott said budget repair is important, as this allowed the government to respond to Covid. “But we have got to do that in a way that’s about growth,” she told the conference. “I don’t think you cut your way out of this, you have got to grow your way out of this.” Australian courts may not be able to enforce an order that Google pay John Barilaro more than $700,000 in defamation damages because of free speech protections in US law, legal academics say. Matt Kean says claims of political deal over NSW koala policy ‘absolutely untrue’ NSW treasurer Matt Kean has denied claims from an outgoing Liberal colleague that he did a political deal that she claims “virtually condemns NSW koalas to extinction”, AAP reports. NSW Liberal MP Catherine Cusack posted a series of tweets on Tuesday allegedly showing her and former NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian arguing over text message about the government’s proposed koala policy in 2020. “I am posting these messages to prove I had no knowledge of the disgusting deal @Matt_KeanMP did with the Nationals that virtually condemns NSW koalas to extinction,” Cusack wrote in a follow up tweet. Kean, the former environment minister, says the claims are “absolutely untrue”. “Everyone knows that I fought to protect koalas,” he said on Wednesday, citing the $193m funding package for the endangered species he secured while environment minister.” “I think it’s a matter of public record that my relationship with (former NSW Nationals Leader) John Barilaro nearly broke the government over the stance I took to protect koalas.” Cusack also said her requests to meet with Dominic Perrottet in recent months had been rebuffed, however the premier said the pair met on Wednesday morning. “Catherine has some concerns in relation to bills and the like,” the premier said. “That’s only a natural thing and when people get into parliament they have different views on things and I think that’s important.” The government spent four years developing its koala SEPP (State Environmental Planning Policy), and while trying to pass the legislation endured a bruising stoush that threatened to destroy the Liberal-National coalition. It was defeated when Cusack crossed the floor, telling the parliament the policy “has zero to do with protecting koalas”. The text messages appear to show a lengthy exchange with Berejiklian urging Cusack to support the bill. Berejiklian allegedly later texted that Ms Cusack’s lack of support meant the koala protection policy had been quashed and later informed her she had lost her role as parliamentary secretary. Greens MP Cate Faehrmann is scheduled to introduce a Great Koala National Park bill into parliament on Wednesday. She urged the Labor Party to support the bill but tweeted “all indications are they won’t vote for it”. The new shadow minister in the NDIS policy area, Michael Sukkar has responded to the CEO’s resignation by demanding communications or discussions minister Bill Shorten had about the CEO role be made public. Ukraine war should not distract Quad from focus on Indo-Pacific, Indian high commissioner says India’s high commissioner to Australia says the Quad – which also includes the US and Japan – must remain focused on the Indo-Pacific rather than be distracted by the war in Ukraine. Manpreet Vohra, the high commissioner to Australia, also said he hoped the interim trade deal between Australia and India – which was agreed before the election – would be ratified by the Australian parliament in coming months. Speaking to reporters in Canberra, Vohra said India had no reason to doubt the new Australian government’s commitment to the Quad. He said prime ministers Anthony Albanese and Narendra Modi had a “very warm, very productive” meeting in Tokyo shortly after the new Australian government took office. It’s quite clear from even before the elections and our interactions with the Labor party, that there is very strong bipartisan support for further deepening the India-Australia relationship, to the support for the comprehensive strategic partnership and all the different pillars of that, all the new areas that we believe India and Australia can get together to improve things for themselves, as well as for the region. And that has been on display since the election of the new government. India, which has had long-standing ties with Russia, has been the Quad partner most reluctant to condemn Moscow over the invasion of Ukraine. Asked whether it was a strength or weakness of the Quad that the grouping was able to accommodate those differences, Vohra said: It’s certainly a strength. I think the four Quad members are such good friends with each other, and collectively, that it allows you to, you know, understand differences that one might have in terms of policy positions, etc. So we explain, frankly, to them what we can do or cannot do, they do the same with us. And there is that understanding and appreciation of each other’s constraints and abilities. And in any case, there is agreement by all four that the Quad cannot lose sight of the Indo-Pacific, which is its focus, and events in Europe, while they will have an impact, cannot distract us from our attention on the future of the Indo-Pacific region. Vohra was speaking after an event marking the launch of the Australia-India Leadership Dialogue, to be held on 6 September in New Delhi. The dialogue will be co-chaired by Atlassian co-founder Mike Cannon-Brookes and Australia India Institute chief executive Lisa Singh, who is a former Labor senator. Victorian transport company fined $490,000 after worker died in truck rollover A Victorian transport company has been slapped with $490,000 in fines after a worker died in a truck rollover in the state’s southeast, AAP reports. The truck driver died while attempting to round a bend in a milk tanker at Leongatha in May 2018. An investigation into the company he worked for, Peter Stoitse Transport Pty Ltd, found it failed to give its drivers detailed information and training about how to drive the tankers, despite nine rollovers since 2009. An inspection at its Leongatha depot in July 2018 resulted in major defect notices for 80% of a fleet of prime movers and tanker trailers, meaning they had to be immediately taken off the road. In September 2018, the company did not notify WorkSafe about a separate truck rollover at Echuca. That incident left another driver hospitalised with a serious laceration. Peter Stoitse Transport pleaded guilty in the Latrobe Valley County Court on Wednesday to two charges of failing to provide and maintain a safe working environment, and one charge of failing to notify WorkSafe about an incident. It was hit with $490,000 in fines. The largest of $300,000 was for failing to provide a safe system of work. The company showed a clear disregard for its drivers’ safety, WorkSafe health and safety executive Narelle Beer said: Tragically, two workers have been killed in vehicle accidents so far this year and WorkSafe will continue to take strong enforcement action against those duty holders refusing to keep their workers safe on the road. Here are the latest coronavirus numbers from around Australia today, as the country records at least 59 deaths from Covid-19: ACT Deaths: 1 Cases: 821 In hospital: 89 (with no people in ICU) NSW Deaths: 10 Cases: 7,825 In hospital: 1,283 (with 38 people in ICU) Northern Territory Deaths: 0 Cases: 254 In hospital: 14 (with no people in ICU) Queensland Deaths: 15 Cases: 4,257 In hospital: 312 (with 12 people in ICU) South Australia Deaths: 0 Cases: 2,995 In hospital: 237 (with 5 people in ICU) Tasmania Deaths: 0 Cases: 667 In hospital: 38 (with no people in ICU) Victoria Deaths: 25 Cases: 9,519 In hospital: 522 (with 29 people in ICU) Western Australia Deaths: 8 Cases: 7,720 In hospital: 283 (with 15 people in ICU) My colleague Luke Henriques-Gomes’ full report on the NDIS chief resigning today. Cost of living in Northern Territory well above national average Families are struggling as inflation runs rampant in the Northern Territory, social services groups say. AAP reports the cost of living in the territory – the Consumer Price Index – jumped six per cent in the 12 months to December 2021, well above the national average of 3.5%, the NT’s peak body for the social and community services sector said. “Territorians are doing it tough,” NT Council of Social Service chief executive Deborah Di Natale said. “We need the commonwealth and NT government to recognise these increases for critical services like health, childcare and education, and for living costs such as housing, transport and food.” Darwin rents rose eight per cent compared to 0.4% nationally in the same 12-month period, according to the council’s recently released annual cost of living report. Housing in Darwin - including utilities - also increased, up 15.9% compared to four per cent nationally. Darwin families were also hit at the petrol bowser, with automotive fuels rising 45.9% compared with 32.3% nationally. The increases were even more severe for people in remote communities, where the price of diesel is up to $2.75 per litre, according to Fuel Price Australia. Overall, it means Territorians living on low incomes or on income support payments are finding it tough to pay for everyday expenses. “Significant cost of living pressures have emerged or intensified for Territorians, and at an unsustainable and disproportionate rate in certain areas,” Di Natale said in the report. “The implications of this for people’s physical and mental health, and ability to participate in the workforce and in society is well known. This reality is preventable and should not be accepted.” The council called on the federal government to increase social security payments, such as Jobseeker and the Remote Area Allowance, twice yearly. The council has also called on the NT government to extend concessions for electricity, driver’s licences, prescription glasses, vehicle registration and bus fares. The Tasmanian government has announced it will raise the minimum age of detention from 10 to 14 as part of its overhaul of the youth justice system in Tasmania. Minister for education, children and youth, Roger Jaensch said: We know that detention does not support rehabilitation or reduce the likelihood of reoffending for younger children. Early exposure to a detention environment can also further traumatise young people, expose them to problem behaviours of older detainees and increase criminal networks. There will always be a need for secure detention as a last resort for a very small minority of young people who commit the most serious offences, and to ensure community safety. This change will help ensure that the detention of young people in Tasmania is truly a last resort. The powers for police to arrest, search and hold young people 10 and over will remain for the purposes of investigating crime. Legislation will need to pass through parliament, which Jaensch said will be part of a suite of legislation overhauling the youth justice system, anticipated to occur near the end of 2024. Age of criminal responsibility is being considered through the national meeting of attorneys general, seeking national consistency. Change the Record welcomed the commitment, but said the age of criminal responsibility should also be raised to 14. Cheryl Axleby, co-chair of Change the Record said: Children belong at home, in school and with their families – not in handcuffs, courtrooms or prison cells. It is a relief to hear the Tasmanian government commit to keeping tiny children out of prisons, but they must do more to protect and support our children in community and give them the opportunities they deserve to thrive. This announcement stops short of the reforms we need – not just to keep children out of prison cells, but to ensure children under 14 are never arrested, handcuffed or put in police lockup but are instead supported with therapeutic and age-appropriate services when they need our help. Consumer groups back government commitment to regulate buy now, pay later sector Consumer groups have welcomed the commitment by new financial services minister Stephen Jones, reported by Guardian Australia this morning, to regulate buy now, pay later (BNPL) services as credit. They’re currently exempt from consumer protection rules due to a loophole in the law and consumer groups say a voluntary code set up by the industry has too many gaps. In a statement, Financial Counselling Australia, Choice, Anglicare Australia, the Consumer Action Law Centre (Calc) and the Financial Rights Legal Centre welcomed Jones’s commitment. “This is fantastic news for consumers, giving them better protection and rights under the credit laws,” said Fiona Guthrie, the CEO of Financial Counselling Australia. Alan Kirkland, the CEO of Choice, said: Buy now, pay later is unregulated credit and is causing harm to consumers. We welcome closing this loophole as a priority for the new government. Governments in countries like the UK and New Zealand have recognised the need to protect people from these unregulated products. It is time for Australia to catch up. Gerard Brody, the CEO of Calc, said: The industry code has far too many gaps. It isn’t mandatory and there are many BNPL companies that haven’t signed up. There are only vague upfront assessment processes, that do not require the company to only provide loans that are affordable and suitable. Moreover, there is virtually no consequences for breaching the code – it does not contain sanctions or consumer rights equivalent to credit laws. You can read our interview with Jones here: SA cabinet ministers head to Limestone Coast for community forum South Australia’s Labor cabinet will meet in the state’s south-east with the premier, Peter Malinauskas, again talking up the importance of the region. AAP reports the premier will visit local forestry sites and business leaders on Wednesday ahead of a community cabinet forum in Mount Gambier later in the day. That will give locals an opportunity to speak directly with cabinet ministers. On Thursday, there will be a formal cabinet meeting with Malinauskas to also visit the local TAFE college. “The Limestone Coast plays a vital role in the economic and social fabric of our state,” the premier said. The cabinet’s trip to the southeast comes on the back of significant election promises from Labor which included $52.5m for the regional health system, $39m for a new technical college in Mount Gambier and $19m to support the state’s forestry industry. The government also promised to invest in the local lobster and livestock industries, establish a Cross Border Commissioner to support the region’s interests and upgrade local roads. Let’s return briefly to Anthony Albanese’s vow to review the circumstances surrounding the Port of Darwin lease “in an orderly way”. The prime minister was asked about Chinese company Landbridge Group’s long-term lease over the port when he spoke with reporters in Darwin this morning. He said: What I’ve said is what I said prior to the election. And I will do what I said I would do on this and every other issue, which is we’ll have a review of the circumstances of the port. The [Northern Territory] chief minister is conscious of the fact that we will do that. And we’ll do that in an orderly way. Let’s step through the history of this contentious issue and where things landed during the previous term of parliament. The NT’s then Country Liberal party government granted a 99-year lease over the Port of Darwin to Landbridge Group in 2015. Last year, the Morrison government announced a review of the arrangements at the Port of Darwin on national security grounds. For the record, we should add that Landbridge Group vowed to cooperate with that review while stating that it had struck the deal with the NT government “in good faith”. On 1 April, then foreign minister Marise Payne dismissed a news report that Defence’s review had found there were no national security grounds sufficient to recommend a government intervention to overturn the lease. She told Senate estimates the review was “still in process”. Basically, it sounds like Defence had completed its part of the review, but other national security agencies were also involved, and officially the review had never ended. During the election campaign, Albanese and his frontbenchers were highly critical of the lease arrangements. When asked on 26 April what a Labor government would do about the Port of Darwin, Albanese said it “should never have been sold to the Chinese”. He said that decision was “extraordinary” because it was a strategic port, “and it is something that I’ve said we would examine if we were in government”. Pressed on whether he would break the lease, then opposition leader Albanese told Radio 5AA: Well, I’ve said that we would examine those issues if we were, if we’re successful, in May. There are issues that you would need to take advice on. Issues of sovereign risk and other issues that you need to take account of and they are not unimportant. But it is important that Australia is prepared to stand up for our national interest. Given that the federal review never officially ended, it sounds like Australia’s security agencies will pick up where they left off in the previous term of parliament. Striking public service workers rally outside NSW parliament over pay rise Thousands of striking public service workers have rallied outside NSW parliament to vent their displeasure over the government’s promised 3% pay rise, AAP reports. Public Service Association (PSA) members ranging from prison officers, park rangers, school support staff, ServiceNSW workers and civilian police employees are striking for 24 hours. Union members marched up Macquarie Street in Sydney on Wednesday morning, but the crowd did not match the size of recent strikes by teachers and nurses. “We’re hoping for a very good turnout,” PSA general secretary Stewart Little said, adding he would love to see 30,000 members hit the streets in protest. The strike comes after the PSA last week gave an ultimatum to the government to commit to a pay rise. Premier Dominic Perrottet on Monday announced the 2.5 % annual cap on public sector wage rises would be increased to 3% next financial year, with an additional 3.5% the following year, depending on productivity gains. PSA senior vice president Juliette Sizer told members a fair pay rise “starts at 5.2%”, 0.1% above inflation. The government also announced frontline health staff would receive a $3,000 bonus in recognition of their work during the Covid-19 pandemic. Little said no one is more deserving of the bonus than health workers but it should include PSA members who work in the ministry of health. “The epidemiologists, the contact tracers ... stopping the pandemic overwhelming our community,” he said. Teachers, prison officers and emergency service workers should also get the payment, he added. Unions have called for the wages cap to be raised further to at least reflect the rate of inflation, while some want it abolished altogether. Labor has also been pushing for changes to the bargaining process between unions and the government. Opposition leader Chris Minns has described it as “fundamentally broken”. Perrottet said the wage rise was fair and responsible within the confines of the 21 June budget. “It’s not just the public servants that are going through a challenging time, it’s every person across NSW after coming through the pandemic,” Perrottet said. Last Tuesday in October likely for the new Labor government’s budget. Victorian energy minister says too much gas being exported Victoria’s energy and environment minister, Lily D’Ambrosio, has suggested too much of our gas is being exported overseas, blaming “profits” of gas producers for there not enough being reserved for domestic use. “We know that for too long, we’ve had too much gas exported to other countries,” D’Ambrosio said outside Victorian parliament this morning. We need to bust a few myths. Some of the myths are that this country is running out of gas. It’s not running out of gas. The problem is too much of what is being produced, certainly to the north of the country, is being exported overseas, and that’s because of profits being made by the large producers. She also flagged the potential “redesign” of the so-called gas “trigger” mechanism, which would force gas companies to supply more product domestically, but can currently only be activated from 1 January. Her comments come ahead of the “crisis meeting” of Australia’s energy ministers over the current power issues. Daily Mail’s citing of student’s gender and sexuality found to breach press code The Daily Mail has removed photos and references to a youth worker’s gender identity and sexuality in an article after the article was found to be in breach of the Press Council code. The report referenced that the student is non-binary and queer in a story critical of an article they had written in a the Meanjin magazine regarding the Brereton report on alleged war crimes in Afghanistan. A complaint, not from the subject of the article, to the Press Council raised concerns that prominent references to the student’s sexual orientation and gender identity were not relevant to the article. The Press Council found that in prominently referring to the student’s sexual orientation and gender identity the Daily Mail failed to take reasonable steps to avoid contributing to substantial prejudice and that there was not sufficient public interest justifying doing so. The council said it welcomed the amendment of the article to remove the photos and references. South Australia has recorded 2,995 new Covid cases and no deaths. There are 237 cases in hospital, with five in intensive care. You’ve got to respect the homage to his predecessor. With that, I will pass you into the highly capable hands of Josh Taylor, who will keep you company for the rest of the day. Stay warm! Dreyfus says ‘no threat’ to Australia after high court ruling on terrorism laws The attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, has released a statement in response to the Delil Alexander ruling in the high court. To recap, the high court has ruled powers used by the former home affairs minister to cancel the Australian citizenship of a dual national suspected of terrorist activities are unconstitutional. Dreyfus said: The government notes the decision of the High Court of Australia in Alexander v Minister for Home Affairs [2022]. The government will examine the judgment and its implications in detail. It is important to note that there is no threat to Australia as a result of today’s decision. The Australian government has a range of measures available to manage the risk posed to Australians by individuals offshore including the Temporary Exclusion Order regime which can prohibit an individual returning to Australia for up to two years. In Queensland, a police investigation has been launched after the discovery of human remains on the Sunshine Coast. Two men who were four-wheel driving discovered the remains in a remote forest track in the Glass House Mountains about midday on Tuesday, police say. Police have declared a crime scene and preliminary examinations indicate the remains are human. They will be sent for further scientific and forensic analysis including establishing gender. The New South Wales court of appeal has thrown out an extraordinary order requiring Nine Entertainment to hand over copies of a 60 Minutes program about the Double Bay cosmetic surgeon Joseph Ajaka before it was broadcast. Last month Ajaka won a court order at the 11th hour preventing the broadcast, and the publication of articles in the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age. But the appeals court has ruled the order was a mistake and should be set aside because there was “no such power, jurisdiction or authority” for “preliminary discovery against a party or parties who were already defendants to proceedings”. The court ruled that the orders “made by Justice Rothman on the afternoon of 13th May 2022 were not sustained by any jurisdiction in the court. Those orders must therefore be set aside”. Nine has been approached for comment. High court says Love and Thoms precedent did not retrospectively apply to Aboriginal man’s detention case We’ve got a bit more detail on the case of Aboriginal man Brendan Thoms, after the high court found his detention by immigration authorities was lawful. The judges unanimously followed a precedent that section 189 of the Migration Act can validly authorise detention of people who are “reasonably suspected of being unlawful non-citizens”. The reasonableness is judged at the time of the detention. The judges said the high court’s prior decision in the 2020 case of Love and Thoms that Aboriginal could not be “alien” to Australia did not retrospectively make that suspicion unreasonable. Thoms was detained because he was a New Zealand citizen whose Australian visa had been cancelled, which were objective facts that provided reasonable grounds for his detention. Thoms’s lawyer, Claire Gibbs, said: Our client Brendan Thoms is very disappointed with this outcome. He spent more than 500 nights locked up in immigration detention. He deserves justice and accountability for the way he was treated and the ongoing harm it has caused. The federal government now has an important opportunity to ensure that the findings of the historic Love Thoms case are upheld and followed, so that no First Australians will ever again be declared aliens and threatened with deportation. The Morrison government appealed against the release of an Aboriginal non-citizen (Montgomery) to try to overturn the original Love and Thoms decision, a bid to restore commonwealth power to deport Aboriginal non-citizens. The Albanese Labor government is yet to say if they will pull the case. The Western Australian premier, Mark McGowan, has released the state’s Covid update. There have been 7,720 new cases reported to 8pm last night and eight further deaths notified to WA Health. The deaths date back to previous days however they are within the 24-hour reporting period. There are 283 people being treated in hospital with the virus including 15 people in ICU. Court of appeal overturns order requiring Nine to hand over draft story Channel Nine’s 60 Minutes, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age have won an appeal against a recent court decision requiring the outlets to hand over draft copies of an upcoming investigation to an interested party. Lawyers for the cosmetic surgeon, who launched court action after he saw a promo for the 60 Minutes episode before he had responded to journalist Adele Ferguson, have indicated they will make another attempt. NT police investigate death of seven-year-old Northern Territory police are investigating the death of a child at a remote location in central Australia. Police say around 4pm on Sunday a seven-year-old girl was travelling with her father and several others in a vehicle around 25km east of Harts Range. Police allege during the journey she fell from the moving vehicle, suffering serious head injuries. The girl was taken to the Harts Range clinic and later the Royal Adelaide hospital for women and children but died from her injuries. Major crash investigation unit detectives travelled to the area to investigate the circumstances surrounding the incident. Investigations continue. Macquarie Bank raises interest rates by 0.5 points The Australian foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, has condemned North Korea for “reckless and destabilising behaviour” over its ballistic missile launches. In a statement, Wong also called on the UN Security Council to “respond decisively to North Korea’s continued violation of its legally binding resolutions”. She said Australia would “continue to strictly enforce” those resolutions and would “encourage all countries to do likewise”. She signalled that Australia would keep its autonomous sanctions against North Korea under review. Wong said: Australia strongly condemns North Korea’s launch of eight ballistic missiles this week – which violates multiple UN Security Council resolutions and undermines the global non-proliferation regime. The test on 5 June is the latest demonstration of the regime’s reckless and destabilising behaviour. North Korea has launched a total of 31 ballistic missiles so far this year, including six intercontinental ballistic missiles. Its apparent preparations to undertake a nuclear test are likewise gravely concerning and a threat to the peace and security of our region. Australia calls on the Security Council to respond decisively to North Korea’s continued violation of its legally binding resolutions. We further urge Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs and return to meaningful dialogue with the United States and the Republic of Korea. Permanent peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula can only be achieved through dialogue. Queensland Health has released today’s Covid update. There have been 4,257 new cases reported and 15 further deaths. There are 312 people being treated in hospital with the virus including 12 people in ICU. No Context Anthony Albanese: Murugappan family on the plane to Queensland They’re en route to Brisbane. Two women found dead in Sydney were sisters, police say Allcroft says there were no obvious signs of injury to the two women. Asked what drew the government agency to the attention of the unit, she said police were in “early stages of the investigation” and were “looking into all lines of enquiry”. At this stage we’ve got two females who are deceased and we have no further information at this stage. We don’t know the cause of death. We’ll know more tomorrow once we’ve had the post-mortem completed. The bodies have been there for some time. However I can’t tell you how long. That will be a question for the coroner ... it’s a very tragic scene when we go to any deceased persons, let alone two sisters who are deceased and unfortunately, at this stage, we don’t know why. New South Wales police are speaking now about the discovery of two bodies at a unit in Canterbury. The women haven’t been formally identified but are believed to be 23 and 24 years old. They were located in their separate bedrooms. About 9:30am, police attended an apartment in Canterbury Road, Canterbury, following reports that a body had been located by another government agency. Upon entering the premises, police located the bodies of two females. A crime scene was established, and has been examined by specialist crime scene officers. There was no obvious signs of forced entry to the detectives from Burwood police area command and the homicide squad are investigating the circumstances under Strike Force Walbird. Detectives are still examining the crime scene. Asked if police were investigating a murder, officer Claudia Allcroft said police were still in the “infancy” of the investigation but the circumstances were suspicious and more would be known after a post-mortem examination is conducted tomorrow. NSW public servants walk off the job demanding pay rise About 30,000 public servants in New South Wales are walking off the job today demanding pay rises keep up with rising inflation. It comes after the Public Service Association (PSA) union’s demands of a 5.4% pay rise weren’t met by the start of the week. Instead, the NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, offered a pay rise of 3%, with another 0.5% increase to the public service annual pay cap likely the following year. He also announced a one-off bonus of $3,000 for healthcare workers. Union representatives said this amounted to a pay cut when Australia’s inflation rate was factored in. The PSA NSW general secretary, Stewart Little, said: This offer is pure politics. Moving half a per cent and playing silly games with one-off bonuses for certain workers. It’s a shameless attempt at dividing workers against each other. ACT Health has released today’s Covid update. There have been 821 new cases reported and one further death – a woman in her 90s. There are 89 people being treated in hospital with the virus and no people in ICU. Stakes are high for state of origin Important breaking news for rugby fans, Queenslanders, or residents of New South Wales: While we’re here, the prime minister published his expert tips in the Daily Telegraph today. They are as follows: NSW wins by 14. Man of the match: Damien Cook. First try: Brian To’o. Why NSW will win: Cook to run from dummy half in last 30 minutes against tired forwards. High court releases details of citizenship law invalidation The high court has released a summary of its decision invalidating laws that allowed the home affairs minister to strip someone of citizenship for repudiating their allegiance to Australia by engaging in proscribed conduct, such as foreign incursions of alleged terrorist recruitment. First, some facts about the plaintiff, Delil Alexander: The plaintiff was born in Australia and acquired Australian citizenship by birth. He also acquired, and still holds, Turkish citizenship by descent. In April 2013, the plaintiff departed Australia for Turkey and, at some point, travelled into Syria. A qualified security assessment (QSA) provided by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation to the minister in June 2021 stated that the plaintiff had joined the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, which was a designated ‘terrorist organisation’, by August 2013, and that he had likely engaged in foreign incursions and recruitment by entering or remaining in al-Raqqa Province in Syria, a ‘declared area’, on or after 5 December 2014. In July 2021, the minister made a determination pursuant to section 36B of the Citizenship Act, relying in part on the information provided in the QSA, that the plaintiff ceased to be an Australian citizen. The determination stated that the minister was satisfied that: the plaintiff had engaged in foreign incursions while outside Australia, which demonstrated a repudiation of his allegiance to Australia; that it would be contrary to the public interest for him to remain an Australian citizen; and that he would not become stateless by reason of the determination. The law was judged invalid because some in the majority found in effect it amounted to retribution for conduct deemed so reprehensible as to be incompatible with the shared values of the Australian community because it deprived the plaintiff of his entitlement to enter and live at liberty in Australia. Only courts can judge and punish criminal guilt, so the law was invalid. Daniel Andrews says Victoria can’t “go it alone” on gas reserve scheme This is the Victorian premier’s take ahead of this afternoon’s meeting on energy: Meanwhile, the leader of the Nationals, David Littleproud, is still yelling to the abyss about nuclear power: Here is some analysis on the nuclear power question from climate and environment editor, Adam Morton: Energy ministers meet to discuss power price spikes State and federal energy ministers are holding a video conference late this afternoon, which is timely given the strain in the east coast markets lately, and the soaring wholesale prices. The Australian Energy Market Operator yesterday lifted its imposed gas price caps for the Sydney and Brisbane markets that had been imposed after the exit of Weston Energy from the market triggered the first use of the “retailer of last resort mechanism” in about six years. However, by another measure, Sydney’s cumulative price threshold has been exceeded so the price cap of $40 a gigajoule remains. By the same approach, Victoria’s wholesale gas prices remain at $40/GJ after the state hit the threshold on 30 May. There’s a bit of discussion this morning around “if only we’d reserved some domestic gas when we opened up eastern Australia to global prices a decade ago”. (Both the Coalition and Labor share the blame for waiving that decision through when it was clear local consumers would cop higher gas prices.) Western Australia has a 15% reservation policy and lower power prices. Today’s meeting is not an emergency one although it does have some urgent issues to deal with. It’s not expected to produce a major outcome although the current price spikes will be addressed. It will discuss the progress towards a “capacity market”. This seems to be a key issue to watch in the coming years with the main question being, if we do have standby power plants what form will they take? WA (again!) has one, as do many markets overseas. Will ageing coal plants be kept going a bit longer, or as some states want, only new capacity so that we don’t hinder the transition towards decarbonisation. An issue to keep an eye on. The chief executive of the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA), Martin Hoffman, has resigned after continued speculation about his future. Hoffman, who took on the role in November 2019, was heavily criticised during his term by the new minister, Bill Shorten, who accused the NDIA leadership of losing the trust of the disability community. Before the election, Shorten told Guardian Australia that “you have to question the whole leadership of the NDIS in the last few years” and singled out Hoffman, as well as former chair Helen Nugent, blaming them for the abandoned “independent assessments” proposal that riled advocates. Shorten had this week batted away questions about Hoffman’s future. The NDIA chair, Denis Napthine, said: During Martin’s leadership the NDIS completed the full transition from the old systems – and grew dramatically with now more than 520,000 participants benefiting from the scheme. He has also overseen significant participant experience improvements, with an emphasis on digital investment that will deliver further improvements in future. He led the agency with passion, grace and commitment, including managing through the impacts of the Covid pandemic. Hoffman said: It has been an absolute privilege to have served in this role for the last three years. I wish the scheme, and its participants, families, carers and providers all the very best for the future. I thank the amazing staff of the agency for their dedication and support. Hoffman faced significant pressure over the independent assessments saga, during which several damaging internal leaks pointed to dissatisfaction with the agency’s attempts to clamp down on increasing costs. More recently the agency has been accused of wasteful spending on private lawyers to battle NDIS participants in the courts, while Hoffman himself apologised after Guardian Australia revealed his staff had compiled an “intelligence report” of a woman’s social media posts as it fought unsuccessfully to deny her support. Shorten has also been critical of the appointment of Napthine, a former Victorian Liberal premier, who was appointed by the Coalition earlier this year. Hoffman will leave the role on 2 July, with the deputy, Lisa Studdart, to serve in the position while a replacement is found. Shorten has released a statement: The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, has tested positive for Covid. In a statement, he said: It’s finally caught up with me – I have returned a positive result for Covid-19. I’ve got mild symptoms and will be isolating at home in Melbourne for the next seven days. I will continue some duties remotely, while also taking time to rest and recover. I send my sincerest thanks to all the nurses and healthcare workers who are about to enter another winter of flu and Covid cases – you deserve a pay rise. The Northern Territory government has released today’s Covid update. There have been 254 new cases reported and no further deaths. There were 121 cases recorded in the Top End, 55 in central Australia, 10 in East Arnhem, 19 in the Big Rivers region, three in the Barkly region and 46 are under investigation. There are 14 people being treated in hospital with the virus and none in ICU. The high court has ruled that the detention of an Aboriginal non-citizen was not unlawful, because he was detained before a landmark decision that found they were beyond the reach of the aliens power. In February 2020, the high court ruled that Aboriginal Australians cannot be aliens, and therefore cannot be deported, a decision the commonwealth is currently attempting to overturn. Brendan Thoms, one of the original plaintiffs, brought a separate case arguing that his detention from September 2018 to February 2020 was unlawful, a move that could expose the commonwealth to compensation claims by multiple people who were released after the decision. On Wednesday the high court unanimously ruled that Thoms detention in that time was not unlawful. The high court has ruled that laws allowing dual nationals to be stripped of their Australian citizenship for suspected terrorist activities are unconstitutional. The laws were challenged by lawyers acting for Delil Alexander, a Turkish Australian man imprisoned in Syria whose citizenship was revoked in July 2021. On Wednesday the high court ruled that the home affairs minister’s powers were invalid because they involved the exercise of an “exclusive judicial function”, that is, punishing criminal guilt. The court ordered that Alexander is an Australian citizen and the law purportedly stripping him of it is invalid. Penny Wong speaks with US secretary of state Australia’s foreign minister, Penny Wong, continues her whirlwind entry into global diplomacy, holding a phone call with the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, on the way back from her visit to Indonesia with the prime minister, Anthony Albanese. A readout of the call, from Blinken’s office, said the pair spoke about “our ongoing coordination on regional issues” and the upcoming G20 meetings in Bali – which Albanese confirmed this week he would be attending, after questions over whether he would visit considering the participation of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. Blinken’s office said: Secretary Blinken and foreign minister Wong also discussed our collective efforts to hold Russia accountable for its unprovoked and unjust war of choice against Ukraine, including in multilateral institutions and bodies. The secretary and foreign minister reviewed the foreign minister’s recent visits to Indonesia, Fiji, Samoa and Tonga, and the secretary reaffirmed the United States commitment to strengthening economic opportunity, resiliency, and freedom across the Indo-Pacific through open and transparent work with partners and allies in the region. As Katharine Murphy wrote this morning, Wong “has exploded out of the blocks since Labor won the election”. Is Australia going to Mars? A bit of a kooky last question. A reporter says Scott Morrison announced Australia would go to Mars. Are we a step closer to that dream? Albanese: I’m not going to be that ambitious. But a very good question. One I wasn’t anticipating, I’ve got to say. Today, in itself, I think is significant. Fixing transmission critical, PM says Katharine Murphy asks Anthony Albanese if the government need to go faster on the transition to renewables and hydrogen in the face of the energy crisis. He replies: We need to do exactly what we said we would do which is to have a plan to ensure that we move to 82% renewables by 2030 as part of the national energy market. A 42% reduction. But we’ll put in place the measures. We need to, as soon as possible, make sure that we fix transmission, it’s the low-hanging fruit. It’s critical and we’ll do what we can to do that. ‘I’m very proud we’ve brought this family home’ Now to the Murugappan family, who are flying to Brisbane from Perth today on their first step home to Biloela. Anthony Albanese is pleased: Isn’t that good? Do you feel good about that? I sure do. Every Australian should. What about other families or other situations? Albanese returns to the family: The Bilo family were loved and wanted by their local community. This guy, Nades, worked at local meatworks. We import people to work in meatworks because we can’t find enough workers. And here we grab this family in the middle of the night, took them down to Melbourne. Then took them to Christmas Island. Then they’ve ended up in Perth after these little girls who were born in Australia got not just mental health issues, but physical health issues as well. I’m very proud we’ve brought this family home. I’m very proud. And the community will be as well. No people should be treated in that way, and I must say this as well. The cost, the cost to the Australian taxpayers is in the double figures of millions of dollars from this. Coal still part of Australia’s energy mix, PM says Reporter: Considering the way that the grid is now, though, are you open to using coal to make up for the gas shortfalls and supply-and-demand problems now? Anthony Albanese: Coal is a part of our mix right now. The NT chief minister follows. She says it’s a “unique opportunity” to work with a Labor government that believes in climate change and the need to shift to renewables on projects like the sun cable. Albanese says he’s had discussions with billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes and others about how to maximise the cable’s input. PM cites budget deficit Anthony Albanese dodges whether cabinet would consider vouchers for electricity prices and winter handouts for low-income households before the October budget, but reiterates that the government is $1tn in debt: The former government has left us with $1tn of debt. There are measures, some measures are in place to alleviate some cost-of-living pressures and they’re in place ... but we will, of course, always consider what can be done. But there is a fiscal context here. Energy grid must be made fit for purpose, Albanese says Reporter: How uncomfortable is it for you as a new leader promising an extra push towards renewable energy, when you’re in a situation where there’s a fall back on coal-fired production with electricity? Anthony Albanese: Not at all. One of the problems that has occurred here is a failure of investment. Because the former government had 22 energy policies, and didn’t land one. So, you haven’t had the orderly investment that is needed ... You don’t have a grid that’s fit for purpose in the 21st century. That’s why in my first budget reply, we had two big measures – childcare ... but rewiring the nation – to fix the energy grid based upon the Australian Energy Market Operator’s integrated systems plan ... If you had a grid that was fit for purpose, where renewables were being plugged into the grid, just as households know that if you’ve got solar panels on your roof, they’re lowering your power bills. If that was across the economy for households and businesses with a grid that was fit for purpose, you would have a real alleviation on pressures that are in place right now. Energy market pressures have built up over nine years, PM says Anthony Albanese reminds journalists his government was just sworn in and says pressures on the energy market are a hangover from the previous government: We’ve been in government now for just a little bit over two weeks. These pressures have built up over nine years. And this, the former government, had a policy of deliberately keeping wages low at a time when cost of living and the price of everything was going up. My government does not have that policy. My government has a policy of doing what we can to assist cost-of-living pressures. At the same time, we’re conscious of the fact that we’re being left with $1tn of debt with not much to show for it. ‘My government understands the pressure that working families are under’ The PM is asked about what the government will do in the short term to ease cost-of-living pains in the wake of interest rate hikes announced by the RBA yesterday. He acknowledges the RBA decision will be “a blow” for families but it wasn’t unexpected. He then reiterates the government’s long-term strategies of childcare and renewable energy reform: That doesn’t mean that it won’t hurt people. We know that people are suffering from a cost-of-living crisis. With everything going up except for their wages. We have a plan to alleviate cost-of-living pressures by taking measures on childcare, by taking measures on electricity prices, which will have an impact. Not immediately. It takes time to flow that through, but also by our position on wages, which is to have a plan to lift wages. That’s why I’ll have an employment summit coming through ... my government understands the pressure that working families are under and we’ll be doing what we can to alleviate those pressures going forward. Jet interception occurred in international air space, PM stresses The prime minister is asked about accusations from the Chinese government that an Australian RAAF plane came near the airspace of the disputed Paracel Islands, known as Xisha in China, when it was intercepted by a Chinese jet. He replies: This incident occurred in international air space. Full stop. Voice to parliament ‘simply good manners’, PM says Now to questions. Anthony Albanese is asked if he is confident he will have bipartisan support to implement the Uluru statement from the heart: I’m very hopeful that that will occur ... I want to work to bring people together. And what we know is that this will be just like the apology to stolen generations. When it happens, people will wonder why it hadn’t happened earlier. And that’s what I want to do. This is just simply good manners in order to ask First Nations people what their view is when issues affect them. Whether it be their education, their health. Sometimes it’s put as if this is just symbolic, and there’s a difference between practical reconciliation and symbolism. The two are connected. If you don’t give respect to people, then you won’t be able to close the gap in health, in education, in housing, in life expectancy. In all of these issues in which we need to do that practical work. And I am up for reaching out and embracing as many people as possible, but I’m absolutely committed to advancing this as well. NT chief minister celebrates ‘new frontier’ and thanks traditional owners Natasha Fyles is up. She says it’s “wonderful” to have the newly elected PM in the NT: Showing to Territorians that he dares about more than the east coast. Here in the territory, and also our strong representation from my federal parliamentary colleagues, and I, too, acknowledge the Larrakia people and pay my respects. It was amazing to be in east Arnhem Land last week looking at Nasa infrastructure on territory soil. I acknowledge the Gumatj and the work that they have done with ELA to get this project off the ground. We have backed it since its inception and it is showing that the Northern Territory is a key part of the future, particularly for investors in this new frontier. So it’s an exciting project. Albanese hails Nasa rocket launches Anthony Albanese says the Nasa rockets, to be launched into space from the NT, will be an “exciting project” that will send a message to Australians of how important science is: Australia’s contribution to the space industry does date back to the 1950s. As a nation, we have to build on that legacy, and it’s terrific to be here in Darwin today to declare Equatorial Launch Australia and Nasa go for launch right here in the Northern Territory. The Australian government has granted regulatory approval for ELA to launch three scientific suborbital launches on behalf of Nasa between June 26 and July 12 at the Arnhem Space Centre. These three launches are important, they’re for universities to do scientific research. These rockets will go some 250km north into ... well, up into the sky, to collect data on physics of the sun and its relationship with the Earth. We want the next generation to look at Stem as part of Australia’s future and this is why this is an important project ... the idea Nasa is involved in Australia should be something of pride. The prime minister is speaking in the Darwin now alongside chief minister Natasha Fyles, on the Nasa agreement announced today: We’re both pretty new, at our respective jobs. But we’ve both been around for a while and are good friends, and I look forward to working with Tash, including at the first meeting of the national cabinet that we’ll hold in Canberra. First of all, dinner at The Lodge on Thursday night next week and then a meeting to be held on Friday. There is much work to be done on federal and state relations and streamlining the way that our nation works. Victoria has released today’s Covid update. There have been 9,519 new cases reported and 25 deaths. It brings today’s death toll from Covid to 35. Condolences to their loved ones. There are 522 people being treated in hospital with the virus, including 29 people in ICU. The Tasmanian government will raise the minimum age of detention from 10 to 14 as part of reform of the youth justice system: We know that detention does not support rehabilitation or reduce the likelihood of re-offending for younger children. Early exposure to a detention environment can also further traumatise young people, expose them to problem behaviours of older detainees and increase criminal networks. An Aboriginal-led push to raise the age of criminal detention from 10 to 14 in Queensland failed after the government and opposition refused to back calls from the Raise the Age coalition. The ACT was the first jurisdiction in Australia to commit to raising the age of criminal responsibility - separate with detention - in line with UN standards. From Indonesia to the Northern Territory: Priya Murugappan has just spoken at Perth airport, marking one year since the family arrived in the city and were placed in community detention. She and her family are due to fly to Brisbane this morning, the first stop on their long-awaited journey home to Biloela. Murugappan expressed her gratitude to Perth Children’s hospital, where staff cared for her four-year-old daughter Tharnicaa. The child was medically evacuated from Christmas Island with a blood infection caused by untreated pneumonia: I’m very grateful to the Perth Children’s hospital. I have made great friends ... me and my family are very happy to start our journey back to my community in Bilo. Thank you to all in Perth – love you, Perth, thank you. undefined Environment minister Tanya Plibersek has taken an early interest in independent MP Zali Steggall’s seat of Warringah. NSW Health has released today’s Covid update. There have been 7,285 new cases reported and 10 deaths. There are 1,283 people being treated in hospital with the virus, including 38 people in ICU. Tackling inflation a key challenge, Katy Gallagher says Finance minister Katy Gallagher was on ABC Breakfast this morning discussing the RBA interest rate hike. She said “every commentator predicted” there would be an increase: Tackling rising inflation is a key challenge in the economy and I know it’s going to be a really tough day yesterday for millions of mortgage-holders and households already under enormous pressure from rising cost of living, now rising interest rates and falling wages. It’s a challenging set of circumstances. Asked if the government would consider calls from Acoss to offer $1,000 energy relief payments for low-income households, Gallagher said there was already short-term relief in the budget announced by the previous government: We’re putting together a budget for October and as the treasurer has already foreshadowed, a cost-of-living lens will be placed over that budget ... we’re not pretending that there are things, you know, that will solve these long-term challenges. If we look at energy, this has been building up many years. It’s a deliberate design feature of the previous government’s economic architecture to keep wages low. In two weeks or in a month, these aren’t going to be things that we can turn around but we are working hard and we will make sure that where we can make sensible or provide sensible solutions we’ll make those sensible and responsible investments. Detectives have launched an investigation after the discovery of two women’s bodies inside a unit in south-west Sydney. About 9.30am yesterday emergency services were called to a home on Canterbury Road after a concern-for-welfare report. The women are yet to be formally identified but are believed to be in their 20s. A crime scene was established and an investigation into the circumstances surrounding their deaths has begun. Forecasts for next six months ‘not pretty’, economist says Chief economist at Rate City Sally Tindall appeared on ABC Breakfast this morning to discuss the RBA’s decision to lift the cash rate to 0.85%. Tindall said the RBA clearly “needs to get the inflation genie back in the bottle”: And they’re prepared to do what it takes to get the job done. You only have to look at other countries around the world, such as the United States, where inflation is well over 8%, to see how easily things can get out of hand. So we’ve seen a 0.5% hike. For the average borrower, $500,000 owing today, 25 years remaining on the home loan, that will see their repayments rise by $133 a month. If you combine it with the May hike from the month before, that’s a total of $197 a month. And for larger loans, that’s obviously more pain. For someone with a $1m loan, for example, they’re looking at $265 a month just from this change yesterday. Tindall said there was no disputing there would be further increases to come: After the meeting, all four big bank economists updated their forecasts for the next six months, and let me tell you, it is not pretty ... it’s certainly going to be a lot of money for many people out there. A lot, though, will have built up a bit of a buffer while we’ve had the lower interest rates. But it’s people that have had a change in circumstances that could struggle. Pundits tip that cash rate will top 3% by year’s end As we noted yesterday evening in the blog, Westpac and CBA are among the banks to predict the Reserve Bank will follow up with another 50 basis point increase when its board next meets on 5 July. Westpac was also the first to move in lifting its rates, with more expected to follow within days. The RBA must have pondered just hiking to a big round number like 1%, rather than 0.85%, but perhaps we’ll get to 1.25%. (The last time the central bank raised by more than half a point was in 1994.) Investors, though, have also responded to the RBA’s “jumbo rise” (most economists had tipped yesterday’s move would be no more than 40 basis points – so the pundits were mostly caught out again). They’re now tipping the cash rate will top 3% by the end of the year: Many businesses are going to be pinched by the increase and, as one economist pointed out this morning, the media tends to overlook that part of the mix. Perhaps they have more of a chance to pass on the higher costs, but point noted. Meanwhile, among mortgage holders, the financial squeeze could be felt the most among first homebuyers, as we noted in this story today: AWU urges windfall tax in response to energy crisis The Australian Workers’ Union is urging the federal government to implement a UK-style windfall tax in response to the energy crisis. AWU national secretary Daniel Walton said multinational gas exporters were using the global situation to “cream astronomical mega-profits from Australians”: I’ve had manufacturers telling me they are seeing their gas costs rise by as much $100,000 a day. It’s insane and it’s unsustainable. Without drastic action we’re going to see thousands of Australian manufacturing jobs lost this year. The government should tell the gas exporters it’s fine for them to generate record profits, but they also have to ensure some of those mega-profits are used to help the nation that owns the gas. At every stage in discussions the government should be holding a big stick with “windfall tax” written on it. If the government refuse to pick up that stick now and get tough then gas exporters will bluster and delay and factories will close en masse. Don’t prop up coal’s ‘dirty clunkers’, Adam Bandt says Greens leader Adam Bandt has lashed out at coal producers before Chris Bowen’s meeting with state and territory ministers. He says a subsidy to ageing coal power plants will slow the modernisation of the energy network after calls for coal-fired power stations to be brought online. The ACT minister attending the meeting will be ACT Greens leader Shane Rattenbury, who led the territory’s transition to 100% renewable energy. Bandt: Propping up coal-fired power stations is throwing good money after bad. No amount of patching up these dirty clunkers will fix the problem. We need accelerated investment in new wind, solar, transmission and batteries, not more money for coal. The lesson from the ACT could not be clearer: go 100% renewables, break up with fossil fuels and reap the benefits of cheaper, cleaner, reliable energy. The Greens took a comprehensive plan to the election to phase Australia out of coal and gas by 2030 through a big government build of renewables and grid upgrades and we’re putting it on the table in this parliament. ‘Carrier pigeon pulling balloons of gas?’ Chris Bowen says the opposition are either “very naive or very dishonest” to have suggested Labor could alleviate the energy crisis by getting on the phone: The gas pipeline from Queensland to south-east Australia is currently working at 100% capacity, you couldn’t get more gas into it if you tried. How are they supposing to get extra gas into the pipeline? Bowen muses: Telepathy? Carrier pigeon pulling balloons of gas? Bowen warns there are no easy fixes Energy minster Chris Bowen is appearing on AM with Sabra Lane. Asked if the meeting with state and territory leaders today will have any impact on the energy crisis, he replies: The state and territory energy ministers will be making progress. There’s no easy fixes here ... and one meeting isn’t going to solve nine years of failed energy policy but we’ve got some meaty issues to discuss. Bowen says he has been in “constant contact” with the state and territories: We’ve been making progress all week and no doubt we’ll continue talking about issues in the lead-up to the meeting. It’s more important to make this transition to 82% renewables ... to get that right. Asked if Bowen will consider handouts for people on lower incomes to deal with the blows, he says there will be cost-of-living relief in the budget and Labor will continue listening to “sensible suggestions” across the board to deal with “this crisis we’ve inherited”. Queensland energy minister hails ‘collaborative’ approach Queensland’s energy minister has issued a statement before the state and territory leaders’ meeting with Chris Bowen today. Mick de Brenni said he was taking to the meeting with a “sense of optimism”: that the new federal government’s “cooperative and collaborative” approach would yield better results than previously seen: I will take to this meeting direct input from the Queensland energy industry, the conservation sector and energy consumers who will meet with me this morning to provide guidance on how to deliver the best outcome for Queensland. De Brenni said greater investment in renewables would be the cheapest means to lessen the impacts of the global market and could deliver Australia energy independence: Whilst all options are on the table for consideration at the EMM, Queensland would continue to promote policy responses that supported our record on delivering new, cheaper and cleaner generation into the market. The formula we are following to keep downward pressure on power prices focuses on connecting more renewables and back-up storage to our grid. China’s warning to Australia China has warned Australia to stop “provocations” or face “serious consequences” after the federal government said a Chinese jet plane was intercepted, the AFP and Guardian staff report. China said yesterday the Australian P-8 anti-submarine patrol aircraft came near the airspace of the disputed Paracel Islands – known as Xisha in China. The aircraft “approached for reconnaissance, ignoring repeated warnings from the Chinese side”, defence ministry spokesman Tan Kefei said at a press conference. The People’s Liberation Army organised naval and air forces to identify the military aircraft “issuing a warning to drive it away”, Tan said: The Australian military plane seriously threatened China’s sovereignty and security and the measures taken by the Chinese military were professional, safe, reasonable and legal. Tan accused Australia of spreading “false information” and called the actions of the Australian pilots “dangerous and provocative”. China warned Australia to manage the actions of its naval and air forces or face “serious consequences”. Defence minister Richard Marles didn’t reveal the exact location of the encounter at the time or exactly how close the planes came to each other – but he did outline further details at a press conference. Nasa rockets will be launched into space from the Northern Territory this month and next under an agreement to be unveiled by the federal and NT governments tomorrow. Anthony Albanese and Northern Territory chief minister Natasha Fyles will confirm that three scientific suborbital sounding rockets will be launched between 26 June and 12 July 2022 from the Arnhem Space Centre, which is owned and run by Equatorial Launch Australia. The two governments say the looming event will be the first time that Nasa launches rockets from a commercial facility outside the US, and they will be the first Nasa rockets launched from Australia since 1995, when launches were conducted from the Royal Australian Air Force Woomera Range complex. Albanese: We can trace Australia’s celebrated connection to the space industry back to the 1950s and as a nation we have to build on that legacy. Approximately 75 Nasa personnel will be in Australia for the launches. The two governments say the missions will investigate heliophysics, astrophysics and planetary science phenomena only observable from the southern hemisphere. The Arnhem Space Centre is located on the Dhupuma Plateau near Nhulunbuy, on the lands of the Gumatj people. The two governments say the traditional owners have been consulted as part of the approval process. ‘The longer back you go the less likely there’s going to be a public interest’ Mark Dreyfus says how far back the commission will be able to look will not be a decision for the government but the longer back you go the less likely the hearings will hold a public interest: Anti-corruption commission hearings will ‘overwhelmingly’ take place in private Mark Dreyfus says the commission’s hearings will “overwhelmingly” take place in private, however there will be circumstances in which public hearings will be useful.: There will be circumstances in which it is clearly in the public interest for a public hearing to take place. Almost all state and territory commissions have the power to hold sparing public hearings. They can potentially be very useful ... it’s a way of building confidence in the activities of the commission if people can see it in operation ... it’s something that prompts others to come forward, it brings out evidence if people hear of the investigation. Dreyfus reiterates the bill will be introduced this year: I’m not going to set limits on this commission. It’s independent ... it’s not there to accept instructions from governments of the day. Dreyfus deadbats pork barrelling question Mark Dreyfus is asked whether the commission will have the power to investigate pork barrelling. Will it be constituted as corruption? No, I’m not saying that. And I haven’t said what you’ve just said. I’ve been repeatedly asked about pork barrelling ... and if such programs and this goes for any government program ... falls within the commission’s view of serious and systemic corruption ... the ambit of the commissions responsibilities ... then that’s going to be a matter which the commission can determine it will look at. Dreyfus says he hopes the commission will be operational by mid-2023. Taskforce ‘completed devoted’ to drafting anti-corruption commission bill Minister for public service and integrity Mark Dreyfus is appearing on Radio National now. Asked if Labor will start from scratch on an anti-corruption bill or adopt independent MP Helen Haines’ integrity bill, which has been completed and introduced, he says the “full resources” of his department are working to draft a bill to be legislated this year: My department swung into action as soon as the election result was clear we’ve now got a taskforce ... completely devoted to ensuring we will legislate an anti-corruption commission this year. The full resources of the department are now directed to drafting the very best bill we can bring to the Australian parliament. The Murugappan family at the centre of a decade-long immigration battle is beginning their journey home to the central Queensland town of Biloela this morning where they will live in the community on bridging visas while waiting for their case to be processed in court. The family are flying to Brisbane from Perth this morning, and will make it back to Biloela in time to celebrate Tharnicaa’s birthday, who will turn five on 12 June. Home to Bilo campaigner Bronwyn Dendle told Guardian Australia: We’ve been down in the trenches and we haven’t had that birds-eye view. But it’s not until you sit back you appreciate the wider implication of people being able to put a face to asylum seekers. We’ve rehumanised a group of people that past governments have worked so hard at dehumanising. Greens urge accelerated investment into renewables Deputy co-leader of the Greens Nick McKim appeared on Radio National this morning offering the party’s perspective on the energy crisis. He said the government needed to pivot “really quickly” to accelerated investment into renewable energy, and to make fossil fuel companies pay their “fair share” of tax: [The] climate imperative is sitting over the top of everything. I’m happy to work with Labor in the short term around legislation absolutely ... alongside that we need support for people to go electric and invest in solar panels. McKim said short-term measures like putting a cap on gas prices could be implemented alongside “meaningful investment” to drive down power prices in favour of renewable energy: We need a significant shift in thinking in this country ... [not the] same old last tired planet cooking thinking ... [We need to] break the nexus between political parties and the fossil fuel industry. The energy crisis is continuing to dominate the agenda for the newly elected government. Energy minister Chris Bowen will meet his state and territory counterparts today to discuss possible solutions to the gas supply problems and power prices exacerbating cost-of-living pressures. Caitlin Cassidy is here to take you through it, and unfortunately, we’re spare on good news this morning. The Australian Council of Social Services has written to Bowen warning it is “deeply concerned” about the financial pressures on people with low incomes, while the Greens have warned a “significant shift” in thinking is needed away from fossil fuels. Speaking of cost-of-living pressures, first homebuyers are likely to be hardest hit by the RBA’s decision to lift the official cash rate to o.85% yesterday, the highest increase in more than 20 years. More increases have been flagged in coming months to curb unacceptable levels of inflation. Westpac is the first major bank to pass on the full value of the interest rate rise to mortgage holders, with the other banks expected to make their decision today. We’re not the only ones feeling the pinch. The World Bank has warned the nation is on the cusp of a situation similar to the 1970s oil price shocks as a result of the conflict in Ukraine, slowing economic growth and pushing up the prices of goods. In better news, Australia has kept its World Cup dream alive after defeating the United Arab Emirates 2-1 in a qualifier match in Qatar. The final, sudden-death playoff for a spot in the cup will take place next Monday against Peru. There’s much to get to, so let’s get cracking."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/grogonomics/2019/apr/28/reality-rarely-gets-a-run-in-an-election-campaign-full-of-feigned-outrage","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2019-04-27T22:00:01Z","webTitle":"Reality rarely gets a run in an election campaign full of feigned outrage | Greg Jericho","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2019/apr/28/reality-rarely-gets-a-run-in-an-election-campaign-full-of-feigned-outrage","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/grogonomics/2019/apr/28/reality-rarely-gets-a-run-in-an-election-campaign-full-of-feigned-outrage","fields":{"headline":"Reality rarely gets a run in an election campaign full of feigned outrage","bodyText":"The general consensus is that now that Easter and Anzac Day are behind us and with pre-polling starting on Monday, the prologue of the campaign is over and the real one begins. The campaign has mostly gone as expected, but usually by now there has been some outrage over a person in a campaign advert who is actually an actor. It seems the parties this time round have decided to forego the fake-tradie outrage and have a fake policy outrage instead. Mostly this campaign involved both parties (and much of the media) pretending to be outraged over things that are either fake or have been purposely mistaken. Consider the response to Bill Shorten saying he would not impose any further taxes on superannuation. The Liberal party and many in the media called this a major gaffe given the ALP has long had a policy to change the taxation of superannuation. “Shorten doesn’t even know his own policies.” Well, no. In the press conference it was clear he was being asked about any new taxes to the ones that were already the ALP’s policy. Consider this was the exchange: Journalist: Can you rule out no new or increased taxes on superannuation? Shorten: We have no plans to increase taxes on superannuation. Journalist: That’s different from ruling it out though. Shorten: We have no plans to introduce any new taxes on superannuation. Journalist: So will you rule it out? Shorten: Sure. Now maybe the journalist had no idea about Labor’s superannuation policy that has been around for nearly three years, but you would think if this actually meant that Shorten had forgotten or was announcing he had dumped his own policy someone in the press pack would twig. And yet there were 16 more questions asked in that press conference and not one journalist thought they had witnessed a major policy shift or gaffe, for none asked another question about superannuation. But we had to go through the whole “Shorten forgot his own policy” pretence – in which most in the media purposely sought to misunderstand the context so they could run the “Shorten had a bad day” line. On the other side we had Labor accusing the Liberal party now being in favour of nuclear power because in an interview Scott Morrison suggested that while it was not on the agenda, when asked if a nuclear power company could propose opening a nuclear power station he replied: “well they can if it can pay its way”. In reality no nuclear power station is at all close to viable without mass government subsidies, so Morrison’s position was not new. But again we had the pretence that this really meant the LNP might approve a nuclear power station. The big problem with the Morrison government is not nuclear power but that the day before the election was called it approved a nuclear mine in WA that will have major adverse effects on native wildlife and groundwater. That is reality. But we also had Labor announcing up to $1.5bn from the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility to be used to unlock the gas supply of Beetaloo sub-basin to Darwin and the east coast. It continues the pretence both parties have on climate change. The LNP pretends climate change is a myth, while Labor pretends to want to act. And yes it has better policies (the easiest hurdle to clear) but for every move to reduce emissions, there is always one that will do more harm. Then of course there is it the pretence about an estate tax – as ever called a “death tax”. Neither Labor nor the Greens have any plans to introduce estate taxes, but why should we let facts get in the way? Election campaigns are now to be based around fake social media posts which are then turned into Liberal party adverts not all that far removed from Karl Rove style push polling. The shame is that neither side will even consider introducing an estate tax despite the massive wealth inequality in this country. The LNP won’t because they favour landholders and the wealthy; Labor won’t because they know the LNP (with a great assist from most media outlets) will make great hay out of “death tax” lines and the truth will never get a look in. At the moment the richest 1% hold more wealth than the bottom 70% of households, and yet a policy designed only to affect that 1% would be treated as though Labor was after everyone’s house. Never mind that it is a standard tax in most developed nations, no one has any confidence the issue will be treated with any rationality. And thus, because our political debate is so putrid, a good idea doesn’t even get to the starting gate. But the biggest pretence occurring in this election is that everything is fine in the economy. The most recent GDP figures show the economy grew more slowly in the December 2018 quarter than it has for 15 years. On a per-capita basis our economy actually shrunk over the last half of 2018. Household living standards are lower now than they were not just at the last election, but the one in 2013. To top it off, this week the ABS revealed inflation ground to a halt, indicating an utter lack of demand in the economy – a state so bad the Reserve Bank is likely in May to reduce the cash rate to a new record low of 1.25%. But both major parties continue their absurd argument over who will have the biggest surplus, and laughable fights over how much taxation will be raised from now till 2030 – none of which anyone actually believes are even close to real. But the real has not had much of a run so far. With the prologue over, let us hope this new stage of the campaign also marks the introduction of reality into the debate. • Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/live/2021/oct/28/rishi-sunak-cost-of-living-budget-economists-politics-live-boris-johnson-latest-updates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2021-10-28T16:04:31Z","webTitle":"Rishi Sunak’s budget ‘hammers’ working people while giving banks a tax cut, says Labour – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2021/oct/28/rishi-sunak-cost-of-living-budget-economists-politics-live-boris-johnson-latest-updates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/live/2021/oct/28/rishi-sunak-cost-of-living-budget-economists-politics-live-boris-johnson-latest-updates","fields":{"headline":"Rishi Sunak’s budget ‘hammers’ working people while giving banks a tax cut, says Labour – as it happened","bodyText":"That’s all from me for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. Here’s a summary of the latest news: The chancellor insisted he did not have a “magic wand” to make cost of living pressures disappear, while also insisting he was right not to use some of the tools at his disposal to help struggling households. Rishi Sunak sought to play up the role of global problems in driving inflation – not least of energy prices – while insisting he was right not not cut VAT on home energy bills because it would disproportionately benefit those in large homes. The budget has the country set for a flat recovery for living standards, the Resolution Foundation warned. There are fears the average household could see their tax rise by thousands of pounds during Boris Johnson’s premiership, a thinktank has warned and the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said the plan would leave the overall tax burden at its highest since the final period of Clement Attlee’s postwar Labour administration 70 years ago. The shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves described the budget as “hammering working people, while giving banks a tax cut. “The Tories have no plan to tackle the cost-of-living crisis, no plan to shift the unfair taxes they’ve hit working people with and no plan for growth,” she said. The decision to raise taxes on workers amid high levels of inflation will squeeze living standards next year, causing “real pain” for low-income households, the Institute for Fiscal Studies warned. The UK’s leading tax and spending thinktank said a middle earner was likely to be worse off next year as high rates of inflation and tax rises negate weak growth in wages. If you’d like to follow our live pandemic coverage, my colleague Tom Ambrose has the latest news: Richard Ratcliffe, the husband of Nazanin Zaghari Ratcliffe – the British Iranian detained in Tehran since 2016 – left frustrated and largely empty handed from an hour-long meeting with the new foreign secretary, Liz Truss. Following the meeting, he returned to his hunger strike outside the Foreign Office. Ratcliffe had pressed for an explanation on why the government had not paid an acknowledged £400m debt to Iran, and urged ministers to declare the Iranian detention of dual nationals as hostage-taking. The foreign secretary did not give us anything new. It was a reiteration of the status quo. She was very caring, said she was committed, working hard, but cannot talk about the debt as it is complicated. It is very clear they see their role as doing no harm. She said: ‘There are things I cannot tell you’, but she did not give us anything about to understand what the complications are, or why the payment is taking so long. I told the foreign secretary that I was deeply suspicious at this stage that they could not explain the problem. They cannot keep hiding behind ‘there are things we cannot tell you’ and ‘there are secret reasons that are too complicated to explain’. Our story is not that complicated. There is just a reluctance to explain or change. It does not really wash after five years. I told her: ‘You need to be brave in sorting the debt and challenging hostage-taking. Otherwise, you are inviting these guys to play cat and mouse with Nazanin, to pick up others and let them feel emboldened.’ According to Ratcliffe, Truss – accompanied by officials and the Middle East minister James Cleverly – made no comment, despite being pressed twice to acknowledge that payment of the debt might lead to his wife’s release. Teaching black history could help to prevent racism, MPs have heard in a debate to mark Black History Month. The Labour MP Bell Ribeiro-Addy has told a Westminster Hall debate calls to teach black history often end up “descending into a so-called war on woke and culture wars”. When we ask the government to teach black history as part of the curriculum, we are not asking them to do so over other aspects of British history. We are asking them to recognise that black history is British history. It is part of that history and it is not taught widely as it should be. If racism is ignorance and education is the absence of ignorance, the obvious answer to dealing with racial inequality is simple and it costs the government nothing to start just there with education. The idea that teaching children about racial inequality – as some teachers will do in Black History Month – is not what is holding back working class children in our education system. It wasn’t teaching racism that closed down hundreds of youth services or cut funding per pupil in this country, that was this government. It is these policies that hold back working class children from all of our communities. A former education recovery tsar has described the chancellor’s latest catch-up offer as “meagre” and warned that the government’s “half-hearted” deal for children was a “false economy”, my colleagues Sally Weale and Richard Adams write. Sir Kevan Collins said he was “frustrated” and “disappointed” by the government’s continuing lack of ambition for children’s learning recovery, and that Rishi Sunak’s budget showed that education had slipped down the pecking order of priorities in Whitehall. The former teacher resigned from his role as the government’s education recovery commissioner in June after his proposals for a £15bn long-term catch-up programme for children whose learning has been disrupted by the pandemic were scaled back to just £1.4bn by the Treasury. Asked to comment on the additional £1.8bn for catch-up announced by the chancellor on Wednesday, he said any additional funding for education was welcome, but it still meant less than £500 of recovery funding for each child in England, compared with £1,800 in the US and £2,100 in the Netherlands. This latest top-up means that the government has now committed close to £5bn for recovery programmes, including the national tutoring programme and funding allocated directly to schools. Collins said: It’s great to see additional money – always – in education, but it’s not enough. I’m concerned that these meagre measures reveal a failure to recognise the kind of foundational role schools play in creating fair and prosperous communities. We know the pandemic and learning loss has hit our poorest communities hardest. We know potentially we have wiped out all the work we did to narrow the gap and the gap is now widening between disadvantaged children and their peers. The short-term saving offered by a limited recovery programme will be dwarfed by the long-term cost of successive cohorts leaving education with lower skills. Jersey’s government has responded to French threats over fishing licences. In a joint statement, the Channel island’s ministers for external affairs and environment, Ian Gorst and John Young, said some extra permits – permanent and temporary – would be issued to French fishers but condemned Paris’s “retaliatory measures”. They said: We are extremely disappointed at the French government’s announcement, made yesterday afternoon, pursuing an approach of retaliatory measures. Yesterday morning, government of Jersey officers met officials from France, the UK and the European Commission and made further progress on the outstanding applications from French vessels for licences to fish in Jersey’s territorial waters. The outcome of that meeting was that 162 French vessels will be licensed to fish in Jersey’s territorial waters from this Friday. Of the 162 licences, 113 are permanent (categorised as “green”) and 49 will be issued as temporary (“orange”). Vessels that receive a temporary licence will be able to fish in Jersey waters until 31 January 2022, to give them time to provide further data which is necessary to secure a permanent licence. Jersey officials have agreed to examine in detail additional evidence that has been provided by French authorities in the last week. Currently, there are 55 vessels in a third (“red”) category that will not have a licence to fish in Jersey waters after 31 October. The door remains open for further data to be submitted and new applications that meet the criteria under the trade and cooperation agreement can be submitted at any time. The announcement means there are an extra two permanent permits and 18 more temporary licences, reducing those rejected from 75 to 55. On Wednesday, the French government said that, unless further permits were issued, it would ban British vessels from landing seafood in its ports, tighten controls on UK imports and potentially reduce energy supply to Jersey. The island relies on sub-sea cables that deliver energy from French nuclear power stations. Ministers are monitoring the latest dispute with France over the issuing of licences to French fishing boats, Downing Street has said. The prime minister’s official spokesperson said the UK fully supported the way Jersey and Guernsey were handling the issue, which was “entirely in line” with the provisions of Britain’s trade deal with the EU. We are monitoring this situation very carefully. We have relayed our concerns to the (European) commission and the French government. We think the threats outlined yesterday evening were disappointing, were disproportionate and were simply not what we expect from a close ally and partner. I can’t at this moment set out exactly what our response might be. It will be appropriate, it will be calibrated. We want to have further discussions with French government and the EU. We stand ready to respond appropriately. The independence of the elections watchdog is vital, ministers have heard, as MPs questioned whether the body will be subject to government interference in future. Cat Smith, a Labour MP acting as a representative of the Electoral Commission, told the Commons the elections bill would give “significantly broader” scope and power to the government over the regulator than it has over similar bodies. The SNP accused ministers of a “grubby power grab” over moves in the bill to set the Electoral Commission’s overall strategy; something it cannot do for other regulators. Deidre Brock, the MP for Edinburgh North and Leith, said: The elections bill doesn’t only require Scottish voters to show ID at UK general elections, but also gives the Westminster government the powers to set the Electoral Commission’s strategy and policy statement. Given the Scottish parliament also pays towards the commission, isn’t this another case of a grubby Westminster power grab and an attack on our devolved settlement? On behalf of the Electoral Commission, Smith said: The elections bill does cover the whole of the UK but some provisions would apply differently to elections in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The commission’s view is that as currently drafted, the proposals for a strategy and policy statement are not consistent with its role as the independent regulator. The scope and power is significantly broader than similar mechanisms in place for other regulators such as Ofcom, Ofgen and Ofwat, which do not include giving guidance about specific matters. The existence of an independent regulator is fundamental for maintaining confidence in our electoral system. It is vital there is no actual or perceived involvement from government in the commission’s operational functions or decision making. A man has been charged after the deputy Labour leader, Angela Rayner, received a series of threats. Benjamin Iliffe, 36, of Slade Way, Chatteris, in Cambridgeshire, has been charged with malicious communications and possession of cannabis, Greater Manchester police (GMP) said. The force also said a 52-year-old man arrested in Halifax, West Yorkshire, on Wednesday has been bailed, while a 70-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of malicious communication relating to abusive emails received on Saturday 16 October. One man has been charged and an additional arrest has been made in relation to a police investigation into multiple reports of threatening and abusive phone calls, emails and letters towards a woman in Ashton-under-Lyne. Yesterday, officers from GMP attended an address in Halifax and arrested a 52-year-old man. The man was arrested on suspicion of malicious communications and has since been released on bail pending further enquiries. His arrest relates to abusive phone calls received on Friday 15 October. An additional arrest was made this morning in conjunction with South Yorkshire police. A 70-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of malicious communication and he remains in custody for questioning. His arrest relates to abusive emails received on Saturday 16 October. In conjunction with the investigation, police in Cambridgeshire have also charged one man. Benjamin Iliffe of Chatteris, Cambridgeshire, has been charged with malicious communications and possession of cannabis. He has been remanded into custody and will appear before Huntingdon magistrates’ court later today. Enquiries remain ongoing and GMP continues to work in partnership with Cambridgeshire constabulary and South Yorkshire police. The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, has told the Commons the budget is a “blueprint for a stronger Britain”, PA Media reports. It’s a country where if you have innovative ideas you will get the support you need to turn it from a dream into reality. It’s a country where if your talent is nurtured and your skills are honed you will get the support and the ongoing interest and engagement – strong engagement – from the government. It’s a country where if someone does an honest day’s work they will receive a decent wage. We have every right to be confident about our future. I think many of us have listened to the litany of woe and despair for too long, and we feel, as my right honourable friend the chancellor said yesterday, that we are optimistic, we are very excited about the future of our country. He dismissed criticism from the shadow business secretary, saying he had “heard it all before”, and criticised Ed Miliband’s performance at PMQs as “the same litany of doom and gloom, and it will prove no more effectual in 2021 than it did in 2015”. A director of the company that owns a British trawler detained by French maritime police has told AFP the act appears to be “politically motivated”. Andrew Brown, director of sustainability and public affairs at Macduff Shellfish, based at Mintlaw in Aberdeenshire, confirmed that the vessel was approached while fishing for scallops in the early hours of Thursday morning. “It does seem to be a misunderstanding. We believe we have been fishing legally in French waters,” he told AFP. Access to the waters is “a little bit complicated”, but they opened for fishing earlier this month, he said. “I suspect it is politically motivated,” he added, since “we’ve not had this issue” previously. The Cornelis is now being held at Le Havre while the skipper is interviewed by French officials, Brown added. Rishi Sunak’s decision to raise taxes on workers amid high levels of inflation will squeeze living standards next year, causing “real pain” for low-income households, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has warned. Issuing its verdict after the chancellor’s budget on Wednesday, the UK’s leading tax and spending thinktank said a middle earner was likely to be worse off next year as high rates of inflation and tax rises negate weak growth in wages. It said that while Sunak was promising a new age of optimism, voters might not get much feelgood factor after the chancellor announced £40bn of tax increases this year – the largest increase since 1993. Paul Johnson, the director of the IFS, said the outlook for living standards jarred with the chancellor’s upbeat tone. Over the next several years a combination of tax increases and high inflation will mean very slow growth in living standards. High inflation, rising taxes and poor growth, still undermined more by Brexit than by the pandemic, will see real living standards barely rising and, for many, falling over the next year. The thinktank said the chancellor’s plans came after a tough decade for households, with weak levels of economic growth and austerity. Miliband also told MPs: Yesterday we saw raid upon raid on the living standards of working people. Council tax hikes hidden in the budget documents, not announced by the chancellor. A stealth raid on the self-employed worth £1.7bn over the coming five years, not announced by the chancellor. And, of course, the national insurance hike on ordinary families confirmed. Maybe I’m a bit old-fashioned in this but let’s remember this is a direct breach of the promise every member of the party opposite made to their constituents at the general election. Miliband said the “most shameful” part of the budget was the government’s “refusal to reverse” the cut to universal credit, which took place in recent weeks via the removal of the £20 per week uplift. He raised questions about the lack of support for energy-intensive industries amid soaring energy prices before questioning the Treasury’s commitment to the government’s green agenda. Miliband also criticised the air passenger duty changes, adding: Once again it shows the Treasury is not signed up to this agenda. Removing the “Instagram filter” from Rishi Sunak’s budget reveals it offers an “age of stagnation” rather than optimism, according to the shadow business secretary. Ed Miliband said there has been 11 years of “low growth, stagnant wages, falling living standards” under the Conservatives, with the budget failing to tackle the cost-of-living crisis. Opening day two of the budget debate, Miliband told the Commons: It’s less than 24 hours since the budget was delivered and it’s already unravelling because of the chasm between the claims of ministers and the reality that working people face. To listen to the chancellor yesterday, it’s clear he is living on a totally different planet. He told us he’d deliver an age of optimism. But when you take off the Instagram filter all he offers is an age of stagnation. Low wages, low growth, high taxes, more lost Tory years. Returning to the issue around the detained trawler, the SNP’s environment spokeswoman, Deidre Brock, has pressed Eustice to offer more details, adding: We have a skipper of a Scottish scalloping vessel due in court, it’s simply not good enough that the secretary of state doesn’t have answers to those questions. Eustice, on the vessel thought to be detained, said: What I’ve been able to establish so far in respect of that vessel is that they were on the list that was provided by the MMO (Marine Management Organisation) initially to the European Union. The European Union therefore did grant a licence. We are seeing some reports that for some reason they were subsequently withdrawn from the list, it’s unclear why that might have been at the moment. Eustice said he was awaiting further details from Marine Scotland and is expecting a response in the “next hour or so”. Responding to the Resolution Foundation report this morning, the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has said: Revelations from yesterday’s budget that taxes will be £3,000 more per household than when Boris Johnson became prime minister are staggering. This is a budget hammering working people, while giving banks a tax cut. The Tories have no plan to tackle the cost-of-living crisis, no plan to shift the unfair taxes they’ve hit working people with and no plan for growth. This was an out-of-touch, high-tax, low-growth budget from a Conservative government that would rather waste billions of pounds of taxpayer cash than give households a VAT cut on their heating bills heading into winter. Labour would tax fairly, spend wisely, and grow our economy with our climate investment pledge and plan to buy, make and sell more in Britain. While he has declined to commit to cutting taxes before the next election, the chancellor has said he is unhappy with the increases he has introduced and that his ambition is to lower the tax burden. Now, a thinktank has warned that Sunak will have to develop “new and radical ways” to realise that ambition. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said he has taken the state to the levels “not seen in normal times since the days of Geoffrey Howe”; Margaret Thatcher’s first chancellor. In the IFS’ comprehensive budget analysis, its director, Paul Johnson, stressed that Sunak was doing so with “almost entirely a set of policy choices unrelated to the pandemic” by responding to government departments having been “starved of funding for a decade” under austerity. After “historic tax increases”, the IFS director said the story of Wednesday’s budget was of “spending increases and a worrying outlook for living standards”. Johnson warned of the challenges while trying to fulfil the demands of public services that have suffered a decade of cuts. In opening remarks at a post-budget event in central London, Johnson is due to say of Sunak: If he is to achieve the ambition he set out at the end of his speech to get taxes down and reduce the size of the state, then he is going to have to come up with some pretty new and radical ways to manage those pressures. He would be helped by an economy growing rather more enthusiastically than it has managed for some time now. Finding the key either to reforming public services to make them cheaper and more efficient, or to getting higher economic growth, are challenges which have defeated most of his predecessors. Johnson said if the current forecasts were correct then the chancellor could be in line for a pre-election giveaway of “perhaps £7bn and still maintain some fiscal headroom ... But, given his newly stated fiscal targets, it’s not a huge or comfortable cushion”. The home secretary, Priti Patel, has described the detention of a British fishing trawler by French authorities as disappointing. Asked if she was concerned about the latest action in the dispute about fishing rights and whether she had spoken with her French counterpart, she said: It is disappointing, and we as a country fulfilled all our obligations under the TCA. But at the same time, discussions across government will continue, both at commission level but also with counterparts within the French administration. The environment secretary said he had asked officials to urgently investigate the situation. The shadow environment secretary, Luke Pollard, asked in the Commons if an external waters licence has been issued “to the Scottish scalloper currently detained in Le Havre, as its name does not appear on the MMO website. Is that an oversight?” George Eustice replied: My officials are investigating the circumstances around this vessel that’s been detained in France. It is too early to be able to identify precisely what happened. But I have seen reports that it was on a list originally and then appeared not to be on a list. But it is something that I’ve asked our officials to urgently investigate. The shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said she welcomed increases in spending announced during yesterday’s budget, but said there were areas that gave her “cause for concern”. Highlighting the need for greater investment in education, she has told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: If we are going to grow the economy sustainably we have got to invest in our young people. Unless we ensure that kids catch up from that missed out education (during the pandemic) there will be a long-term cost to our economy. She called the announcement of a cut to air passenger duty ahead of the Cop26 climate summit astonishing. We wouldn’t have gone ahead with that cut. I find it astonishing that, the week before Cop26, where we are supposed to be showing global leadership, we have cut air passenger duty on domestic flights. We should be encouraging people to use our train network for those journeys. Sunak has declined to commit to cutting taxes before the next general election. Asked on Sky News whether he would slash taxes before the next Westminster polling day, which is expected to be held by 2024, the chancellor said: We started cutting taxes yesterday, our priority being those on the lowest incomes. There is a tax cut for 2 million families (the reduction of the universal credit taper rate) and it is not going to come in as normal next April – it is going to come in, in a few weeks time so we can get help to people right now. But, as I said very clearly yesterday, my ambition is to lower taxes for people, that is what I would like to do as chancellor. We had to take some corrective action as a result of the crisis and the response we took to it, but hopefully that now is done and, as we demonstrated yesterday, our priority is to make sure that work pays, that we reward people’s efforts and I’m delighted we could make a start on that yesterday. Pressed on whether there would be income tax cuts before the next election, the chancellor replied: No, no – let’s talk about this budget, rather than all the other ones. Rishi Sunak’s budget has the country set for a flat recovery for living standards amid fears the average household could see their tax rise by thousands of pounds during Boris Johnson’s premiership, a thinktank has warned. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has said the budget would leave the overall tax burden at its highest since the final period of Clement Attlee’s postwar Labour administration 70 years ago. The Resolution Foundation said this burden combined with higher growth, inflation and public spending than previously expected prompted it to warn “that Britain could be set for a flat recovery for household living standards”. The foundation’s analysis found the chancellor’s plans will mean that, by 2026-27, tax as a share of the economy will be at its highest level since 1950, amounting to a £3,000 increase per household since Boris Johnson became prime minister. The weakest decade of pay growth since the 1930s means real wages in the UK are set to fall again in 2022, with the foundation writing: Real wages are on course to grow by just 2.4% from May 2008 to May 2024 – a far cry from the 36% real wage growth experienced between May 1992 and May 2008. Burnley and Bury, two distinct towns separated by a 20-mile drive, were interchangeable to Sunak this morning as he tried to talk up the government’s so-called levelling-up agenda. The chancellor was conducting broadcast interviews in the latter but he seemed to think he was in the former. The BBC Breakfast presenter Ben Thompson told Sunak he was from Burnley, which is in Lancashire. Sunak said: It is not just about being in the north [of England], by the way. We’re here in Burnley but, if you are growing up in a village in the south-west or even on the south coast, people want to feel opportunity is there for them, wherever they happen to be. I put it down to two things: One is having pride in the place you call home and a lot of what we announced yesterday, the levelling-up fund – bids like Burnley market, world famous Burnley market, benefiting from £20m of investment. That’s going to create jobs. It is about improving the every day infrastructure of our communities. But he defended his decision not to cut VAT on home energy bills to counter rising energy prices. Asked on BBC Breakfast why he did not make such a move, the chancellor said: Because, as many independent experts and thinktanks have pointed out, it is not a particularly well-targeted measure because people living in very large homes with large energy bills would disproportionately benefit from that. Actually, where we want to target support is on those who are a bit more vulnerable. That is why just over a month ago, or around about then, we announced half-a-billion pounds in something called the household support fund, and that will provide £150 for about 3 million of our most vulnerable households, to help them with some of those higher bills through the winter period. I think that is a more targeted approach to get help to those who really need it, not a very large VAT cut, the bulk of the benefit of which would end up going to people with large homes with big bills who probably don’t need the help. Here’s a little more detail on Sunak’s comments this morning. During an appearance on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, he was asked about the impact of inflation on price increases. He said: I addressed inflation yesterday in the budget speech and I know people will have concerns about that and I wanted to provide a bit of an explanation and some reassurance on what was going on. It is largely down to two global forces: one is the impact of rapidly reopening economies putting pressure on global supply chains and the other factor is, of course, energy prices. I wish I did but I don’t have a magic wand that can make those global challenges disappear; they are going to be with us for a little while. But where the government can make a difference, we are – whether it is the tax cut, whether it is freezing fuel duty, whether it is helping people with energy bills through the winter, where we have put support in place – we are doing what we can. The chancellor has insisted he does not have a “magic wand” to make cost of living pressures disappear, while also insisting he was right not to use some of the tools at his disposal to help struggling households. Rishi Sunak has sought to play up the role of global problems in driving inflation – not least of energy prices – while insisting he was right not not cut VAT on home energy bills because it would disproportionately benefit those in large homes. He’s in Burnley or Bury – depending on whether you believe Rishi Sunak or Rishi Sunak – doing the morning media round following his budget yesterday. In Westminster, the Speaker of the Commons Lindsay Hoyle has granted an urgent question in the Commons on the fishing dispute in which a British trawler has been detained by the French. That will be asked by the SNP’s environment, food and rural affairs spokeswoman Deidre Brock and is expected from 10.30am. There will also be business questions and a continuation of the budget debate."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2020/jan/07/budget-2020-sajid-javid-brexit-tax","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2020-01-07T13:27:07Z","webTitle":"Budget 2020: what will Sajid Javid announce?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/07/budget-2020-sajid-javid-brexit-tax","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2020/jan/07/budget-2020-sajid-javid-brexit-tax","fields":{"headline":"Budget 2020: what will Sajid Javid announce?","bodyText":"Sajid Javid has announced the date of the budget as 11 March with a promise to kickstart a decade of renewal. Fresh from the landslide Conservative victory, the chancellor will use the event to formalise spending commitments made before the general election. The budget will be Britain’s first in more than four decades as a non-EU member state, and take place against a backdrop of subpar economic growth and a scramble to negotiate a trade deal with Brussels before the end of the year. Here are five key areas Javid will be expected to target: Infrastructure The chancellor announced the date of the budget at the construction site of a £350m extension to the Manchester tram network, sending a signal that infrastructure spending – particularly in the north of England – would form the backbone of his maiden tax and spending event. The Tory manifesto included plans to ramp up capital spending by about £20bn above current levels, indicating there is plenty of additional funding available for projects across the country. A key question mark will be whether the government goes ahead with the first phase of HS2 route between London and Birmingham. Regions Javid is expected to announce a shake-up of Treasury rules to enable higher levels of investment in the north and the Midlands. Government investment decisions are based on the generation of gross value added, a measure of economic output that critics argue has traditionally benefited London and the south-east. The new rules are expected to include targets for improving wellbeing or reducing regional productivity gaps. Public services Boris Johnson made increasing spending on public services a central plank of his election campaign, promising to bring to an end the decade of austerity initiated by his Conservative predecessors. Javid will be expected to deliver on the prime minister’s priorities, including funding for new hospitals, training thousands of new police officers and funding schools and vocational training. One area to watch will be social care. Beyond a promise to raise funding by £1bn, the issue was a notable black hole in the Conservative manifesto. Overall, the manifesto included about £1.5bn in additional day-to-day spending on public services next year above existing levels. Environment The Treasury said the chancellor would prioritise the environment in the budget. The government has committed to reaching net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, but has so far announced few spending-related measures to help hit the target. Policies announced in the Tory manifesto that could feature at the budget include plans to make homes more energy-efficient, with £9.2bn for spending on insulation and similar measures for schools and hospitals. Offshore wind is to reach 40GW of capacity by 2030, more than 11 times the capacity of the Hinkley C nuclear power station under construction in Somerset. There will also be an investment of £800m for carbon capture and storage – a technology that stores CO2 emissions – and £500m to help energy-intensive industries reduce their carbon output. Tax Johnson promised to cut taxes before the election. Changes include raising the threshold for national insurance contributions to £9,500 a year in 2020-21 as well as reducing the burden of business rates on companies. The Treasury is, however, constrained by the public finances, which remain in deficit despite a decade of Conservative promises to eliminate the gap between public spending and tax income. Johnson said before the election that he would freeze a cut in corporation tax to provide about £6bn for other priorities. Javid will announce new rules allowing him to increase public borrowing to take advantage of low interest rates and to invest for the future. However, he will still target a balanced day-to-day spending budget within three years."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/live/2022/apr/06/uk-politics-live-tories-two-child-policy-child-poverty-report-national-insurance-latest-updates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-06T15:48:05Z","webTitle":"UK politics: Boris Johnson defends national insurance increase amid cost of living crisis – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2022/apr/06/uk-politics-live-tories-two-child-policy-child-poverty-report-national-insurance-latest-updates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/live/2022/apr/06/uk-politics-live-tories-two-child-policy-child-poverty-report-national-insurance-latest-updates","fields":{"headline":"UK politics: Boris Johnson defends national insurance increase amid cost of living crisis – as it happened","bodyText":"Here’s a roundup of the key developments from the day: Since the introduction of the two-child policy – which limits benefits payments to the first two children born to the poorest households –exactly five years ago today, the fertility rate for third and subsequent children born to poorer families has barely fallen. Instead, the main impact of the policy has been to become the biggest single driver of child poverty. The financial pressures on many UK households and businesses have intensified today, as national insurance rates are lifted to raise funds for the NHS and social care. Despite the cost of living crisis, the government has pressed on with its manifesto-busting 1.25 percentage point rise in national insurance, announced last September. The increase in national insurance payments for millions of people already struggling to deal with the cost of living crisis is both right and fair, the health secretary has said. Sajid Javid said the levy of an extra 1.25 percentage points, due from Wednesday, was needed to pay for health and social care as a result of the Covid pandemic. Keir Starmer says the national insurance rise is “the wrong tax at the wrong time”. The Labour leader said: People are really, really struggling to pay their bills. And this is just going to impact on them very, very hard. Increasing national insurance for millions of workers is unfair and comes at the wrong time as the nation faces a cost-of-living crisis, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey has said. He told BBC Breakfast that “the NHS and the care system does need money but it needs to be done in a fair way”. Boris Johnson said he had “absolutely no problem” with hiking national insurance to help fund the NHS. He did, however, acknowledge households would face choices to help make ends meet. Rishi Sunak’s popularity with voters has plunged amid continuing debate over the government’s reaction to surging living costs, according to a poll. His net favourability was down 24 points since just before his spring statement on 23 March, to reach minus 29, the survey by YouGov found. Hospitals and ambulance services across England are under “enormous strain” fuelled by “heavy demand”, “severe” staff shortages and soaring Covid cases, health leaders have warned after NHS trusts covering millions of patients declared critical incidents. Dr Layla McCay, director of policy at the NHS Confederation, which represents the whole healthcare system, said the situation had become so serious that “all parts” of the health service were now becoming “weighed down”. The Scottish Conservatives today diverged from the Westminster party as they committed to voting for a ban on conversion practices – including a ban on trans conversion therapy – in forthcoming Holyrood legislation. Divisions in the Conservative party over the privatisation of Channel 4 are bursting into the open, with the plans likely to face a bumpy ride in parliament. After the government made the announcement, it became clear that privatisation plans were not sitting well, not only with media personalities but also with senior figures in the Conservative party. Sewage has become a major battleground in the local elections in so-called “blue wall” seats, where the Liberal Democrats are challenging the Conservatives, from Guildford to Cambridgeshire. The Lib Dems have put eliminating sewage dumps at the heart of their campaign, with the party leader, Ed Davey, launching their fight today in Wimbledon. Chronic worker shortages in the food and farming sector as a result of Brexit and the coronavirus pandemic could push food prices even higher and lead to more having to be imported, MPs have warned. Parliamentarians on the environment, food and rural affairs committee reported that the sector had half a million vacancies in August last year, representing an eighth of all roles. The government will unveil its long-awaited energy strategy tomorrow, with rising bills one of the main pressures on household finances. Boris Johnson told reporters in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, that there was a “limit to the amount of taxpayers’ money” that could be used to address the problem. The job of keeping the UK’s electricity and gas flowing will be returned to public control by 2024, under government plans for the effective nationalisation of a division of National Grid. A new public body, the “Future Systems Operator” will have responsibility for planning and managing energy distribution, with a focus on the challenges posed by decarbonisation. That’s it from me today. Thanks for joining me. For the latest news on Ukraine, follow our dedicated live blog: Hospital trusts in Yorkshire have warned patients they may have to wait for up to 12 hours to be seen at accident and emergency (A&amp;E), after a sharp increase in demand. The West Yorkshire Association of Acute Trusts (WYAAT), which covers six hospitals in West Yorkshire and Harrogate, has issued a plea for patients to attend their local A&amp;E only in “genuine life-threatening situations”. The warning came after the clinical director of a hospital in Lancashire said patients were routinely waiting more than two days for a bed, with staff left “crying with frustration and anger”. “For the past few months we have on a regular basis had more than 50 patients waiting for a bed and that wait being in excess of 60 hours,” Graham Ellis, the clinical director of Royal Preston hospital told the hospital trust’s executive team in a letter leaked to the Health Service Journal. He added: We have witnessed senior experienced staff crying with frustration and anger as they have had to resuscitate patients in the waiting room, examine in the viewing room and CT changing room, seen patients leave the department as they have been pulled out of a cubicle to allow someone more unwell to be treated in their former space and patients die without the dignity of privacy. Read the full story here: Boris Johnson has said he does not “think that biological males should be competing in female sporting events”, amid the fallout from his decision not to ban conversion practices for people questioning their gender. Speaking on Wednesday, the prime minister said the issue “wasn’t something I thought that I would have to consider in great detail”. Johnson also said that women should have spaces in hospitals, prisons and changing rooms which were “dedicated to women”. “That’s as far as my thinking has developed on this issue,” Johnson told a journalist during a visit to a hospital in Hertfordshire. “And if that puts me in conflict with some others, then we have got to work it all out.” He added: That doesn’t mean that I’m not immensely sympathetic to people who want to change gender, to transition, and it’s vital that we give people the maximum possible love and support in making those decisions. But these are complex issues. And I don’t think they can be solved with one swift, easy piece of legislation … it takes a lot of thought to get this right. He also insisted it was right to exclude people who were questioning their gender from a long-promised ban on so-called conversion “therapy”. After the resignation of a senior equality adviser and cancellation of the government’s flagship international LGBT conference in the face of a mass withdrawal of support from stakeholders, the prime minister said he was “sad” at their response. Read more from my colleagues Aubrey Allegretti and Libby Brooks here: The UK has imposed a sweeping set of sanctions on Russia in response to the atrocities committed in Ukraine. Asset freezes have been imposed on Sberbank, Russia’s largest bank, and the Credit Bank of Moscow. All new outward investment to Russia has been banned and the UK has also committed to end all imports of Russian coal and oil by the end of the year, with gas to follow as soon as possible. Imports of Russian iron and steel products will be banned and a further eight oligarchs have also been added to the sanctions list. Liz Truss said the package was “some of our toughest sanctions yet”. The foreign secretary said: Our latest wave of measures will bring an end to the UK’s imports of Russian energy and sanction yet more individuals and businesses, decimating (Vladimir) Putin’s war machine. Together with our allies, we are showing the Russian elite that they cannot wash their hands of the atrocities committed on Putin’s orders. We will not rest until Ukraine prevails. Follow our dedicated liveblog on the invasion of Ukraine here: The job of keeping the UK’s electricity and gas flowing will be returned to public control by 2024, under government plans for the effective nationalisation of a division of National Grid. A new public body, the “Future Systems Operator” will have responsibility for planning and managing energy distribution, with a focus on the challenges posed by decarbonisation. The government said the plan, announced on the eve of the publication of its long-awaited energy strategy, would “drive progress towards net zero while maintaining energy security and minimising costs for consumers.” BEIS said the National Grid, a stock market-listed company since 1995, would be “appropriately compensated” in a transaction that will see the government take control of its Electricity System Operator, the part of the business that keeps the lights on. Gas distribution assets will also be taken into state ownership. The National Grid’s chief executive, John Pettigrew, said National Grid “has a critical role to play in the decarbonisation of the economy to reach net zero, while continuing to ensure security of supply at the lowest cost to consumers.” He said: We have been working closely with government, industry and the regulator to create a Future System Operator that enables long-term holistic thinking, drives progress towards net zero, and lays the foundations for the regulatory reform necessary to deliver a clean, fair and affordable energy transition. We will continue to work closely with all relevant parties to ensure a smooth transition, subject to parliamentary approval and conclusion of the transaction process. Read more here: PA reports that divisions in the Conservative party over the privatisation of Channel 4 are bursting into the open, with the plans likely to face a bumpy ride in parliament. Tory MP and Father of the House Sir Peter Bottomley told the PA news agency the House of Lords will take out any clause that privatises the network, and announced he will make a speech shortly after the Queen’s speech in the Commons explaining why he deems the plans “unconservative”. The government confirmed on Monday that it will proceed with plans to privatise Channel 4, which has been publicly owned since it was founded in 1982 and is funded by advertising. The culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, said that while Channel 4 held a “cherished place in British life” she felt that public ownership was holding the broadcaster back from “competing against streaming giants like Netflix and Amazon”. Plans for the sale will reportedly be set out in a white paper later this month and will be included in a new media bill for next spring. After the government made the announcement, it became clear that privatisation plans were not sitting well, not only with media personalities but also with senior figures in the Conservative party. A string of Tory MPs and peers, including Sir Peter, former Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, chair of the digital, culture, media and sport (DCMS) committee Julian Knight, and former cabinet ministers Damian Green and Jeremy Hunt publicly questioned the plans. Sir Keir Starmer has said ministers should honour their promises to ban all forms of conversion therapy. Speaking during a visit to Bacup in Lancashire, the Labour leader said: “Conversion therapy in all its forms should be banned. That used to be the government’s position. “They have been flip-flopping on this over the last few days. The need to stick to their promises.” Sir Keir accused ministers of using the issue to try to distract from the cost-of-living crisis as the rise in national insurance contributions kicked in. “They know that what is keeping people awake at night is the cost of living, whether they can pay their bills or not,” he said. “In order to try to distract from that the government wants to create an argument about conversion therapy. It is not going to wash.” Hospitals and ambulance services across England are under “enormous strain” fuelled by “heavy demand”, “severe” staff shortages and soaring Covid cases, health leaders have warned after NHS trusts covering millions of patients declared critical incidents. Dr Layla McCay, director of policy at the NHS Confederation, which represents the whole healthcare system, said the situation had become so serious that “all parts” of the health service were now becoming “weighed down”. This will have a “direct knock-on effect” on the ability of staff to tackle the care backlog, she added, as well as the current provision of urgent and emergency care. She sounded the alarm after a major ambulance trust, South Central Ambulance Service (SCAS), which covers 7 million people across Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Hampshire, Oxfordshire, Sussex and Surrey, declared a critical incident after “extreme pressures” forced it to prioritise patients with life-threatening illnesses. Following on from the post about Rishi Sunak’s waning popularity, a separate poll from Ipsos Mori also shows that his favourability ratings have dropped to the lowest since he became chancellor. It found that: 26% of Britons are favourable towards the chancellor and 44% unfavourable. 56% think country heading in the wrong direction – highest number this parliament. 52% think Johnson should resign if issued with a fixed penalty notice over partygate. The Scottish Conservatives today diverged from the Westminster party as they committed to voting for a ban on conversion practices – including a ban on trans conversion therapy – in forthcoming Holyrood legislation. In January, a Holyrood committee published a report calling for an immediate ban on the “traumatising” practice in Scotland, with the recommendations being welcomed as a fully comprehensive prohibition, with no exemptions. But the Scottish party also announced that “supporting women’s spaces in council-run venues including schools, parks and swimming pools” would be a key plank of its manifesto for the May council elections. Welcoming the recent EHRC guidelines on same-sex spaces – which have caused much concern and distress amongst the LGBTQ+ community – as providing “necessary clarity”, the Scottish Conservative spokeswoman on gender reform, Meghan Gallacher MSP, said: Our local government manifesto will include a commitment to protect women’s same-sex spaces. It is essential that we continue to respect women’s safety. We cannot allow long-held rights to be eroded.” Many women feel that their place in society and their safety is under threat. Those views should be heard and respected, not dismissed, as they have been on too many occasions. Rishi Sunak’s popularity with voters has plunged amid continuing debate over the government’s reaction to surging living costs, according to a poll. His net favourability was down 24 points since just before his spring statement on 23 March, to reach minus 29, the survey by YouGov found. The poll put the Chancellor’s support below that of Keir Starmer (minus 25) for the first time since the Labour leader took office, PA News reports. Minus 29 is Sunak’s lowest ever result and is a 24-point decrease since 22-23 March, and a 14-point drop since immediately after the spring statement, the figures showed. The poll found more than half of Britons (57%) have an unfavourable opinion of the chancellor, compared with 28% who view him in a positive light. Sunak’s net favourability with 2019 Conservative voters was 6, a fall of 23 points from March 23-24, and a drop from 41 just before the spring statement. The prime minister’s net favourability among Britons was minus 34, down 8 points from March 23-24. Boris Johnson’s favourability among 2019 Conservative voters was 7. Starmer’s net favourability of minus 25 is down from minus 21 on 23-24 March, while his net favourability among Labour voters is 20 – 13 points higher than that of Johnson among conservative voters. The findings were based on a survey of 2,120 British adults on 4-5 April, YouGov said. YouGov says: The aftermath of the spring statement and the ongoing cost-of-living crisis seem to be continuing to have a devastating effect on Rishi Sunak’s popularity among the British public. The chancellor’s spring statement has been criticised as failing to support lower-income households through the worst cost-of-living crisis in decades and caused widespread anger among those who stand to suffer most from spiralling prices. Speaking against the national insurance rise, Keir Starmer said now is “not the time” to be putting up taxes. The Labour leader told Jeremy Vine on BBC Radio 2 This is a tax that hits businesses and working people. It doesn’t hit others. So, if you’re a landlord with 20 or 30 properties, you are not getting a penny more taxed today. If you’re a tenant of that landlord in work, you’re getting whacked with the national insurance tax. Starmer stressed a Labour government “will always support the NHS” and “there is obviously a need to deal with the backlog of waiting lists, etc”, but added: The problem I have got with this tax today is that it’s going to raise about 12bn or so, 11 or 12bn. That is the money that has been lost in the last two years through Covid, through equipment we didn’t need or fraud, and the government is not going to try to recover that money. When asked if the country is heading towards the next election with Labour promising lower tax and lower spending than the Conservatives, the Labour leader said: We have declared that now is not the time to be putting up taxes. I think most people know the last two years have been really, really tough. All the businesses in Bacup I have spoken to this morning are saying: ‘ook, Keir, it has been tough on us, we have kept going and now what we need to do is get back on our feet, get people back into the high streets, give us a bit of breathing space so we can grow the economy.’ I think they’re right about that. So, I’m not saying that, you know, we don’t need to raise money to pay for the health service. Of course I’m not, but I am saying that the single biggest problem the moment is growing the economy. Ed Davey said the UK could be on a “slippery slope” when it came to its free press as he vowed to fight plans to privatise Channel 4. The Liberal Democrat leader told PA news agency at his party’s local election campaign launch in south-west London: We have huge numbers of commercial stations, and that’s great. Do we really need to get rid of the remaining public service broadcasters? The Liberal Democrat answer is absolutely not. We should be strengthening and supporting them. I really worry that what we’re seeing is what we’ve seen in the United States with Fox News and countries like – I’m not saying it is going quite this far – Hungary and (Viktor) Orban, where they like to close down the free, independent press. We are going to fight that every step of the way. It is a slippery slope. We have to protect our free press, our independent press, and there are too many moves the conservative government is making that I think is undermining our free press, and we are going to fight to stop them. Ed Davey has said he is worried about the conservative government’s approach to public broadcasting after ministers announced plans to privatise Channel 4. The Channel 4 move is seen as the biggest sell-off of a publicly-owned company since the Royal Mail – a decision taken when the Lib Dems were in a coalition government with the conservatives. The Liberal Democrat leader told PA news agency at his party’s local election campaign launch that the Royal Mail decision had been about “looking after low-paid” workers because it was “losing huge amounts of money” and people faced losing their pensions and jobs. He said: The privatisation of Channel 4 is a completely different issue and we are totally against it. That has been in our manifesto, it is still our policy. I am deeply worried about what the conservatives are doing to our public broadcasting, whether that is the attacks on the BBC we keep getting and now the privatisation of Channel 4. The government will unveil its long-awaited energy strategy on Thursday, with rising bills one of the main pressures on household finances. Boris Johnson told reporters in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, that there was a “limit to the amount of taxpayers’ money” that could be used to address the problem. We will do everything we can to help people with the the energy price spikes, which ... are a global thing, they are being exacerbated by what (Vladimir) Putin is doing in Ukraine. We’ll have to see how long that goes on for. But, as we did during Covid, we will make sure we look after people to the best of our ability. Now, we’ve got to be frank with people, there’s a limit to the amount of taxpayers’ money we can simply push towards trying to deal with global energy price spikes. What we can do is make sure that we fix some of the long-term problems and I think it was a great mistake not to invest long-term in nuclear power. And I’ll be saying a lot more about that tomorrow. He said it was also possible to be “more urgent” in rolling out some renewable power generation. Boris Johnson said he had “absolutely no problem” with hiking national insurance to help fund the NHS. Speaking in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, he said: I’ve got absolutely no problem with it. We’ve got to do the difficult things. We’ve got to take the big decisions, the right decisions for this country. Johnson said he wanted 75% of people waiting no more than 28 days for a cancer diagnosis but “it’s only possible if you invest now”. “It’s the biggest priority for the country,” he said. Johnson acknowledged households would face choices to help make ends meet. Asked whether families should eat cheaper food, not replace clothes, turn down the thermostat or turn heating off entirely, the prime minister said: People obviously are going to face choices that they are going to have to make. We in the government will do everything that we can to help. The “most important thing” that could be done was to have a “strong, robust economy in which you have a high level of security in your employment”. Boris Johnson has defended the national insurance increase but acknowledged households were facing “unquestionably tough times”. Speaking at a hospital in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, he said: What we are doing today is unquestionably the right thing for our country, it’s the right thing for the NHS. Because we’ve got, here in the UK, we’ve now got backlogs, waiting lists of six million people. Everybody across the country knows somebody who is waiting for cancer treatment or some sort of procedure that’s crucial for their health. We’ve got to give our doctors and our nurses the wherewithal, the funding, to deal with that. The prime minister said the government would help families “in any way that we can”, including the 22 billion package of measures announced to support households “through what are unquestionably tough times caused by the end of the pandemic, the global inflation problem, the energy price spike”. Ed Davey has kicked off the Liberal Democrats’ local elections campaign by the River Wandle in Wimbledon, south-west London. The party leader told supporters: Life has been tough for so many people, it is still tough. They are rising to the challenge, they are raising their families, caring for others, playing by the rules. Now, more than ever, they deserve a fair deal, but the rising cost of energy, soaring energy bills, are overwhelming millions of families and pensioners. Yet this Conservative government either doesn’t care or doesn’t get it. The Conservatives are raising unfair taxes again and again. He also accused Tory MPs of voting consistently “to allow water companies to pour their filthy sewage into our waters”. Sewage has become a major battleground in the local elections in so-called “blue wall” seats, where the Liberal Democrats are challenging the Conservatives, from Guildford to Cambridgeshire. The Lib Dems have put eliminating sewage dumps at the heart of their campaign, with the party leader, Ed Davey, planning to launch their fight at the River Wandle in Wimbledon on Wednesday. He is calling for a tax on sewage companies to fund the clean up of local rivers, which can see waste pumped out into the environment when there is heavy rainfall. The Tories have been under huge public pressure over the issue since the government rejected a House of Lords amendment to put a legal duty on water companies to phase out pumping waste into rivers last autumn. However, in a sign of how contested the issue has become, some Tory election material on social media has misleadingly accused the Lib Dems of “voting against a legal duty to clean up rivers”. Lib Dem MPs opposed the government’s plans in favour of stronger legal duties backed by opposition parties. A Liberal Democrat source said: Conservative MPs are clearly running scared of the huge public backlash over sewage. Their desperate new social media tactics just won’t cut it. Read more here: Keir Starmer says the national insurance rise is “the wrong tax at the wrong time”. The Labour leader said: People are really, really struggling to pay their bills. And this is just going to impact on them very, very hard. Starmer told BBC Radio 5 Live the government had chosen to place the burden on people in employment, while protecting those who made income from renting out property and share dividends. He said: There are lots of landlords who’ve got many, many properties and they are not going to be paying a penny more in tax. Their tenants, who are going out to work, are going to be paying more in tax. Instead, Starmer said the “general approach should be that income of all its forms should be taxed fairly” and promised to set out Labour’s plan to follow that before the next general election, due to take place in about two years. The increase in national insurance payments for millions of people already struggling to deal with the cost of living crisis is both right and fair, the health secretary has said. Sajid Javid said the levy of an extra 1.25 percentage points, due from Wednesday, was needed to pay for health and social care after the pandemic. The government has pressed ahead with its plans to increase national insurance contributions for both workers and businesses, despite calls from businesses groups, unions and some Conservative MPs to at least delay the introduction. A planned change to free some of the country’s lowest earners from national insurance contributions altogether is not due to be implemented until the summer. Read more here: It would be “morally wrong” to let “our children pay for our healthcare and our adult social care”, Sajid Javid has said. Speaking on BBC Breakfast, the health secretary said: The choice for us as a country is we either put that money in ourselves now, and if we don’t do it ourselves, we will have to borrow it. And that is mortgaging the future of our children and our grandchildren. I think it not only is economically wrong and opens up more risk for the public finances, I think it is morally wrong. Why should our children pay for our healthcare and our adult social care? They are going to have enough challenges as they grow older. I think that will be the wrong approach. The financial pressures on many UK households and businesses have intensified today, as national insurance rates are lifted to raise funds for the NHS and social care. Despite the cost of living crisis, the government has pressed on with its manifesto-busting 1.25 percentage point rise in national insurance, announced last September. The move means millions of workers will begin paying higher National Insurance contributions from today, the start of the new tax year. Businesses will also see their contributions rise, at a time when they’re already juggling rising costs. Tax rates for dividend income also rise by 1.25 percentage points. Businesses groups, unions and some Conservative MPs had all pushed the government to delay the increase, given the financial pressures on workers and companies. The “health and social care levy” is expected to raise around £12bn per year, to tackle the backlog of cases at the NHS due to the pandemic, and also reform routine services. Today’s changes mean those earning above £9,880 will now be liable for 13.25% NI contributions, up from 12%. Earnings above £50,270 will be charged a rate of 3.25%, up from 2%. But from July, national insurance will only start to be charged on earnings over £12,570, because chancellor Rishi Sunak announced a £3,000 rise in the NI threshold in last month’s spring statement. That will take around two million workers out of direct tax altogether (if they earn less than £12,570 per year). According to Resolution Foundation, everyone earning less than £32,000 a year will be better off from the combination of those two policies from July. But there are other changes kicking in for the new tax year, including a freeze on income tax thresholds. That will drag more people into paying tax, or more tax, if their pay increases over the next few years. That will make it harder for households to handle rising costs, such as last week’s surge in energy bills. Prime minister Boris Johnson has defended the national insurance increases, saying the health service needs the extra resources: We must be there for our NHS in the same way that it is there for us. Covid led to the longest waiting lists we’ve ever seen, so we will deliver millions more scans, checks and operations in the biggest catch-up programme in the NHS’s history. We know this won’t be a quick fix, and we know that we can’t fix waiting lists without fixing social care. Our reforms will end the cruel lottery of spiralling and unpredictable care costs once and for all and bring the NHS and social care closer together. The Levy is the necessary, fair and responsible next step, providing our health and care system with the long term funding it needs as we recover from the pandemic. The government says the levy means: It will begin raising billions to tackle Covid backlogs and reform routine services. £39bn over the next three years will put health and care services on a sustainable footing. It will deliver biggest catch-up programme in NHS history and end spiralling social care costs. You can follow the business liveblog which is covering the rise in national insurance in detail today: One thing no government can control is NHS demand, the health secretary has said. When asked when the NHS waiting list will start falling, Sajid Javid told BBC Breakfast: I have been really straightforward about this. What we can do in the NHS is increase activity levels and that is exactly what this extra funding is going to do. The one thing that no government can control is demand for the NHS, especially on the back of a pandemic. We estimate some 11 million people stayed away from the NHS during the height of the pandemic. I think we can all understand why that happened. I want those people to come back. I want them to know that the NHS is there, that it’s open for them. I want them to be seen. What I don’t know, no-one knows, is what proportion of those people will come back. Is it 50%? Is it 70% or 30%? That is why it’s very hard to put a number on where the waiting list goes. It is already at six million and it will go higher before it starts to come down. The chair of the the environment, food and rural affairs committee, which has published a report about “acute labour shortages” in the food and farming industry, said he was “hopeful” the home office was listening to concerns. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Neil Parish said: I am hopeful that the Home Office is listening but they must listen and do something about it rather than just leave it and it’ll sort itself out, because it won’t. Chronic worker shortages in the food and farming sector as a result of Brexit and the coronavirus pandemic could push food prices even higher and lead to more having to be imported, MPs have warned. Parliamentarians on the environment, food and rural affairs committee reported that the sector had half a million vacancies in August last year, representing an eighth of all roles. The huge labour shortages in the food industry have led to unharvested crops being left to rot in fields, the cull of healthy pigs on farms because of a lack of workers at meat processing plants, and disruption to the food supply chain, as well as threatening the UK’s food security. The committee – which is chaired by the Conservative MP Neil Parish, along with five other Conservatives, four Labour MPs and one Scottish National party colleague – wrote in a report that the workforce shortfall was the “single biggest factor affecting the sector”. The food industry is the UK’s largest manufacturing sector but MPs issued the stark warning that it could shrink permanently if the government does not address the acute labour shortages, which could lead to wage rises, price increases, reduced competitiveness and, ultimately, food production being exported abroad. They found that food and farming businesses have been badly hit by a lack of workers, with the pig sector particularly affected, prompting a crisis in domestic production. Industry associations have previously claimed that as many as 40 independent farms have left the sector as a result. Farmers have been warning for some time about a lack of workers, after many overseas workers went home during the pandemic, and Brexit has limited the number of EU temporary workers who can travel to the UK on the seasonal worker visa scheme. Read more here: Increasing national insurance for millions of workers is unfair and comes at the wrong time as the nation faces a cost-of-living crisis, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey has said. He told BBC Breakfast that “the NHS and the care system does need money but it needs to be done in a fair way”. On the national insurance rise, he said: It doesn’t tax the unearned income of very wealthy people. It doesn’t tax the income of landlords. It puts all the burden on working people – that is wrong. Yes, we need more money for the NHS and social care. The Conservatives starved it of money and one reason why the pandemic was so difficult was that the Tories had underfunded the NHS. He said that income tax could go up a penny in the pound because that “spreads the burden and makes sure that wealthy people do pay their fair share”. Davey told the programme: The problem we have at the moment is that the conservatives are not only taking an unfair approach to funding the NHS, but they are putting this tax rise up just at the wrong moment. The health secretary has defended the decision to hike up national insurance for millions of workers as he argued it is “right that we pay for what we are going to use as a country”. Sajid Javid told Sky News it was “necessary” because of the impact of the pandemic, which is going to have an impact for years. It kicks in today, the new health and social care levy. All of the funding raised from it is going to go towards the extra 39 billion we are going to put in over the next three years to health and social care. It’s going to pay in the NHS for activity levels that are some 130% of pre-pandemic, it’s going to be nine million more scans, tests and procedures, meaning people will get seen a lot earlier. Why is any of this necessary, whether it is for health or social care? It’s because of the impact of the pandemic. We know it is unprecedented. It has been the biggest challenge in our lifetime. The impact of that is going to continue for many years. He added: You asked me about the fairness of it. When we spend money on public services, whether it’s NHS or anything else, for that matter, the money can only come from two sources. You raise it directly for people today, that’s through taxes, or you borrow it, which essentially you are asking the next generation to pay for it. I think it is right that we pay for what we are going to use as a country but we do it in a fair way. This levy, the way it is being raised is the top 15% of earners will pay almost 50%. I think that is the right way to do this. Welcome to today’s politics live blog. I’m Nicola Slawson and I’ll be taking the lead today. You can contact me on Twitter (@Nicola_Slawson) or via email (nicola.slawson@theguardian.com) if you have any questions or think I’m missing something. We also have a dedicated Ukraine blog, which you can follow here: It was one of the Conservatives’ most controversial cuts: waging war on the UK’s “benefit culture” by restricting social security payments that supposedly enabled “welfare scroungers” to have large families they could ill-afford. The two-child policy – which limits benefits payments to the first two children born to the poorest households – would, proponents argued, cut the welfare bill and bring “feckless” parents to heel by – as one minister put it – teaching them “the reality that children cost money.” New research, however, indicates the behavioural change aspect of the policy has dismally failed. Since its introduction exactly five years ago today, the fertility rate for third and subsequent children born to poorer families has barely fallen. Instead, the main impact of the policy has been to become the biggest single driver of child poverty. Prof Jonathan Portes, co-author of the study said: In the absence of a behavioural fertility response to the policy, the main function of the two-child limit is to deprive families living on a low income of approximately £3,000 a year. This will inevitably lead to dramatic increases in child poverty among larger families. Analysis of birth records and household survey data for the study, commissioned by the Nuffield Foundation, found the policy’s introduction in 2017 led to a decline in births of third children of just 5,600 a year – fewer than 1% of the total annual births in England and Wales. The study speculates as to why the policy has had so little behavioural impact. Unpublished research suggests over half of families were unaware of the policy before they were affected. Many large families – Orthodox Jewish and Muslim families are disproportionately affected – may ignore it for religious reasons. The research comes as fresh estimates suggest that 1.4 million children in more than 400,000 families in the UK are affected by the two-child policy. April’s below-inflation benefits rise means affected families with three children face a £983 a month shortfall in benefits, with larger families facing an even bigger hole in their income. Sara Ogilvie of Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG), which produced the estimates, said: The two-child limit is a brutal policy that punishes children simply for having brothers and sisters. It forces families to survive on less than they need, and with soaring living costs the hardship and hunger these families face will only intensify.

Archaeologists say the discovery at Somerton, near Glastonbury, sheds significant light on life and death in the south-west of Britain after the Roman invasion. Some of the people buried in the Romano-British cemetery were clearly of high status, with the position of one woman’s skull indicating her head was initially resting on a pillow. Tiny nails were also found at the foot of the graves, suggesting most of the people were buried wearing hobnail boots. But it is the structure of the graves that is fascinating. The majority were lined with local stone and capped and sealed with the same sort of slabs used to create roofs in the area 2,000 years ago. In one particularly unusual grave, slabs were used to create a tent-like structure above the person who was buried. A similar setup was recently discovered at the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station construction site on the Somerset coast – 25 miles (40km) north-west of Somerton – and it has echoes of grave profiles in Spain and Italy. Other finds include “grave goods” such as pottery and jewellery, while one pot that was dug up contained a chicken wing. A coin from the time of Emperor Vespasian, who ruled from AD69 to AD79, and a piece of carved bone, most likely from a knife handle, were also uncovered. Steve Membery, an archaeologist and member of the South West Heritage Trust, which has overseen the excavations, said: “This site is a significant discovery. The individuals were evidently of some status. Most graves in Roman Britain are pretty much a rectangular cut with someone laid on their back. They’ve actually built these graves. There’s been a lot more care taken over these.” Membery believes the people who have been found would have lived and worked in a nearby Roman villa. The villa has yet to be discovered but what is believed to be an outhouse and a barn associated with it have been found. Evidence has also been uncovered of an iron-age settlement predating the Roman cemetery. Membery said one of the most interesting elements of the cemetery was that it showed how local people adopted Roman burial customs. Bodies were squashed into the oldest graves but laid flat, in the Roman style, in the later ones, and grave goods were placed close to the head. DNA analysis will be carried out to try to learn more about the people who were buried at Somerton. It is thought likely they were British people who had adopted Roman customs after the invasion. But analysis of remains found at Hinkley Point found evidence people buried there had origins in east Asia. “They probably made their way to the eastern Roman empire and then their descendants came to Britain,” Membery said. The find means archaeologists in Somerset are hesitant to make assumptions about the possible origins of people whose remains are unearthed. The Somerton cemetery was found on land owned by Somerset county council during building work for a new junior and infant school. Work had to be halted but will restart later this month. Cllr Faye Purbrick, the cabinet member for education, said: “The findings are both exciting and extraordinary, providing us with valuable insight into Somerset’s early history. We will be able to understand so much more about the lives of Roman people in Somerton thanks to these discoveries.” The site’s archaeology has been gathered for further scientific analysis. A full report of the findings will be published in due course."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2020/mar/05/flybe-business-and-political-leaders-warn-of-severe-impact-on-regional-economies","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2020-03-05T16:44:31Z","webTitle":"Flybe: business and political leaders warn of severe impact on regions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/05/flybe-business-and-political-leaders-warn-of-severe-impact-on-regional-economies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2020/mar/05/flybe-business-and-political-leaders-warn-of-severe-impact-on-regional-economies","fields":{"headline":"Flybe: business and political leaders warn of severe impact on regions","bodyText":"Business figures and politicians around the UK have warned that Flybe’s collapse could lead to severe consequences for regional economies following the loss of key air transport links. Exeter-based Flybe operates nearly 40% of the country’s domestic flights and there were fears over the impact of its collapse from around the country. In the south-west, Flybe’s failure was met with alarm that there could be substantial ripple effects financially. “A huge pack of cards has just fallen over,” said Tim Jones, chairman of the South West Business Council. Jones said that if the services the airport provided were not replaced quickly – and lost jobs restored as well – the result could be losses of up to £600m a year to the regional economy. Exeter airport – where all but one of the scheduled departures on Thursday was supposed to be a Flybe service – is an important hub not just for holidaymakers but for business people who use it to hop to London and other major cities in the UK and Europe. It is also used by people flying in from other parts of the UK to work on infrastructure projects for a week at a time, such as the Hinkley Point nuclear power plant site on the Somerset coast. Jones said the airport was hugely important because major road and rail routes into and out of the south-west were unreliable. “This area can routinely be cut off from the rest of England.” A major accident on the M5 or on the A303 can lead to traffic being delayed for many hours. There are often floods on the train line near Exeter and at times of severe weather the line further south at Dawlish can be cut off. “The dependency on the airport is absolutely profound,” said Jones. “It connects us to national and international markets and it is unthinkable that we should lose it. We will be doing all we can to make sure the government steps in really quickly to fill the gap.” The Exeter MP, Ben Bradshaw, said it was a big blow to the local and regional economy. He said: “Why did the government say Flybe was vital to regional connectivity last month? [Boris] Johnson’s mantra of ‘levelling up’ our left-behind regions lies in tatters.” At the airport and at Flybe HQ, tearful staff expressed concern at their job losses. An estimated 1,500 of Flybe’s more than 2,000 workers – from cabin crew to engineers and backroom staff – live in the Exeter area. Katherine Densham – who had worked for Flybe for 13 years as cabin crew, joining the company straight out of college – heard in the early hours that the company had collapsed. She had been due to fly from Exeter to London City airport and came to the airport, in her uniform, to check what was happening. She broke down in tears and said: “I feel really sad. I’m not sure what I’m going to do now. I heard in the early hours of the morning. I thought we’d be saved. I’ve no idea what I’ll do next – try and find some work to pay the bills.” In Belfast, another key Flybe hub, the chief executive of Hospitality Ulster, an organisation representing the hospitality industry in Northern Ireland, said the collapse was “devastating”. “The regional connectivity that Flybe offered was vitally important to tourism and our wider hospitality sector here, without it there will be a huge impact on visitor access,” said Colin Neill. Scottish regional airline Loganair said it would fill a substantial number of gaps left by Flybe’s exit from Scotland yesterday, saying it would add almost 400 flights a week on 16 domestic routes including services from Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen. Loganair said that by taking on the routes, it would “help former Flybe ground handling agents and airport operators at locations such as Southampton and Exeter to preserve employment in their businesses”. The airline’s chief executive, Jonathan Hinkles, said the move is the result of “several weeks of behind-the-scenes contingency planning work”, cautioning that it will not lead to “over-expansion” and is “robust and sustainable”. Concerns over the loss of vital transport links were also raised in Birmingham, where Flybe was a key operator at the city’s airport. “This means of travel is vital for our existence,” said Gareth Jones, managing director of machinery firm HK Technologies, which is based near the airport. “The last thing we want to do is travel to Heathrow, or East Midlands or Manchester. If we have to send our engineers to Ireland they will have to travel by ferry and take their tools with them.” Being able to fly to a range of other cities is important for the region, tweeted Andy Street, mayor of the West Midlands: “The main focus is now on making sure Birmingham airport maintains its excellent connectivity … I am pleased the airport already has plans to backfill routes.” A Birmingham airport spokesperson said it had had “very positive discussions” in the past few days with other airlines interested in taking on some of Flybe’s routes from Britain’s second city."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/jul/13/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-missile-destroys-ammunition-depot-in-occupied-town-officials-to-seek-grain-export-deal","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-14T00:25:25Z","webTitle":"Ukraine rules out ceding territory to Russia as part of any ceasefire deal – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/jul/13/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-missile-destroys-ammunition-depot-in-occupied-town-officials-to-seek-grain-export-deal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/jul/13/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-missile-destroys-ammunition-depot-in-occupied-town-officials-to-seek-grain-export-deal","fields":{"headline":"Ukraine rules out ceding territory to Russia as part of any ceasefire deal – as it happened","bodyText":"Thank you for joining us for today’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. We will be pausing our live reporting overnight and returning in the morning. In the meantime, you can read our comprehensive summary of the day’s events below. A breakthrough deal to resume exporting Ukrainian grain has been announced with the establishment of a coordination and monitoring centre in Istanbul. Turkey’s defence minister Hulusi Akar said Ankara will ensure the safety of shipments in transit and the parties will jointly check grain cargoes in ports after officials from Ukraine, Russia, United Nations and Turkey met for talks in Istanbul on Wednesday. UN chief Antonio Guterres described the talks as a “critical step forward” but said more work was needed before a deal is set to be signed next week. A traffic jam of more than 130 cargo ships loaded with Ukrainian grain is waiting in the Black Sea to pass into the Danube. The ships are waiting to access exit routes through the Sulina and Bystre estuary canals to reach a series of ports and terminals in Romania from where the grain can be transported on around the world Russian and proxy forces have reportedly entered the town of Siversk in Ukraine’s Donetsk region, according to Russian media reports. State news agency Tass quoted Vitaly Kiselyov, an official from the self-appointed Luhansk People’s Republic, as saying the town could fall within a couple of days, but it was not clear what that claim was based on. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has ruled out ceding territory to Russia as part of any ceasefire deal. In a briefing, Kuleba said no peace talks were under way between Moscow and Kyiv “because of Russia’s position and its continued aggression against our country”. Russia has forcibly removed nearly 2 million people from Ukraine, including several hundred thousand children, since its invasion of the country, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said. Tens of thousands of Ukrainian are being held in filtration camps in the temporarily Russian-occupied territories, Zelenskiy said in a video address to the Asian Leadership Conference in Seoul on Wednesday. The death toll from a weekend Russian missile attack on a residential apartment block in Chasiv Yar in eastern Ukraine has risen to at least 47. According to Kyiv, the residential building was hit by Russian rockets fired from truck-borne systems late on Saturday evening. The Ukrainian emergency services initially gave a death toll of 10, but as rescue teams continued to comb through the debris that number rose. Russian forces will probably focus on taking several small Donbas towns during the coming week, including Siversk and Dolyna on the approaches to Slovyansk and Kramatorsk, according to the UK Ministry of Defence. “The urban areas of Slovyansk and Kramatorsk likely remain the principal objectives for this phase of the operation,” the British intelligence report said. North Korea has officially recognised the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic and the self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic, the pro-Russian occupied territories in the east of Ukraine. The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) becomes only the third UN member state to recognise them as legitimate authorities, after Russia and Syria. In response, Ukraine’s foreign ministry announced it has cut ties with North Korea. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, called for an immediate halt to Russian deportations of Ukrainian citizens. Blinken accused Russia of “deliberately separating Ukrainian children from their parents and abducting others from orphanages before putting them up for adoption inside Russia”. A third American national is being held captive by pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine, according to reports. Suedi Murekezi, 35, was arrested last month in Kherson, a Russian-occupied port city in southern Ukraine where he had been living for more than two years, his brother Sele Murekezi said. A Moscow court has ordered one of the last prominent opposition figures still in Russia, Ilya Yashin, to be detained for two months pending an investigation into the spreading of “fake information” about Russia’s army. If convicted, he faces up to 15 years in prison for spreading “false information” about Russian forces fighting in Ukraine. Lithuania will allow sanctioned Russian goods to transit its territory on their way to Russia’s Kaliningrad exclave, its foreign ministry said on Wednesday, reversing its policy after new European Commission guidelines. The global economic outlook that has “darkened significantly” following the consequences of the war in Ukraine, according to the head of the International Monetary Fund. Kristalina Georgieva said the global outlook remains “extremely uncertain” with an increased risk of recession. “The human tragedy of the war in Ukraine has worsened. So, too, has its economic impact … and it’s only getting worse,” she said. G20 finance ministers and central bank governors are preparing to meet in Bali this week. Russian and proxy forces have entered the town of Siversk in Ukraine’s Donetsk region, according to Russian media reports. State news agency Tass quoted Vitaly Kiselyov, an official from the self-appointed Luhansk People’s Republic, as saying the town could fall within a couple of days, but it was not clear what that claim was based on. Ukraine’s armed forces said in their evening operational update that Russia had not conducted any new assaults on the frontline that includes Siversk, but that the town had been fired upon by artillery. The Guardian has not been able to immediately verify the report. In its latest intelligence report, the UK Ministry of Defence predicted that Russian forces will likely focus on taking several small towns during the coming week, including Siversk and Dolyna on the approaches to Slovyansk and Kramatorsk. Russian energy giant Gazprom said Wednesday it could not guarantee the good functioning of the Nord Stream gas pipeline and did not know if a “critical” turbine engine would be returned from repair in Canada. Gazprom started ten days of maintenance on the Nord Stream 1 pipeline on Monday as turbines are currently undergoing maintenance at a Canadian site owned by German industrial giant Siemens. The company said in a statement, as reported by Agence France-Presse, on Wednesday: Gazprom does not have a single document to allow (German company) Siemens to take out of Canada the gas turbine engine currently being repaired there. In these circumstances, it is not possible to draw an objective conclusion about the development of the situation and ensuring the safe operation of the Portovaya station - a critical facility for the Nord Stream gas pipeline.” Over the weekend, Canada agreed to deliver to Germany turbines needed to maintain the pipeline, despite sanctions in place against Russia and appeals from Ukraine. The annual work on the gas link was scheduled long in advance, but many fear Gazprom might seize the opportunity to shut off the valves. Berlin has not provided a timetable for the return of the turbines. A government spokesman said Monday that Siemens was “planning to transport (the turbines) as soon as possible” from Canada to Germany, and then onto Russia to be installed. Lithuania will allow sanctioned Russian goods to transit its territory on their way to Russia’s Kaliningrad exclave, its foreign ministry said on Wednesday, reversing its policy after new European Commission guidelines. The new guidelines on Wednesday followed weeks of tension among Moscow, European Union member Lithuania and the European Union that tested Europe’s resolve to enforce sanctions on Russia. Kaliningrad, which is bordered by EU states and relies on railways and roads through Lithuania for most goods, has had some freight transport from mainland Russia cut off since 17 June under sanctions imposed by Brussels. The sanctions were designed to bar entry into the EU of certain Russian products, such as vodka and steel. Moscow earlier said restricting overland transit of goods from Russia to Kaliningrad amounted to an illegal blockade; Lithuania said it had no choice but to enforce rules imposed by Brussels. This decision, which removes restrictions on a certain range of products transported by rail, is a demonstration of realism and common sense,” a Russian foreign ministry spokesperson said by email to Reuters on Wednesday. “Although we still have questions about the contents of this document.” Kaliningrad Governor Anton Alikhanov wrote on Telegram the new guidelines are “only the first step needed” to solve the stand-off: “We will continue to work towards the complete removal of restrictions”. As G20 ministers and central bank governors gather in Bali this week, they face a global economic outlook that has “darkened significantly”, the head of the International Monetary Fund has said. Kristalina Georgieva hinted the IMF will downgrade its expectations for global economic growth this month, saying the outlook remains “extremely uncertain” and blaming the war in Ukraine, higher than expected inflation, and the ongoing Covid pandemic. In a statement, she said: It is going to be a tough 2022—and possibly an even tougher 2023, with increased risk of recession. The human tragedy of the war in Ukraine has worsened. So, too, has its economic impact especially through commodity price shocks that are slowing growth and exacerbating a cost-of-living crisis that affects hundreds of millions of people—and especially poor people who cannot afford to feed their families. And it’s only getting worse. G20 finance ministers and central bank governors are preparing to meet in Bali where they will discuss the global economy, including food security, and the impact of the war in Ukraine. Georgieva called for “decisive action and strong international cooperation, led by the G20”. Indonesia’s central bank governor Perry Warjiyo is cautious about the prospect of reaching an agreement over the way forward, saying: “We hope for the best, but of course prepare for the worst”. Georgieva said that inflation has “broadened beyond food and energy prices” in that has led many central banks to increase the cost of borrowing, something she said will “need to continue”. It’s 1am in Kyiv. Here’s where things stand: Turkish, Ukrainian, Russian and UN officials have established a coordination center in Istanbul to monitor grain exports, the head of Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenksiy’s office said on Wednesday. “Its task will be to carry out general monitoring and coordination of safe navigation in the Black Sea,” Andriy Yermak said. A UNHCR survey has revealed that 65 percent of Ukrainian refugees intend to stay in their host countries for the time being. The survey cited main reasons being safety concerns, family ties and employment opportunity access. At least 14 civilians have been injured after Russian missiles struck an unnamed commercial enterprise in Zaporizhizhia on July 13, the Kyiv Independent reports. Rescue workers are currently on scene where two Russian missiles severely damaged the enterprise’s facilities, local authorities said. Rare footage has emerged of Russian filtration procedure applied to Ukrainians in Russian-occupied territories, Euromaidan reports. In the video, Russian occupiers can be seen asking Ukrainians to undress and examining them for patriotic tattoos on Mariupol streets. Hungary has declared a “state of danger” on Wednesday due to the energy crisis caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Gergely Gulyas, chief of staff of Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s office announced a seven-point plan to tackle the energy crisis and listed the measures after a cabinet meeting. Russia and Ukraine will hold new talks in Turkey next week on resolving their dispute over blocked grain exports, the Turkish defence minister said Wednesday. “It was agreed that the Russian and Ukrainian delegations should meet again in Turkey next week,” Hulusi Akar said in a statement after the first talks in Istanbul between Russian and Ukrainian delegations since March. That’s it from me, Maya Yang, as I hand over the blog to my colleague in Australia, Samantha Lock, who will be bringing you the latest updates. I’ll be back tomorrow, thank you. Ukraine, the United Nations and Turkey all hailed progress at talks in Istanbul with Russia designed to resume Black Sea grain exports on Wednesday. Officials said they have established a coordination centre in Istanbul to monitor grain exports. The head of Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenksiy’s office, Andriy Yermak, said: Its task will be to carry out general monitoring and coordination of safe navigation in the Black Sea. This will ensure the export of Ukrainian grain and guarantee food security for millions of people around the world.” Turkey’s defence minister Hulusi Akar said an agreement would be signed next week, adding that Ankara will ensure the safety of shipments in transit and the parties will jointly check grain cargoes in ports. However, UN chief Antonio Guterres said more work was needed before a deal was signed. Guterres told reporters in New York: We have seen a critical step forward. We still need a lot of goodwill and commitments by all parties.” Zelenksiy addressed the news in his latest address: Today in the news there are many references to the meeting in Turkey regarding the unblocking of agricultural exports from our country through the Black Sea. We are indeed making significant efforts to restore the supply of food to the world market. And I am grateful to the United Nations and Turkey for their respective efforts.” A UNHCR survey has revealed that 65 percent of Ukrainian refugees intend to stay in their host countries for the time being. The survey cited main reasons being safety concerns, family ties and employment opportunity access. The survey also revealed that 16 percent of Ukrainian refugees plan to return to their home country. Main reasons for return include improved situation, economic reasons and access to services, and wanting to reunite with families. At least 14 civilians have been injured after Russian missiles struck an unnamed commercial enterprise in Zaporizhizhia on July 13, the Kyiv Independent reports. Rescue workers are currently on scene where two Russian missiles severely damaged the enterprise’s facilities, local authorities said.

In the video, Russian occupiers can be seen asking Ukrainians to undress and examining them for patriotic tattoos on Mariupol streets. Hungary has declared a “state of danger” on Wednesday due to the energy crisis caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Gergely Gulyas, chief of staff of Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s office, announced a seven-point plan to tackle the energy crisis and listed the measures after a cabinet meeting. “The situation is very difficult everywhere in Europe because of the war and the sanctions taken in response,” he said, adding that the new plan will come into effect in August. The government will step up domestic natural gas production from 1.5 to 2.0bn cubic metres, while seeking other sources of gas. It will also impose an export ban on energy sources such as firewood and increase domestic production of lignite coal. In addition, the government will reopen a power station at Matra and extend the operation of the Paks nuclear power plant near Budapest. People who consume more than average amounts of energy will have to pay for it at the market price rather than the heavily subsidised state rates. That could affect up to a quarter of the population, said Gulyas. Hungary currently imports 65% of its oil and 80% of its gas from Russia. Russia and Ukraine will hold new talks in Turkey next week on resolving their dispute over blocked grain exports, the Turkish defence minister said Wednesday. “It was agreed that the Russian and Ukrainian delegations should meet again in Turkey next week,” Hulusi Akar said in a statement after the first talks in Istanbul between Russian and Ukrainian delegations since March. Akar said the two countries’ defence delegations agreed on “joint controls” at ports and on ways to “ensure the safety of the transfer routes” across the Black Sea. He hinted that a final agreement on releasing approximately 20 to 25m tonnes of grain currently blocked in Ukrainian ports could be announced next week. “At this meeting, which we will hold next week, all the details will be reviewed once again and the work we have done will be signed,” Akar said. It’s 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has ruled out ceding territory to Russia as part of any ceasefire deal. In a briefing, Kuleba said no peace talks were under way between Moscow and Kyiv “because of Russia’s position and its continued aggression against our country”. Russian artillery and rockets pounded the Ukrainian town of Bakhmut overnight and into Wednesday morning. Donetsk governor, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said Russian forces were “constantly shelling the entire free territory of Donetsk region [with] Bakhmut district suffering the most”. The Russian ministry of defence has said it caused large losses to Ukrainian forces in the last 24 hours, claiming to have killed at least 425 service personnel and shot down four planes and nine unmanned drones. Yuriy Ihnat, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian air force, dismissed Russia’s assertions as propaganda. At least five people have been injured and one killed by Russian shelling in the region of Kharkiv, according to the daily update from the regional governor Oleh Synyehubov. He posted to Telegram this morning to say: “The terror of the civilian population of Kharkiv Region by the Russian occupiers continues.” At least seven people were reportedly killed by a Ukrainian missile strike on a large ammunition store in the town of Nova Kakhovka, in Russia-occupied Kherson. The claims of fatalities attributed to recently acquired US weapons were made by the Russian-installed administration in the town and could not be immediately verified. The death toll from a weekend Russian missile attack on a residential apartment block in Chasiv Yar in eastern Ukraine has risen to at least 47. According to Kyiv, the residential building was hit by Russian rockets fired from truck-borne systems late on Saturday evening. The Ukrainian emergency services initially gave a death toll of 10, but as rescue teams continued to comb through the debris that number rose. Russian forces will probably focus on taking several small Donbas towns during the coming week, including Siversk and Dolyna on the approaches to Slovyansk and Kramatorsk, according to the UK Ministry of Defence. “The urban areas of Slovyansk and Kramatorsk likely remain the principal objectives for this phase of the operation,” the British intelligence report said. Military delegations from Ukraine, Russia and Turkey met with UN officials in Istanbul to discuss a possible deal to resume safe exports of Ukraine grain. The four-way meeting comes as exports across the Black Sea continue to be blocked by Russian warships and sea mines Kyiv has laid to avert a feared amphibious assault. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, was quoted as saying that Kyiv believed a deal was “two steps away”. North Korea has officially recognised the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic and the self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic, the pro-Russian occupied territories in the east of Ukraine. The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) becomes only the third UN member state to recognise them as legitimate authorities, after Russia and Syria. In response, Ukraine’s foreign ministry announced it has cut ties with North Korea. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has called for an immediate halt to Russian deportations of Ukrainian citizens. Blinken accused Russia of “deliberately separating Ukrainian children from their parents and abducting others from orphanages before putting them up for adoption inside Russia”.

If convicted, he faces up to 15 years in prison for spreading “false information” about Russian forces fighting in Ukraine. A traffic jam of more than 130 cargo ships loaded with Ukrainian grain is waiting in the Black Sea to pass into the Danube as negotiators from Moscow, Kyiv, the UN and Turkey began talks in Istanbul on easing Ukrainian agricultural exports. The ships are waiting to access exit routes through the Sulina and Bystre estuary canals to reach a series of ports and terminals in Romania from where the grain can be transhipped to global destinations, amid mounting global concern about the Russian blockade on Ukrainian exports through the Black Sea. Maritime tracking services showed a logjam of ships waiting to pass into the Danube since a second route through the Bystre estuary was opened after the recent Russian retreat from nearby and strategic Zmiinye [Snake] Island, which had threatened shipping close to Odesa. Previously ships had only been able to pass into the Danube via the Sulina Canal, whose passage is one way, with cargo vessels having to wait weeks to pass through the canal. Although large carriers cannot pass through the Bystre estuary, limiting the amount of grain that can be exported, Ukrainian officials said that already 16 ships had transited the Bystre route in the past four days since it had reopened. Russia has forcibly removed nearly 2 million people from Ukraine, including several hundred thousand children, since its invasion of the country, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said. Tens of thousands of Ukrainian are being held in filtration camps in the temporarily Russian-occupied territories, Zelenskiy said in a video address to the Asian Leadership Conference in Seoul. In comments translated by Ukrinform, Zelenskiy said: Just imagine this number – 2 million people. That’s how many of our people have already been taken to Russia. Among those who had been forcibly removed from Ukraine and taken to Russia were “several hundred thousand children”, Zelenskiy said. He continued: No one will name the exact numbers at the moment – all these deported people are deprived of means of communication, their IDs have been taken from them, they are being intimidated and taken them to remote areas of Russia, so that it will be as difficult as possible for them to return home to their Motherland. Young women were among those being held in so-called filtration camps in occupied territories, he said: Young women disappear there. I believe you all understand what’s happening to them there. Ukraine’s foreign ministry has announced it has cut ties with the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), most commonly referred to in the west as North Korea, over its recognition of two pro-Russian occupied territories in the east of Ukraine. It comes after North Korea said it has officially recognised the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic and the self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic, becoming only the third UN member state to recognise them as legitimate authorities, after Russia and Syria. In a statement, Ukraine’s foreign ministry said: We consider this decision as an attempt by Pyongyang to undermine the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. A Moscow court has ordered one of the last prominent opposition figures still in Russia, Ilya Yashin, to be detained for two months pending an investigation into the spreading of “fake information” about Russia’s army. “Do not be afraid of these scoundrels! Russia will be free!” Yashin shouted in court after the judge ruled to keep him in prison until 12 September. Yashin, a Moscow city councillor and an ally of jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, was charged with “discrediting” the Russian army. If convicted, he faces up to 15 years in prison for spreading “false information” about Russian forces fighting in Ukraine. Navalny, who is able to post on Twitter through his lawyers and allies, demanded the immediate release of Yashin and said he had spoken the truth about what was going on in Ukraine. Days before he was first detained, Yashin, 39, had vowed to stay in Russia despite the looming threat of arrest for his outspoken criticism of President Vladimir Putin and Russia’s actions in Ukraine. Sitting smiling in the defendant’s glass box, Yashin said: This is a politically motivated case from the first to the last page. Last week, an opposition councillor was sentenced to seven years in jail by a court in Moscow for criticising Russia’s military actions in Ukraine, the first prison sentence handed out under the new laws that restrict criticism of the war. Talks between delegations from Ukraine, Russia, Turkey and UN officials in Istanbul to discuss resuming grain exports from Ukraine from the Black Sea port of Odesa have now ended. In a statement, the Turkish ministry of defence said: The four-party meeting between the military delegations of the Ministry of Defense of Turkey, the Russian Federation and Ukraine and the United Nations delegation regarding the safe shipment of grains waiting in Ukrainian ports by sea ended at the Kalender Pavilion. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, was quoted earlier today as saying that Kyiv believed a deal was “two steps away”. Kuleba said: The security concerns, linked to Russia’s position, need to be addressed. We are in the final phase and now everything depends on Russia. Other participants appeared less optimistic and Turkey’s defence ministry gave no further details of the meeting’s outcome after announcing it had ended. The EU executive has said sanctioned Russian goods can transit through the bloc’s territory to Kaliningrad by rail, but not by road. In a statement, the European Commission said: The transit of sanctioned goods by road with Russian operators is not allowed under the EU measures. No such similar prohibition exists for rail transport. The commission underlined the “importance of monitoring the two-way trade flows between Russia and Kaliningrad ... to ensure that sanctioned goods cannot enter the EU customs territory”. The statement comes after Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said earlier today that Moscow was expecting progress over a possible EU deal to allow Russia to transit some sanctioned goods to its Kaliningrad exclave via the bloc, but the problem had not been resolved. It’s 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has ruled out ceding territory to Russia as part of any ceasefire deal. In a briefing, Kuleba said no peace talks were under way between Moscow and Kyiv “because of Russia’s position and its continued aggression against our country”.

Hello everyone, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong with you today bringing you all the latest news from the war in Ukraine. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. More than 9 million people have crossed the border from Ukraine since Russia invaded the country on 24 February, according to the UN’s refugee agency. A total of 9,136,006 border crossings have been recorded since Russian troops invaded Ukraine, the agency said. The death toll from a weekend Russian missile attack on a residential apartment block in Chasiv Yar in eastern Ukraine has risen to at least 47, according to a deputy in Ukraine’s presidential office, Kyrylo Tymoshenko. Saturday’s strike destroyed the five-storey building and damaged several others in the Donetsk region city. The body of one more victim was recovered from the rubble of the building on Wednesday morning, Tymoshenko wrote on Telegram. Among the 47 people killed in Saturday’s attack included a child, he said. The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), most commonly referred to in the west as North Korea, has officially recognised the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic and the self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic, the pro-Russian occupied territories in the east of Ukraine. The DPRK becomes only the third UN member state to recognise them as legitimate authorities, after Russia and Syria. US secretary of state Antony Blinken has called for an immediate halt to Russian deportations of Ukrainian citizens, accusing Russia of “deliberately separating Ukrainian children from their parents and abducting others from orphanages before putting them up for adoption inside Russia”. Reuters report that in a statement, Blinken said: “The unlawful transfer and deportation of protected persons is a grave breach of the fourth Geneva convention on the protection of civilians and is a war crime.” Blinken tweeted: Russia must immediately halt its systematic “filtration” operations in Ukraine, which have reportedly disappeared, detained, or forcibly deported from their homes approximately up to 1.6 million innocent Ukrainians, including 260,000 children. A visit for journalists into the occupied cities of Lysychansk and Sievierodonetsk organised by Russian military has produced striking images of a city that was the focus of Russian military efforts for a considerable time earlier in the war. Ukraine has denied claims by Russian forces that it had shot down four Ukrainian military jets in Ukraine. Russia’s defence ministry said earlier that its forces had destroyed an Su-25 and Su-24 – both Soviet-era jets used by the Ukrainian air force – over the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine along with another Su-25 and a Mig-29, another Soviet-designed fighter aircraft, in the Mykolaiv region of southern Ukraine. Reuters has cited Yuriy Ihnat, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian Air Force, as dismissing Russia’s assertions as propaganda. A third American national is being held captive by pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine, according to his friends and family and a private volunteer group specialising in rescuing US citizens. Suedi Murekezi, 35, was arrested last month in Kherson, a Russian-occupied port city in southern Ukraine where he had been living for more than two years, his brother Sele Murekezi said. “We are all extremely worried for his wellbeing. He is obviously in danger,” he said. After having not heard from him for a month, Sele received a call from his brother in the early hours of 7 July, in which he said he was imprisoned in Donetsk, the biggest city in the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic backed by Russia. Murekezi also said he was in the same jail as Alexander Drueke and Andy Tai Ngoc Huynh, two American fighters captured by Russia last month. Unlike Drueke and Huynh, Murekezi’s friends and family say he did not participate in any fighting in Ukraine and moved to the country about four years ago, settling in Kherson in 2020. On the phone, Murekezi told his brother he had been falsely accused of participation in pro-Ukrainian protests, a charge that his brother and two close friends in Kherson denied. “They are using him as a pawn for their own propaganda purposes,” said Sele Murekezi. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has ruled out ceding territory to Russia as part of any ceasefire deal and said no peace talks were under way between Moscow and Kyiv. In a briefing, Kuleba said: The objective of Ukraine in this war … is to liberate our territories, restore our territorial integrity, and full sovereignty in the east and south of Ukraine. This is the end point of our negotiating position. He added: Currently there are no (peace) talks between Russia and Ukraine because of Russia’s position and its continued aggression against our country. In an interview published before talks in Istanbul involving representatives from Ukraine, Russia, Turkey and the UN, the Ukrainian FM said a deal to resume grain exports blocked by Russia appeared very close. Most of the refugees from Ukraine, mainly women and children, hope to leave their host countries and return home eventually, a UN study shows. Around two-thirds of refugees from Ukraine expect to stay in their host countries until the security situation improves after Russia’s invasion, according to a survey by the UN’s refugee agency UNHCR. The study, conducted between mid-May and mid-June, surveyed around 4,900 people from Ukraine now living in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Moldova, Poland, Romania and Slovakia. More than 5.6 million refugees are now recorded across Europe, with 8.8 million people crossing out of Ukraine and nearly 3.3 million crossing back in since the Russian invasion. Of those seeking to return, 40% planned to do so in the next month, the UNHCR said. It added: They are anxious to reunite with friends and family and worry about those who stayed behind. Most want to wait until hostilities have subsided. The Kremlin said it was expecting progress over a possible EU deal to allow Russia to transit some sanctioned goods to Kaliningrad, but that the problem had not been resolved. Speaking to reporters today, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said: There is no finalisation of this situation yet. We expect some progress, but we cannot say that the problem has been removed. On Monday, Lithuania expanded restrictions on trade through its territory to Russia’s Kaliningrad exclave, with goods sanctioned including concrete, wood, alcohol and alcohol-based industrial chemicals. The governor of Kaliningrad, Anton Alikhanov, has proposed a total ban on the movement of goods between the three Baltic states and Russia, in response to what authorities in the exclave have called a “blockade”. Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, has warned Lithuania and the EU it could adopt “harsh measures” against them if the transit of goods to and from Kaliningrad did not resume. Russian artillery and rockets pounded the Ukrainian town of Bakhmut overnight and into Wednesday morning in what some sources speculated was a reprisal for a Ukrainian attack using a US-supplied Himars missile system on a Russian air defence site in Luhansk. Others suggested the shelling could signal a renewed Russian offensive aimed at cities in Donetsk province. In one video posted on social video around midnight from outside Bakhmut, constant rocket strikes can be seen illuminating the night sky and a woman’s voice is heard saying: “My mother is there! Fuck, fuck, fucking hell.” A man named Nikolai says: “Everything is on fire. They hit the power lines.” As the woman speaks again, apparently wanting to borrow a phone to call her mother, the man interjects. “Your mum is fucked. It’s Stupky [that’s getting hit],” he says, referring to a northern area of Bakhmut. Describing the situation on his Telegram channel, the Donetsk governor, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said Russian forces were “constantly shelling the entire free territory of Donetsk region [with] Bakhmut district suffering the most”. According to Kyrylenko, one person died and five more were injured in the town, which has largely been evacuated. Read the full story by Peter Beaumont here. Two settlements in Ukraine’s Luhansk region remain under Ukrainian control, according to the Ukrainian governor of the region, Serhai Haidai. He has posted to Telegram to say: “The armed forces of Ukraine maintain defence on the outskirts of Luhansk region – two settlements of the region are under the control of the government.” He accuses Russia of transporting grain away from Ukraine in trucks, and also says that Russian mobile telephone networks are working in the region. He also claims that “the Russian army destroyed warehouses with food products, shops and markets in large cities”, saying that the settlements continue to be “on the verge of a humanitarian disaster”. He says that the gas supply system in Lysychansk and in Rubizhne has been destroyed. The claims have not been independently verified. The death toll from a weekend Russian missile attack on a residential apartment block in Chasiv Yar, eastern Ukraine, rose to at least 45 on Tuesday. Saturday’s strike destroyed the five-storey building and damaged several others in the Donetsk region city. Nine people had been pulled out alive as the rescue operation continued. At least seven people were reportedly killed by a Ukrainian missile strike on a large ammunition store in the town of Nova Kakhovka, in Russia-occupied Kherson, in a strike attributed to recently acquired US weapons. The explosion hit a warehouse close to a key railway line and a dam on the Dnieper river. Footage on social media showed a large explosion lighting up the night, burning ammunition and billowing smoke. Russia has reportedly heavily shelled the eastern town of Bakhmut in the Donetsk region overnight in response to the Nova Kakhovka strike. Kyiv Independent reporter Illia Ponomarenko tweeted alongside footage purportedly of the assault: “Meanwhile, Russia responds by sweeping Bakhmut off the earth with artillery in the night.” The Russian ministry of defence has said that it caused large losses to Ukrainian forces in the last 24 hours, claiming to have killed at least 425 service personnel and shot down three planes and nine unmanned drones. At least five people have been injured and one killed by Russian shelling in the region of Kharkiv, according to the daily update from regional governor Oleh Synyehubov. He has posted to Telegram this morning to say: “The terror of the civilian population of Kharkiv Region by the Russian occupiers continues.” Military delegations from Ukraine, Russia and Turkey will meet UN officials in Istanbul to discuss a possible deal to resume safe exports of Ukraine grain from the major Black Sea port of Odesa as a global food crisis worsens. Grain shipments via the River Danube have increased with the reopening of the Bystre canal. The number of foreign ships reaching Ukraine ports to help with grain exports has doubled to 16 within the last 24 hours, according to Ukraine’s deputy infrastructure minister Yuriy Vaskov. Ukraine has restored long-decommissioned ports to facilitate the exportation of grain due to Russia’s Black Sea blockade, and expects to increase monthly exports to 500,000 tonnes. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, says Russia “doesn’t have the courage” to admit defeat. In a nationally televised address, Zelenskiy also mocked the Russian military’s apparent reliance on ageing weapons and Soviet-era tactics, and insisted the unity of his country’s citizenry, combined with the strength of Ukraine’s armed forces, meant the outcome of the war was “certain”. Russian forces will probably focus on taking several small Donbas towns during the coming week, including Siversk and Dolyna on the approaches to Slovyansk and Kramatorsk, according to the UK Ministry of Defence. “The urban areas of Slovyansk and Kramatorsk likely remain the principal objectives for this phase of the operation,” the British intelligence report said. That is it, from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later. Léonie Chao-Fong will be with you next to continue our live coverage of Russia’s war in Ukraine. Russian’s ministry of defence has again said that it caused large losses to Ukrainian forces in the last 24 hours, claiming to have killed at least 425 service personnel and shot down three planes and nine unmanned drones. In particular, Russian forces claim to have killed 350 Ukrainian service personnel in high-precision attacks on a shipyard in Mikolaiv. They also claim to have killed or captured “a sabotage and reconnaissance group” in the area of Dementievka in the Kharkiv region. The self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) has issued its regular daily operation briefing. In it, the DPR claims that along with the armed forces of Russia and of the similarly self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic, they have “liberated” 242 settlements in eastern Ukraine. This number has been static for a few days now. It claims that the Ukrainian army shelled 12 settlements under DPR occupation, causing three deaths and injuries to 12 civilians. It also claims that 38 “housing constructions” and eight civil infrastructure facilities were damaged. The claims have not been independently verified. Russia’s RIA Novosti news agency is reporting that the Russian delegation has arrived in Turkey for talks over the export of grain from Ukraine. They cite a diplomatic source. The source told them there was “high confidence” of progress in today’s talks, at which military delegations from Turkey, Russia and Ukraine will meet with a UN delegation at a secret location. In western Ukraine it has been quiet overnight, with Lviv’s regional governor Maksym Kozytskyi reporting that there was one air raid warning but no attack materialised. He says that 240 people arrived in Lviv via evacuation trains from the east yesterday. One person has been killed and at least five injured by Russian shelling in the region of Kharkiv, according to the daily update from regional governor Oleh Synyehubov. He has posted to Telegram this morning to say: “The terror of the civilian population of Kharkiv Region by the Russian occupiers continues.” Synyehubov states that the five injured people “are in the hospital and receiving all the necessary help, their condition is stable, there is no threat to life”. He claims that overnight a missile attack on the region was thwarted by Ukrainian forces. He also says that “active hostilities continue on the territory of the region”, and that a 55-year-old was killed. The claims have not been independently verified. In recent weeks, the military focus in eastern Ukraine had been pro-Russian forces attempting to take the cities of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk. This morning, we have been sent pictures from inside the cities now that they are occupied by the self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic, an authority recognised only by Russia and Syria as legitimate. The photographs were taken on a trip for journalists organised by the Russian ministry of defence. This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog in London. You can contact me at martin.belam@theguardian.com Russian forces are likely to focus on taking several small Donbas towns during the coming week, including Siversk and Dolyna on the approaches to Slovyansk and Kramatorsk, according to the UK Ministry of Defence. The urban areas of Slovyansk and Kramatorsk likely remain the principal objectives for this phase of the operation, the British intelligence report said. Russia also continues to seek to undermine the legitimacy of the Ukrainian state and consolidate its own governance and administrative control over occupied parts of Ukraine, according to the MoD. Recently this has included an initiative to twin Russian and Ukrainian cities and regions to develop post-conflict administrations and a decree to make it easier for Ukrainians to obtain Russian citizenship.” Germany has published a complete list of its military aid for Ukraine after increasing its support package to €2bn. The list of military aid includes seven Panzerhaubitzen 2000 self-propelled howitzers, cars, a field hospital, spare parts for the MiG-29, armoured vehicles, tanks, air defence systems and MLRS. Also included are 14,900 anti-tank mines, 500 stinger anti-aircraft missiles and 21.8m rounds of handgun ammunition. Russia and Ukraine are set to hold their first talks with UN and Turkish officials aimed at breaking a months-long impasse over grain exports. The four-way meeting in Istanbul comes as exports across the Black Sea continue to be blocked by Russian warships and sea mines Kyiv has laid to avert a feared amphibious assault. The negotiations are being complicated by growing suspicions that Russia is trying to export grain it has stolen from Ukrainian farmers in regions under its control. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, earlier played down expectations from the Istanbul talks. We are working hard indeed, but there is still a way to go,” the UN chief told reporters. The meeting will involve military delegations from the three countries and diplomats from the UN. The Turkish defence minister Hulusi Akar said they would focus “on the safe shipment to international markets of grain waiting in Ukrainian ports”. Nato member Turkey has been using its good relations with both the Kremlin and the western-backed leaders in Kyiv to try to broker an agreement on a safe way to deliver the grain. Ukraine estimates that up to 25m tonnes of grain are blocked in its ports. Turkey says it has 20 merchant ships waiting in the region that could be quickly loaded and sent to world markets. A plan by the UN proposes the ships follow safe “corridors” that run between the known location of mines. The Ukrainian World Congress is taking legal action against Canada for breaking sanctions and transferring repaired turbines to Germany for the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline. According to a statement released on Tuesday, the organisation said: Over the past several days, the Ukrainian World Congress together with the Ukrainian Canadian Congress has been pleading with the Government of Canada to revoke the waiver provided to Siemens Canada which allows the return of repaired Nord Stream 1 turbines to Germany. We have also called upon the Government to ensure that all sanctions that have been imposed by Canada on Russia remain in place and are significantly enhanced. To date, our efforts have been unsuccessful, and we have had no choice but to take legal action.” The organisation filed a notice of application for judicial review, sating that the decision to grant the permit was not reasonable, transparent, or properly authorised. We cannot supply a terrorist state with the tools it needs to finance the killing of tens of thousands of innocent people,” Paul Grod, President and of the UWC, said. This is not just about a turbine or possible many turbines to support Russia’s energy exports, this is about continuously succumbing to Russia’s blackmail.” At least seven people were reportedly killed by a Ukrainian missile strike on a large ammunition store in the town of Nova Kakhovka, in Russia-occupied Kherson, in a strike attributed to recently acquired US weapons. The claims of fatalities were made by the Russian-installed administration in the town and could not be immediately verified, though footage on social media showed a large explosion lighting up the night, burning ammunition and towering smoke. The explosion hit a warehouse close to a key railway line and a dam on the Dnipro River. Imaging from Nasa’s Firms global fire tracking system showed a number of secondary blazes in buildings around the initial blast site. Kyiv said it had launched artillery barrages that a destroyed a Russian arms depot, hitting artillery, armoured vehicles “and a warehouse with ammunition”, and in addition carried out a “special operation” to free military captives in the Moscow-controlled region. Russian-backed authorities accused Ukraine of damaging civilian infrastructure. Pro-Russia officials and some Ukrainian commentators were quick to suggest that the explosion was the result of a strike by Ukraine’s newly supplied US Himars missile system. A number of recent strikes on ammunition warehouses and Russian command centres have been attributed to Himars. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s rolling live coverage of Russia’s war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I will be bringing you all the latest developments for the next short while. It is approaching 8am in Kyiv and here is where things currently stand: The death toll from a weekend Russian missile attack on a residential apartment block in Chasiv Yar, eastern Ukraine, rose to at least 45 on Tuesday. Saturday’s strike destroyed the five-storey building and damaged several others in the Donetsk region city. Nine people had been pulled out alive as the rescue operation continued.

Ukraine has restored long-decommissioned ports to facilitate the exportation of grain due to Russia’s Black Sea blockade, and expects to increase monthly exports to 500,000 tonnes. The US treasury announced on Tuesday it was sending an additional $1.7bn (£1.4bn) in economic aid to Ukraine to fund “essential services”. European foreign ministers late on Monday approved €1bn (£850m) in aid, the first instalment of a €9bn rescue package agreed in May. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, is set to visit Tehran next week to hold talks with the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. The meeting comes as the US has accused Iran of preparing to supply Russia with hundreds of weapons-capable drones for use in Ukraine. Military delegations from Ukraine, Russia and Turkey will meet UN officials in Istanbul on Wednesday to discuss a possible deal to resume safe exports of Ukraine grain from the major Black Sea port of Odesa as a global food crisis worsens. The UN human rights office (OHCHR) said on Tuesday that more than 5,000 civilians have been killed in Ukraine since Russia invaded on 24 February, adding that the real toll was probably much higher. The European Union has so far frozen €13.8bn (£11.7bn) worth of assets held by Russian oligarchs, other individuals and entities sanctioned for Moscow’s war against Ukraine, the EU’s top justice official said on Tuesday. Russia has claimed to have killed a significant number of foreign mercenaries fighting in Ukraine in the last three weeks, including 23 from Britain. Russia has launched a criminal case against one of the last opposition figures remaining in the country, for allegedly spreading false information about the Russian army, his lawyer said on Tuesday. Ilya Yashin, 39, a Moscow city councillor, was sentenced to 15 days in jail last month for disobeying police. He had been set to be released in the early hours of Wednesday. The appeals over the death sentences of captured Aiden Aslin, Shaun Pinner and Saaudun Brahim will be dealt with within a month, an official from the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic said. The UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, has said she “utterly condemns” the sentencing, stating: “They are prisoners of war. This is a sham judgment with absolutely no legitimacy.” Brazil is looking to buy as much diesel as it can from Russia and the deals closed “as recently as yesterday”, the Brazilian foreign minister Carlos Franca said on Tuesday, without giving further details."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/nov/22/new-nuclear-power-cannot-rival-windfarms-price-energy-boss-innogy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-22T15:37:07Z","webTitle":"New nuclear power cannot rival windfarms on price, energy boss says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/22/new-nuclear-power-cannot-rival-windfarms-price-energy-boss-innogy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/nov/22/new-nuclear-power-cannot-rival-windfarms-price-energy-boss-innogy","fields":{"headline":"New nuclear power cannot rival windfarms on price, energy boss says","bodyText":"New nuclear power stations in the UK can no longer compete with windfarms on price, according to the boss of a German energy company’s green power arm. Hans Bunting, the chief operating officer of renewables at Innogy SE, part of the company that owns the UK energy supplier npower, said offshore windfarms had become mainstream and were destined to become even cheaper because of new, bigger turbines. Asked whether nuclear groups that want to build new reactors in the UK could compete with windfarms on cost, even when their intermittency was taken into account, Bunting replied: “Obviously they can’t.” His comments came after MPs criticised the £30bn cost to consumers for EDF Energy’s Hinkley Point C nuclear power station, and said ministers should revisit the case for new nuclear before proceeding with more projects. Innogy recently secured a subsidy of £74.75 per megawatt hour of power to build a windfarm off the Lincolnshire coast, which is £17.75 cheaper than Hinkley and should be completed about three years earlier. “What we see now [with prices] is with today’s technology. It’s not about tomorrow’s technology, which is about [to come in] 2025, 2027, when Hinkley will most likely come to the grid ... and then it [windfarms] will be even cheaper.” While the company is planning to use the most powerful turbines in the world today for the Lincolnshire windfarm, Bunting said even bigger ones in development would drive costs down further. “A few years ago everyone thought 10MW [turbines] was the maximum, now we’re talking about 15[MW]. It seems the sky is the limit,” he said. “[It] means less turbines for the same capacity, less steel in the ground, less cables, even bigger rotors catching more wind, so it will become cheaper.” However, EDF argued that nuclear was also on a path to lower costs. “Early offshore wind projects started at around £150 per MW/h and developers have shown they can offer lower prices by repeating projects with an established supply chain – the same is true for nuclear,” an EDF spokesman said. “EDF Energy’s follow-on nuclear projects at Sizewell and Bradwell will remain competitive with other low-carbon options and we are confident they can be developed at a significantly lower price than Hinkley Point C.” In an interview with the Guardian, Bunting said Innogy was strongly committed to the UK despite its subsidiary npower merging with the big-six supplier SSE. A third of the group’s renewables staff are based in the UK. “The npower and SSE merger does not for us mean we are going to leave the UK. No way. We’re going to stay here, and grow here,” he said. He argued the new supplier would be good for billpayers, contrary to consumer groups’ fears. “There is an industrial logic in it. I think at the end of the day it will help competition because then you have two large players on the market, and they will be more efficient.” Bunting said he would like to build onshore windfarms in the UK too, if the government rethought its ban on subsidies for them. He said the political argument against them – public opposition in Tory shires – no longer stood because potential windfarms in Scotland and Wales were more likely to win subsidies. “England shouldn’t worry because England doesn’t have such good wind conditions … in an auction [for subsidies] the English sites would anyway struggle to qualify against Welsh and Scottish sites.” Innogy would also take a close interest in building large solar power plants, if ministers reopened support for them, he added. Bunting rejected the idea that the subsidy costs of paying for clean power should be shifted off energy bills and into general taxation, as British Gas’s boss has argued for. Such a change would make the cost of clean power less transparent and deter households and businesses from taking steps to save energy, he said. “If part of the energy [costs] is tax-financed it will become completely intransparent,” he said. A spokesman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: “We need a diverse energy mix to ensure that demand for energy can always be met, and both nuclear and renewables will play an important role in this for many years to come.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2021/jan/19/the-capitol-riot-was-our-chernobyl-james-comey-on-trump-the-pee-tape-and-clintons-emails","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2021-01-19T06:00:48Z","webTitle":"‘The Capitol riot was our Chernobyl’: James Comey on Trump, the ‘pee tape’ and Clinton’s emails","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/19/the-capitol-riot-was-our-chernobyl-james-comey-on-trump-the-pee-tape-and-clintons-emails","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2021/jan/19/the-capitol-riot-was-our-chernobyl-james-comey-on-trump-the-pee-tape-and-clintons-emails","fields":{"headline":"‘The Capitol riot was our Chernobyl’: James Comey on Trump, the ‘pee tape’ and Clinton’s emails","bodyText":"As an investigator turned author, James Comey has developed a forensic eye for detail. The colour of the curtains in the Oval Office. The length of Donald Trump’s tie. Something about the US president that the camera often misses. “Donald Trump conveys a menace, a meanness in private that is not evident in most public views of him,” says Comey, a former director of the FBI, from his home in McLean, Virginia, a suburb of Washington DC. That menace came flooding out to engulf the US on 6 January when a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol in Washington. Five people, including a police officer, were killed in the mayhem. Comey, whose unorthodox interventions in the 2016 election are blamed by many liberals for putting Trump in the White House, watched in horror. “I was sickened to watch an attack on the literal and symbolic heart of our democracy, and, as a law enforcement person, I was angered. I am mystified and angry that Capitol Hill wasn’t defended. It’s a hill! If you wanted to defend it, you could defend it, and for some reason it was not defended. I think that’s a 9/11-size failure and we’re going to need a 9/11-type commission to understand it so that we don’t repeat it.” If he were still at work in the FBI’s brutalist building on Pennsylvania Avenue, Comey would be at the heart of the hunt for the domestic terrorists. He misses the job. Aged 60, a father of five and grandfather of one, he has spent the pandemic learning yoga, training to become a foster parent again and preparing for a teaching job at Columbia University in New York. Comey has also written another memoir, Saving Justice: Truth, Transparency and Trust, a slender sequel to his 2018 bestseller, A Higher Loyalty. It includes anecdotes from his law enforcement career, tangling with the New York mafia and others, and quotations from William Shakespeare and Trump (who reported to Comey that “Putin told me: ‘We have some of the most beautiful hookers in the world’”). It acknowledges the flawed history of his beloved FBI while defending the nobility of its purpose; he calls for it to strip the name of the former director J Edgar Hoover from its headquarters and rename it in honour of the civil rights hero John Lewis. But there is no escaping the 2016 election and the explosive investigation of Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server, at her home in New York, while she was secretary of state. “I didn’t want to put it in the book and I ended up having to because my editors convinced me,” he says. “How do you talk about transparency and all these things without at least touching it?” Driven by transparency, Comey broke protocol during the campaign by publicly opining that, although she would not be prosecuted, Clinton had been “extremely careless” in her handling of classified information. Then, just 11 days before the election, he notified Congress that the FBI was reviewing more Clinton emails. Comey is sure the news would have leaked anyway. Clinton blames him for her shock defeat; he maintains that an FBI director’s decisions cannot be guided by their preference for president. “I’m sure that strikes people as stubborn and righteous and all kinds of stuff, but I don’t think so. Between bad and terrible, we chose bad in a way that we had to.” (The “terrible” option would have been to stay silent, which would have seemed like a cover-up, especially considering the justice department was already compromised as a result of an impromptu meeting between Bill Clinton and the attorney general.) But, looking back, was he truthful and transparent to a fault? Did Trump’s baseless rants about bias in the FBI and the deep state prompt Comey to overcorrect in a way that he would not have done if Clinton’s opponent had been a conventional candidate such as Jeb Bush? “Maybe. But I’m not sure what you do about that,” he says. “It is totally legitimate to think about what the American people will think about this decision or that decision.” Last year, A Higher Loyalty was turned into a TV drama, The Comey Rule, with Jeff Daniels and Brendan Gleeson cast supremely as Comey and Trump respectively. Among the most wrenching scenes were those in which Comey faced his wife, Patrice (Jennifer Ehle), before, during and after decisions that could tilt the election away from the woman who would be the first female president and towards a man who boasted about grabbing women by the genitals. “She knew that I was in agony about the whole thing and I couldn’t talk to her about a lot of it,” he says. “I would tend to tell her things just before they went public so she would be prepared it was going to be on the news. “Her strongest reaction was in October, first: ‘Why does it have to be you? You’re going to get slaughtered for this. Oh my God, I wish it weren’t you.’ Then, second: ‘It’s too close, it’s too close to the election.’ That was a worry both about me and that I might do something to help Donald Trump. She really wanted a woman to be elected president.” The mood in the Comey household was “sombre” on the morning after Trump’s victory, but, after Comey explained his actions, his wife and daughters understood, he says. Liberal Twitter, however, has been less forgiving. When he posted a photo last year showing him wearing a T-shirt that said “Elect more women”, the former Clinton spokesperson Nick Merrill tweeted: “A lot of us tried. You fucked it up. But the tee shirt definitely makes up for it.” Tom D’Angora, a producer, director and activist, added: “Every horrifying thing Trump has done to this world started with you Comey! YOU have blood on your hands.” He has grown a thick skin. “I’ve learned to push that out. I can’t open that window, because you get overwhelmed with bile, so I don’t ever read comments on Twitter, but I have to open it enough in case there’s something thoughtful that shows me I missed something. What am I going to do? It doesn’t change my life. I’m not a public person and I don’t want to run for office. I’ve never been to a Washington DC party. It doesn’t affect me.” Comey and Clinton have never met. If they did, what would he say? “I think I would tell her that I’m sorry for her pain. I remember reading that she said I shivved [stabbed] her. I’m sick of talking about it, but if she wanted to, I would try to have her understand why we made the decisions we made.” In fact, Comey was overseeing not one but two investigations – the other was into mysterious contacts between Trump’s campaign and Russia. This included a dossier compiled by Christopher Steele, a former MI6 officer, that contained the salacious – and unverified – allegation that the Russian government has a video of Trump watching sex workers urinate on each other in a Moscow hotel room in 2013. “It came to us in late September. We had information since the summer with which it was consistent and I didn’t know what to make of it, but, because it was from a source who had a track record with the FBI, our team dove into it to see if they could replicate it. I still don’t know. I actually think the Senate intelligence committee report, coupled with [former Trump lawyer] Michael Cohen’s account in his book, probably makes the ‘pee tape’ stuff more likely than it was when I was fired.” Eventually, Comey had to inform Trump of the allegations, which was “nerve-racking” and “almost an out-of-body experience”. He went on to endure several excruciating months as FBI director, witnessing up close the 45th president’s corrosive disregard for institutions, the intelligence community and the rule of law. One night, Comey faced a test of his loyalty to Trump in the form of a private White House dinner of salad, shrimp scampi, chicken parmesan with pasta and vanilla ice-cream. “So, I’m thinking, sitting at the table, I have to protect the FBI, I have to protect myself, I have to avoid a war with the president of the United States and I’ve got to remember every word he says, because he may commit a crime in my presence. You’re trying to do all four of those things and eat and he never stops talking, so it’s one of those sweat-through-your-suit moments – not that it’s warm in the room. “There’s so many things going on in your head at the same time that it’s exhausting. The 90 minutes or so just flew by and then I’m out of there trying to remember what he said so I could write it down right away.” Such encounters gave Comey – who was fired in May 2017 – cause to reflect on why so many collaborators, enablers and enforcers have bowed to Trump’s will and embraced his alternative reality, defending the indefensible and proclaiming that two plus two equals five if the president has decreed it so. “He rarely stops talking in a way that not only is filled with constant lying, but draws those to whom he’s speaking into an involuntary circle of assent. He has this way of lying and saying: ‘Everybody agrees and of course we all agree,’ and a wave of lies hits you. “But it’s more complicated than that, because the person speaking is in some sense an object of reverence in the American civic religion: he’s sitting in the Oval Office and he’s the president of the United States, so you want to believe him and respect him. “I think it’s something about that combination that makes him uniquely able to bend people – and he has bent lot of people. It’s a really hard thing to resist. I bent in small ways that I convinced myself were tactical. I gave silence in response to a request for loyalty and I said: ‘I’ll be honest,’ and then when I got ‘honest loyalty’ I agreed to that to get out of that conversation.” Trump tends to attract people who lack a solid moral framework, Comey says. “They tell themselves stories like: ‘I’ve got to deal with this to protect the country; because I’m so important to the nation, I’ll make these compromises.’ And then he’s eaten your soul, it’s too late, and then you’re the attorney general of the United States marching across Lafayette Square thick with choking pepper smoke after protesters have been cleared so the man can hold the Bible up. That’s where you end up.” The constant appeasement of Trump as he crossed every line and trashed every norm reaped its whirlwind on 6 January with the mob attack on the US Capitol. Comey offers an arresting metaphor: the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in the former Soviet Union. The US has always had a “radioactive stew” of violence, he suggests, but in recent decades it has been largely kept inside a containment building (the law) and tamed by control rods (cultural expectations, such as use of the N-word becoming taboo). “What Donald Trump has done for the last five years is attack the building from the outside to weaken its foundation,” says Comey. “He’s withdrawn the control rods, and that’s a recipe for a nuclear disaster, a radioactive release. That’s what you saw on Capitol Hill, our own Chernobyl, when the ugly radioactive violence and racism of America explodes in public view.” Comey was a Republican for most of his life, but now describes himself as an independent. He acknowledges that the party’s decay started well before Trump, with partisan bomb throwers such as Newt Gingrich and Sarah Palin. But Trump is the first president to have been impeached twice, this time for inciting an insurrection against the US government. “The Republican party needs to be burned down or changed,” Comey says. “Something is shifting and I’m hoping it’s the fault breaking apart, a break between the Trumpists and those people who want to try and build a responsible conservative party, because everybody should know that we need one. Who would want to be part of an organisation that at its core is built on lies and racism and know-nothingism? It’s just not a healthy political organisation.” The purge could be accelerated if Trump were to face criminal prosecution after he left office. Comey believes that a case at state level, pursuing allegations of bank and insurance fraud by Trump’s businesses in New York, would be a less divisive way to bring him to justice than a blockbuster trial in federal courts. “At the end of the day, I still come down in the place that the best interests of the country would not be served by giving him that Donald Trump daily drama in our nation’s capital for three years as part of the United States versus Trump. That would give him the oxygen and the attention that he so craves and make it so much harder for a new president to heal the country both spiritually and physically, and to get some people out of the fog of lies that they’re trapped in. “I just think, on balance, the country is better served by impeaching him, convicting him in the Senate and letting local prosecutors in New York pursue him for the fraudster he was before he took office. That mixture accommodates the important public interest of the rule of law being asserted, but doesn’t do it in a way that makes it impossible for a new president to move the country on.” On Wednesday afternoon, Comey’s longtime nemesis will be exiting the White House in disgrace and defeat. It follows an election in which people voted in record numbers despite the pandemic, officials (including Republicans) ensured a fair count, courts (including Trump-appointed judges) threw out preposterous lawsuits and, hours after the mob’s failed putsch, Congress voted to certify Joe Biden’s victory. US democracy had a near-death experience, but survived. “I’m deeply optimistic,” Comey says. “America is a wonderful, complicated, screwed-up country, but it’s always getting better. It usually gets worse before it gets better, but the better succeeds, so we make progress. I am optimistic this will be the inflection point that we so desperately needed. I wish it weren’t so, but this, I think, is going to awaken Americans to the things that matter.” Saving Justice: Truth, Transparency and Trust by James Comey is published by Macmillan (£20).

The decision by the Republican-controlled Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) was unexpected and comes amid repeated promises by Trump to rejuvenate coal as the nation’s top power source. The industry has been besieged by multiple bankruptcies and a steady loss of market share as natural gas and renewable energy have flourished. The energy secretary, Rick Perry, last year proposed fresh government support for coal-fired and nuclear power plants in an effort to slow the rate at which these units are being phased out, stating the output is needed to avoid power outages “in times of supply stress such as recent natural disasters”. The plan would provide a lifeline to many ageing coal and nuclear plants that would otherwise go out of business, primarily due to the abundance of cheap natural gas and the plummeting cost of renewables. The Department of Energy has noted that 531 coal-generating units were retired between 2002 and 2016, while eight nuclear reactors have announced retirement plans in the past year. Donald Trump has vowed to arrest this decline and end the “war” on mining communities by repealing various environmental regulations put in place during the Obama administration. But non-partisan expert analysis published last month calculated that the plan would cost US taxpayers about $10.6bn a year. And the money would be used to prop up some of the oldest and dirtiest power plants in the country, according to the joint report by research groups Climate Policy Initiative and Energy Innovation. And in rejecting the proposal on Monday afternoon, the FERC declared that despite claims by the administration to the contrary, there is no evidence that any past or planned retirements of coal-fired power plants pose a threat to reliability of the nation’s electricity grid. The administration’s plan was opposed by an unusual coalition of business and environmental groups that frequently disagree with each other. Critics said the plan would distort energy markets and raise prices for customers, especially in the north-eastern and midwestern US. One called it “ludicrous” and perverse. Perry thanked the panel on Monday for addressing his proposal, which he said had initiated a national debate on the resiliency of the nation’s electricity system. The government has not released its own calculation of the cost of the proposal. “What is not debatable is that a diverse fuel supply, especially with onsite fuel capability, plays an essential role in providing Americans with reliable, resilient and affordable electricity, particularly in times of weather-related stress like we are seeing now,” Perry said. Perry was referring to his plan to compensate power plant owners that maintain a 90-day fuel supply protected against severe weather and other disruptions, a feature shared by coal and nuclear power but less apparent with renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power. Energy providers outside of coal and nuclear have warned about interference in the free market and manufacturers with high energy needs said higher prices could be passed on to consumers. Tech giant Apple weighed in on Monday against the proposal, saying it would inhibit innovation and competition and interfere with plans to increase use of “clean energy” such as wind and solar power. In its decision, the five-member energy panel essentially agreed with critics who said there was no evidence of a threat to the grid’s day-to-day reliability that would justify the emergency action Perry was seeking. An energy department report last year called reliability “adequate”, citing significant additions to the grid from natural gas, wind and solar. The FERC said in its decision that it is launching a new process to evaluate the resilience of the nation’s electric grid."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2019/jun/07/chernobyl-hbo-russian-tv-remake","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2019-06-07T11:24:26Z","webTitle":"Russian TV to air its own patriotic retelling of Chernobyl story","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/07/chernobyl-hbo-russian-tv-remake","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2019/jun/07/chernobyl-hbo-russian-tv-remake","fields":{"headline":"Russian TV to air its own patriotic retelling of Chernobyl story","bodyText":"Russian state TV is set to air its own drama about the deadly 1986 Chernobyl disaster – but unlike the HBO series, which has transfixed viewers around the world, this version will claim that a CIA spy was present for the worst nuclear accident in history. Chernobyl, which will air on Russia’s NTV channel, appears to fulfil a demand from tabloid columnists and state TV news for a more patriotic retelling of the story. Craig Mazin, the creator of the HBO series, famously obsessed over minor details such as shoelaces and telephones, and adopted first-hand accounts of survivors to authentically recreate the Soviet Union of the 1980s. NTV’s Chernobyl, filmed in Belarus, takes far more liberties. A description of the show says that the plot revolves around a CIA agent dispatched to Pripyat to gather intelligence on the Chernobyl nuclear power plant and the Russian counterintelligence agent sent to track him down. If it sounds like fiction, that’s because it is. But the director, Alexey Muradov, said the show “will tell viewers about what really happened back then”. “There is a theory that the Americans had infiltrated the Chernobyl nuclear power plant and many historians do not deny that on the day of the explosion an agent of the enemy’s intelligence services was present at the station,” Muradov told the tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda, which said the show “proposes an alternative view on the tragedy in Pripyat”. State-run television and Russian tabloids have accused the HBO series of bias by papering over the heroic acts of Soviet emergency workers, the so-called “liquidators”. “Chernobyl did not show the most important part – our victory,” ran one headline in Komsomolskaya Pravda, the country’s most popular daily. Another article by the prominent war correspondent Dmitry Steshin in the same paper claimed the show was filmed in order to sabotage overseas sales of nuclear energy technology by the Russian state company Rosatom. Russia fetes its military veterans like few other countries do, but far less attention is paid to the Chernobyl liquidators. Ilya Shepelin, a Russian journalist, wrote in the Moscow Times that “the fact that an American, not a Russian, TV channel tells us about our own heroes is a source of shame that the pro-Kremlin media apparently cannot live down”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2020/jan/22/a-toolbox-for-his-work-fundraiser-launched-to-save-derek-jarman-home","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2020-01-22T14:35:53Z","webTitle":"'A toolbox for his work': fundraiser launched to save Derek Jarman's home","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/22/a-toolbox-for-his-work-fundraiser-launched-to-save-derek-jarman-home","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2020/jan/22/a-toolbox-for-his-work-fundraiser-launched-to-save-derek-jarman-home","fields":{"headline":"'A toolbox for his work': fundraiser launched to save Derek Jarman's home","bodyText":"A public fundraising campaign to save the home and garden of the artist and film-maker Derek Jarman has been launched with a deadline of 10 weeks to reach a target of £3.5m. On one level Prospect Cottage is a small, pretty Victorian former fisherman’s house on a shingle beach in Kent, which has Dungeness nuclear power station looming over it. But campaigners argue it is a work of art in its own right with an internationally recognised garden. It is also a source of inspiration for artists and activists and, shrine-like, a place of pilgrimage for devotees of one of the most important and influential British artists of his generation. It was bought by Jarman in 1986. Following his death in 1994 it was carefully looked after by Jarman’s long-time companion, Keith Collins. He died in 2018 wanting the house to have a legacy, as well as a benefit to his own surviving partner. The campaign to raise the money was launched at the Slade School of Art on Wednesday by speakers who included the actor Tilda Swinton, a close friend and collaborator of the artists, who was with Jarman when they spotted the small painted wooden house with a “for sale” sign stuck in stones. “Derek’s father had recently died and left him a small inheritance,” said Swinton. “Life on Charing Cross road had become somewhat overstimulating and Derek was looking for a place to be quieter.” They went round the house and Jarman quickly knew he would buy it. “Within a couple of months, Derek was taking down chintz curtains and prizing open the lid of the first of a gazillion gallons of pitch black paint with which to anoint his new kingdom. Swinton said Jarman created a Tardis-like home which was itself a work of art. “First and foremost, the cottage was always a living thing, a practical toolbox for his work.” Collins, when he was ill in 2018, approached his friend the artist Tacita Dean and talked of his anxieties about what to do with the cottage. Dean phoned Stephen Deuchar, director of the Art Fund, and a plan was hatched to give the cottage a future. The initiative involves Tate, which will look after Jarman’s archive from the cottage, and Creative Folkestone, which will oversee its long-term care, run residency programmes and organise small group tours. Maria Balshaw, the director of Tate, recalled being a teenager and watching Jarman’s films such as Sebastiane and Jubilee late at night on Channel 4. “These films told me that there was another world and another way of seeing and thinking. I can honestly say they changed my life.” Dean said Jarman was an artist who touched so many people in many different ways, “whether we’re stone collectors or gardeners or gay activists or just activists, or film-makers or painters … he was remarkable.” Nearly half the money has already been raised thanks to £750,000 from the National Heritage Memorial Fund; £500,000 from the Art Fund; and £250,000 from the Linbury Trust. That still leaves a big sum. It is “a bit terrifying,” said Dean. A crowdfunding page at artfund.org/prospect has been created with prints and works of art for sale. They include, for £25, a badge and set of stickers designed by Jeremy Deller. For £100, a Michael Craig-Martin print. And for £1,000, a limited edition print of a blackboard drawing by Dean. Deller said the cottage gave a great insight in to what Jarman was like as an artist. “The word unique is overused, but this really is a unique environment, it’s a unique building. Within it you can see his thought processes, you can see his work and it is all in such incredible condition … he deserves to have this kept as it was.” A deadline of 31 March has been set to raise the money and prevent, the Art Fund said, the risk of it “being sold privately, its contents dispersed and artistic legacy lost”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2020/jan/01/zero-carbon-energy-outstrips-fossil-fuels-in-britain-across-2019","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2020-01-01T08:01:00Z","webTitle":"Zero-carbon electricity outstrips fossil fuels in Britain across 2019","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/01/zero-carbon-energy-outstrips-fossil-fuels-in-britain-across-2019","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2020/jan/01/zero-carbon-energy-outstrips-fossil-fuels-in-britain-across-2019","fields":{"headline":"Zero-carbon electricity outstrips fossil fuels in Britain across 2019","bodyText":"Zero-carbon energy became Britain’s largest electricity source in 2019, delivering nearly half the country’s electrical power and for the first time outstripping generation by fossil fuels. Following a dramatic decline in coal-fired power and a rise in renewable and low-carbon energy, 2019 was the cleanest year for electrical energy on record for Britain, according to National Grid, which owns and operates the electricity transmission network in England and Wales, and also runs the Scottish networks. National Grid’s latest data shows that wind farms, solar and nuclear energy, alongside energy imported by subsea cables, delivered 48.5% of Britain’s electricity in 2019. This compares to 43% generated by fossil fuels – coal, gas, and other carbon sources such as oil and diesel. The remaining 8.5% was generated by biomass, such as wood pellets. This milestone comes as the UK enters the mid-point between 1990 and 2050, the year in which it has committed to achieve at least a 100% net reduction in greenhouse gas emissions based on 1990 levels, and to become a net zero carbon economy. A decade ago, fossil fuels generated more than three-quarters of all electricity, while zero-carbon sources accounted for less than a quarter (22.8%), with wind at 1.3%. Then, coal plants provided almost a third of the UK’s electricity. This has dwindled to 1.9%, and Britain set a new record for going without coal-powered energy altogether in summer 2019: it went for 18 days from May to early June without using coal to generate electricity, the longest such run since 1882. By the end of this winter, the UK will be left with only four coal fired power plants. EDF Energy’s Cottam coal plant in Nottinghamshire closed this year and two other coal plants, RWE’s Aberthaw B and SSE’s Fiddler’s Ferry, are due to close in March 2020. The National Grid figures show a dramatic shift in the last two decades. Wind farms, solar panels and hydro power now generate just over a quarter of Britain’s electricity, compared with 2.3% in 1990. Nuclear power accounts for 17%, compared with nearly 20% in 1990. However, the use of gas – a fossil fuel – also shot up to generate more than 38% of the country’s electrical power last year, compared with just 0.1% in 1990. National Grid’s chief executive John Pettigrew said: “As we enter a new decade, this truly is a historic moment and an opportunity to reflect on how much has been achieved. “At National Grid, we know we have a critical role in the acceleration towards a cleaner future and are committed to playing our part in delivering a safe and secure energy system that works for all.” Other recent government figures showed that the UK’s growing fleet of offshore wind projects generated more electricity than onshore windfarms for the first time in the third quarter. Since then, wind power reached fresh highs during blustery weather in early December to generate almost 45% of the UK’s electricity on one day. In December, National Grid unveiled plans to invest almost £10bn in the UK’s gas and electricity networks over the next five years. Of this, almost £1bn has been earmarked for the transition to a net zero carbon electricity system by 2025, including investments in new equipment and technology. A further £85m will support changes to the ways people heat their homes, switching away from gas boilers to technologies such as electric heat pumps and hydrogen boilers. National Grid estimates that more than 23 million homes will need to install new low-carbon heating solutions by 2050. • This article was amended on 3 January 2020 to make clear, for avoidance of doubt, that various references to energy and power meant electricity only."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2020/sep/21/top-10-places-to-spot-migratory-birds-uk","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2020-09-21T05:30:05Z","webTitle":"10 of the best places to spot migratory birds in the UK","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/sep/21/top-10-places-to-spot-migratory-birds-uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2020/sep/21/top-10-places-to-spot-migratory-birds-uk","fields":{"headline":"10 of the best places to spot migratory birds in the UK","bodyText":"There have been signs of change in the air for a couple of weeks now. Birdsong has returned to gardens and parks after a few weeks of near silence. Starlings have been massing in my local south-east London supermarket car park – in a slightly Hitchcockian fashion – before finally mustering a respectable murmuration. I found it mesmerising, but fellow shoppers seemed not to notice. The same week, on a warm mid-September day, a trip to Dungeness in south-east Kent, produced the wow factor of a vast flock of lapwings, climbing, turning and swooping, flashing black, white, silver and purple in the bright sunlight. Something is afoot. The torpor of late August, when so many birds – freed from having to mark territories – seem to skulk silently in trees and thickets, has passed; now there are frenetic and bold displays and much gathering of the clans. Some, like the lapwings, are coming together for winter from their dispersed UK and continental breeding sites; others are heading off to sub-Saharan Africa on the tail of swifts who left more than a month ago, and then there are species that just want to shift a few miles, not always for reasons understood by ornithologists. I first saw the change at the beginning of September, on the North Downs near Sevenoaks. Plaintive mews from high above alerted me to buzzards, a raptor now quite common in south-east England (having for many years been absent). I’ve only ever seen one or two at a time but staring up I could see 10 of these majestic birds of prey stacked up, soaring, occasionally play-fighting, gliding ever higher in tight circles. Later I learned from birding experts online that young buzzards often cluster along with their parents and neighbouring broods before dispersing to fresh territories that can be hundreds of miles away. The experience told me it’s the time to get out on foot or bike to witness things that can only be seen at this time of year. A perusal of Chris Packham’s Self Isolating Bird Club Facebook page revealed unusual happenings: swarms of house martins in Hampshire, wheatears flitting through gardens as they summon the strength to set off to central Africa. Another site detailed one man’s joy as around 90 pink-footed geese interrupted his work while they transited from summer breeding grounds in the Arctic en route to their favoured UK autumn and winter coastal locations. Back at Dungeness, below the lapwings, a cyclone of swallows was developing over coastal pasture. They were feasting on flying insects in preparation for their journey to South Africa. Until 108 years ago swallows’ whereabouts in autumn and winter was something of a mystery – as recently as the 18th century many observers, even great naturalists such as Gilbert White, hypothesised that they hibernated in mud by ponds. But on 27 December 1912 a letter was received by bird ring supplier Harry Witherby from a hotelier in Natal, South Africa, confirming the amazing truth. It revealed that a swallow found trapped in a nearby farmhouse had a ring on it marked Witherby, High Holborn, London. The bird had actually been ringed by John Masefield in Cheadle, Staffordshire, on 6 May 1911. Our knowledge of bird behaviour had taken a huge leap. Even more dramatic was the later discovery that Arctic terns – one of the UK’s most elegant summer seabird visitors – dash off to the extremes of the southern hemisphere in autumn. In December 1966 a tern was found in New South Wales that had been ringed in Anglesey six months earlier. More recent studies, including one by BBC Springwatch with Newcastle university, showed that terns nesting on the Farne Islands off the coast of Northumberland were setting off each autumn on a zigzagging route of more than 59,000 miles that took in West Africa and the Indian Ocean before arriving off Antarctica. The passage of migrants is still shrouded in mystery, however. Technology has given us the means to locate them but not necessarily tell us about the reasons for their route choices. The British Trust for Ornithology has been tracking a cuckoo they call Carlton II on its annual migration to central Africa for the past couple of years. Earlier this month, its solar-powered tracker revealed that the cuckoo had decided to take in a swathe of the Atlantic Ocean 100 miles off Morocco on its route from Suffolk to Mauritania. Humans, however, have played a role in bird route choices, with railways, canals and roads offering geographic locators. The BTO says it’s noticed ospreys following the A1 on the start of their epic journey to central Africa. But at the moment you’re most likely to see small birds on the move. The period from mid-September to mid-October sees finches setting off on mysterious travels within the UK and to other parts of Europe. “Siskins, in particular, are popping into gardens right now,” BTO ornithologist Paul Stancliffe says, “and chaffinches will be following soon after, then later, goldfinches and bramblings.” He explains that males of many of these species remain closer to their breeding grounds for territorial reasons, and so a larger proportion of birds on the move tend to be female. “Males are often desperate to get back as soon as weather and food sources allow to establish territory, so don’t feel the urge to travel so far in the autumn,” he says, adding that a cold snap on the continent or a failure of the berry crop in, say, Scandinavia, can see thousands of birds of both genders on the move. One of the most dramatic “invasions” is set to occur in the next two weeks with redwings arriving in the UK from Scandinavia and western Russia, says Stancliffe. Again, food and weather will play their part in the exact timing but the advance guard has already made landfall in the Shetland and Orkney islands. A beautiful small thrush easy to identify from its eye-stripe, the flocks often traverse the North Sea by night and descend on UK hedgerows in their thousand to devour berries. Redwings aren’t Stancliffe’s favourite though. His unlikely choice, the bird he always looks out for at this time of year, is the humble wood pigeon. “In 1985, on Hengistbury Head, Dorset, I saw at least 50,000 wood pigeons heading south – it took them nearly three hours to pass over.” Where they go exactly is still something of a mystery but the cork oak forests of Portugal and Spain and their acorns seem fertile territory for many. “Light winds and a clear day helps … but you never know when your luck will be in.” 10 of the best places to see autumn migrations Paul Stancliffe says peninsulas and headlands jutting into the sea are among the best places, as birds are effectively funnelled. Inland, hill ridges, from the Pennines to the Chilterns have proven to be excellent territory for spectacular bird spotting. But essentially, spectacular movements of birds can be seen all over the country, including towns and cities. However, if we are to narrow it down, here are some options that should improve your chances. Spurn Point, East Yorkshire This narrow thread of land – actually classed as a sand tidal island – facing Grimsby is home to a bird observatory that records prodigious quantities of migrants and rarities. An easterly wind will bring thousands of birds passing through. Dungeness, Kent Given its lighthouses, miniature railway, nuclear power station, curious shacks and shingle, the peninsula is a unique spot even without the vast array of bird and insect life that uses it to launch off over the English Channel. A bird observatory and excellent RSPB reserve keep track of the comings and goings. Portland Bill, Dorset Some 6,000 housemartins were recorded in one last week at Portland Bill Obsevatory, along with 3,000 swallows and 500 meadow pipits. A lofty narrow promontory with Grade II-listed lighthouse and an atmosphere all of its own make this a special spot. Land’s End, Cornwall Stancliffe says he likes to visit the Cornish peninsula to view the passage of skylarks heading to Ireland. Other birds seen here in numbers each autumn include meadow pipits, lesser black-backed gulls and sandwich terns. Temporary residents rocking up can include Lapland and snow buntings, Richard’s pipits and American golden plovers. North Ronaldsay, Orkneys This island is a bit remote, but it warrants inclusion because not only is it a stunning, other-worldly location, but September is its hottest month bird-wise. All the finches and thrushes pass through in this month and the seabird migration reaches its climax. In addition, waders and a wide roll call of raptors make their presence felt at this time. Blakeney Point, Norfolk Another beautiful but somewhat bleak coastal location that not only attracts migrant birds in great number but plenty of twitchers desperate to add to their lists of rarities. The point itself – part of the Blakeney national nature reserve – has a breeding tern colony as well as its famous seal colony, but the surrounding vegetation harbours an array of migrants and vagrants such as brown shrikes, flycatchers, icterine warblers, wrynecks and so on. Lough Foyle, County Derry The RSPB-maintained mud and sandflats at this estuary reserve host large populations of pale-bellied brent geese and whooper swans as they return from their breeding grounds in Greenland and Iceland respectively. Flocks of more than 1,000 geese and 3,000 golden plover waders are regularly recorded here – an astounding sight. Rutland Water, east Midlands Passage waders, ducks and geese are the stars during autumn at this huge inland lake, with 21 species of wader once recorded in a single day, and other regular migrants include glossy ibis, terns and wheatears. Up to 70 species breed over summer, including ospreys, some of which are about to set off on their long journeys south. South Downs national park Experienced Surrey-based birder Steve Gale is a specialist in North Downs migrations but admits that the South Downs have the edge when it comes to spotting at migration times. He says this is because the South Downs “have steep slopes on both sides and a narrower ridge so the birds are funnelled into a smaller space”. His recent sightings at Chanctonbury Ring, Cissbury Ring and Chantry Hill include 700 housemartins, 2,000 linnets, a rich haul of flycatchers, wheatears, yellowhammers and corn buntings. St Davids peninsula, Pembrokeshire The whole of the Pembrokeshire Coast natural park is superb birdwatching territory with lots of varied terrain from ancient woodland to sea cliffs and river valleys. Being a headland, St Davids is used by birds transiting to and from Ireland and by visitors from Arctic regions. Wrynecks, buff-breasted sandpipers and ospreys also drop by at this time of year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2022/aug/22/australia-news-live-updates-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-scott-morrison-secret-ministries-heath-economy-jobs-migration-nsw-qld-victoria","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-22T08:48:34Z","webTitle":"Push to reconvene inquiry into Holgate dismissal – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2022/aug/22/australia-news-live-updates-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-scott-morrison-secret-ministries-heath-economy-jobs-migration-nsw-qld-victoria","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2022/aug/22/australia-news-live-updates-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-scott-morrison-secret-ministries-heath-economy-jobs-migration-nsw-qld-victoria","fields":{"headline":"Push to reconvene inquiry into Holgate dismissal – as it happened","bodyText":"That’s where we’ll leave you this evening.

Liberal MP Bridget Archer has welcomed the idea of an independent review into Morrison’s conduct, saying he should consider his position. Former Australia Post CEO Christine Holgate said she was ‘disappointed’ to learn that Morrison was secretly finance minister during what was supposed to be an independent inquiry into the controversy around her dismissal from the role. The Greens have called for the inquiry into Holgate’s dismissal to reconvene following revelations of Morrison’s secret appointment to the finance portfolio, which is a “shareholder” ministry.

They’ve also given the Labor party a 42% primary vote, up from 33% at the election in May. Keep a look out tomorrow morning for Guardian Australia’s own Essential poll, covering a range of political and economic issues, including company tax and the shape of the economy. Lettuce back on the menu as price finally drops The price of lettuce has finally dropped at major supermarkets from soaring highs of $11.99 to a modest $2.50, as vegetable stocks return following months of supply chain issues. Shaun Lindhe, national manager of communications at AusVeg, said prices had gone down as the availability of produce increased, particularly in areas recovering from flooding events: Over the last few months, we have seen good conditions in many vegetable-growing regions, as well as increased supply from growers heavily impacted by severe floods earlier in the year – particularly southern Queensland, which is a major vegetable production region in the winter months. This is resulting in an increased supply and availability of vegetables, including fresh lettuce in the market.

A woman is taking legal action against Aldi after she was injured at a Victorian store last year amid a “special buys” frenzy involving discounted TVs. The 73-year-old, who wishes to remain anonymous, is seeking compensation after she was allegedly struck by another customer’s trolley and knocked to the ground during the heavily promoted sale at the Corio store in August 2021. The woman was knocked to the ground and suffered a fractured hip, which required surgery. According to a statement of claim filed in the Victorian county court, the incident also left the woman with ongoing trochanteric bursitis, depression and anxiety.

Queensland inquiry into police responses to domestic violence reopens submissions to public Queensland’s commission of inquiry into police responses to domestic violence has unexpectedly reopened submissions to the public, citing the reaction to evidence given by the state’s police commissioner as a driver for the decision. Queensland’s police commissioner, Katarina Carroll, was interrogated for more than eight hours at a public hearing in Brisbane last week after she initially declined an invitation to attend. The commission said it was contacted by a number of Queensland police service (QPS) members after Carroll “agreed” there were “significant cultural issues relating to sexism, misogyny and racism” within the force. “After considering the answers to the questions put to [Carroll] at that hearing and upon receiving further communications from current and former members of the QPS … the commission has decided that it’s necessary to reopen call for submissions,” the commissioner, Deborah Richards, said during a brief hearing on Monday.

Western Australia is urging hospitality and tourism workers from the rest of Australia and New Zealand to consider moving to the state, as it grapples with a skills shortage ahead of summer, AAP reports. The WA premier, Mark McGowan, announced a major campaign, Discover the Other Side, to attract chefs, wait staff, baristas, bartenders, managers and tour operators ahead of summer. McGowan said: Summer is the busiest time of year for our local hospitality and tourism industries, so the timing of this campaign is critical to help attract young workers to WA. With our strong and thriving economy, relaxed lifestyle and great attractions, there’s no better time to make the move to WA and work in these high-demand industries. As someone who relocated to WA for work in my twenties and has remained here ever since, I can safely say it was one of the best decisions I’ve ever made. The campaign has been developed with key industry and government bodies, including Tourism WA and the WA Australian Hotels Association. It builds on the state’s Life in WA campaign launched nationally last year to target skilled workers in the construction and manufacturing industries, which was expanded to the United Kingdom and Ireland. Aaand that bushfire warning has now been downgraded to “watch and act”. If you’re in the area, please keep an eye on the situation. An emergency warning has been issued for a bushfire in Darwin’s south-east. Secure NT says the blaze is spreading on one or more fronts and effective containment strategies are not in place for its entire perimeter, AAP reports. The risk of loss of life or threat to properties is almost certain or has occurred. Northern Territory Fire and Rescue Service is primarily undertaking defensive strategies to protect lives and property. Locals in the vicinity of Wishart and Kirkland roads have been urged to leave if it is safe to do so. If it’s not safe to leave, they should shelter indoors immediately. Hanson-Young continues: We as the committee, the Senate committee that hosted this inquiry, over many months, had the finance department in front of us a number of times. We had the Australia Post board and we had a whole raft of from the two shareholder ministers and their offices in relation to it. Not once was it disclosed that the prime minister himself [was] in a position of being a shareholder minister. Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young is speaking now about the party’s proposal to reconvene the Senate committee into Australia Post CEO Christine Holgate’s dismissal. She says: There is a serious question about due process. That’s what the Senate inquiry found. The majority report found there were serious questions about whether the process had been followed, whether Christine Holgate had been given an appropriate opportunity to respond. There were question marks over the behaviour of the prime minister just in the public reaction that he gave. But now we find out that he actually was in an extra position of power and that was never disclosed at any moment or at any point. So it really does create an uncertainty over the lack of due process and the legality of whether Christine was removed. Nationals leader calls for ‘maturity’ in debate of Morrison’s secret ministries National Party leader David Littleproud is speaking to the ABC right now about the examination of former PM Scott Morrison’s self-appointment to multiple ministries. Littleproud says Anthony Albanese has been too intent on “tearing down the former Coalition government”. I think we need a level of maturity to this debate now. That’s what the Coalition will bring to it. OK, sure. New black hole song New album from Nasa just dropped, and it’s the sound of a black hole. Quite literally. NSW facing extension of industrial action by rail union Industrial action by NSW rail unions could continue next month as the state government and opposition call for an end. The potential extension came after workers refused to operate 37 trains they said did not meet minimum maintenance standards, leading to delays on the T1, T2, and T8 lines on Monday, AAP reports. Rail, Tram, and Bus Union NSW secretary Alex Claassens said: People are in my office talking about a calendar for September. Everybody is very frustrated and angry and something’s got to give here. Claassens said trains that did not meet minimum maintenance standards could be affected by a range of issues “from safety all the way through to cleanliness”. He blamed outsourcing and extended time between maintenance inspections for failure to meet standards. Meetings took place on Friday, Sunday, and Monday to try and resolve the long-running dispute over a new enterprise agreement and the union’s safety concerns with the mothballed Korean-built fleet of intercity trains. While the action that took trains out of service on Monday was in the union’s advised calendar, Claassens said the union did not expect so many trains would not meet the standards. Premier Dominic Perrottet said trains being out of action was incredibly disappointing and dismissed the industrial action the union has been engaged in throughout this month as “political games”. Perrottet said Monday’s action was “unplanned”, although the union advised weeks ago it would not be operating trains that did not meet minimum standards. The premier said the trains did meet those standards. This is just the union once again taking action and inconveniencing people for their own political benefit. None of us understood that it was going to have that massive impact, and that again has highlighted the problem that we’ve got. The blustery sunny day in Victoria has turned into blustery rain and hail and potential for minor floods. Please keep an eye on local warnings. A little interlude: here is current federal treasurer Jim Chalmers and former Labor prime minister (and treasurer) Paul Keating having a chinwag this morning. I’m informed that Chalmers wrote his PhD thesis on Keating’s leadership. The Greens are calling for the senate committee that held an inquiry into the sacking of Australia Post CEO Christine Holgate to reconvene, after revelations that Scott Morrison was a “shareholder minister” at the time.

Qantas frequent flyers struggling to claim \"apology” perks due to technical issues Qantas frequent flyers have been offered a $50 voucher as an “apology” from the airline for flight cancellations and delays in recent months. However news.com is reporting that the airline’s app and website has crashed after frequent flyer members rushed to redeem the vouchers. The perks offered also included status extensions for Qantas frequent flyers in silver and above, also increased lounge access and extra award booking availability as well. Parliament could have “different view” from solicitor general on legality of Morrison’s actions, Shoebridge says Greens Senator David Shoebridge appeared on Sky News earlier, weighing in on the Scott Morrison secret ministries saga as the public awaits the findings of the solicitor general. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, revealed just before midday that the solicitor general has released his findings on the legality of Morrison’s actions and that he will make those findings public following a briefing this afternoon. Shoebridge said the parliament may have a “different view” from the solicitor general on the lawfulness of Morrison’s actions. Shoebridge said the solicitor general’s report would not be the end of the investigation. He said: Both the Senate and the House have very distinct interests to the government of the day when it comes to … the power to, secretly or otherwise, appoint ministers. There were 213 new cases in the last reporting period, and one person is in intensive care. There were 132 new cases in the last reporting period, and one person is in intensive care. Brisbane man shot twice by police officer as children hid in bushes, police say A man will undergo surgery after being shot twice by a Queensland police officer he had allegedly lunged at with a large metal sharpening file during a “horrible incident” at a house in Brisbane’s south, AAP reports. Queensland police said the 43-year-old’s wife and four sons – aged seven to 14 – were at home during the confrontation on Sunday night. There were 786 new cases in the last reporting period, and eight people are in intensive care. Man lucky to survive plane crash in NSW A 71-year-old pilot is “incredibly lucky to walk away” alive after his light plane crashed into trees, flipped and landed on its roof on the NSW Central Coast, AAP reports. Emergency crews were called to the crash site near Warnervale airport, north of the Central Coast town of Wyong, just before 11am on Monday. The plane crashed while attempting to land, NSW Police were told. When paramedics arrived they found the aircraft had crashed into trees and come to rest on its roof, NSW Ambulance Inspector Andrew Craig said. The pilot has been incredibly lucky to walk away from this crash with minor injuries. Our paramedics know that incidents involving aircraft can be extremely serious and it’s a relief that the man involved today was not badly injured.” Multiple ambulances attended the scene and were helped by off-duty paramedics, who were nearby when the plane came down, NSW Ambulance said. The pilot suffered only a minor injury to his hand and was taken to John Hunter hospital in a stable condition. NSW Police are investigating and the Australian Transport Safety Bureau have been notified. Flood warnings for parts of regional Victoria A spokesperson for the Office of the Official Secretary to the Governor General has defended its role in non-disclosure of Scott Morrison’s ministerial appointments. The spokesperson said: There is a difference between the governor general swearing-in a minister to hold office and approving an existing minister to administer a department. The instances in question are examples of the latter. They are neither the first nor the last examples. How these appointments are communicated is the prerogative of the government of the day. The Office of the Official Secretary to the Governor General is not responsible for publishing these sorts of administrative appointments. As such, they are not and have not been included in the Office’s annual reports, nor would the act of signing an instrument approving an administrative appointment be included in the governor general’s program on the website. In response to current media commentary, there is no secret or conspiracy in the office’s reporting. The office routinely publishes details of swearing-in ceremonies and gazettes the details of when the governor general has directed a minister to hold office. However, the office is not responsible for publishing changes to the administrative arrangements for departments. Again, that is the prerogative of the government of the day. There has been no deviation by the office from past practice. Acknowledging that the administrative appointments were not communicated – as expected, by the government of the day – the office supports a more transparent process to ensure that any appointments made under section 64 are made public. Noting that these reporting responsibilities are the prerogative of the government of the day, the office will await the recommendations of the current process before commenting further. Global stars feature on Melbourne’s virtual art trail A new augmented reality art trail has seen giant worms, skulls and spiders installed in Melbourne’s public spaces - virtually, of course, AAP reports. AR. Trail, which can be viewed through a smartphone app, features some big names in global contemporary art, including KAWS, Olafur Eliasson and David Shrigley. With constant phone use becoming the norm, it’s hoped the virtual exhibition will attract new audiences that may find museums and galleries intimidating, Melbourne Arts Precinct Corporation chief executive Katrina Sedgwick told AAP. It’s your perfect selfie paradise because you’ve got these works, you and your friends can hop in there and you can take those images, it’s already beautifully set up on the screen. The free show stretches from Federation Square down St Kilda Road to NGV International, and people can use a QR code to access an app, enabling them to see the works on the camera screen of their phones. It also includes commissions by celebrated Australian artists Reko Rennie and Ron Mueck, and the first virtual reality work by Patricia Piccinini. Cold front moving over Victoria Victoria will see showers today before a cold front moves in tomorrow. Farmers warned cold temperatures to affect sheep and lambs Did you know the Bureau of Meteorology has a special warning to farmers to keep their sheep warm amidst frosty conditions? One has just been issued for sheep graziers across NSW, as cold temperatures, rain and showers and southwesterly winds are expected during later today and into Tuesday. The bureau says: There is a risk of losses of lambs and sheep exposed to these conditions. The warning is in place for the Mid North coast, Hunter, Northern Tablelands, Illawarra, South Coast, Central Tablelands, Southern Tablelands, North West Slopes &amp; Plains, Central West Slopes &amp; Plains, South West Slopes, Riverina, Upper Western, Lower Western, Snowy Mountains and Australian Capital Territory forecast districts. One-in-100 year weather events becoming more frequent: Ardern The prime minister of New Zealand Jacinda Ardern has travelled to the South Island city of Nelson, where residents are still recovering after a huge week of rain brought flooding and destruction. You can hear what she had to say, reflecting that these events would become more frequent. Northern Territory hospitals carry on after supplies fire Health officials in the Northern Territory continue to assess the effect of a weekend warehouse fire in Darwin that destroyed crucial hospital supplies, with early estimates putting the damage bill at about $30m, AAP reports. The blaze has left hospitals in Darwin, Katherine and Palmerston with about three days’ worth of some items including theatre consumables, disposable sheets and gloves but officials say there will be no effects on services or patient care. Supplies of most items are also kept in other facilities. Nursing and emergency medicine director Kylee St George said all services, including theatre procedures, would be uninterrupted. She said there would be a full system review of what stock is on hand and what is available and where the vulnerabilities are. She said: So we have until Wednesday to put in contingency plans on ensuring our current position that no patient care or staff ability to perform their duties will be affected. NT chief minister Natasha Fyles said some fresh supplies would arrive on Wednesday and work was continuing to identify what gaps might remain. The chief minister said there was no information to suggest there would be issues or delays with restocking, though checks were being made to determine if sourcing some specialised equipment could take longer. Cold front coming for NSW and ACT Cold temperatures, rain and southwesterly winds starting later today and continuing tomorrow are being predicted for NSW and the ACT by the bureau of meteorology. Independent MP calling for sanctions on the Myanmar junta Independent MP for Goldstein and former ABC South East Asia correspondent, Zoe Daniel, is calling on Australia to introduce sanctions on the Myanmar junta who took over the country in a military coup eighteen months ago. Daniel is urging for Australia to follow the lead of the US, UK, the European Union and India who have all imposed targeted sanctions on Myanmar individuals and businesses. Daniel is calling on sanctions for the two largest military-owned conglomerates and their subsidiaries in order “to cut off vital foreign revenue to the junta.” Star Entertainment says $198.6m loss largely due to Covid closures at casinos Star Entertainment Group has posted a full year loss of $198.6m as Covid-related closures during the year and a writedown against its flagship Sydney casino hit the casino operator, AAP reports. Australia’s second-biggest casino operator today said it has slashed the value of goodwill for the Star Sydney property by $162.5m “due to regulatory and other uncertainties”. There were 786 new cases in the last reporting period, and eight people are in intensive care. Albanese says services for long-term unemployed need examination The PM was also asked about jobs again, and he made an interesting comment about employment services – interesting particularly in the wake of my colleague Luke Henriques-Gomes’ ongoing coverage of jobseekers’ “mutual obligations”. For a lot of long-term unemployed who have been shut out of opportunity, with the tight labour market, it may well be that those opportunities open up to them again. Some of that means you need one on one support. We need to look at employment services in the way that it has been operating as well because the advice from both long-term unemployed but also from employment services providers is that the structure that said if you have made 20 phone calls a week and ticked those boxes, that is what it is about. If it hasn’t advanced the opportunity for you to get into employment, then that’s just a paper shuffling exercise. Albanese says government will release report on Darwin port Just circling back to the end of that press conference with the prime minister this morning. He was asked about the current status of the review into the lease of the Darwin port by the Chinese-owned company Landbridge, which was considered a security concern by the Labor party. Anthony Albanese: I have said that we will be reviewing the Darwin port ownership of the lease. People would be aware that it was leased out to a company connected, very directly, with the government of the People’s Republic of China. We opposed it and I was the shadow minute at the time and we were concerned about that. We expressed our opposition. I have asked for advice and when we receive it, we will make it public. The hearse carrying Archie Roach paused outside Charcoal Lane for a minute’s silence. Images from the late Archie Roach’s final journey past Charcoal Lane in Melbourne have started to come through from Guardian Australia photographer Ellen Smith. Kean answers questions at estimates about trade job saga The New South Wales Treasurer Matt Kean sent a text message of support to former deputy premier John Barilaro when he expressed an interest in a highly paid New York trade role last year. Speaking at budget estimates, Kean said he then “didn’t give it a second thought” because it was “not usual” for Barilaro to text him ideas: I received a text from John Barilaro, texted back something supportive and I didn’t give it a second thought. I got lots of strange and wacky requests from John Barilaro. He texted me that he wants to build nuclear power plants all over the state, he texted me that he wanted to go to the federal parliament, he texted me that he wanted to take the Nationals party out of the government. He said the exchange about the job was “some time in December” but he was not sure exactly when. Kean said he did not think Barilaro was “genuine” in his interest “and I never heard from him again”. Barilaro was eventually appointed to the role before he relinquished it amid public backlash. Here is our previous reporting: The former managing director of Australia Post, Christine Holgate, has weighed into the controversy surrounding Scott Morrison and his secret ministries. In 2020 Morrison called on Holgate to resign after it was revealed she gave Cartier watches to executives, saying she should stand aside “or she can go”. Shortly thereafter, the finance department undertook a review into expenses at Australia Post. It has now become clear that Morrison was secretly the finance minister at the time, having sworn himself in to the portfolio in March 2020. In a statement provided to Guardian Australia, Holgate said: I was as disappointed as everyone else to learn the former PM had secretly taken on the most important roles in cabinet. The fact he was secretly Finance Minister, when the finance department were apparently conducting an “independent” inquiry into my matter, is very concerning. Wage increases in common interest for unions and employers, PM says Asked, “On the enterprise bargaining reform, what do you think about the ACTU/BCA proposal?,” Anthony Albanese says: Enterprise bargaining is not working. We know that is the case, wages haven’t been keeping up with inflation and the difference between the new government and the old government is that the old government of the Coalition had a policy of putting downward pressure on wages. They wanted low wages to be a key feature of the economic architecture. They fessed up on that. That is not the Labor government’s approach. We want to see wages increase over time and we want it to occur in a way that is cooperative. I see that there are common interests between unions and employers. It has been a theme of mine for a long, long period of time. It is a part of my philosophical view around the creation of Infrastructure Australia, the creation of jobs and skills Australia, how do we create that common purpose structures? Enterprise bargaining is about employers and unions coming to common interest to benefit both and anything that can do that I see as very positive. PM stands by promise to reduce power prices The questions have returned to policy. Anthony Albanese is asked if he is still committed to the campaign promise to cut electricity bills by $275: What occurred was that unbeknownst to the Australian public, again a lack of transparency, the government knew that wholesale prices were going to have considerable increases. They deferred those increases until after the election campaign and then they went up. Our commitment is that because of our policies they will drive down energy prices. We stand by the modelling which we released, which is that, from a business as usual, as the government – the former government was sitting there for a decade with no structure to encourage investment, where it was needed in renewables and at the same time as it was presiding over the closure of plants like Liddell, that it would reduce power prices our policy. Our policy will reduce power prices and we stand by that and we stand by the modelling. Albanese commits to releasing solicitor general’s advice The PM is asked if he thinks there should be a broader inquiry into this: Quite clearly, there are real questions to be answered here. There is a question of legality. There hasn’t been a suggestion of illegality but there are – there have been questions raised about how this could occur, how it fits in with the conventions and the normal accountability mechanisms and checks and balances that are there in our parliamentary democracy. They are matters that need to be considered. I will await and consider the advice properly. I will release it publicly. I am giving that commitment, so that everyone will have the opportunity to see the advice for themselves, but I would have thought that Australians are concerned that this could ever occur. There is a basic fundamental weakness in checks and balances if no one knows who the minister is, then how can they be held to account for decisions which are made? Anthony Albanese has just addressed the elephant in the room – the legal advice on Scott Morrison’s secret ministries. I will be briefed by the secretary of my department, Glynn Davis, on the advice. My understanding is he has received the advice. I will be briefed on it this afternoon. I intend to release that advice so that people can see it and be transparent about it and we will, because my government, as an orderly government, we have cabinet meetings tomorrow. I think politeness and proper process means that they should have access to it. I will do that and I intend to release the advice tomorrow. As I said, I haven’t had the opportunity, because I have been here, it came through while we were downstairs, so I will get briefed on it this afternoon at the commonwealth offices and then it will be considered, or released – I don’t know that there is any decisions to be made, I am not sure because I haven’t examined it yet, by the cabinet, but I will release it tomorrow in Canberra. All state and territory leaders to attend jobs and skills summit Anthony Albanese is asked about NSW treasurer Matt Kean calling the summit unnecessary. He responds: Dominic Perrottet is very keen to attend and accepted the invitation, as did every single premier and chief minister. You advance the country when there is more collaboration. PM acknowledges skills shortages are a ‘handbrake on business activity’ but affirms visas are federal domain The ministers are asked if they would support the NSW government bringing in its own visa to meet the skills demand. Anthony Albanese responds: The Australian government conducts visas in this country, in terms of migration, and that hasn’t changed. We want to work with all of the state and territory governments. I will ask Brendan to make some comments on this as well. We will have the day before the jobs and skills summit, we will have a meeting of the national cabinet. I have already had constructive discussions about this, including with Dominic Perrottet, and I know that all of the state and territory governments are concerned about the skills shortages. They are a handbrake on business activity and Daniel Andrews and Dominic Perrottet both wrote to me a little while ago and that is part of the context of having the jobs and skills summit, but I might ask Brendan to come and add some comments. Engagement with jobs and skills summit ‘already a success’, PM says Anthony Albanese is taking questions. First one up asks him if he is worried that the jobs and skills summit could “fizzle out like the Rudd summit did which recommended the Henry tax review, which wasn’t a shining success”. Albanese responds: The Rudd 2020 summit was the first time anyone heard of the national disability insurance scheme. Pretty significant reform that came out of that process. Already I regard it as a success. The fact that you are all here and we are talking about jobs and skills is part of the process of what we are doing here. Making sure that people understand that there are significant skills shortages. If you look at the front page of every newspaper today, many of them are talking about skills shortages and about what is required. That is part of why we are calling the jobs and skills summit to provide that focus. ‘It is really important for employers to get the skills they are crying out for’ The minister for skills and training, Brendan O’Connor, has begun speaking: It is not a coincidence that the prime minister and this government wanted to introduce, as the first piece of legislation, the Jobs and Skills Australia. That is an independent body [to advise] the government as to what skills are in need now and what skills will be needed in the future. That will be advised and formed by employers and unions and universities in the VET sector, state and territory governments. We want to make sure we are able to invest wisely in areas where there are skills shortages. We know the skills shortages are very significant across the economy, across the labour market, and so it’s a priority of the Albanese government to invest in skills, invest in our own work force and invest in those students coming through. Along with, of course, dealing with the skilled migration pathways. It is really important for employers to get the skills they are crying out for. Anthony Albanese highlights diversity of skills needed The PM says: I wanted to come here [Cerrone Jewellers] with Brendan O’Connor, our minister for skills, employment and training, to very much emphasise that when people speak about skills, including in National Skills Week, often they will think about plumbers and apprentices, but it is about other skills that are needed as well. I have spoken often during the campaign about a future made in Australia, about ways in which we take our resources and value-add and then export to the world, as well as for domestic consumption. This is a great example of it. A business that has employed over the years hundreds of employees. A business that is well run, you can always tell because when you walk around, when people say to you, “I have worked here for 40 years and 35 years,” which is what we heard down stairs. I want to acknowledge the presence of Senator Jacobi, one of the Oceania representatives in the Italian parliament, who has joined us here as well. Albanese speaking Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has begun to speak in what is a doorstop interview at a Sydney business. He is spruiking Cerrone Jewellers in his electorate, which he says has hosted clients like Barbara Streisand and Celine Dion in Leichardt. The visit highlights the start of Jobs and Skills Week, and is part of his government’s promise of a “future made in Australia.” Ministers may administer other portfolios, footnote said Last week Guardian Australia reported a wrinkle in the claim Scott Morrison had misled parliament about his multiple ministries. After several reshuffles, Morrison presented lists of his ministry to parliament that omitted his double appointments, including one on 30 October 2020 claiming to be the “full ministry”. But, the lists contained a footnote that said: Ministers are sworn to administer the portfolio in which they are listed … and may also be sworn to administer other portfolios in which they are not listed. AAP is reporting today that Morrison’s first ministry list, dated 28 August 2018, contained the disclaimer. That is more than 18 months before Morrison got his first extra ministry (health) in March 2020. Before Morrison becoming prime minister the disclaimer was: As a general rule, there is one department in each portfolio. However, there is a Department of Human Services in the Social Services portfolio and a Department of Veterans’ Affairs in the Defence portfolio. The title of a department does not necessarily reflect the title of a minister in all cases. It is unclear if the disclaimer is related to secret multiple ministries or whether it is just more precise language to reflect administrative arrangements that ministers’ responsibilities often overlap. There were 1,587 new cases in the last reporting period, and 11 people are in intensive care. AiGroup raises concerns about Labor’s paid domestic violence leave Employers appearing before the Senate inquiry into Labor’s paid domestic violence leave bill have raised concerns that it goes further than the Fair Work Commission model. The FWC suggested that 10 days of leave should be paid to permanent employees, should accrue progressively and be paid at workers’ base rate of pay. Labor’s bill is more generous in several respects: it applies to casuals; is given as 10 days upfront; and it is paid on workers’ expected earnings if they had been available to work the shift. The Australian Industry Group’s head of national workplace relations, Brent Ferguson, told the inquiry Labor’s proposal for rates of pay was “completely unworkable” and “out of step with how other paid leave is calculated”. The bill would require employers to “speculate” about what would have occurred on a given day, and pay workers for “disadvantages of having to work” even though they weren’t available. For example, he said, reimbursement for expenses that were not actually occurred, or penalty rates for working unsociable hours of overtime or on weekends would have to be paid. Ferguson also called for a longer transition period. Inquiry into Queensland police calls for further submissions The commission of inquiry into Queensland police responses to domestic violence is calling for further submissions after police service’s commissioner Katarina Carroll’s evidence last week. This latest news comes from Guardian’s Queensland reporter Eden Gillespie. You can read more about Carroll’s evidence from Gillespie here: The prime minister Anthony Albanese is due to take the mic in Sydney shortly after 10.30am this morning. Albanese will appear with the minister for skills and training, Brendan O’Connor, in a visit to Cerrone Jewellers to highlight the start of Jobs and Skills Week, and will hold a doorstop. The media conference comes as the nation continues to await what the solicitor general has to say about the legality of Scott Morrison’s secret ministerial appointments. Solicitor general Stephen Donaghue will hand the much-anticipated legal advice to Albanese today but no updates have yet been released. ‘The people and the parliament were being held in contempt,’ Bandt says of Morrison saga Greens leader Adam Bandt spoke to ABC Breakfast News this morning about Scott Morrison’s secret ministries, continuing calls for the privileges committee to find out if he mislead parliament: Governments and ministries are not play things just for political parties. They are fundamental institutions and the public has the right to know what is going on, who the ministers are. All of the so-called explanations that are coming in from his former colleagues about who knew what when just add to the case, not only for a broader look at what is going on, but add to the case that the people and the parliament were being held in contempt. Bandt was also critical of comments made from former deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce on ABC Insiders yesterday that he hadn’t pushed back on Morrison’s actions taking on the resources portfolio because he feared the Nationals could lose the portfolio altogether.

Disability job summit as sector overhauled Social services minister Amanda Rishworth says she makes no apologies for a decision to shutter multiple disability employment providers due to poor performance, AAP reports. Before a national roundtable in Canberra later today, Rishworth said eight jobs providers would be closed, while half of the country’s 104 providers faced the prospect of being wound back. The moves come amid a wide-ranging review of the sector. Rishworth said she was confident the more than 15,000 people with a disability affected by the decision to close providers would be transitioned to more effective services. She told Sky News today: I’m not going to make any apologies for standing by and watching what has been very poor performance over a long period of time continue to provide bad service for people living with a disability. It was absolutely time to take action on this. Rishworth said it was critical the roundtable examined how barriers to people with disability finding employment could be removed: Businesses changing their mindset, changing some of their HR processes are really critical, and of course community changing their attitudes in how we support people living with a disability get a job. There are a lot of people living with a disability that want to work, but have these barriers in front of them. The decision will mean only the most effective disability employment services providers will continue to receive commonwealth funding. David Littleproud would support closing ‘loopholes’ revealed by solicitor general The Nationals leader David Littleproud has just spoken to Sky News in the lead-up to the release of the legal advice from the solicitor general regarding Scott Morrison’s secret ministerial appointments. Littleproud says he is awaiting to see what the advice is but emphasises that political leaders have a “responsibility to be custodians” of the nation’s faith in democratic institutions. He said he has had conversations with opposition leader Peter Dutton. He said he would support closing any “loopholes” revealed by the Morrison saga to “protect that inbuilt trust in our democratic institutions”. Legendary musician and Gunditjmara-Bundjalung elder Archie Roach, who died in late July, is to be farewelled through the streets of Melbourne this morning. Amos Roach, his son, took to Facebook with the following announcement: Amos and Eban Roach and family are taking Archie Roach Home. Escorted by the Southern Warriors Aboriginal Motorcycle Club, Archie Roach will journey one last time through the streets of Collingwood, Fitzroy and St Kilda. You are welcome to join along the journey and send Archie off in style. Guardian Australia’s photographer Ellen Smith is in Melbourne and we’ll bring you more photographs from that event. Australian federal police have seized the largest shipment detected in Australia of the deadly opioid fentanyl. The shipment contained more than 5m potentially lethal doses of the drug, but was stopped by a joint operation with Australian Border Force. The AFP said: More than 11kg of pure powdered fentanyl and 30kg of methamphetamine were hidden inside in an industrial wooden lathe sent from Canada that arrived at the Port of Melbourne in December, 2021. The AFP, ABF and the Department of Home Affairs have established a joint operation to identify those responsible for importing the fentanyl – due to the seriousness this criminality poses to the Australian community. Australian authorities have only ever detected illicit fentanyl importations in minor amounts - all less than 30g - with the first case in 2017. The investigation into the importation began after ABF officers inspected a container in Melbourne on 3 February, 2022. The officers detected nearly 60kg of powdered substances hidden inside military-style ammunition boxes concealed within a three tonne lathe. Industrial action delays Sydney trains There are cancellations and delays on Sydney’s west and south-west train lines as the rail union takes action, AAP reports. The Rail Tram and Bus Union is undertaking rolling stoppages throughout August and additional action was imposed today after workers refused to operate 37 trains, saying they did not meet minimum maintenance standards. The action is affecting trains on the T1, T2, and T8 lines. Sydney Trains chief executive Matt Longland says the action has put pressure on services and commuters should expect delays. He told Sydney radio 2GB: That is creating gaps and will continue to create gaps across the day, mainly in the west and south-west. RTBU NSW secretary Alex Claassens said trains that did not meet minimum maintenance standards could be affected by a range of issues “from safety all the way through to cleanliness”. The rail union and management will meet again today to try to resolve the long-running dispute over a new industrial agreement and the union’s safety concerns with the mothballed Korean-built intercity trains. Trains services will be stopped tomorrow between 10am and 4pm on the Blue Mountains and Newcastle lines, affecting stops from Newcastle to Lithgow. On Thursday Sydney’s City Circle line will be impacted, with workers refusing to run trains from 10am to 4pm. There were 2,600 new cases in the last reporting period, and 28 people are in intensive care. There were 5,013 new cases in the last reporting period, and 50 people are in intensive care. ACTU calls for national renewables strategy You’ll be hearing a lot about next week’s jobs and skills summit and there are a lot of submissions to get through, but it’s good to have a look to see where the stakeholders are taking this opportunity for roundtable discussions. The Australian Council of Trade Unions wants the government to “quickly establish” a national energy transition authority, making the point that climate and mining jobs are linked. It has released its report, Secure Jobs for a Safer Climate, laying out how 12 coal-fired power stations have closed so far in the last 10 years, with no plan for transitioning the communities that relied on those assets. ACTU president Michelle O’Neil said there was a better way, with the renewable sector capable of creating “395,000 secure and well-paid jobs and $89bn in revenue by 2040 in export industries alone”. To realise this, the report recommends that the Albanese government: Establish an independent and properly resourced national energy transition authority to manage an orderly and fair transition process for affected workers – including supports for redeployment, skills and training, and secure jobs opportunities. Develop a national renewables strategy, ensuring Australia becomes a renewable energy superpower with local industries, supply chains and good unionised jobs. Build a national disaster response capability that seeks to mitigate, prepare for, respond, and recover from extreme weather events. Take a leading role in developing climate mitigation and adaption policies and programs. Ensure that industries and households have access to reliable and affordable energy. Reach a net-zero emissions public service by 2030, with full engagement of workers. O’Neil said it was about not having to choose between climate action and jobs: Through support for skills and training, redeployment, and secure jobs in new industries we can ensure no worker or region is left behind. Climate change is already with us, with workers across all industries suffering the health impacts of extreme heat and climate-related disasters, while dealing with the rising cost of living due to crop and land degradation – there needs to be a mitigation and adaptation plan from the government. An ambitious $11bn revamp of Sydney’s Central station precinct has been unveiled, with plans for high-rise towers, a public square and parklands, AAP reports. The redevelopment at the southern end of Sydney’s CBD will be built over 20 years and cover a 24-hectare site to include office space and housing, as well as new city connections. NSW premier Dominic Perrottet revealed the plans today, saying they would utilise unused space over the rail corridor to deliver a vibrant destination and provide much-needed space for the expansion of the city centre: We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reimagine this iconic part of our CBD and transform it into a world-class precinct of shops, restaurants, office spaces, parkland and additional housing. Infrastructure minister Rob Stokes said: The masterplan celebrates the heritage of the precinct while also offering a grand new public square, three new parks, new community and social services hubs as well as at least 30% of affordable and diverse housing. Stronger crypto regulation coming Crypto will face more regulation in Australia, with the Albanese government set to open consultation on how to better help Australia’s regulatory framework deal with the crypto asset sector. The Australian Taxation Office estimates that more than 1 million taxpayers have interacted with the crypto asset ecosystem since 2018. Stephen Jones and Andrew Leigh are going to lead the charge, with the first step in the reform agenda to be prioritising “token mapping” work in 2022. (I am no expert but essentially that means mapping back the token to the digital wallet it belongs to.) Jones and Leigh say no one else in the world has done it yet, so it should be quite the ride. The pair say in a joint statement: With the increasingly widespread proliferation of crypto assets – to the extent that crypto advertisements can be seen plastered all over big sporting events – we need to make sure customers engaging with crypto are adequately informed and protected. The previous government dabbled in crypto asset regulation but prematurely jumped straight to options without first understanding what was being regulated. The Albanese Government is taking a more serious approach to work out what is in the ecosystem and what risks need to be looked at first. A public consultation paper on token mapping will be released soon. Husic defends parliamentarians deciding on grants On ABC Radio this morning both minister for industry Ed Husic and Liberal MP Bridget Archer were asked about the Grattan Institute’s report about pork barrelling. Husic was wary of taking ministerial discretion away on grants and leaving it up to the bureaucrats:\" I think parliamentarians are elected to represent both community and national interest. I don’t think we should all be tarred with a Coalition brush. Parliamentarians, they are up for the judgment of people every three years or so. And if they’ve done the wrong thing that should be done that way. I do get concerned if you just spin it all off to departmental people. With the greatest respect, the accountability is much sharper when you come to an election. Archer, who followed Husic on ABC RN, hits back at the suggestion that all parties shouldn’t be “tarred with a Coalition brush”: I don’t think it is a Coalition issue, I think it’s an issue broadly and has been for quite some time … I think there needs to be a level of confidence and accountability in the decision making. Departments – not politicians – should decide government grant recipients, Grattan Institute recommends The Grattan Institute has a very timely report out today with a plan to end pork barrelling, which calls for departments rather than ministers to make the call on who receives grants. As the authors of the report write in the Conversation: Ministers should be able to establish grant programs and define the selection criteria, but they should not be involved in choosing grant recipients. Shortlisting and selecting grant recipients is an administrative function for the relevant department or agency. Ministers should have bigger fish to fry. Danielle Grattan, an author of the report and chief executive at Grattan, was asked about whether a federal Icac would produce the same outcome, but she said it would be more effective to tackle the problem “upstream”. ‘They are talking about it’: Archer on Morrison saga Bridget Archer also rejected the argument that has been coming from certain members of the Coalition – including Barnaby Joyce on ABC Insiders yesterday – that nobody was talking about the Morrison saga: Bridget Archer has welcomed the idea of an independent review into Scott Morrison’s conduct, saying he should consider his position. Asked by ABC Radio whether the governor general and the public service should be included in this, Archer said: I don’t necessarily see any reason why not, if it is a broad examination of this issue. Asked whether she believes Morrison should resign, she says she is reluctant to call on other MPs to resign: I would ask him to reflect on that, on his role going forward. It’s forcing other colleagues to defend themselves and their own records, and I think that’s unfair. Governor general disrespected by being put on the spot, industry minister says Ed Husic has said he feels for the governor general “being put in that position”, and he believes he was “disrespected by putting him in this spot”. The talk then turns to republicanism and whether an Australian republic could have avoided the Morrison saga, as assistant minister for the republic Matt Thistlethwaite says. Husic is asked if he agrees. Husic says he supports the idea of a republic but that “in this case it’s about us and the Coalition respecting the way things should work”. Government reviewing modern manufacturing initiatives approved by Morrison Ed Husic is asked when did the review begin of the grants for the modern manufacturing initiative under Morrison’s control as industry minister (17 projects were approved before the federal election): I took that step to look at those grants … when I’d learnt a number of things as an incoming minister. Asked if all 17 projects Morrison gave the OK as industry minister would go ahead, Husic responds: We’re going through the review and we’ll make a decision … it is a very big call to take money off the table for industries and businesses that have factored that in. I’m going through it and consulting with the department and considering the advice I’m being given. My intent is to do it before the budget. Coalition prioritised political interest, Husic says Ed Husic says he does not accept “whatsoever” the explanation that the former prime minister needed to give final approval because the projects covered several ministerial portfolios: Instead of prioritising the national interest the Coaltion prioritised the political interest and they announced the bulk of these right before the election. Industry minister responds to Morrison’s decision on modern manufacturing initiative Ed Husic, the minister for industry and science, is speaking to ABC Radio. This follows the revelation that former prime minister Scott Morrison, under the industry portfolio, took control of the modern manufacturing initiative and approved 17 projects before the federal election, with more than half in Coalition seats. Asked whether Morrison’s actions in approving $828m in grants in March, with just three of the projects in a safe Labor seat, constituted pork barrelling, Husic responded: I was concerned last year when I saw Morrison had made himself the decision maker, wrote to him and his people didn’t think there was any issue. If you’re still trying to get across which ministries Morrison assumed, this article will help you: Queenslanders call for raise in age of criminal responsibility More than 25,000 Queenslanders have signed a petition calling for the state government to raise the age of criminal responsibility from 10 to 14. The petition contains 26,853 signatures and has been backed by a coalition of legal and community services. It comes after Labor voted with One Nation, Katter’s Australian party and the LNP to defeat a Greens’ bill to raise the age of criminal responsibility in parliament last week. Queensland attorney general Shannon Fentiman opposed the bill and said raising the age would be “irresponsible” ahead of a national approach that would promote “consistency” and “fairness”. Across Australia, children as young as 10 can be held in watchhouses and hauled before courts to face criminal charges. The chief executive of Queensland’s Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Service, Shane Duffy, said the government needed to examine root causes of behaviour rather than locking children up: We need more services, not sentences. How would you personally feel about your 10-year-old being locked up? PeakCare Queensland’s executive director Lindsay Wegener was a former director of Queensland youth detention centres. She said the laws were “dangerous and cruel”, putting children on a lifetime trajectory of crime. The chief executive of the Youth Advocacy Centre, Katie Acheson, said raising the age would bring Queensland into line with international human rights guidelines. Fentiman will meet with the coalition today to receive the petition. Queensland is the fourth state government to be presented with a petition, as part of the national Raise the Age campaign. The Australia Institute’s International and Security Affairs program has polling out showing that more Australians are afraid China will attack Australia than Taiwanese believe China will attack Taiwan. Two surveys were carried out this month, one in Taiwan (of 1,002 people) and one in Australia (of 1,003 people). The poll shows Australians are more skittish than Taiwanese people about the prospect of an attack by China – nearly one in 10 Australians believe an invasion will come “soon”, compared with one in 20 Taiwanese. Australians are also more pessimistic about an invasion of Taiwan compared with those who live there – one in four respondents believed China would move on Taiwan “soon”. Both groups were on the same page though when it came to the US and China working out any grievances peacefully. Allan Behm, the director of the Australia Institute’s international and security affairs program and a former senior foreign affairs, attorney general’s and defence official said the more “the anti-China lobby beats the drums of war, the more afraid of China Australians become”. The rhetoric on China and the “fearmongering” was impacting public opinion. He said: It is astonishing that Australians are more afraid of an attack from China than the Taiwanese are. The results show popular opinion is detached from geopolitical and geostrategic reality. The results support the case for a reset in the Australia-China relationship and the manner in which we hold this important national conversation. Such a reset should be based on facts and the national interest rather than the fear peddling we saw in the recent Australian federal election by some for domestic, partisan interests. Solicitor general Stephen Donaghue is set to hand down the much-anticipated legal advice regarding former prime minister Scott Morrison’s secret ministerial appointments. Prime minister Anthony Albanese will receive the advice about whether Morrison breached any rules after he secretly appointed himself to five portfolios. But before Albanese receives this advice he is also flagging a separate investigation into Morrison’s actions, telling Sky News yesterday that there was “a need for proper scrutiny of what occurred”. Liberal MP Bridget Archer has also told the ABC she believes there is need for further investigation or an inquiry. In employment news, the government has released a list of the top 10 in-demand professions over the next five years in the lead-up to the jobs and skills summit next week. The list is based on the skills priority list, data on job vacancies and projected growth in employment, and the roles include nurses, construction managers and chefs.

Here’s a summary of the main developments: Anthony Albanese has visited Australian troops in the Middle East as he travels to the Nato summit in Spain. A woman who locked herself to the steering wheel of her car and blocked the harbour tunnel is one of 11 climate protesters arrested in Sydney. The protesters were among a group of 50 to 60 activists who kicked off a week of disruption in Sydney with a march through the city centre on Monday. John Barilaro personally approached former New South Wales Labor leader Jodi McKay about a trade commissioner job in India, raising further questions about the role senior ministers in the government have played in appointing the controversial $500,000-a-year roles. Australia’s new environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, has received an enthusiastic welcome in Lisbon at the UN ocean conference after flagging five new blue carbon projects and declaring that “under the new Australian government, the environment is back – front and centre”. Meanwhile, Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions increased in 2021 as the country wound back Covid-19 lockdowns without taking significant steps to maintain a fall in carbon pollution recorded during the pandemic. The United Australia party’s new senator has accused Labor of “pumping the brakes” on the crossbench’s ability to scrutinise the government by cutting their staff, as Albanese stares down the prospect of a “Senate strike” over cuts to parliamentary staff. Australian states and territories announced at least 23 deaths from Covid-19 on Monday. The Victorian department of health says the Omicron BA.4/BA.5 subvariants are likely to become dominant variants in Victoria. These may be offshoots of an earlier Omicron strain, BA.2. An emergency biosecurity zone has been imposed to stop the movement of bees across NSW after the deadly parasite varroa mite was discovered. Thanks for tuning in, we’ll be back to do it all over again tomorrow – when the first tranche of 2021 census results are released. Have a pleasant evening. Man shot by police in Melbourne A man has been shot by police in Melbourne. Victoria police confirmed he was shot in Coburg North at 4.40pm on Monday, AAP reports. They said the man was being treated by paramedics and no one else had been injured. The shadow climate change and energy minister, Ted O’Brien, has said climate protest activity blockading streets is “unacceptable” and state governments should consider higher penalties to stamp them out. O’Brien said: If you want to get a message across you do not drive a car into police ... You do not inconvenience people. It is a disgrace the way they have been behaving today. Let’s hope the state government does what needs to be done ... and sends the fear of God into others who would carry on like anarchists. O’Brien said that “true anarchists” don’t care about policy changes on climate because “their job is to cause anarchy ... any degree of rationality won’t top it”. O’Brien said the Greens and “probably the teals” have a business model “predicated on maintaining the rage, no matter how much people try to take action on climate action” to get votes and stay in parliament. On nuclear power, O’Brien said he “hadn’t seen any evidence” that nuclear shouldn’t be considered “due to economics”. He criticised Labor for nixing nuclear due to its cost, which he said “hasn’t been proven” and argued that cost doesn’t justify a ban. He said: On the one hand we have the government calling for more gas and more coal, but Chris Bowen out there saying the solution is less of these energy sources. This crisis the country has been in is a crisis of dispatchability. The more renewables come in, the more we will need gas ... to back renewables up. It isn’t an anti-renewables debate. Renewables need partners in life. John Barilaro approached former NSW Labor leader Jodi McKay about trade role in India John Barilaro personally approached former New South Wales Labor leader Jodi McKay about a trade commissioner job in India, raising further questions about the role senior ministers in the government have played in appointing the controversial $500,000-a-year roles. Barilaro, whose recent appointment as New York trade commissioner has become embroiled in controversy, was still NSW deputy premier when he sounded out McKay last year about her interest in the India role, the Guardian understands. While McKay did not get the job – Vishwesh Padmanabhan was appointed to the role in December last year – Barilaro’s personal approach is significant because the NSW government has insisted the public service, not government ministers, were responsible for the appointments. Read the exclusive story here: Australia’s sense of order and its values of democracy must be defended, Anthony Albanese has declared. AAP have filed this report from the Camp Baird base, where the prime minister visited Australian troops serving in the Middle East ahead of his week-long European trip, which includes the Nato summit in Spain before travelling to Paris. He touched down at the Al Minhad operating base in the United Arab Emirates on Monday morning local time, where he met with defence force personnel and Australian embassy staff at Camp Baird. The base was the site where at the highest point, 2,750 Afghan evacuees were processed following the US withdrawal of Afghanistan, and the fall of Kabul to the Taliban in August last year. Speaking to about 30 troops, Albanese thanked them for their service in keeping the nation safe, and said Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was a “reminder of the unsafe world we live in”. He said: Our values of maintaining international rule of law, maintaining a sense of order in the global environment is one that can’t be taken for granted. It does have to be defended, and those of us in political life are humbled by the knowledge that it’s defended each and every day by our men and women in uniform. Albanese spoke of a group of six young Afghan women who were living together in a house in his Sydney electorate after having been settled. “They will make great Australian citizens,” he said. He praised the women for their volunteer work in packing food hampers for those in need, and said “they will be great assets to Australia”. About 50 Australian Defence Force personnel are serving at Camp Baird, which plays a “critical role” for Australia’s presence in the region, the prime minister said. Albanese then spoke with individual personnel gathered for breakfast at the mess, before taking a group photo with them. Australia’s ambassador to the UAE Heidi Venamore prepared a bacon and egg roll for the prime minister. Earlier, upon arrival at the base, Albanese and his partner Jodie Haydon laid a wreath at the memorial for Australians who had been killed while serving on Middle East operations. The sombre pair was watched on by more than a dozen Australian troops in attendance. Annastacia Palaszczuk tightens Queensland’s lobbying rules ahead of integrity report release Queensland’s premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, has moved to tighten political lobbying rules ahead of a key report being released into her own government’s integrity. Prof Peter Coaldrake is due to hand down his final report into government accountability and integrity on Tuesday. In April, his interim report found lobbying was widespread, escalating and lacked proper regulation. Coaldrake said he would consider steps to ensure the ministerial code of conduct “has teeth and is observed” in his final report. Palaszczuk on Monday pre-empted his possible recommendations and announced changes to the lobbying code of conduct. She said anyone working for a lobbying firm, except for administration staff, will be deemed a lobbyist. “That basically means anyone working for a lobbying firm will need to be registered as a lobbyist,” Palaszczuk told reporters.

(Before that, they had fallen each year since 2009, assuming you trust the data on the land sector. There are reasons not to do so, as reported here.) Anyway, just as people can buy an offset for air travel, there are some emerging offers to do the same for motorists. One of them is NRMA’s carbon offsets scheme, which allows drivers to plug in their car make and model and their estimated annual distance driven to work out how much they should offset to be carbon neutral. They calculate the payment and will direct the money raised to bush regeneration in Australia, investing in renewable energy and rainforest protection. Hummer drivers (not me) would have a lot of trees to plant, by these calculations. More typically, a medium-sized car driven 10,000km a year would produce about 1.87 tonnes of carbon. To take that out of the atmosphere you need to plant 84 trees (and presumably hope they survive fire, drought or water logging, etc). For that NRMA, reckons the offset will cost $41.05 – not a huge amount in the grand scheme of things. Fears global biodiversity talks will not settle on key targets and goals Despite positive reviews for Australia’s role in global biodiversity talks held in Nairobi last week, there is concern that the international negotiations are drifting. The final agreement is supposed to be reached at a meeting of countries in Montreal in December, but there are key targets and goals that have not been settled and it is likely another round of talks will be required before then. WWF-International issued a statement saying little progress had been made in Nairobi, with key decisions “kicked down the road” and a small number of countries, such as Brazil, “actively working to undermine the talks”. WWF-Australia’s Quinton Clements said the talks overall were lacking in political leadership and there was real concern that agreement would not be reached in Montreal. A spokesperson for the environment and water minister, Tanya Plibersek, said the new government was committed to “stepping up Australia’s global environmental leadership”. She said this was made clear at the Nairobi meeting and reflected in a strengthened negotiation position on environmental protection, including actions to address extinction risk and protect more land and sea area. “Australia’s negotiation team for the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity … will be advocating for an ambitious Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework in line with the government’s commitments for stronger action on the environment.” Albanese government changing Australia’s tone to be ‘more ambitious’ on environment You may have read that Australia’s new environment and water minister, Tanya Plibersek, has told the United Nations ocean conference in Lisbon that “the environment is back – front and centre” under the Albanese government. These aren’t the only international talks where a change in tone from Australia has been observed. The oceans conference follows a round of negotiations last week in Nairobi for a new global agreement on nature under the convention on biological diversity. The convention on biological diversity receives less attention than global climate conferences, but the current negotiations are aimed at achieving an ambitious new international agreement for protecting and restoring nature. The significance of these talks has previously been compared to the Paris climate agreement. Plibersek was not in Nairobi last week but Australia sent a delegation. Quinton Clements, WWF-Australia’s head of policy, was among observers who noted more ambitious language from the new government. He said: There’s definitely a bit of a change from the previous regime. The new minister and government have given clearer direction to the Australian delegation. They’ve been more ambitious in terms of where Australia sits.” Clements said that ambition extended to things like halting and reversing biodiversity loss and working with other countries to ensure a “nature positive” approach to wildlife and sustainable development by 2030, which in simple terms means agreeing there will be more nature by 2030 than there is currently. The Victorian department of health says the Omicron BA.4/BA.5 subvariants are likely to become dominant variants in Victoria. These may be offshoots of an earlier Omicron strain, BA.2. In a statement, the department of health said the prevalence of BA.4/BA.5 in Victorian metropolitan and regional wastewater catchments has “risen significantly in recent weeks, indicating increasing transmission of this sub-lineage in the community”. The BA.4/BA.5 sub-lineage was first identified in catchments in April and has since risen from under 5% in late May to 17% as of 23 June, the department statement said. “BA.4/BA.5 is expected to overtake the BA.2 strain in coming weeks to become the dominant strain in Victoria,” the department said. “This is in line with similar patterns in NSW and Queensland.” Both states have seen a significant rise in the number of people hospitalised with Covid-19 during June. Victoria’s department of health said the prevalence of BA.4/BA.5 in Victoria is likely to result in an increase in cases – including reinfections – and hospital admissions and deaths. This is because the strain has a greater ability than BA.2 to evade immunity provided by vaccination and earlier Covid-19 infection. There is no evidence at this stage that the BA.4/BA.5 sub-lineage causes more severe disease, but the department is closely monitoring the situation. The department statement urged people to stay up to date with vaccinations, stay home if unwell, and strongly recommended masks be worn in shared indoor settings. Tjapwurong woman withdraws legal challenge to Victorian highway after state says it will develop new plan A senior Tjapwurong (Djab Wurrung) woman who has withdrawn a legal challenge to the construction of a highway that endangered culturally significant trees in western Victoria says the court case represents a win for her community. Marjorie Thorpe said in a statement that she had withdrawn the challenge after the state government’s Major Road Projects Victoria (MRPV) agreed it would no longer rely on a 2013 cultural heritage management plan as part of its Western Highway duplication project. In October 2020, MPRV felled a tree considered a sacred directions tree, Thorpe said, and were preparing to destroy another tree and build the road close to five other significant trees, including two birthing trees. Thorpe filed an emergency supreme court application soon afterwards, and an injunction preventing further roadworks until the case was heard was granted later that year. Thorpe said that as the court case continued the state “abruptly announced that it would no longer rely on the 2013 plan to construct the road, and promised to work with the Eastern Maar Aboriginal Corporation to develop a new Cultural Heritage Management Plan”. She said this meant there was no need for the case to continue. Thorpe added: This week, in a win for my Tjapwurong community and ancestors, I discontinued the proceeding. This maintains my rights to sue if the state tries to use the old Cultural Heritage Management Plan as a basis for further construction on our lands. It also reserves my rights to review the new Cultural Heritage Management Plan once is it complete to ensure it is legal and complies with cultural heritage legislation. Thorpe thanked community members who gave evidence in her case, and her lawyers, and urged the state to better protect Aboriginal heritage. She said: Tjapwurong people have lost many of our stories about the trees as a result of colonisation and dispossession, but that makes the surviving stories of special importance. They provide a connection to our past – an important connection to the existence and history of the Tjapwurong people. It is important that we preserve that connection, including so we can pass on the stories of our ancestors and our people and the land to our children and grandchildren. I hope that this time around, the rights of our people and the remains of this precious heritage can be protected. Australia’s emissions climbed in 2021 as transport and fossil fuels wiped out gains during Covid Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions increased in 2021 as the country wound back Covid-19 lockdowns without taking significant steps to maintain a fall in carbon pollution recorded during the pandemic. National emissions rose 0.8% – 4.1m tonnes of carbon dioxide – in the final full year of the federal Coalition government, according to government data released on Monday. While pollution from electricity generation continued to drop due to an increase in renewable energy and reduction in coal power, this decrease was effectively cancelled out as emissions from transport, manufacturing and fossil fuel developments – notably the gas industry – bounced back. Emissions were also up from agriculture as the recovery from drought continued.

Giving evidence in the murder trial of Christopher Michael Dawson on Monday, The Australian’s Hedley Thomas said he had produced the 2018 podcast to help Lynette Dawson’s family seek justice for their daughter and sister who had vanished with no explanation. “And so justice for Lyn meant to you, didn’t it, the prosecution of Christopher Dawson,” asked defence barrister Pauline David. “I think that is a fair call, yes,” Thomas replied.

Catherine Birch, a senior ANZ economist, has crunched the numbers, and estimates the recent increases and those to come will contribute a “hefty” 0.6 percentage points of the 7% annual consumer inflation rate we can expect by year’s end. There’s a long list of blame for the soaring energy costs, including coal-fired power plants being subject to “unscheduled” outages. “But an underlying issue is the lack of coherent energy and climate policy in Australia for the past several years which has undermined investment in the energy sector,” Birch said. “This has left the sector more vulnerable to shocks.” But the impacts on household bills varies in part because of different packages offered by the states to help people pay bills. The cost of generation also varies a lot across different parts of Australia, depending on their energy mix. The ASX tracks future wholesale prices, and Victoria is projected to have a cheaper prices for the next few years at least (partly because their brown coal is not internationally traded). As for the future, we will get a better sense of what the Australian Energy Market Operator expects will be the necessary new investment “to keep the lights on” when it releases the 2022 Integrated System Plan this Thursday. We know from the draft plan – and last week’s release of the design of a capacity market – that a massive amount of spending is going to be needed over the next few decades. Expect some big numbers but it is also worth remembering that we would have had to spend most of it even without a decarbonising goal since all of the coal plants and some gas ones are at or approaching the end of their design lives anyway. As one energy insider said the other day: “How often do you see somebody driving a 50-year-old car?” Police vow to crack down on Sydney protesters as 11 arrested Police have accused environmental activists who staged disruptive protests in Sydney on Monday of “incredibly dangerous” behaviour and have vowed to continue tracking down all of those involved ahead of further actions planned this week. A woman who locked herself to the steering wheel of her car and blocked the harbour tunnel was one of 11 climate protesters arrested in Sydney, as Blockade Australia activists kicked off a week of disruption with a march through the city centre. On Monday afternoon, the acting assistant commissioner, Paul Dunstan, said those involved will be charged with recently introduced state government legislation to crack down on illegal protesters following several arrests of climate change activists blocking traffic and access to ports. Protesters face a maximum penalty of two years’ jail and $22,000 fines for disrupting traffic or preventing access on roads. Dunstan said police will continue going through CCTV footage to identify protesters so they can be arrested. He also said police will have an increased presence across the city in coming days in anticipation of further actions. Police will continue to be out in force in the coming days as this group continues their unlawful disruption of Sydney. They appear hell-bent on continuing this activity to disrupt the people of our city ... We need the public’s help to help us identify those involved and to help us prevent further unlawful protest activity. Dunstan said police had a “very strong deployment on the footprint of the CBD” on Monday, “however, the group this morning was highly unorganised and erratic, and they were moving throughout the CBD in an unstructured format, and it was difficult to get ahead of them”. We will be out in force and we will have additional police as a result of this morning’s activity. What I will say – the behaviour of this group was nothing short of criminal activity. The throwing of bicycles, the throwing of garbage bins, the throwing of other items in the path of police, in the path of media, in the path of innocent members of the public just walking by, will not be tolerated and cannot be by the people of NSW.

The scheme is being extended into next year as pubs and clubs continue to struggle to find workers. The hospitality minister, Kevin Anderson, said: Many who left the sector have seen their mandatory certifications lapse. We want to make it easy for those people to quickly and freely renew those certifications and remove any barriers that are preventing them from re-entering the hospitality sector. People whose certificates lapsed since February 2020 will be able to renew their certificates for free until February next year. More than 16,000 people have completed free RSA and RCG refresher courses since February this year, according to the government. ‘Alarming’ state of the environment report to be released in July Tanya Plibersek says a damning national environmental report card received by the former Coalition government last year but not released, tells an “alarming story” of decline, native species extinction and cultural heritage loss. In one of her first interviews as the new federal environment and water minister, Plibersek said the state of the environment report – a five-yearly official scientific assessment – would be released when she gave a National Press Club address on 19 July. It would help inform changes Labor planned to strengthen the country’s widely criticised national environment laws, she said. Read more: Thanks so much for hanging out with me this morning. I’m handpassing this blog over to my lovely colleague Elias Visontay now – he’ll be with you for the rest of the afternoon. See you tomorrow morning! Frank Moorhouse remembered for contribution to Copyright Agency If you’re a creator in Australia and you’ve ever received a payment from the Copyright Agency for use of your work, you have Frank Moorhouse to partly thank for that. The Copyright Agency have talked about the late writer’s legacy in a Twitter thread here: The United Australia party’s new senator has accused Labor of “pumping the brakes” on the crossbench’s ability to scrutinise the government by cutting their staff. Ralph Babet, the Victorian senator, has called on Anthony Albanese to review the decision, which the prime minister has doubled down on despite threats from minor parties of disruption in the Senate if their allocation is not increased. On Friday, Labor revealed that crossbench parliamentarians will receive just one additional adviser, down from four under the Morrison government, prompting One Nation and senators Jacqui Lambie and David Pocock to threaten to delay government bills. Babet said: Cutting independent and minor party parliamentary staff allocation by 75% will make it very difficult for us to be able to do our jobs effectively. The prime minister is essentially pumping the brakes on our ability to scrutinise the government and the legislation they may propose. We call on the prime minister to review his decision. Auction levels down after interest rate rises With Australia likely to have considerably higher interest rates by the end of the year, it’s not surprising that the most rate-sensitive parts of the economy are going to get a bit more attention, particularly real estate. Of course, record-low interest rates from November 2020 until (awkwardly for the Morrison government’s reelection hopes) May this year, helped propel property prices to record levels in many parts of the country. It makes sense that we’ll see some unwinding of those rises now the cost of borrowing is increasing. CoreLogic, a consultancy, said the past week’s auction levels were down about one-fifth in the main capitals from a year ago. But preliminary clearance rates edged slightly higher to 59.8%. This time last year, 75.4% of auctions held recorded a successful result. Sydney, the most expensive city to live in the country, did have a small uptick in clearance rates too. However, not so promising was 28.6% of scheduled auctions in the past week that were pulled – a level not seen since late April 2020, CoreLogic said. For now, investors are betting the Reserve Bank has more increases to come this year in its cash rate target (a rate that in turn directly influences what commercial banks charge households and businesses for their loans). If the market’s speculation is correct that the RBA will lift its cash rate from 0.85% to 1.5% on 5 July, the 65-basis-point move will be the largest since 1994. SA Liberal party data harvesting was ‘inadvertent’, ombudsman says Data harvested through hyperlinks in media releases and on government websites used by the previous South Australian Liberal government was muddled and of little use, the state ombudsman has ruled. Wayne Lines looked at the use of links by the Liberals that redirected web users through a domain used by political parties around the world to collect data for campaign purposes, AAP reports. Lines said it appeared the practice had been inadvertently carried over when the former government was elected in 2018 and ceased in March 2021. As well as the hyperlinks being used in media releases, employees from a range of agencies had cut and pasted them on to agency resources without understanding the potential implications. The ombudsman engaged an expert in cyber security, privacy and the protection of government data to provide advice after studying the functions of several of the hyperlinks in question. Lines said on Monday that advice found the data was effectively “muddled” and most likely could not be used in any meaningful way: In all of the circumstances, particularly noting the expert advice that it does not appear data was produced in any meaningful form, I determined, in my discretion, that it is not in the public interest to take further action in relation to the matter. Even so, the use of stateliberalleader.nationbuilder.com for the management of media distribution lists by the former government as a carryover from being in opposition is regrettable and created the perception of public information being used for party-political purposes. Lines said he had released details of his inquiries to remind all political parties of the importance of government resources not being used, or having the appearance of being used, for party-political purposes. NSW is facing a week of industrial action New South Wales is bracing for a week of industrial action with train drivers, teachers, nurses and midwives calling for better pay and staffing conditions, AAP reports. Rail commuters have been warned to expect delays with action by The Rail, Tram and Bus Union starting on Tuesday with a go-slow, with train drivers limited to 60 km/h. The action will escalate until Friday when drivers will refuse to drive foreign-built trains. The union’s NSW head, Alex Claassens, said without those trains the network would be reduced to about 30% capacity. The action is driven by safety concerns over a new fleet of Korean-built trains, which the union maintains need to be modified to keep passengers safe. The transport minister, David Elliott, said he was “open minded about the modifications so long as it doesn’t cost taxpayers unnecessarily” and “so long as it doesn’t void the warranty”. Public and Catholic school teachers across the state will strike for 24 hours on Thursday. Teachers are calling for a pay rise to keep up with rising inflation as they grapple with unsustainable workloads and worsening staff shortages. And nurses and midwives are planning to stop work for periods ranging from two hours to 24 hours on Tuesday demanding better staff to patient ratios. Hundreds are expected to participate in a union mass meeting in the Sydney CBD. Australian politicians react to Roe v Wade decision Earlier, we reported Anthony Albanese’s comments about the US supreme court’s decision to overturn the constitutional right to abortion in that country. Guardian Australia’s foreign affairs and defence correspondent, Daniel Hurst, has rounded up comments from other Australian politicians on the issue here: No deaths were recorded in the state in the past 24 hours. There are eight people in intensive care. Census data to be released on Tuesday Australians are about to get a clearer idea of how we are changing as a nation, and how the Covid pandemic changed us, when results from the 2021 census are released. On Tuesday, the Australian Bureau of Statistics will release the first tranche of data covering topics such as population flows between cities and regional areas, how Australians are housed, the languages we use, Indigenous health and education, employment and unpaid rates of work. Demographers are eagerly anticipating Tuesday’s release as a snapshot of mid-pandemic Australia. However they are cautioning that on an initial glance the results will tell two very different stories: on the night the census was taken, 10 August 2021, half the country was in lockdown while other states enjoyed some of the most relaxed rules on internal movement during the pandemic. So what can we expect? Read the full story here to find out: Protests continue on Sydney streets Some worrying birds’-eye footage of a car driving through the Blockade Australia protest in Sydney: More on the late Australian author Frank Moorhouse, from our deputy culture editor, Sian Cain: NT Health has reported 125 cases recorded in the Top End region, 48 in Central Australia, five in East Arnhem, 10 in the Big Rivers region, zero in the Barkly region and 21 are under investigation. There are currently 17 patients in hospital. There are two patients requiring oxygen and one patient is in ICU. The number of active cases in the NT is 1,565. You can see all the Covid-19 statistics for NT on their website. No deaths have been recorded in the state over the last reporting period. There are three people in intensive care. You can see all the Covid-19 statistics for Tassie on their website. Nasa has successfully launched a rocket from the Northern Territory – the first commercial space launch in Australia’s history, AAP reports. Troublesome winds caused the countdown to be aborted several times before the first of three scheduled rockets launched at about half past midnight (ACST) on Monday from the Arnhem Space Centre on the Dhupuma Plateau, near Nhulunbuy. It is the space agency’s first launch from a commercial spaceport outside the US and will help scientists study how a star’s light can influence a planet’s habitability. The rocket is carrying an X-ray quantum calorimeter, which will allow University of Michigan scientists to measure interstellar X-rays with precision and provide new data on the structure and evolution of the cosmos. About 75 Nasa personnel were in Arnhem Land for the launch, the agency’s first in Australia in 27 years. Nasa last launched from Australia in 1995, when its rockets lifted off from the Royal Australian Air Force Woomera range complex in South Australia. Nasa will launch another two rockets from the space centre on 4 and 12 July. Still cold in Tassie: Oyster and kelp farmers join calls to future-proof NSW south coast’s blue economy During the 2019 black summer bushfires, oyster farmer Kevin McAsh’s leases along the Clyde River on the New South Wales south coast were badly charred. Afterwards, floods washed debris upstream into the Batemans Bay estuaries: The elders said they’ve never seen anything like it. All the ground cover was destroyed. The soil was absolutely scorched. Now there’s nothing left to hold it. Mangroves with their feet in water were cindered. Although it will be years before the mangroves McAsh is replanting can restabilise the riverbank, he is grateful for ongoing work by scientists monitoring the water quality. Oyster leases can generate $40,000 a hectare in an industry the state government calls the most viable aquaculture sector in NSW. Yet with scientists estimating that Australia’s east coast estuaries are warming four times faster than anywhere else in the world, McAsh has joined the call to future-proof the region’s blue economy. Read the full story from Elizabeth Walton here: Why are teachers leaving Australian schools? Why does a teacher shortage occur? Gabbie Stroud, teacher and author, says it’s because our education system is operating “under a business model which treats students and parents as customers, and teachers as expendable workers expected to function as told, rather than as autonomous professionals tasked with the unique and complex responsibility of guiding young people’s learning.” Stroud spoke to numerous teachers leaving the profession amid Australia’s teacher shortage, who say their skills are “not respected or valued”, the expectations were destroying them, and the lack of trust and compounding stress made their jobs untenable. Read the full story here: The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, says the US supreme court’s decision to overturn abortion rights “is a setback for women and their right to control their own bodies and their lives”. Albanese had spoken to reporters about the decision before flying out of Australia last night. But his comments to the ABC’s AM program this morning were slightly stronger in describing the implications of the US supreme court’s decision: Well, people are entitled to their own views, but not to impose their views on women for whom this is a deeply personal decision. That is, in my view, one for an individual woman to make based upon their own circumstances, including the health implications. This decision has caused enormous distress. And it is a setback for women and their right to control their own bodies and their lives in the United States. It is a good thing that in Australia, this is not a matter for partisan political debate. Disruption is ‘essential in cutting through climate denial’, activists say More on the climate protests happening in Sydney today: AAP are reporting that about 50 masked protesters marched north down Kent Street towards the harbour after moving through the city, beginning at Elizabeth Street, between Park and Bathurst streets. Blockade Australia protests have previously shut down Port Botany, the Harbour Bridge and Spit bridge. The Transport Management Centre says the Sydney Harbour Tunnel is closed at the tunnel entrance in North Sydney, after a protester parked a car, blocking access. Blockade Australia livestreamed a video of the young woman in her car blocking the tunnel, claiming she was from the northern NSW town of Lismore, which was subject to extreme and repeated flooding earlier this year, and is still recovering. All traffic is being diverted via the Sydney Harbour Bridge and traffic is backed up for several kilometres. Blockade Australia said they would continue to cause disruptions in the days ahead: Disruption to the infrastructure of Australia’s project of exploitation is essential in cutting through the climate denial that this system survives off. Earlier this year, the NSW government arrested climate crisis activists blocking traffic and access to ports. Protesters now face a maximum penalty of two years’ jail and $22,000 fines for disrupting traffic or preventing access on roads. The roads and crimes legislation amendment bill, passed earlier this year, created new offences targeting activists who block access to major facilities including ports and railways. Albanese to have discussions about Ukraine at Nato summit The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is not speculating about what further assistance Australia may offer Ukraine – but says he will have discussions with Australia’s friends at the Nato summit in Madrid this week. He told the ABC’s AM program it was significant that Australia, South Korea, Japan and New Zealand were invited: This is an important time in international politics. We have Russia’s invasion of Ukraine; this brutal invasion is against the rule of law – it’s an attack on the sovereignty of the people of Ukraine. It’s important that democratic nations stand side by side with the government and people of Ukraine. Asked to describe the implications for Australia if President Vladimir Putin prevails in Ukraine, Albanese said: Well, the implications are not just for Australia, but for all of those who cherish democracy, who cherish the rule of law, and who cherish the rights of nations to be sovereign, are extreme. We know that there is an alliance that has been reached as well between Russia and China. There are implications for our region, given the strategic competition that is in our region, which is why this Nato summit comes at such a critical time and why I look forward to the discussions that I’ll have both in the formal proceedings at the Nato summit, but also in the bilateral meetings I’ll have with our democratic friends, including Prime Minister [Boris] Johnson, but also Justin Trudeau and other democratic leaders. Lane asked about Afghanistan – which last week suffered an earthquake that killed more than 1,000 people and left many people homeless amid a broader humanitarian crisis – and whether the government’s announcement of an extra $1m in aid was enough. Albanese replied: Well, we’ve provided support that we see as being appropriate. And we certainly feel for the people of Afghanistan who are going through this difficult time at the same time as, of course, with the change that has occurred in regimes there has caused further hardship. There were 6,862 new cases recorded in the state over the 24 hour reporting period, with 55 people in intensive care. The state has recorded 6,305 new cases in the last 24 hours. There were 26 people in intensive care and 10 on ventilators. Climate activists have blocked the harbour tunnel in Sydney among other streets in the city centre as part of a “week of resistance” against climate inaction. The activists, from group Blockade Australia, moved from Hyde Park at 8am this morning across the CBD towards the harbour and have reportedly blocked multiple roads. Last week, activists from the group said they wanted to “blockade the streets of Australia’s most important political and economic centre and cause disruption that cannot be ignored”. The NSW parliament passed controversial anti-protest laws in April widely understood as intended to stymie climate protest. Seven Blockade Australia activists were charged a week ago after an extraordinary incident in the Colo Valley involving undercover police officers. Albanese responds to crossbench backlash Returning to that interview with the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, on the ABC’s AM program: ABC’s Sabra Lane asked him about criticism of the cuts to crossbenchers’ staff allocations. Asked whether the move was dismissive and arrogant, Albanese said: Well, what is not fair is the idea that Zali Steggall’s electorate should have double the representation in terms of staff of electorates in the same region. And the fact is that the eight staff that were allocated to the crossbench is more than senior frontbenchers had in opposition. Up until 2017 the crossbenchers had one additional staffer for House of Representatives staff members. This is something that was increased to three in 2017 and then was further increased in 2019 at the same time as there were changes in the composition of the parliament with some defections from the Liberal party. Despite the current backlash, Albanese sought to emphasise his interest in constructive relationship with the crossbench: I’ve had discussions with crossbenchers. I’ve rung all of them after the election and I have rung everyone back who wanted to discuss these issues. There are some misconceptions there. The Australian literary community is paying tribute to the writer Frank Moorhouse, who died on Sunday, aged 83. His publisher at Penguin Random House, Meredith Curnow, said in a statement to Nine Newspapers: Renowned for his use of the discontinuous narrative in works such as The Americans, Baby and Forty-Seventeen, Frank Moorhouse has been an active participant in Australian literature for nearly 50 years. The Edith Trilogy, made up of the astounding novels Grand Days, Dark Palace and Cold Light have not only brought immense pleasure to so many readers, but have also affected the career paths of many women. I feel so privileged to have worked with Frank on Cold Light. One of the reasons I will forever adore Frank Moorhouse is his generosity toward new writers and people working in publishing. He loved to sit and learn from younger people and to share his immense wisdom and incredible stories. We will all miss him very much. Frogs that lay eggs on land – new WA genus named after teacher whose lab was a campervan Four frog species in Western Australia that lay their eggs on land have been identified as a new genus and named after a retired high school music teacher-turned-scientist. Researchers have classified the frogs into the distinct biological group Anstisia. Their tadpoles develop entirely on land and never contact the water of a creek or pond before becoming adults. Instead, they swim around in a jelly-like pool created by laid eggs and are nourished by yolk reserves. The genus has been named in honour of Marion Anstis, who worked as a high school teacher for 31 years before cataloguing virtually all known frog species on the Australian continent. Grant Webster at the University of New England, one of two scientists who classified the genus, said Anstisia was the first frog genus in Australia to be named after a person: It does happen a lot in plants – like Banksia, for example, after [Joseph] Banks. Usually, a frog scientist of such prestige and contribution will get a frog [species] named after them eventually. [Marion Anstis] never had anything named after her. Read the full story about this remarkable woman (and the frogs!) here: Anthony Albanese commented this morning about the parliamentary staff cuts for crossbench MPs. He told ABC radio: They’re not totally on their own … They have access to the parliamentary library that we will be increasing support for, they have access to clerks that draft legislation in addition to personal staff … At the same time as [the Morrison government] were cutting Centrelink staff, people can’t get passports, visas can’t get processed, the only area of public service that saw an increase in staffing levels appears to have been parliamentary staff. He said there had been “misconceptions” about the job of electoral office staff, who often did parliamentary work. Also speaking on ABC RN, independent ACT senator David Pocock accused the prime minister of making the decision to gain political advantage: Cutting back on our small teams creates an unfair playing field which disadvantages our communities and our capacity to actually advocate on their behalf. It could be incredibly hard to actually be across legislation and if I don’t understand things it’s going to be very hard to actually vote on them. … I want to be constructive, to represent a community I love. I’m certainly not going to just vote against things to make a point, that’s not how I do things. Victoria: it’s cold! It’s getting colder! It’s not warm in NSW either: Australian Muslim group lodges complaint against Twitter for failing to remove ‘hateful’ content An advocacy group for Australian Muslims has lodged a complaint against Twitter with the Queensland Human Rights Commission, accusing the site of failing to take action against accounts that incite hatred on the platform. The Australian Muslim Advocacy Network (Aman) argues that, as a publisher, Twitter is responsible for content posted by a far-right account that has been cited in the manifesto of the extremist who killed 77 people in Norway in 2011. The network says despite multiple requests, Twitter has refused to delete the account and replies to its posts that “vilify” Muslim. The network has accused Twitter under Queensland’s Anti-Discrimination Act of inciting hatred as a publisher of third-party accounts, as well as discrimination for refusing to take action against hateful content. Its complaint also says Twitter has engaged in indirect discrimination by failing to apply Australian standards to content on its platform. Read the full story here: An emergency biosecurity zone has been imposed to stop the movement of bees across NSW after the parasite varroa mite was discovered for the first time in Australia, AAP reports. Agriculture minister Dugald Saunders issued the order on Sunday, saying no bees will be allowed to be moved across NSW: Australia is the only major honey-producing country free from varroa mite, the most serious pest to honey bees worldwide. The tiny reddish-brown parasites have the potential to devastate an industry that’s worth $70m annually by spreading viruses that cripple bees’ ability to fly, gather food and pollinate crops. Varroa mite was detected at the Port of Newcastle on Friday by the state Department of Primary Industries, which is now investigating potentially contaminated hives outside an initial 50km biosecurity zone. A property near Trangie in central western NSW will be inspected and containment and control activities will be carried out on Monday after hives near the Port of Newcastle were recently sent there. Saunders said: If varroa mite settles in the state, it will have severe consequences, so we’re taking every precaution and action needed to contain the parasite and protect the local honey industry and pollination. We’re working with apiary industry bodies and stakeholders to ensure beekeepers are well informed and can continue to help us with this critical response. The 50km biosecurity zone in place around the Port of Newcastle means beekeepers within the area must notify the department of the locations of their hives. A 25km surveillance zone is active around the site and officials are monitoring and inspecting managed and feral honey bees. A 10km emergency zone around the port remains in place, with hives in that area to be eradicated. Melbourne startup raises $9m for mental wellness game based on tending houseplants A Melbourne games startup has raised $9m in funding while developing a mobile game aimed at mental wellness that doesn’t try to keep you on for hours a day, in what is said to be the largest venture capital seed investment for a game studio founded by women in Australia. Lumi Interactive has been developing Kinder World since 2020. The premise of a mobile game of houseplant maintenance within a community focused on mental wellbeing was conceived during the six pandemic lockdowns in Melbourne between 2020 and 2021. Co-founder Lauren Clinnick said during the lockdowns, random acts of kindness made the world a better place. Read the full story: A little bit of background on that: under the previous Coalition government, crossbench MPs and senators were allowed to have two advisers and two assistant advisers. Crossbench MPs and senators have now been told they can only have one senior adviser, alongside their four electoral office staff. Monique Ryan, the teal independent who knocked Josh Frydenberg out of Kooyong, said over the weekend: After coming to power, Prime Minister Albanese stated that he wanted to work cooperatively with crossbench MPs to ensure they were able to contribute fully to the parliament’s deliberations and operations. It’s disappointing that his first act towards the crossbench is utterly at odds with that statement. Labor’s Katy Gallagher defends crossbench staffing cuts Finance minister Katy Gallagher has just been speaking on ABC RN about the parliamentary staffing cut: The prime minister isn’t trying to put anyone offside … Boosting the parliamentary library is a fairer way to deal with this resource allocation. We’re open to constructive discussion with the crossbench … but we also need to be sustainable. RN Breakfast host Patricia Karvelas puts it to her that they are in a very different situation to the major parties, which have significantly more collective resources, and “the machinery of government” behind them. Gallagher says increasing resources to the parliamentary library is a “fairer” way of doing it. We are having ongoing and constructive engagement with [the crossbenchers] and we will continue that. People of Australia have voted for this parliament, it’s up to this parliament to make that work ... Everyone is taking a hit here because we’re trying to make it fairer and more sustainable across the parliament. Good morning folks, welcome to yet another Monday. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is on his way to Europe today, arriving in Madrid this afternoon for the Nato summit, which will focus on talks about the war in Ukraine and further sanctions on Russia. Albanese will be joined by leaders from New Zealand, South Korea and Japan among others. He’s expected to meet with UK PM Boris Johnson and US president Joe Biden during the trip. Albanese said prior to departure that he was still taking “security advice” on whether it was safe to visit Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Kyiv. Back at home, independent members of the new federal parliament, Monique Ryan, David Pocock, Zali Steggall and Jacqui Lambie have criticised Albanese’s decision to cut the number of parliamentary staff crossbench MPs and senators can hire from four to one senior adviser, alongside their four electoral office staff, saying it will hamper their ability to properly scrutinise legislation. Victorian premier Daniel Andrews’ new cabinet will be sworn in today after the Labor government was forced into a swift cabinet reshuffle five months out from the November state election. Deputy premier James Merlino, health minister Martin Foley, jobs minister Martin Pakula and police minister Lisa Neville all stepped down from cabinet on Friday, along with retiring planning minister Richard Wynne, prompting the reshuffle. Andrews’ new frontbench was revealed on Saturday, with Jacinta Allan crowned deputy premier. Sonya Kilkenny, Lizzie Blandthorn, Steve Dimopoulos, Harriet Shing and Colin Brooks will be sworn in at Government House on today. And the movement of bees across NSW has been banned under an emergency order to stop the spread of the varroa mite, after an infestation was detected at the Port of Newcastle on Friday. The mite can be devastating for hives and crops. I’ll be with you until lunchtime today.

Kingsgate Bay (between the two) is a little less accessible – there is no car park and no toilets – and consequently much quieter. A short walk at low tide from Botany Bay through a chalk seacliff arch is all it takes to shake off the crowds. There’s nothing much to do on arrival except settle with a picnic, go for a swim in the shallow, sheltered sea, or peer into a rockpool. Which, of course, is plenty.

Haverigg Beach, Duddon estuary, Cumbria The Cumbrian coastline is often forgotten as visitors pile inland, into more-familiar Lake District destinations. This means that the Duddon estuary, with its 30-mile shoreline comprising sand, saltmarsh, dunes and mudflats, has plenty of room for roaming in solitude. The gently sloping shingle beach at Haverigg, at the mouth of the estuary, expands into a seemingly never-ending sandy stretch, fringed by dunes with views of distant Lake District fells. A walk along the old sea wall passes a lagoon – once an iron ore mine now Hodbarrow RSPB nature reserve – and a restored lighthouse. Where to stay Cockleshell Cottage is on Haverigg harbour and the Cumbrian Way and has views of the estuary. Sleeps 4, from £665 a week. Bossington Beach, Porlock Bay, Somerset This huge shingle arc stretches between the Bristol Channel and the farmland and hills of Exmoor and offers masses of mind-clearing space. Start your visit in the hamlet of Bossington, gawp at the pretty cob and thatched cottages, and leave the car at the National Trust car park (the beach is part of its Holnicote Estate). The beach is on the South West Coast Path and there are walks to the rocky promontory of Hurlston Point and around wildlife-rich Porlock Marsh, passing chunky concrete remains of second world war pillboxes on the way. Where to stay Exmoor Owl and Hawk Centre in Allerford, near Minehead, has three rooms in its farmhouse. Doubles from £90 B&amp;B, singles from £70. Porthledden Cove, Kenidjack valley, Cornwall Leave the car at the National Trust car park at Cape Cornwall, and head off along the South West Coast Path to the less-visited Porthledden Cove at the end of Kenidjack valley. Brush past scented gorse and scrubby heather beside the stream that once powered 50 tin mining waterwheels, to the sheltered beach. There, find masonry relics of Cornwall’s industrial past slumbering beside sculptural, multicoloured boulders and a small shingle beach. An abundance of rock pools, hollowed from chunks of granite by the sea, is revealed at low tide. Where to stay Boslow Cottage in St Just has sea views from the garden. Sleeps 6. From £724 a week. Limited availability in July and September. The Commercial Inn is a comfortable hotel in the market square at St Just. Doubles from £89 B&amp;B, plenty of availability – opening 6 July. Steephill Cove, Isle of Wight Although the beach fills up with sandcastle-building families at peak periods, its lack of vehicular access means that Steephill Cove remains off the more obvious tourist trails. Approach it by parking in Ventnor’s Botanic Gardens, then wander past towering echium and tropical planting to the coastal path. A steep descent pitches you out onto the sandy beach where it’s all about beach huts, deckchair hire and pretty holiday cottages converted from a former lighthouse, a boat house and fishermen’s cottages. Some fishing boats still sail to catch lobster and crab served up in pasties from shoreside cafes. Where to stay In a barn conversion at Bank End Farm near Ventnor, seven nights from £555 per week (sleeps 2) to £2,137 (sleeps 8), limited availability. Try cottages at Steephill Cove, various prices and room sizes, but booking up quickly. Dunwich Beach, Suffolk Along the coast from Southwold lies the sand-and-shingle beach at Dunwich. With Sizewell B nuclear power station constantly in view and mist rolling in frequently from the sea, it is moodier than its neighbour and attracts fewer visitors. Its history also has an air of melancholy – ramped up by tales of the drowned port of Dunwich, swept away by a storm surge in 1286. Crumbling cliffs speak of the still-constant threat of coastal erosion. The heath backing the beach is the place to see rare bird species, some of which have flown over from the neighbouring RSPB reserve at Minsmere. Where to stay The Eels Foot Inn, Eastbridge, a pub with six rooms. Doubles from £110 B&amp;B. Spurn Point, near Hull, East Yorkshire For an otherworldly, away-from-it-all day out, try this whip-thin tidal island stretching out into the North Sea. The three-mile walk to its extremity can be challenging when the wind rattles in across Humber estuary. Yet the trek over the shingle and sand to the lighthouse as the sea pounds on either side, is worth it – not just for a sense of achievement but for the chance to spot migratory birds and find a fossil or two. The Discovery Centre at the start is run by the Yorkshire Wildlife Trust, which manages Spurn. Where to stay Driftwood Caravan Site in Kilnsea, at the base of Spurn Point, has an area for small tents. Caravans and campervans £15 including hook-up; tents £10-£15. Horden Beach, County Durham The Durham coast can sometimes get passed over in favour of beaches in North Yorkshire and Northumberland. There used to be a good reason: its beaches were black with coal-mining waste. When the mines closed, however, a regeneration scheme, together with the motion of the sea, cleaned up the coast. Now there are plenty of reasons to visit the peaceful, sandy beaches, wildlife-rich cliff tops and wildflower-sprinkled denes (valleys). These days the only evidence of Horden beach’s mining past is the multicoloured stones stained umber and yellow by iron oxide. Where to stay No 16 offers boutique, room-only accommodation in Seaham, right at the start of the Durham Coastal Footpath. Two nights in a double is £140-£160. Ross Back Sands, Bamburgh, Northumberland The vastness of this sandy beach, and the fact it can only be reached on foot, means it is blissfully unpopulated. Plenty of room to let a dog have a good run, stride out purposefully and gulp lungfuls of sea air. The 1.5-mile path to the shore goes through fields and past farm buildings until it reaches the massive dune system that fringes the beach. In front of you are miles of sand, the nippy North Sea, the possibility of seals lounging on sand banks and, on either side, the dramatic outlines of Bamburgh Castle and Holy Island. Where to stay In a Wigwam (a wooden tent with mini-kitchen and fire pit) at Springhill Farm near Seahouses. Sleeps 4, £25pp pn, reopens 6 July. Church Ope Cove, Isle of Portland, Dorset At the end of Chesil Beach, the tidal island of Portland is much less visited than the postcard-familiar sites along the Jurassic Coast. Church Ope Cove, on its eastern side, is one of the rocky outcrop’s few beaches. At the bottom of a long flight of concrete steps and tucked between three cliffs, is a sheltered, safe and secluded place to swim and snorkel. This is a shingle beach; debris from the quarrying of Portland Stone, now rounded into pebbles by the tide, has replaced the sand. Where to stay The Old Boathouse has views over Portland Bill from a hot tub with sea views. Sleeps 4, £1,299 for week starting 18 July. All the accommodation listed was available to book at the time of going to press; demand for July and August is currently very high • Clare Gogerty is the author of The National Trust Book of the Coast and Beyond the Footpath: Mindful Adventures for Modern Pilgrims"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"uk-news/2019/aug/13/hinkley-point-c-rising-costs-long-delays-power-station","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2019-08-13T15:40:40Z","webTitle":"Hinkley Point C: rising costs and long delays at vast new power station","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/aug/13/hinkley-point-c-rising-costs-long-delays-power-station","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2019/aug/13/hinkley-point-c-rising-costs-long-delays-power-station","fields":{"headline":"Hinkley Point C: rising costs and long delays at vast new power station","bodyText":"The Hinkley Point nuclear site, on the Somerset coast, should have begun powering around 6m homes well over a year ago. Instead, the 160-hectare (400-acre) sprawl is still the UK’s largest construction site more than a decade after the plan for Britain’s nuclear renaissance first emerged. It will be at least another six years before Hinkley Point C, the first nuclear plant to be built in the UK since 1995, begins generating 7% of the nation’s electricity. The price tag is expected to exceed £20bn, almost double that suggested in 2008 by EDF Energy, which is spearheading the project alongside a Chinese project partner. At the time, EDF Energy’s chief executive, Vincent de Rivaz, said the mega-project would power millions of homes by late 2017. He pegged the cost at £45 for every megawatt-hour. De Rivaz retired a decade later, but the promised switch-on moment remains distant. Delays have been blamed on protracted Whitehall wrangling over the project’s eye-watering costs: the price per megawatt-hour has since more than doubled. Still, this summer workers carried out the UK’s largest concrete pour to complete the base of the first reactor. Simone Rossi, EDF Energy’s incumbent chief, said the milestone was “good news for anyone concerned about the climate change crisis”. “Its reliable, low-carbon power will be essential for a future with no unabated coal and gas and a large expansion of renewable power,” he said. The cost concerns have proved more difficult for executives and ministers to address. The National Audit Office condemned the government’s deal to support the Hinkley Point project through consumer energy bills in a damning report, which accused ministers of putting households on the hook for a “risky and expensive” project with “uncertain strategic and economic benefits”. Hinkley Point will add between £10 and £15 a year to the average energy bill for 35 years, making it one of the most expensive energy projects undertaken. Under EDF Energy’s contract with the government, the French state-backed energy giant will earn at least £92.50 for every megawatt-hour produced at Hinkley Point for 35 years by charging households an extra levy on top of the market price for power. The average electricity price on the UK’s wholesale electricity market was between £55 and £65 per megawatt-hour last year. The dramatic collapse in the cost of wind, solar and battery technologies has made nuclear power even harder to swallow. Despite its detractors, Hinkley Point has soldiered on because concerns over the project’s costs, although considerable, are still smaller than the concerns over the UK’s future energy supplies. The project was first mooted under Tony Blair’s Labour government as an answer to the UK’s looming energy supply gap after years of underinvestment in the UK’s fleet of power plants. The nuclear mantle was taken up in the coalition years by the Liberal Democrat energy secretary Ed Davey, before it was given the green light by the Conservative government. Andrew Stephenson, the minister in charge of nuclear, said Hinkley was “key to meeting our ambitious target of net zero emissions by 2050”. Nuclear power is controversial among environmentalists, many of whom do not consider the uranium-fuelled energy to be a sustainable option. But according to the government’s official climate advisers new nuclear reactors are needed. The Committee on Climate Change expects renewable energy to play a major role filling the gap in energy supplies. Offshore wind will increase tenfold to help meet its 2050 target to reduce emissions to net zero, and the climate watchdog has called for onshore wind and solar to play a far larger role too. But the advisers predict that at least two new nuclear reactors, in addition to Hinkley Point, will be required to help the UK meet its climate goals. The verdict means households are likely to be called on to stump up for EDF Energy’s follow-on project at the Sizewell site in Suffolk. It also leaves the door open for a resurrection of plans to build reactors in north Wales, and possibly a Chinese-led nuclear project in Bradwell in Essex too. Hinkley in numbers • 9,000 cubic metres – the largest pour of concrete ever in the UK took place at the Hinkley Point site to complete the base of the first reactor. That’s the volume of almost four Olympic swimming pools. • 250 metres – maximum height of the world’s biggest crane, assembled on site after being delivered by 280 trucks. • 5,000 tonnes – weight of the Welsh steel used to reinforce the base of the first reactor. • 430 acres – site area, equivalent to about 250 football pitches. • 30% – the nuclear industry is aiming to reduce the cost of new projects by almost a third by 2030."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2019/nov/28/the-simpsons-the-five-greatest-episodes-in-the-iconic-shows-history","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2019-11-28T16:24:01Z","webTitle":"The Simpsons: the five greatest episodes in the iconic show's history","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/nov/28/the-simpsons-the-five-greatest-episodes-in-the-iconic-shows-history","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2019/nov/28/the-simpsons-the-five-greatest-episodes-in-the-iconic-shows-history","fields":{"headline":"The Simpsons: the five greatest episodes in the iconic show's history","bodyText":"With composer Danny Elfman suggesting that The Simpsons could be about to end, here is our pick of the five greatest episodes in the show’s 30-year run. Treehouse of Horror (season two) All the Halloween specials have their moments, but the original and best is the first Treehouse of Horror episode. You have to admire the freshness of the format from a show still finding its feet, complete with Marge’s concerned content warning in front of red theatre curtains. The story features the Homer-centric reworking of Edgar Allan Poe’s The Raven, and the Amityville Horror/Poltergeist parody of Bad Dream House. Then there is the genius of Hungry Are the Damned, which introduces long-running alien pair Kang and Kodos and one of the best book title reveal gags of all time. The ultimate Simpsons scarefest. Marge v the Monorail (season four) “I’ve sold monorails to Brockway, Ogdenville, and North Haverbrook, and, by gum, it put them on the map!” Lyle Lanley, voiced by Phil Hartman, is the perfect con-man for Springfield, as he foists on them the disastrous and unnecessary monorail, playing on their desire for oneupmanship over neighbouring Shelbyville. Homer gets a chance to be properly heroic and save the day. Plus Leonard Nimoy enigmatically cameos, and it gifts us all The Monorail Song, a call-and-response Gilbert and Sullivan-style number that showed a creative team at their absolute peak. Lisa the Iconoclast (season seven) Lisa is set to ruin the town’s bicentennial celebration when she discovers that founder Jebediah Springfield was actually a bloodthirsty pirate called Hans Sprungfeld. But she has a change of heart when she sees how the celebrations are bringing everyone together. This episode also features a cameo from the ghost of George Washington, in the kind of meta-touch that epitomised The Simpsons at its height. On the face of it, a silly story set in Springfield. But when you think deeper, a morality tale emerges about how the whole nation portrays the founding fathers and earliest presidents. And it gave the world the Springfield motto: “A noble spirit embiggens the smallest man.” A perfectly cromulent motto indeed. 22 Short Films About Springfield (season seven) Sure, there are plenty of other full-length regular episodes you could put into a top five, but 22 Short Films About Springfield gleefully explores one of the things that made the show so great for so long – its supporting cast of instantly identifiable minor characters, all with their own foibles and catchphrases. In this episode, characters like Smithers, Dr Nick, Moe, Skinner, Chief Wiggum and even Bumblebee Man get 60 seconds or so to shine. Homer’s Enemy (season eight) Hard-done-by Frank Grimes gets a job at the nuclear power plant, realises Homer is a dangerous lazy idiot, and sets about trying to unmask him for the fool he is. His every plot backfires, heaping yet more adulation on Homer. Grimes’ descent into jealous insanity at the end of the episode is darkly hilarious, as he outlines all the ways that Homer is immortal, and channels the deeply held aggression we surely all share for that one Homer in our workplace. Exquisitely played. What do you think? Which episodes would you have included? And would you have featured anything from the last few years? Is The Simpsons’ time up?

We will be closing this liveblog but opening a new page in the link below. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has warned his country “does not have time to wait” while pushing for an oil embargo on Russia in his latest national address. “Oil is one of the two sources of Russian self-confidence, their sense of impunity,” he said. Zelenskiy said his country is ready for a tough battle with Russian forces amassing in the east of the country. “This will be a hard battle; we believe in this fight and our victory. We are ready to simultaneously fight and look for diplomatic ways to put an end to this war.” The British prime minister, Boris Johnson, pledged a major new infusion of British arms and financial aid during a surprise trip to Kyiv on Saturday. Johnson said the UK and its partners and allies will provide support so that “Ukraine will never be invaded again”. The UK confirmed it will send 120 armoured vehicles and new anti-ship missile systems. Johnson praised Zelenskiy’s “resolute leadership and the invincible heroism”. “Putin’s monstrous aims are being thwarted,” Johnson said. The reputations of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and his government have been “permanently polluted” by war crimes against civilians in Ukraine, he added. Russia’s withdrawal from northern Ukraine has left evidence of “disproportionate targeting” of civilians, mass graves, the use of hostages as human shields, according to the latest British intelligence report. The report also claimed Russian forces continue to use improvised explosive devices (IEDs) to inflict casualties, lower Ukrainian morale and restrict freedom of movement. The Ukrainian military said its soldiers thwarted eight Russian attacks in the territory of Donetsk and Luhansk regions, according to its latest operational report as of 6am this morning. Five people have been killed in east Ukraine shelling, according to the Donetsk governor. Four were reported killed in the city of Vugledar, and one in the town of Novomikhaylovka. Towns and villages surrounding Kyiv have been left reeling after Russia’s failed campaign to seize the capital. In the town of Borodianka, north-west of Kyiv, rescue teams are sorting through the rubble of houses destroyed in Russian bombardments, looking for those missing. Ukraine carried out a prisoner exchange with Russia on Saturday, the third such swap since the start of the war, with 12 soldiers confirmed to be coming home, the Ukrainian deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, wrote online. A total of 4,553 people were evacuated from Ukrainian cities through humanitarian corridors on Saturday, fewer than the 6,665 who escaped on Friday, Vereshchuk said. Ten humanitarian corridors to evacuate people from embattled areas across the country had been agreed on Saturday. The European Commission is pledging €1bn to support Ukraine and countries receiving refugees fleeing the war following Russia’s invasion, said the commission’s president, Ursula von der Leyen. The Czech Republic has delivered tanks, multiple-rocket launchers, howitzers and infantry fighting vehicles to Ukraine among military shipments that have reached hundreds of millions of dollars and will continue, two Czech defence sources told Reuters. The Austrian chancellor, Karl Nehammer, met Zelenskiy earlier on Saturday, following a visit to the city of Bucha to the north-west of Kyiv, where mass civilian graves and street killings by Russian forces were discovered last week. Russia has reorganised the command of its battle operations in Ukraine, installing a new general with extensive experience in Russian operations in Syria, according to western officials. The commander of Russia’s southern military district, Gen Alexander Dvornikov, now leads the invasion. “It speaks to a Russian acknowledgement that it is going extremely badly and they need to do something differently,” an official told CNN while a seperate source told the BBC: “We would expect the overall command and control to improve.” Ukraine has banned all imports from Russia, one of its key trading partners before the war with annual imports valued at about $6 billion, and called on other countries to follow suit. Ukraine’s minister for economic development and trade, Yulia Svyrydenko, made the announcement in a statement on Saturday. Nato is working on plans for a permanent military presence on its border in an effort to battle future Russian aggression, The Telegraph is reporting, citing Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg. Protesters staged a self-described “die-in” outside Downing St in London on Saturday, holding ‘babies’ and signs covered in fake blood in protest against the massacre in the town of Bucha. A similar protest took place outside the White House in Washington D.C. The Ukrainian military has just published its latest operational report as of 6am this morning. Officials claim Russian forces are attempting to break through the Ukrainian defences in Izum in Kharkiv, east Ukraine, by relocating additional units to the area while also attempting to establish full control over the city of Mariupol. A partial blockade of Kharkiv and shelling of the city continues, Ukraine’s general staff of the armed forces said. The “constant arrival of wounded [Russian] soldiers” is putting strain on medical staff and overwhelming medical supplies, the report added. In the absence of a stable supply of spare parts and units, Russian troops are forced to “work around the clock” to restore and repair equipment, officials claimed. In the Luhansk region, the measures of Russian-occupation administrations on forced mobilisation of the population in temporarily occupied territories are being strengthened. According to the report, in the territory of Donetsk and Luhansk regions, Ukrainian soldiers thwarted eight Russian attacks, destroyed four tanks, eight units of armoured vehicles and 13 air targets including three aircraft, one helicopter, five UAVs and four winged missiles. Finland is preparing for a potentially historic decision “before midsummer” on whether to apply to join Nato as a deterrent against Russian aggression. The Nordic nation of 5.5 million has traditionally been militarily non-aligned, in part to avoid provoking its eastern neighbour, with which it shares a 1,300km (830 mile) border. But Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has seen public support for joining Nato double from 30 to 60%, according to a series of polls. “Never underestimate the capacity of Finns to take rapid decisions when the world changes,” former Finnish prime minister Alexander Stubb told AFP. Himself a long-time Nato advocate, Stubb now believes Finland making a membership application is “a foregone conclusion” as Finns re-evaluate their relationship with their neighbour. Next week a government-commissioned national security review will be delivered to parliament, the Eduskunta, to help Finnish MPs make up their own minds, before it is put to a vote. “We will have very careful discussions but not taking any more time than we have to,” Prime Minister Sanna Marin told a news conference on Friday. “I think we will end the discussion before midsummer,” she added. “My guess is that the application will be filed sometime during the month of May” in time for the June Nato summit in Madrid, Stubb said. When a single ceramic cockerel, sitting atop a kitchen cabinet, survived a bombardment of Borodianka, it became a symbol of Ukrainian resistance. So when Boris Johsnon and Volodymyr Zelenskiy were given one each as a gift as they walked through Kyiv, it carried an added significance. As both leaders stroll through the eerily empty streets of the Ukrainian capital, surrounded by armed soldiers, a woman approaches and gives them the two ceramic jugs in the shape of the cockerel. “I’m from London,” Johnson says, to which the woman responds with a smile. “I know, I’m from Kharkiv.” The ceramic rooster was first designed by the famous Ukrainian artist and sculptor Prokop Bidasiuk, who worked at the local majolica factory and created many dishes, vases, toys and other ceramic products. Bidasiuk, who was born in 1895, has had his work displayed at the National Museum of Folk Applied Arts. When photos emerged of one of his ceramic cockerels surviving the bombardment of Borodianka, it was adopted as a reflection of Ukrainian resilience, quickly becoming a meme online. Here is a little more information on what we know about Putin’s appointment of a new general to direct his war effort in Ukraine. Army Gen. Alexander Dvornikov, commander of Russia’s Southern Military District, has been named theatre commander of Russia’s military campaign in Ukraine, according to CNN who cited a US official and a European official. It speaks to a Russian acknowledgement that it is going extremely badly and they need to do something differently,” the European official said. A new assault is now expected to focus on the Donbas region, instead of multiple fronts. Dvornikov, 60, was the first commander of Russia’s military operations in Syria, after Putin sent troops there in September 2015 to back the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. During Dvornikov’s command in Syria from September 2015 to June 2016, Russian aircraft backed the Assad regime and its allies as they laid siege to rebel-held eastern Aleppo, bombarding densely populated neighbourhoods and causing major civilian casualties. The city fell to Syrian government forces in December 2016. Russian forces have used a similarly heavy-handed approach in parts of Ukraine, striking residential buildings in major cities and demolishing much of the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol. “We will see how effective that proves to be,” the European official said. “The Russian doctrine, the Russian tactics remain pretty much as they’ve been since Afghanistan.” “They do things in the same old way,” the official added. Former UK ambassador to Russia, Sir Roderic Lyne, told Sky News on Saturday Moscow has appointed a new general with a “pretty savage track record in Syria to try to at least gain some territory in Donetsk that Putin could present as a victory.” In case you missed Boris Johnson’s earlier address during a surprise trip to Kyiv, the British prime minister hailed the leadership of Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy and signalled that the UK is ready to continue intensifying sanctions on Russia “week by week”. Johnson said that “we will provide support so that Ukraine will never be invaded again”. It is unclear yet if Johnson meant specifically the UK or Britain and its European and Nato allies. Protesters staged a self-described “die-in” outside Downing St in London on Saturday. Demonstrators held ‘babies’ and signs covered in fake blood in protest against the massacre in the town of Bucha and atrocities reportedly committed by Russian forces in Ukraine. A similar protest took place outside the White House in Washington D.C where protesters lay on the ground as they re-enacted the murder of civilians in Bucha. Ukraine has banned all imports from Russia, one of its key trading partners before the war with annual imports valued at about $6 billion, and called on other countries to follow suit. “Today we officially announced a complete termination of trade in goods with the aggressor state,” Ukraine’s minister for economic development and trade, Yulia Svyrydenko, said in a statement on Saturday. From now on, no Russian Federation’s products will be able to be imported into the territory of our state. The enemy’s budget will not receive these funds, which will reduce its potential to finance the war. Such a step of Ukraine can serve as an example for our Western partners and stimulate them to strengthen sanctions against Russia, including the implementation of the energy embargo and isolation of all Russian banks.” Since the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, exchange of goods and services between the two neighbouring countries has been virtually non-existent, but Saturday’s move makes the termination of imports a law. We have some more detail from Zelenskiy’s earlier late-night address. The Ukrainian president urged for “more painful restrictions” on Russia’s cash flow, primarily upon oil and gas. First of all this applies to the oil business. The democratic world can definitely give up Russian oil and make it toxic to all other states. Oil is one of the two sources of Russian self-confidence, their sense of impunity.” Zelenskiy also pushed for gas sanction, saying over time this “will also be shut down”. “It’s just inevitable. Not only for safety, but also for environmental reasons,” he added. Towns and villages surrounding Kyiv have been left reeling after Russia’s failed campaign to seize the capital. The Russian retreat has revealed scores of civilian deaths and devastation inflicted upon homes, apartment buildings and civilian infrastructure. Images from Borodianka, about 50km north-west of Kyiv, reveal the extent of the destruction. Nato is working on plans for a permanent military presence on its border in an effort to battle future Russian aggression, The Telegraph is reporting, citing Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg. Nato was “in the midst of a very fundamental transformation” that will reflect “the long-term consequences” of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s actions, Stoltenberg said in an interview with the newspaper. “What we see now is a new reality, a new normal for European security. Therefore, we have now asked our military commanders to provide options for what we call a reset, a longer-term adaptation of Nato,” it cited Stoltenberg as saying. Stoltenberg, who recently said he would extend his term as head of the alliance by a year, also said in the interview that decisions on the reset would be made at a Nato summit to be held in Madrid in June. It is 4am on Sunday in Ukraine as the country prepares for a feared escalation in attacks in the east and evacuations continue. During a surprise visit to the capital on Saturday, Britain’s prime minister Boris Johnson pledged more military and economic assistance for Ukraine. Here’s where things stand: Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said his country is ready for a tough battle with Russian forces amassing in the east of the country. “This will be a hard battle, we believe in this fight and our victory. We are ready to simultaneously fight and look for diplomatic ways to put an end to this war,” he said. Zelenskiy said Ukraine “does not have time to wait” while pushing for an oil embargo on Russia in his latest national address. He also said he is committed to pressing for peace despite Russian attacks on civilians that have stunned the world, and renewed his plea for countries to send more weapons ahead of an expected surge in fighting in the country’s east, in an interview with the Associated Press. British prime minister Boris Johnson pledged a major new infusion of British arms and financial aid during a surprise trip to Kyiv on Saturday. Johnson said the UK and its partners and allies will provide support so that “Ukraine will never be invaded again”. The UK confirmed it will send 120 armoured vehicles and new anti-ship missile systems. Johnson praised Zelenskiy’s “resolute leadership and the invincible heroism”. “Putin’s monstrous aims are being thwarted,” he said.

Five people have been killed in east Ukraine shelling, according to the Donetsk governor. Four were reported killed in the city of Vugledar, and one in the town of Novomikhaylovka. In the town of Borodianka, north-west of Kyiv, rescue teams are sorting through the rubble of houses destroyed in Russian bombardments, looking for those missing. Heavy Russian bombardment has razed residential buildings and Ukrainian authorities are attempting search, clear-up and, hopefully, some rescue activities. Ukraine carried out a prisoner exchange with Russia on Saturday, the third such swap since the start of the war, with 12 soldiers confirmed to be coming home, Ukrainian deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said in an online post. A total of 4,553 people were evacuated from Ukrainian cities through humanitarian corridors on Saturday, fewer than the 6,665 who escaped on Friday, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said. Ten humanitarian corridors to evacuate people from embattled areas across the country had been agreed on Saturday. The European Commission is pledging 1bn euros to support Ukraine and countries receiving refugees fleeing the war following Russia’s invasion, Ursula von der Leyen said.

The commander of Russia’s southern military district, Gen Alexander Dvornikov, now leads the invasion, the source told the BBC, adding: “We would expect the overall command and control to improve.” Here is another look at British prime minister Boris Johnson’s surprise trip to Kyiv on Saturday. Video footage showed Johnson and Zelenskiy walking through the centre of the Ukrainian capital and talking to ordinary Kyivans. “This is what democracy looks like. This is what courage looks like. This is what true friendship between peoples and between nations looks like,” the Ukrainian defence ministry said alongside a clip of the pair. A total of 4,553 people were evacuated from Ukrainian cities through humanitarian corridors on Saturday, fewer than the 6,665 who escaped on Friday, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister has said. Iryna Vereshchuk made the announcement in an update on her official Telegram late on Saturday. From Mariupol and Berdyansk, 3,425 people traveled to Zaporizhia by car or bus, she said. Of the evacuees, 192 were residents from Mariupol and 3,233 were residents of cities of the Zaporizhia region. Another 529 residents of Melitopol were also successfully evacuated. Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi said he is “deeply disappointed and saddened” by the behaviour of his old friend Russian President Vladimir Putin over the Ukraine invasion. “I cannot and I do not want to hide that I am deeply disappointed by the behaviour of Vladimir Putin,” Berlusconi told a public meeting in Rome. “I’ve known him about twenty years ago and he always seemed to me to be a democrat and a man of peace,” the 85-year-old billionaire continued. Berlusconi, who served as head of the Italian government three times between 1994 and 2011, had previously refrained from publicly criticising Putin. When he was in power, Berlusconi maintained friendly personal ties with the Russian president, going so far as to invite him on vacation to his luxurious villa in Sardinia. “Faced with the horror of the massacres of civilians in Bucha and other places, real war crimes, Russia can not deny its responsibilities,” he said Saturday. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has delivered another signature national address, noting that his country “does not have time to wait” while pushing for a oil embargo on Russia. Ukraine does not have time to wait. Freedom does not have time to wait. When tyranny launches aggression against everything that keeps peace in Europe, action must be taken immediately. It is necessary to act in a principled fashion. And the oil embargo should be the first step. At the level of all democracies, the whole civilised world. Then Russia will feel it. Then it will be an argument for them - to seek peace, to stop pointless violence.” Mexican president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has said Mexico does not accept the Russian invasion of Ukraine in a video message released to coincide with a global event in support of Ukrainian victims of the conflict. We do not accept Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, because we have suffered from invasions,” said Lopez Obrador, referencing the Spanish, French, and American invasions of the Latin American nation. We are in favour of a peaceful solution to the conflict.” Lopez Obrador has tried to remain neutral in the conflict and has declined to impose sanctions against Russia. While his government backed a United Nations vote urging Russia to withdraw its forces from Ukraine, Mexico abstained in a vote on Thursday at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) on suspending Russia from the UN’s human rights body. Russia’s withdrawal from northern Ukrainian has left evidence of “disproportionate targeting” of civilians, mass graves, the use of hostages as human shields, according to the latest British intelligence report. The report, released just before 10pm GMT, reads: Russia’s departure from northern Ukraine leaves evidence of the disproportionate targeting of non-combatants including the presence of mass graves, the fatal use of hostages as human shields, and mining of civilian infrastructure. Russian forces continue to use IEDs to inflict casualties, lower morale, and restrict Ukrainian freedom of movement. Russian forces also continue to attack infrastructure targets with a high risk of collateral harm to civilians, including a nitrate acid tank at Rubizhne.” An earlier report claimed Russian forces continue to use improvised explosive devices (IEDs) to inflict casualties, lower morale, and restrict Ukrainian freedom of movement. The Czech Republic has delivered tanks, multiple rocket launchers, howitzers and infantry fighting vehicles to Ukraine among military shipments that have reached hundreds of millions of dollars and will continue, two Czech defence sources told Reuters. The Czech Republic has spare equipment that Ukrainian forces are familiar with in storage as well as a defence industry focused on upgrades and trade in such weapons. It has been among the most active EU nations in backing Ukraine. Defence sources confirmed to Reuters a shipment of five T-72 tanks and five BVP-1, or BMP-1, infantry fighting vehicles seen on rail cars in photographs on Twitter and video footage this week, but those were not the first shipments of heavy equipment. A senior defence official said: For several weeks, we have been supplying heavy ground equipment - I am saying it generally but by definition it is clear that this includes tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, howitzers and multiple rocket launchers. What has gone from the Czech Republic is in the hundreds of millions of dollars.” The sources declined to discuss numbers of weapons supplied. The senior defence official said the Czech Republic were also supplying a range of anti-aircraft weaponry. Independent defence analyst Lukas Visingr said short-range air-defence systems Strela-10, or SA-13 Gopher in Nato terminology, have been spotted on a train apparently bound for Ukraine, in line with a report in Czech weekly respekt.cz. It’s just after 2am on Sunday in Kyiv, Ukraine. Evacuations are taking place from eastern Ukraine ahead of a feared escalation in attacks there by invading Russian forces. And Britain’s prime minister Boris Johnson pledged more military and economic assistance for Ukraine, during a surprise visit on Saturday. This global blog on the crisis is now handing from the Guardian’s teams in the US and the UK to Australia, where my colleague Samantha Lock will take you through the next few hours. Here’s where things stand: Ukraine is ready for a tough battle with Russian forces amassing in the east of the country. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said: “This will be a hard battle, we believe in this fight and our victory. We are ready to simultaneously fight and look for diplomatic ways to put an end to this war.” Four people have been reported killed in the city of Vugledar, and one in the town of Novomikhaylovka, two east Ukrainian cities, as a result of Russian shelling, Donetsk governor Pavlo Kyrylenko posted on Telegram. The Ukrainian government has issued video clips of president Volodymyr Zelenskiy and British prime minister Boris Johnson walking together through the damp streets of Kyiv, where they waved to and met some of the few residents out and about. Zelenskiy tweeted thanks to the EU and Canadian leaders for supporting the global pledging event for Ukrainian refugees called Stand Up for Ukraine, which raised just over €10bn (£8.4bn). Zelenskiy said he is committed to pressing for peace despite Russian attacks on civilians that have stunned the world, and he renewed his plea for countries to send more weapons ahead of an expected surge in fighting in the country’s east, in an AP interview. Boris Johnson said on his visit to Kyiv that the reputations of Vladimir Putin and his government have been “permanently polluted” by war crimes against civilians in Ukraine. Johnson pledged that the UK and its partners and allies will provide support so that “Ukraine will never be invaded again”. The current war is still raging, obviously, and far from over. He spoke at a joint press conference with Zelenskiy. We are following developments in the Borodianka area, just north-west of Kyiv, where heavy Russian bombardment has razed residential buildings and Ukrainian authorities are attempting search, clear-up and, hopefully, some rescue activities. Ukraine carried out a prisoner exchange with Russia on Saturday, the third such swap since the start of the war, and 12 soldiers are coming home, Ukrainian deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said in an online post. Boris Johnson hails Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s leadership and Ukrainian courage in ensuring so far that, despite abominable destruction and the slaughter of civilians, Russian president Vladimir “Putin’s monstrous aims are being thwarted.” Johnson agreed that the UK will send another 120 armoured vehicles and new anti-ship missile systems to support Ukraine. Austrian chancellor, Karl Nehammer also met Volodymyr Zelenskiy earlier on Saturday, following a visit to the city of Bucha to the north west of Kyiv, where mass civilian graves and street killings by Russian forces were discovered last week. Ukraine is ready for a tough battle with Russian forces amassing in the east of the country, president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Saturday, Reuters reports - also with a few more words from Britain’s Boris Johnson on his visit to Kyiv. British prime minister Boris Johnson offered fresh financial and military support during the surprise visit. At a meeting in Kyiv, after reportedly travelling over land to reach the Ukrainian capital, Johnson told Zelenskiy that Britain would provide armoured vehicles and anti-ship missile systems, along with additional support for World Bank loans. Britain will also continue to ratchet up its sanctions on Russia and move away from using Russian hydrocarbons, he said. The support aims to ensure that: Ukraine can never be bullied again, never will be blackmailed again, never will be threatened in the same way again,” Johnson said. And appearing earlier in the day with Austrian chancellor Karl Nehammer, also in Kyiv, Zelenskiy warned in a news conference that while the threat to the capital had receded, it was rising in the east. This will be a hard battle, we believe in this fight and our victory. We are ready to simultaneously fight and look for diplomatic ways to put an end to this war.” Ukranian negotiator Mykhailo Podolyak said Zelenskiy and Russian president Vladimir Putin would not meet until after the country defeated Russia in the east, which would bolster its negotiating position. We are paying a very high price. But Russia must get rid of its imperial illusions,” he said, according to the Interfax Ukraine news agency. Air-raid sirens sounded in cities across eastern Ukraine, which has become the focus of Russian military action after the withdrawal from around Kyiv. Ukrainian officials have urged civilians in the east to flee. Five killed in east Ukraine shelling, according to the Donetsk governor. Russian shelling killed five civilians and wounded five others in two east Ukrainian cities on Saturday, the local governor said, according to AFP. Today, five people were killed after Russian shelling in the region of Donetsk,” Donetsk governor Pavlo Kyrylenko posted on Telegram. Four of them died in the city of Vugledar, and one in the town of Novomikhaylovka, he added. The fighting has become increasingly fierce in the region, where authorities have urged residents to evacuate before a feared Russian offensive. On Saturday, the Ukrainian army announced on Facebook that it had “destroyed four tanks, eight armoured vehicles and seven enemy vehicles”, as well as “a plane, a helicopter” and drones. Further north, in the Kharkiv region, “at least two people were killed in Slatyne as a result of a [Russian] shelling and another injured,” the mayor of the neighbouring municipality of Dergachi, Vyacheslav Zadorenko, wrote on Facebook. In the spirit of open journalism to which the Guardian is committed, we sometimes bring you snippets from normally-rival outlets, simply to keep our readers better informed across the huge area of Ukraine affected by the war, and in addition to the news-gathering, witness reports and analysis our own reporters - and those of the news agencies to which we subscribe - are putting in on the ground. Here’s some reporting from the New York Times on Saturday, out of Dnipro, Ukraine. The US newspaper writes: Svitlana Kyrychenko, 47, boarded a bus from Kramatorsk on Saturday morning with only a few days’ clothes, fleeing the eastern city where she had lived her whole life the day after a missile strike on its rail station left dozens dead and many more injured. After an hours-long ride to the central Ukrainian city of Dnipro, she was waiting with her modest luggage at the city’s central train station and looking for a place to stay, along with her 18-year-old daughter, mother and aunt. The station, a transit hub for people heading west, was filled with exhausted families carrying what they could, many with pets in tow. “I brought nothing with me. I only brought my documents and clothes to change into for a few days,” Kyrychenko said. Kyrychenko said she had already decided to leave before the strike. She had heard warnings on the news in the days before that the next Russian offensive would envelop Kramatorsk. The Russian troops are coming, so we are leaving to save our lives. We were not going to leave, because we thought the war wouldn’t affect our city.” Kramatorsk has been a key military hub for Ukrainian troops since 2014, when Russia-backed separatists seized territory in the Donbas, a region roughly the size of [the state of ] New Hampshire. As signs have grown that Moscow is shifting its military focus east, officials have been urging residents of the city and region to get out quickly. A former medical worker, Kyrychenko heard in detail from her colleagues about the strike that killed at least 52 civilians. “It was terrible,” she said through tears, recalling descriptions of a nightmarish scene and dozens of people with horrendous injuries. Officials are warning of a long and grinding offensive in the east, but she was still hoping that she would be back in Kramatorsk soon. “I think it’ll be over in a week,” she added. “I really hope so.” Marina, a woman from Sloviansk, a city north of Kramatorsk believed to be a major target of Russian forces, had recently evacuated to Dnipro with her children. She was waiting for a bus that would take her to the western Ukrainian city of Lviv. It’s mentally difficult there,” she said of her hometown. “I haven’t slept in two days.” That dispatch is by the New York Times’s Thomas Gibbons-Neff. He tweeted this on Friday. The Ukrainian government has tweeted some clips of president Volodymyr Zelenskiy and British prime minister Boris Johnson walking together through the damp streets of Kyiv on Saturday. It’s now just into the first minutes of Sunday in Kyiv. The two leaders waved to the few and far between citizens out on the damp streets of the sprawling Ukrainian capital, following the withdrawal of Russian forces that had been closing in on the city but appeared to get bogged down and stall in the face of local military resistance, boosted by western defensive weapon supplies. One Kyiv resident appears thrilled to see the leaders and has his hand on his heart as he thanks Johnson for British support. At least one US reporter, CNN’s Jim Sciutto, is asking how Joe Biden or Antony Blinken are feeling now that Johnson, Austria’s Nehammer and European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen have visited Kyiv and met with Zelenskiy in person in the last 48 hours. Biden and Blinken were in Poland late last month but, despite the US president hinting that he was up for visiting Zelenskiy, neither of them went to Kyiv, which was still being menaced by advancing Russian tanks and troops. But you can imagine some grinding of teeth in frustration in Washington over the timing of all this. Johnson and Zelenskiy walked through Kyiv’s main Kreshchatyk street to the Maidan square, where a 2014 revolution overthrew a pro-Moscow government, when hostilities with neighbouring Russia began, Agence France-Presse reports. AFP also has a snippet of the exchange between Johnson and an unnamed member of the public. We need you,” the man said, to which Johnson replied: “Nice to meet you. We are privileged to help. You have a remarkable president, Mr Zelenskiy.” A global pledging event for Ukrainian refugees called Stand Up for Ukraine has raised just over €10bn (£8.4bn), European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said in Warsaw on Saturday. The outpouring has prompted fresh thanks from Volodymyr Zelenskiy. The Ukrainian president also spoke to Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau on Saturday and has thanked him for support via Stand Up for Ukraine, run by the Global Citizen international anti-poverty organisation. Zelenskiy has been on the phone to Trudeau and also posted on Twitter. “The ‘Stand Up For Ukraine’ campaign has raised €9.1bn for people fleeing bombs, inside and outside Ukraine, with an additional billion pledged by EBRD (the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development),” von der Leyen said, AFP reports. The event, convened by the EU and Trudeau, was to raise money for internally displaced people in Ukraine and refugees from the war-ravaged country, organisers said. More than 4.4 million refugees have fled Ukraine since the Russian invasion began on 24 February. Most of them have headed to EU countries including neighbouring Poland, which has taken in more than 2.5 million refugees so far. The event, partnered by the Global Citizen movement battling poverty, comprised a social media rally on Friday and a pledging conference on Saturday. Artists including Elton John, Alanis Morissette, Billie Eilish, Annie Lennox and Chris Rock joined the campaign alongside global leaders pledging for their countries. “We are devastated to see the suffering of people in Ukraine as this conflict unfolds,” Elton John said on Facebook. He tweeted, too. In more from Borodianka, not far from Kyiv, diggers are sorting through the rubble of houses destroyed in Russian bombardments, looking for those missing, Agence France-Presse reports. Her eyes red from tears and lack of sleep, Antonina Kaletnyk watched as a digger picked through the remains of the building where her son used to live on the third floor. The slow process was unbearable for the 65-year-old mother, whose own home was spared by the fighting. A hole gaped in the middle of the five-storey building, where it was hit by a bomb dropped from a Russian plane on the evening of 1 March, a few days after the start of the invasion. In a few seconds, the 10 apartments that used to stand here were turned into a heap of concrete and twisted metal. There were people in this building, it was night ... The people who stayed in the two blocks on the sides of the building were hurt but they’re still alive. Those that stayed [in the middle section], they’re all dead. Maybe he is still there,” she said. Wearing a brown coat and a blue woollen hat, Kaletnyk sat alone on a chair in the corner of what used to be the building’s garden. She held a cane in front of her in both hands and rested her head on top, a sad, thoughtful look on her face as she watched the diggers do their work. She had not heard from her son, Yuri, 43, since the night the bomb fell. Maybe he managed to get out, maybe he is hurt, maybe he is still there [under the rubble]. I can’t say, I don’t know,” she said, before bursting into tears. Scattered in the ruins of the building there was a pair of shoes, a book, a water pistol, some cushions, clothes and three stuffed animals – a bear, a giraffe and a hippo – all next to each other. A mattress was caught in the branches of a tree. The main road in Borodianka is now nothing more than a nearly 2km-long strip of ruin and devastation. The town, which numbered around 13,000 inhabitants before the war, was retaken by Ukrainian forces at the end of March after the withdrawal of Russian troops from the region around Kyiv. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has warned what emerges is likely to be worse than Bucha, where invading Russians have been accused of committing executions and rapes: They have started sorting through the ruins in Borodyanka. It is much more horrific there.” Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy gave an interview to the Associated Press news agency in his heavily-fortified office in the capital, Kyiv, on Saturday, the day the leader also sat down with British prime minister Boris Johnson and Austrian chancellor Karl Nehammer. After talking initially about his hope of finding a diplomatic solution with Russia after its invasion of Ukraine, Zelenskiy turned his attention to questions about the supply of western weaponry for Ukraine’s defence in the face of the onslaught from Moscow. Zelenskiy displayed a palpable sense of resignation and frustration when asked whether the supplies of weapons and other equipment his country had received from the US and other Western countries was enough to turn the tide of the war, AP reported. Not yet, of course it’s not enough,” he said, switching to English for emphasis. Still, he noted that there had been increased support from Europe and said deliveries of US weapons had been accelerating. Just this week, neighboring Slovakia, an EU member, donated its Soviet-era S-300 air defense system to Ukraine in response to Zelenskiy’s appeal to help “close the skies” to Russian warplanes and missiles. Some of that support has come after visits from European leaders. Nehammer said he expected more EU sanctions against Russia even as he defended Austria’s opposition so far to cutting off deliveries of Russian natural gas. The US, EU and UK responded to the images from Bucha of slaughtered civilians with more sanctions, though the EU has only banned Russia coal so far, not oil and natural gas, on which it relies. Johnson’s office said the prime minister and Zelenskiy discussed Britain’s “long-term support” for Ukraine. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen presented Ukraine’s leader on Friday with a questionnaire marking the first step for applying for EU membership. In an in-person interview with AP, the wire service reported that Zelenskiy had turned introspective when asked what impact the pace of arms deliveries had for his people and whether more lives could have been saved if the help had come sooner. “Very often we look for answers in someone else, but I often look for answers in myself. Did we do enough to get them?” he said of the weapons. Did we do enough for these leaders to believe in us? Did we do enough?” He paused and shook his head. “Are we the best for this place and this time? Who knows? I don’t know. You question yourself,” he said. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he is committed to pressing for peace despite Russian attacks on civilians that have stunned the world, and he renewed his plea for countries to send more weapons ahead of an expected surge in fighting in the country’s east. As Boris Johnson met with Zelenskiy on Saturday in a surprise visit to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, The Associated Press was granted a sit-down interview with Zelenskiy. We have the highlights here, from AP journalists Adam Schreck and Mstyslav Chernov, but we’ve taken the liberty of including hyper-links to Guardian articles for context. Zelenskiy made the comments in an interview with AP a day after at least 52 people were killed in a strike on a train station in the eastern city of Kramatorsk, and as evidence of civilian killings came to light after Russian troops failed to seize the capital where he has hunkered down, Kyiv. No one wants to negotiate with a person or people who tortured this nation. It’s all understandable. And as a man, as a father, I understand this very well [but] we don’t want to lose opportunities, if we have them, for a diplomatic solution,” Zelenskiy said. Wearing the olive drab that has marked his transformation into a wartime leader, he looked visibly exhausted yet animated by a drive to persevere. He spoke to the AP inside the presidential office complex, where windows and hallways are protected by towers of sandbags and heavily armed soldiers. “We have to fight, but fight for life. You can’t fight for dust when there is nothing and no people. That’s why it is important to stop this war,” he said. Zelenskiy said he is confident Ukrainians would accept peace despite the horrors they have witnessed in the more than six-week-long war. Despite hopes for peace, Zelenskyy acknowledged that he must be “realistic” about the prospects for a swift resolution given that negotiations have so far been limited to low-level talks that do not include Russian president Vladimir Putin. We’ll have more of this interview in the next post, as Zelenskiy addresses military aid from NATO and EU countries - and has some surprising answers. Johnson earlier in the day spoke about supplying Ukraine with more weapons, though he used the word “defensive”, when Zelenskiy has been pleading for heavier weaponry for, essentially, counter-offensive measures, including fighter jets from the west to allow more Ukrainian pilots to take to the skies and shoot down Russian aircraft - which western allies have ultimately declined to provide. And here’s some more on Boris Johnson saying that the reputations of Vladimir Putin and his government have been “permanently polluted” by war crimes against civilians in Ukraine. “What Putin has done in places like Bucha and Irpin is war crimes that have permanently polluted his reputation and the reputation of his government,” the British prime minister said of the Russian president, Agence France-Presse reports. Johnson spoke of perceived miscalculations by Moscow and heaped praise on Ukrainians. The Russians believed Ukraine could be engulfed in a matter of days and that Kyiv would falls in hours to their armies. How wrong they were.” He said the Ukrainians have “shown the courage of a lion.” Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy concluded his talks with Johnson during the British PM’s surprise visit to Kyiv on Saturday by calling on other western democratic countries to follow the UK’s example with supplies of weaponry after Britain announced on Friday and Saturday more anti-tank, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles for Ukraine and more armoured vehicles and armed drones “to support Ukraine in this crucial phase while Russia’s illegal assault continues.” Boris Johnson pledges that UK and partners will provide support so that “Ukraine will never be invaded again.” He also said that the discovery of civilian bodies in Ukrainian towns has “permanently polluted” Russian president Vladimir Putin’s reputation. Here is more from the exchange that we’ve been flagging between Johnson and Volodymyr Zelenskiy as they addressed the media after the British prime minister made an unannounced visit to the Ukrainian president in the embattled capital of Kyiv. Zelenskiy said, according to the official interpreter: “Our most sincere friend, a friend to Ukraine, the leader of United Kingdom and the ally to our country, I’m very grateful, Boris, for this visit, it’s very important at this difficult and terrible time for our country. The other western democratic countries should follow the example of the UK. “It’s time to impose a complete embargo on Russian energy resources; they should increase the amount of weapons being supplied. The people of Ukraine value the support of the UK on our paths to peace.” Johnson said: “I want to begin, Volodymyr, by saluting, once again, the bravery of the people of Ukraine in defying the appalling aggression that we have seen. “In the last few weeks the world has found new heroes, and those heroes are the people of Ukraine.” Johnson and Zelenskiy were standing at a small podium each against a backdrop of alternating British and Ukrainian flags. Johnson made a ratcheting action, saying: “Together with our partners, we are going to ratchet up the economic pressure and we will continue to intensify, week by week, the sanctions on Russia.” He went on: “Not just freezing assets in banks and sanctioning oligarchs but moving away from using Russian hydrocarbons, and we will give you the support that you need.” This is clearly a subjective take from Johnson on what Zelenskiy needs, given that the Ukrainian leader has been asking for much heavier weaponry from the west to use in repelling Russia in counter-offensive mode, not just defensive, as Ukraine’s larger neighbour continues to advance in many areas even while withdrawing from around Kyiv. Johnson continued, appearing to choose his words carefully: “The economic support but also, of course, the defensive military support, in which I’m proud to say that the UK helped to lead the way.” He then refers to the Greek philosopher, Heraclitus. “To come to your central point, Volodymyr, I think we are evolving, now, a vision for the future. Heraclitus, I think, said ‘war is the father of all things’... that was an exaggeration, war is not the father of everything, but what this war is certainly producing is a clarity about the vision of a future for Ukraine where, together with friends and partners, we, the UK and others, supply the equipment, the technology, the know-how, the [security] intelligence so that Ukraine will never be invaded again.” There are more reports filtering out from the areas around Borodianka of the destruction invading Russian forces rendered in settlements about 90km (55 miles) to the north-west of Ukrainian capital Kyiv. There’s no English translation on this video clip tweeted out by Belarusian Telegram channel Nexta, but the images and tone are instructive and the journalist concerned, Denis Kazansky, talks about the heavy munitions used to bomb residential buildings. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has warned of atrocities in the area that could be as bad or worse as those that emerged in Bucha after the Russians were driven out. Kira Rudik, the leader of the liberal, pro-European Ukrainian party Golos, is scathing of western efforts to stop Russian president Vladimir Putin from perpetrating his war. Ukraine carried out a prisoner exchange with Russia on Saturday, the third such swap since the start of the war, and 12 soldiers are coming home, Ukrainian deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said in an online post, Reuters reports. Vereshchuk also said that as part of the deal, 14 civilians were returning to Ukraine. She did not say how many Russians had been released. Ukraine has been citing further evidence from some Russian prisoners of war that Russia has committed war crimes by deliberately targeting civilians since Moscow’s invasion of its southern neighbor. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy told US TV channel CBS’s 60 Minutes show on Friday that: There are recordings of prisoners of war who admitted killing people... [and] there are pilots in prison who had maps with civilian targets to bomb. There are also investigations being conducted based on the remains of the dead,” he said in a translation provided by CBS. Boris Johnson hails Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s leadership and Ukrainian courage in ensuring so far that, despite abominable destruction and the slaughter of civilians, Russian president Vladimir “Putin’s monstrous aims are being thwarted.” The British prime minister is speaking in Kyiv. He vowed UK armoured vehicles and anti-ship missiles for Ukraine as he acclaimed its military for “the greatest feat of arms of the 21st century”, Agence France-Presse reports. “It is because of President Zelenskiy’s resolute leadership and the invincible heroism and courage of the Ukrainian people that Putin’s monstrous aims are being thwarted,” he said after meeting Zelenskiy on an unannounced visit to the Ukrainian capital, according to a Downing Street statement. Johnson set out extra military aid of 120 armoured vehicles and new anti-ship missile systems, “to support Ukraine in this crucial phase while Russia’s illegal assault continues”, the statement said. That is on top of UK aid announced Friday of additional Starstreak anti-aircraft missiles and another 800 anti-tank missiles, along with “loitering” drones for “precision strikes” against the Russians. As world powers held a fundraising round for Ukraine, Johnson also promised an extra $500 million via the World Bank. Johnson said it had been a “privilege” to meet Zelensky in person on his surprise visit. “Ukraine has defied the odds and pushed back Russian forces from the gates of Kyiv, achieving the greatest feat of arms of the 21st century. I made clear today that the United Kingdom stands unwaveringly with them in this ongoing fight, and we are in it for the long run.” British prime minister Boris Johnson has made further pledges on his surprise visit to Kyiv to meet Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Johnson signalled that the UK is ready to continue to intensify sanctions on warmonger Russia “week by week” and that Britain will strive to move away from Russian hydrocarbons - ie coal, gas and oil. He has also indicated that we - and it’s unclear yet if Johnson means specifically the UK or Britain and its European and NATO allies - “will provide support so that Ukraine will never be invaded again”. That’s a very front-footed statement, it’s not every day a political leader will venture to use the word “never” in the context of international security and conflict. Together with our partners, we are going to ratchet up the economic pressure and we will continue to intensify, week by week, the sanctions on Russia,” Johnson said in comments to the media moments ago, standing alongside Zelenskiy. We’ll have more details for you very shortly. The Prime Minister has agreed that the UK will send 120 armoured vehicles and new anti-ship missile systems to support Ukraine following talks between Boris Johnson and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Kyiv on Saturday. It is because of President (Volodymyr) Zelenskiy’s resolute leadership and the invincible heroism and courage of the Ukrainian people that (Vladimir) Putin’s monstrous aims are being thwarted,” Boris Johnson said via a statement from Downing Street. Anti-tank and anti-aircraft weaponry, as well as so-called “suicide drones”, are also among the equipment the UK has pledged to provide Ukraine in the £10o financial and military aid package announced by the PM on Friday. That’s it from me, Jenn Selby, today. My colleague, Joanna Walters, will be taking over now. Boris Johnson is not the only world leader to hold talks in Kyiv today. Austrian chancellor, Karl Nehammer, also met Volodymyr Zelenskiy earlier following a visit to the city of Bucha to the north west of Kyiv, where mass civilian graves were discovered last week. After the meeting, Zelenskiy said that despite the atrocities, he was “ready for negotiations” with Russia and “looking for any way to stop this war”. However, he added: “Sadly, in parallel we see the preparations for important battles, some people say decisive ones, in the east.” The Prime Minister has tweeted a photograph of himself shaking hands with Ukrainian president Zelenskiy following their meeting at the embassy in Kyiv. “We’re setting out a new package of financial and military aid which is a testament of our commitment to his country’s struggle against Russia’s barbaric campaign,” he said. More pictures have emerged of Boris Johnson’s surprise one-on-one meeting with Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Kyiv. The pair can be seen shaking hands in front of a yellow and blue Ukrainian flag, as well as perusing the grounds of the Ukrainian embassy to the UK. The Prime Minister travelled to Ukraine as a “show of support” for people of the war-torn country. The leaders discussed the UK’s long term support to Ukraine, and outlined the new £100m British package of financial and military aid to the country, a Downing Street spokesperson said. Anti-tank and anti-aircraft weaponry, as well as so-called “suicide drones”, which loiter over the battlefield before attacking their target, are among the equipment the UK has pledged to provide. US intelligence officials claim Vladimir Putin may use the Biden administration’s support for Ukraine as a pretext to order a new campaign to interfere in American politics. Intelligence agencies have not found any evidence that the Russian president authorised measures like the ones Russia is believed to have undertaken in the 2016 and 2020 elections in support of Donald Trump. However, officials believe he may see the US backing of the Ukrainian resistance effort as a direct affront, giving him further incentive to target another US election. Read the story in full here. It is just past 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand now: The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has described a missile strike on a railway station in eastern Ukraine as a Russian war crime and called for a “firm global response”. At least 50 people, including five children, were killed in the missile strike on Kramatorsk train station. The US believes Russia used a short range ballistic missile on the train station. Russia has denied responsibility. The UK prime minister held a one-to-one meeting with the Ukrainian president in the capital this afternoon. Johnson met Zelenskiy “in a show of solidarity with the Ukrainian people,” a Downing Street spokesperson said. Ukraine’s defence ministry has accused Russian forces of committing war crimes in the town of Makariv in the Kyiv region. The town’s mayor, Vadym Tokar, said on Friday that 132 people had been killed in the town about 50km west of the capital. As of today, 176 children have died and 324 have been wounded in Ukraine since Vladimir Putin ordered Russian troops into the country, Ukraine’s prosecutor general office has said. It said the figures were yet to be finalised as “work is underway to establish them in places of active hostilities, in temporarily occupied and liberated territories”. The Guardian has not been able to verify this information. The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said Russian forces appeared to have committed war crimes by targeting civilians in Ukraine. Leaving Ukraine today after visiting the devastated town of Bucha on Friday, she told reporters: “My instinct says, if this is not a war crime, what is a war crime?” Later that day while at a fundraising event for Ukraine in Warsaw, von der Leyen said the European Commission will pledge 1bn euros to support Ukraine and countries receiving refugees fleeing the war. Russia has reorganised the command of its battle operations in Ukraine, installing a new general with extensive experience in Russian operations in Syria, according to a western official. The commander of Russia’s southern military district, Gen Alexander Dvornikov, now leads the invasion, the source told the BBC, adding: “We would expect the overall command and control to improve.” Ten humanitarian corridors have been agreed for Saturday for people from besieged regions, including the city of Mariupol, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, said. Residents remaining in eastern Ukraine’s embattled city of Luhansk must evacuate, the governor said. Russian air activity is expected to increase in the south and east of Ukraine, according to the UK’s ministry of defence. Russian operations continue to focus on Donbas, Mariupol and Mykolaiv, supported by continued cruise missile launches into Ukraine by Russian naval forces, it said. A curfew will be in place in Ukraine’s southern city of Odesa from Saturday evening until Monday evening, in response to the shelling of the train station in Kramatorsk, and the threat of a missile strike. Figures published today by the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, show that 4,441,663 Ukrainian refugees have fled the country since Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February. About 90% of those who have fled Ukraine are women and children. A Ukrainian government minister has said she expects Ukraine to be granted EU candidate country status in June. Olga Stefanishyna, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister for European and Euro-Atlantic integration, said her country was “ready to move fast” with its application to become a member of the European Union. That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, today as I hand the blog over to my colleague Jenn Selby. Thank you for reading, I’ll be back on Monday. The European Commission is pledging 1bn euros to support Ukraine and countries receiving refugees fleeing the war following Russia’s invasion, Ursula von der Leyen said. Speaking at a fundraising event for Ukraine in Warsaw, the European Commission president said: Six hundred million of those will go to Ukraine, to the Ukrainian authorities and partially to the United Nations. And 400m euros will go to the frontline states that are doing such an outstanding job and helping the refugees that are coming. Boris Johnson’s trip to Kyiv is a publicity coup for the prime minister who has been desperate to travel to Ukraine. The security situation in the capital has stabilised after Russian forces withdrew from their forward positions on 29 March. They abandoned the towns of Bucha and Gostomel north west of Kyiv and retreated to Belarus. Since then artillery attacks on the city have stopped. Emergency teams have swept highways and roadsides for explosives and have been towing away destroyed Russian armoured vehicles. With air travel impossible Johnson will have driven to Kyiv, most probably from eastern Poland. The 600-km route from the border passes the western city of Lviv. On the outskirts of the capital, Johnson will have seen blown up Russian tanks by the side of the road as well as ironic welcoming signs painted by Ukrainians saying: “Russia go fuck yourself”. Johnson is a popular figure in Kyiv after having delivered vital anti-tank weapons, the Swedish-developed NLAW system, to the Ukrainian army. President Zelenskiy has repeatedly praised the UK’s staunch support. A growing number of senior politicians are now making the arduous trip. On Friday the European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen visited together with her deputy Josep Borrell. Both condemned the Russian rocket attack on a train station in the eastern city of Kramatorsk. Johnson travelled to Kyiv before the invasion on 1 February and held talks with Zelenskiy in the Mariinsky palace, the president’s official residence. He said the UK would impose sanctions on Russia as soon as the “first Russian toecap” strode into Ukrainian territory. He also warned - correctly - that Russia’s armed forces were a “clear and present danger”. Here’s more on Boris Johnson’s meeting with Volodymyr Zelenskiy in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv. The UK prime minister travelled to Ukraine to meet Zelenskiy in person “in a show of solidarity with the Ukrainian people”, Downing Street said. They will discuss the UK’s long term support to Ukraine and the PM will set out a new package of financial and military aid. Andriy Sybiha, deputy head of Ukraine’s president office, said on Facebook that the two leaders were holding a “one-on-one meeting”. Sybiha added: The UK is the leader in defence support for Ukraine. The leader in the antiwar coalition. The leader in sanctions against the Russian aggressor. As of Saturday 9 April, 176 children have died and 324 have been wounded in Ukraine since Vladimir Putin ordered Russian troops into the country, Ukraine’s prosecutor general office has said. In a statement on Telegram, it said the figures were yet to be finalised as “work is underway to establish them in places of active hostilities, in temporarily occupied and liberated territories”. According to the data from juvenile prosecutors, the highest number of casualties were recorded in Donetsk oblast (102), Kyiv (91), Kharkiv (76), Chernihiv (50), Mykolaiv (40), Luhansk (35), Zaporizhzhia (22), Kherson (29), the city of Kyiv (16), Sumy (16) and Zhytomyr (15). Note: the Guardian is not able to verify the information. The UK prime minister is holding a meeting with the Ukrainian president in the capital this afternoon. The Ukrainian embassy to the UK shared a photograph of the two leaders in talks: Residents remaining in eastern Ukraine’s embattled city of Luhansk must evacuate, the governor has said as shelling intensifies and Russia bolsters its forces. Ukraine has been warning that Moscow is withdrawing from areas to the north of Kyiv in order to focus its offensive military operations on the country’s east. Moscow, which initially justified its invasion by claiming to need to protect Russian-speaking civilians in the self-proclaimed republics in Donbas, has confirmed the change in strategy. Governor Serhiy Gaidai said about 30% of residents had stayed in the area’s cities and villages despite being asked to leave. Gaidai told public television: They [Russia] are amassing forces for an offensive and we see the number of shellings has increased. Russian operations continue to focus on the south-eastern parts of the country, targeting Donbas, Mariupol and Mykolaiv, the UK’s Ministry of Defence has said. The attacks are “supported by continued cruise missile launches into Ukraine by Russian naval forces”, according to its latest intelligence update. It said it expected Russian air activity “to increase in the south and east of Ukraine in support of this activity” but that forces had failed to establish a land corridor between Crimea and Donbas. With Russia’s offensive refocused, the US has warned that Moscow likely plans to deploy tens of thousands of soldiers in eastern Ukraine. “At this juncture we believe Russia is revising its war aims” to concentrate on “eastern and parts of southern Ukraine rather than target most of the territory,” President Joe Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said earlier this week. The Economist’s Tim Judah shared a video showing a children’s library destroyed by Russian shelling in the Ukrainian city of Chernihiv. The EU will discuss its support for war crimes investigations in Ukraine in meetings over the next two days with the international criminal court’s (ICC) chief prosecutor, Karim Khan. Khan will meet with the EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, on Sunday in Luxembourg, before meeting with EU foreign ministers on Monday, the European Commission said. The meetings underline the EU’s support for investigations into atrocities in Ukraine, AFP reports. After the discovery of corpses in the town of Bucha, near Kyiv, the Ukrainian government and some neighbouring EU countries accused Russia of war crimes, which Moscow has denied. Top EU officials have opted to await the results of the war crimes investigations conducted by Ukraine’s prosecution service with help from the ICC, the EU, the UN human rights commissioner and the OSCE. The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, who visited Bucha on Friday with Borrell, said as she left Ukraine on Saturday: If this is not a war crime, what is a war crime? But a rigorous investigation was needed so that any future war crimes charges stood up in court, she added. Italy plans to reopen its embassy in Kyiv immediately after Easter, Reuters has cited the Italian foreign minister, Luigi Di Maio, as saying. Speaking after a meeting at the foreign ministry to discuss the war in Ukraine, Di Maio said: We were the last to leave Kyiv and we will be among the first to go back. At the same time we must intensify diplomatic pressure to bring [Russian president Vladimir] Putin to the talks table and reach a ceasefire. Figures published today by the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, show that 4,441,663 Ukrainian refugees have fled the country since Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February. That figure was 59,347 more than the previous day. About 90% of those who have fled Ukraine are women and children. About 210,000 non-Ukrainians have also fled the country, according to the UN’s International Organization for Migration (IOM). An estimated 7.1 million people have been displaced within Ukraine, according to figures published by the IOM earlier this week. YouTube has blocked the Russian parliamentary channel Duma TV, leading Russian officials to warn that the platform may be restricted in response. A message on YouTube on Saturday announced that the Duma channel had been “terminated for a violation of YouTube’s terms of service”. The move drew ire from Russian officials, who warned that the site, which is owned by Alphabet, could face restrictions in response. “From the look of it, YouTube has signed its own warrant. Save content, transfer [it] to Russian platforms. And hurry up,” said the foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova on the Telegram messaging service. The Russian communications regulator Roskomnadzor said it had requested that Google restore access to the Duma channel immediately, Reuters reported. “The American IT company adheres to a pronounced anti-Russian position in the information war unleashed by the west against our country,” Roskomnadzor said. Google told Reuters in an emailed comment that is was committed to compliance with all applicable sanctions and trade compliance laws. “If we find that an account violates our terms of service, we take appropriate action. Our teams are closely monitoring the situation for any updates and changes.” The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has called for the perpetrators of civilian killings in Bucha to be held accountable for war crimes. “This is something we cannot forget,” Scholz said in a speech on Saturday reported by Reuters. “We cannot overlook that this is a crime. These are war crimes we will not accept ... Those who did this must be held accountable.” He said that Germany would continue supplying Ukraine with defensive weapons. Ukrainian officials said hundreds of dead civilians have been found dead since Russian forces withdrew from Bucha last week. Bucha’s deputy mayor said that more than 360 civilians were killed and between about 260 and 280 were buried by other residents in a mass grave. Moscow has denied the allegations that its forces killed civilians in Bucha while occupying the town, labelling it a “monstrous forgery” aimed at attacking the Russian army. Satellite images showing bodies on Bucha’s streets mean the massacre can be precisely dated to before Russian forces evacuated the town. Ukraine’s Ministry of Defence has accused Russian forces of committing war crimes in the town of Makariv in the Kyiv region. The town’s mayor, Vadym Tokar, said on Friday that 132 people had been killed. Makariv is about 50km west of the capital. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, on Friday strongly condemned a missile strike on a train station in Kramatorsk that killed at least 50 people, including five children. He and other leaders accused Russia’s military of deliberately attacking the station. Russia, in turn, blamed Ukraine, saying its forces did not use the kind of missile that hit the station – a contention dismissed by experts. Universities in the UK are partnering with higher education institutions in Ukraine to offer support and minimise “the risk of brain drain” during the conflict. The relationships could allow Ukrainian academics to be based at UK universities, host summer schools at UK campuses, and allow English-speaking students to take online modules recognised by their universities. “This project is designed to support Ukrainian universities to continue to function during this difficult time,” said Charles Cormack, the founder and chairman of Cormack Consultancy Group, which is coordinating the scheme with the support of Universities UK, a collective of 140 universities. By supporting them in their mission we are also minimising the risk of brain drain, with academics and students disappearing into the HE systems of other countries. While the project remains in the early stages, already 30 universities across the UK – including the University of London, the University of Edinburgh, and the University of Glasgow – are among those that have expressed interest. More than 25 Ukrainian higher education institutions ranging from medical, law and polytechnic universities in Lviv, Kyiv and elsewhere have registered interest. The partnership between institutions hopes to secure “long-term” collaboration across curriculum content, online resources, research and the movement of students and staff. Other short-term proposed initiatives include access to libraries and online resources, helping to protect Ukrainian resources, including rare book collections, and connecting student unions to raise funds for new equipment. Ukrainians currently studying in the UK will automatically qualify for three years’ leave to remain under the Ukraine extension scheme. Civilians in Russian-occupied areas of the Kyiv region experienced widespread threats of violence and intimidation by Russian forces, the Ukrainian human rights activist Oksana Pokalchuk has said. Two men from the town of Bucha, on the north-west outskirts of Kyiv, said snipers “regularly” shot at them when they went to salvage food from a destroyed grocery store near their home, she said. Pokalchuk, who heads the Ukrainian section of Amnesty International, shared testimonies of what life was like under Russian occupation: The accounts offered only a “small glimpse into the horrors people under occupation have endured”, she said. The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said Russian forces appeared to have committed war crimes by targeting civilians in Ukraine, Reuters reports. Leaving Ukraine today after visiting the devastated town of Bucha on Friday, she told reporters: My instinct says, if this is not a war crime, what is a war crime? But I am a medical doctor by training, and lawyers have to investigate carefully. I saw the photos [that the Ukrainian prime minister] Denys Shmyhal showed me: killing people as they are walking by. We could also see with our own eyes that the destruction in the city is targeted into the civilian lives. Residential buildings are no military target. On Friday, forensic investigators began exhuming a mass grave in Bucha, wrapping in black plastic and laying out the bodies of civilians who officials say were killed while Russian troops occupied the town on the north-west outskirts of Kyiv. Von der Leyen said the EU was working with Ukraine in a joint investigation team to gather evidence of possible war crimes for use in future court cases. It is extremely important that it is well documented, to prevent defeats in court because the evidence is not good enough. Russian soldiers who seized control of Chernobyl showed “lax and careless behaviour” towards radioactive material during their occupation of the decommissioned nuclear power station, Ukrainian soldiers have said. The Red Forest around Chernobyl is one of the most radiation-contaminated areas in the world, and the Ukrainian military has accused Russian troops of digging trenches in that area. One soldier told CNN: They went to the Red Forest and brought radioactive material back with them on their shoes. The Russian soldiers “went everywhere, and they also took some radioactive dust on them” when they left, the soldier added. Ukraine’s minister of internal affairs, Denys Monastyrskiy, also accused Russian troops of locking Chernobyl security staff in the plant’s underground nuclear bunker, crammed in tight quarters without access to natural light, fresh air or communication with the outside world. Monastyrskyy said: They were kept here for 30 days without sufficient lighting and food. They were not allowed outside. On the last day they were taken away from here to an unknown direction. He said he believed that the men had been taken to Russia as prisoners of war, but did not know for certain. Today we know nothing about their fate, unfortunately. The head of the British Red Cross, Mike Adamson, has called for the removal of visa requirements for Ukrainian refugees seeking sanctuary in the UK. Only a “small trickle” of refugees are reaching the UK, Adamson told the BBC, arguing that it should be made “much easier to come here”. The charity’s chief executive said: It will remain a slow process with the current visa arrangements in place and it’s only if we remove those that we’ll actually start to see a steady flow. The whole of Europe and many other countries have waived their visa requirements. He added: The key thing is we get far more people here, and then Britain would be playing its part at scale alongside our partners across Europe and of course showing solidarity and practical support to the people of Ukraine in this terrible situation. On Friday, the British home secretary, Priti Patel, apologised for the time it has taken for Ukrainian refugees to arrive in the UK under two visa schemes. While other European countries have accepted hundreds of thousands of people fleeing the Russian invasion, only about 1,200 people have so far arrived in Britain under the Homes for Ukraine scheme, for those who are sponsored by UK hosts. Another 10,800 people have arrived under the Ukrainian family scheme, for those with existing family connections to the UK. By Thursday, the government had received 79,800 visa applications from Ukrainians and had issued a total of 40,900 visas. A Ukrainian government minister has said she expects Ukraine to be granted EU candidate country status in June. Olga Stefanishyna, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister for European and Euro-Atlantic integration, said her country was “ready to move fast” with its application to become a member of the European Union. Her remarks come a day after the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, pledged to offer a speedy response to Ukraine’s bid for bloc membership. At a joint news conference with Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Von der Leyen handed the Ukrainian president a questionnaire that will form a starting point for a decision on membership, saying: It will not as usual be a matter of years to form this opinion but, I think, a matter of weeks. Zelenskiy told the same news conference he would come back with answers in a week. After almost 30 years, the band Pink Floyd will release a new song to raise money for humanitarian relief in Ukraine, featuring the vocals of a Ukrainian singer who quit an international tour to fight for his country and was wounded. The project started when the Pink Floyd vocalist and guitarist David Gilmour learned that Andriy Khlyvnyuk – with whom he had previously performed – had left a US tour with Boombox and returned to Ukraine to join the territorial defence forces to defend his country from Russia’s invasion. On a two-day visit to a Ukrainian village occupied by Russian forces for more than a month, Shaun Walker spoke to residents who recounted stories of killings and looting by a demoralised invasion force: The day the Russians arrived in the sleepy, windswept village of Staryi Bykiv, they killed six men. By the time they had departed 32 days later, the soldiers had carried out at least three more killings, destroyed the school, systematically looted dozens of houses and turned much of the central street into a wasteland of charred buildings and rubble. The images from Bucha, west of Kyiv, have shocked the world and intensified Ukrainian anger over the Russian invasion, but the story emerging in harder-to-access small towns and villages east of the Ukrainian capital suggests those war crimes are far from an anomaly. Novyi and Staryi Bykiv, two halves of one village separated by a small river, are about 50 miles (80km) east of Kyiv. Dotted with ramshackle cottages, their combined population is about 2,000. In normal times, very little happens here: ducks waddle through the potholed streets, and people work the fields or tend to their own small plots of land and livestock holdings. The Russian army entered the area on 27 February, three days into its invasion, as part of its drive towards Kyiv from three directions. When the advance stalled, they set up a base, moving in tanks, artillery and surface-to-air missile systems. The accounts given by dozens of residents in Staryi and Novyi Bykiv during a two-day visit by the Guardian paint a picture of a thieving, violent and demoralised invasion force that was confused about whether it was supposed to be liberating Ukrainians or destroying them. Finally allowed to walk around freely after a month of terror, men and women wandered the streets on Thursday still in a state of shock. In the car park outside the small village administration building in Novyi Bykiv, children gawped at the charred shells of two Russian armoured vehicles, one with the uniform of a Russian soldier still draped over one of its hatches. Read more of Shaun’s article here: After Russians’ retreat, scarred Ukrainian village recounts month of terror Russia has reorganised the command of its battle operations in Ukraine, installing a new general with extensive experience in Russian operations in Syria, according to a western official. The commander of Russia’s southern military district, Gen Alexander Dvornikov, now leads the invasion, the source told the BBC. The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: That particular commander has a lot of experience of operations of Russian operations in Syria. So we would expect the overall command and control to improve. The instatement was done in an attempt to improve coordination between units, as Russian forces had previously been organised and commanded separately, the official said. Russia has so far struggled to achieve its war goals since launching its invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, failing to capture any major Ukrainian cities. Moscow has since reframed its ambitions to focus on territory claimed by Russian-backed separatists in Donbas, although Ukrainian officials have warned Russia’s long-term objective is to seize the entire country. The official added: Unless Russia is able to change its tactics, it’s very difficult to see how they succeed in even these limited objectives that they’ve reset themselves. Hello. I’m Léonie Chao-Fong and I’ll be bringing you all the latest news from the war in Ukraine. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has described a missile strike on a railway station in eastern Ukraine as a Russian war crime and called for a “firm global response”. At least 52 people, including five children, were killed in the missile strike on Kramatorsk train station. The US believes Russia used a short range ballistic missile on the train station. Russia has denied responsibility. Ten humanitarian corridors have been agreed for Saturday for people from besieged regions, including the city of Mariupol, according to Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk. The governor of Luhansk earlier called for more evacuations, warning that shelling had increased over recent days and that more Russian troops had arrived in the region. Russian air activity is expected to increase in the south and east of Ukraine, according to the UK’s ministry of defence, which said Russian operations continue to focus on Donbas, Mariupol and Mykolaiv, supported by continued cruise missile launches into Ukraine by Russian naval forces. A curfew will be in place in Ukraine’s southern city of Odesa from Saturday evening until Monday evening, in response to the shelling of the train station in Kramatorsk, and the threat of a missile strike. Two UN agencies have called for “urgent action” to help an estimated 1,000 seafarers stranded in Ukrainian ports and waters with dwindling supplies. The US-based Institute for the Study of War says that Ukrainian forces retain control of defensive positions in eastern and southwestern Mariupol. Russian forces are continuing to attempt to redeploy units in eastern Ukraine. However, such troops are “unlikely to enable a Russian breakthrough and face poor morale”, ISW says. Some Russian military units have experienced major losses, a senior US defence official said, and the Pentagon estimates Russia’s combat power is between 80% and 85% of pre-invasion levels. Here are some images from across Ukraine over the past 24 hours. In Bucha, investigators begin exhuming a mass grave to gather evidence of war crimes in the liberated town. Thousands of civilians are believed to remain trapped in Mariupol, where they have faced weeks of heavy shelling. Inside the administrative building of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, which was occupied by Russian troops. Ukraine’s Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said 10 humanitarian corridors for people from besieged regions have been agreed, Reuters reports. This includes one for people evacuating by private transport from the city of Mariupol, Vereshchuk said. More evacuations are needed from Luhansk in Ukraine as shelling has increased in recent days and more Russian forces have been arriving, Luhansk governor Serhiy Gaidai said on Saturday, according to Reuters. He said that some 30% of people still remain in settlements there and have been asked to evacuate. “They (Russia) are amassing forces for an offensive and we see the number of shelling has increased,” Gaidai told the public television broadcaster. Some 176 children have been killed following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, according to Ukraine’s prosecutor general’s office. A further 324 children have been injured, it said. Russian efforts to establish a land corridor between Crimea and the Donbas continue to be thwarted by Ukrainian resistance, the UK’s Ministry of Defence says in its latest update. It also states: Russia continues to hit Ukrainian non-combatants, such as those killed in yesterday’s rocket strike on Kramatorsk railway station in eastern Ukraine. Russian operations continue to focus on Donbas, Mariupol and Mykolaiv, supported by continued cruise missile launches into Ukraine by Russian naval forces. Russian air activity is expected to increase in the south and east of Ukraine in support of this activity. A curfew will be in place in Ukraine’s southern city of Odessa from this evening until Monday evening. This is in response to the shelling of the train station in Kramatorsk, and the threat of a missile strike, reports AFP. In its latest analysis, the US-based Institute for the Study of War says that Ukrainian forces retain control of defensive positions in eastern and southwestern Mariupol. Russian forces are continuing to attempt to redeploy troops withdrawn from northeastern Ukraine to support an offensive in eastern Ukraine. However, such troops are “unlikely to enable a Russian breakthrough and face poor morale”, ISW says. Here are its key takeaways: Ukrainian forces continued to hold out against Russian assaults in areas of southwestern and eastern Mariupol, notably in the port and the Azovstal Metallurgy plant, respectively. Ukrainian forces continued to repel daily Russian assaults in Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts. A Russian Tochka-U missile struck a civilian evacuation point at the Kramatorsk rail station in eastern Ukraine, killing at least 50 and wounding around a hundred evacuees. Russian forces continued attacks south of Izyum toward Slovyansk and Barvinkove but did not take any new territory. Ukrainian counterattacks have likely taken further territory west of Kherson, threatening Russian control of the city. Here is a recap of the comments made by the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in his late-night address on Friday. Zelenskiy referred to the missile strike on a railway station in eastern Ukraine as a Russian war crime and said it must be one of the charges to feature at any future tribunal. At least 52 people were killed, including five children, when a missile hit Kramatorsk railway station on Friday. The US has also blamed Russia, saying it believes it used a short-range ballistic missile. Russia has denied responsibility. Zelenskiy said he expected “a firm, global response”. “Like the massacre in Bucha, like many other Russian war crimes, the missile strike on Kramatorsk must be one of the charges at the tribunal, which is bound to happen,” he said. “All the efforts of the world will be aimed to establish every minute: who did what, who gave orders. Where did the rocket come from, who was carrying it, who gave the order and how the strike was coordinated,” he said. Zelenskiy also repeated his call for more weapons to be provided to Ukraine, and for greater sanctions to be imposed on Russia. “The pressure on Russia must be increased. It is necessary to introduce a full energy embargo – on oil, on gas. It is energy exports that provide the lion’s share of Russia’s profits. Russian banks must also be completely disconnected from the global financial system,” he said. Zelenskiy added that Ukraine had provided details of the military equipment it requires. “Any delay in providing such weapons to Ukraine, any excuses, can mean only one thing: the relevant politicians want to help the Russian leadership more than us Ukrainians,” he said. Hello, it’s Rebecca Ratcliffe with you as we continue our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. Here are the latest developments: Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has described a missile strike on a railway station in eastern Ukraine as a Russian war crime and called for a “firm global response”. At least 52 people, including five children, were killed in the missile strike on Kramatorsk train station. The US believes Russia used a short range ballistic missile on the train station. Russia has denied responsibility. Two UN agencies have called for “urgent action” to help an estimated 1,000 seafarers stranded in Ukrainian ports and waters with dwindling supplies. Some 6,665 civilians were evacuated through humanitarian corridors on Friday, the majority of them rescued from Mariupol and Berdiansk. Russian troops have “forcibly deported” more than 600,000 Ukrainians, including about 121,000 children, to Russia, Ukraine’s human rights commissioner, Lyudmila Denysova, said. Denysova also said residents of the temporarily occupied city of Izyum in the Kharkiv region are being forcibly moved to Russia. Some Russian military units have experienced major losses, a senior US defence official said, and the Pentagon estimates Russia’s combat power is between 80% and 85% of pre-invasion levels. The US defence department is expecting Russia to shift its focus to Donbas and eastern Ukraine. International prices for food commodities, including grains and vegetable oils, reached all time highs in March amid Russia’s war in Ukraine. The conflict was causing massive disruptions, the UN said on Friday, threatening millions of people in Africa, the Middle East and elsewhere with hunger and malnourishment. The European Commission’s president, Ursula von der Leyen, pledged to offer Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, a speedier start to his country’s bid to become a member of the EU. At a joint press conference with Zelenskiy, Von der Leyen said: “It will not as usual be a matter of years to form this opinion but I think a matter of weeks.” Forensic investigators have begun exhuming a mass grave in the Ukrainian town of Bucha, wrapping in black plastic and laying out the bodies of civilians who officials say were killed during the Russian invasion. Since Russian troops pulled back from Bucha last week, Ukrainian officials say hundreds of civilians have been found dead. Russia’s justice ministry has revoked the registration of 15 foreign organisations including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. The ministry said in a statement that the Russian units of the organisations “were excluded due to the discovery of violations of the current legislation of the Russian Federation”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2019/nov/04/tv-tonight-the-audacious-awesome-end-of-the-fing-world","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2019-11-04T06:19:15Z","webTitle":"TV tonight: the audacious, awesome End of the F***ing World","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/nov/04/tv-tonight-the-audacious-awesome-end-of-the-fing-world","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2019/nov/04/tv-tonight-the-audacious-awesome-end-of-the-fing-world","fields":{"headline":"TV tonight: the audacious, awesome End of the F***ing World","bodyText":"The End of the F***ing World 10pm, Channel 4 A confident, even audacious opening to season two of this pitch-black comedy-drama.

PH Bouncers 10pm, Channel 5 It is a grim reflection on how strapped the UK’s emergency services are that there is a need for the “new kind of private security firm” shown in this series. In this hard-hitting opener, Marek and Greg help to tackle nocturnal lawlessness, from restraining mouthy punters to looking after semi-conscious drunks.

Schütte sees Kraftwerk’s music as “a contribution to the political, cultural and moral rebuilding of Germany” after the second world war. Their records obliquely approach history, and the process of constructing a future-oriented nation, by focusing on the material aspects of its everyday life: roads, nuclear power, trains, computers. The group enthusiastically embraced Germany’s place in the European project, in songs that addressed the continent’s interconnection (“Trans-Europe Express”) and were often recorded in a number of European languages. Hütter and Florian Schneider, the founding members, were born into affluent families after the war had ended. They met while students in their home city of Düsseldorf, a wealthy centre for fashion in the midst of industrial Rhineland that was bombed by allied forces during the war but became the capital of the federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia in 1946. Bonn, the new capital of West Germany, lay within the state’s boundaries, a sign that it had become the centre of the nation’s postwar political power. Kraftwerk formed in 1970 from the ashes of an earlier band, Organisation. Their name translates from German as “power station”, and, although the group initially pursued an industrial aesthetic in their cover art, beginning with the Warhol-style traffic cones that illustrated their first two albums, the industrial slowly worked its way into the whole concept of the band – the songs and, eventually, its self‑presentation as man-machine humanoids. By Autobahn, their fourth album, they had added Wolfgang Flür and Karl Bartos to their lineup, and by the fifth, Radio-Activity, their instrumentation was entirely electronic. The robots soon followed. The first, and strongest, half of Schütte’s book traces the cultural context of the band, and their evolution from the art scene in Düsseldorf, where they drew on the idea that artistic practice could help create a better world as developed by Joseph Beuys, who was then based in the city and a friend of the Schneider family. Schütte’s main contention is that, rather than merely being a band, Kraftwerk was in essence a wider art project, “a multimedia combination of sound and image, graphic design and performance”. The group’s career, he argues, is a total artwork along the lines of Wagner’s conception of a Gesamtkunstwerk, one that embraces multiple forms to realise the artist’s vision. Certainly the band was drawing from the historical avant garde, especially the aesthetics of the Bauhaus, the futurists and German expressionism. The idea of representing its members as robots was drawn in part from Fritz Lang’s 1927 film Metropolis; their use of music to represent everyday noises recalled the found sounds of musique concrète. (David Bowie called Kraftwerk’s industrially inspired sounds “folk music of the factories”.) Their aesthetic can be characterised as retro-futurism, and their artistic influences modernist – they looked back as they hurtled forwards. Schütte attempts to trace their influence, but you can see them everywhere: most fascinatingly in hip-hop, most obviously in techno music, but also in the chrome-helmeted anonymity of Daft Punk, in the industrial philosophy of Factory Records and the Haçienda nightclub, and, ultimately, in the general trajectory of pop music ever since Kraftwerk’s run of great albums between 1974 and 1981 – away from traditional rock and towards the electronic. Their influence grew even as they declined as a creative force. Since 1981’s Computer World a mere two albums of original material have been released, of which only Tour de France Soundtracks (2003) was on a par with their classic work. Instead, for the most part Hütter and Schneider’s attention shifted to digitising their back catalogue and, later, returning to the live arena. For the most part Schütte eschews a biographical approach, denigrating Flür’s gossipy memoir I Was a Robot. So the reader gets only a limited sense of the personalities behind the band, and it remains unclear whether Kraftwerk’s relative silence post-1981 is due to indolence or a strategy of mystery-building to drive boxset sales. (Here’s Flür on the bike-obsessed Hütter and Schneider: “They would prefer to study cycling catalogues ... than think up ideas for new songs.”) Perhaps it’s best to take Kraftwerk at face value: as a corporation whose business is industrial design, and which is engaged in an ongoing process of perfecting its product. That ambition has recently been realised in their impressive live shows, which have been held in museums, art galleries and airports, complete with the highest-tech 3D visuals. On tour in the 1970s the band had difficulty reproducing their music in a concert setting. Equipment would break down, and for years they never played live at all. But Kraftwerk kept going and technology finally caught up. • Kraftwerk by Uwe Schutte (Penguin Books Ltd, £9.99). To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com.

GW Britain’s FTSE 100 index has begun February with a 1% rally. The blue-chip stock index has closed 71 points higher at 7536 points. Silver miner Fresnillo (+4%) and technology-focused investor Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust (+3.6%), followed by a clutch of miners and oil giant Shell. Banks and travel companies also had a solid day. But Ocado led the fallers, dropping almost 5%. Concerns about the pace of US interest rate rises may have faded a little, as michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: European markets have got off to a strong start to February, after last night’s push back by a number of Federal Reserve officials, who poured cold water on some of the hawkish narratives being put out with respect to the Federal Reserve’s hiking timeline. This timely corrective, from the likes of Bostic, George and Daly, appears to have reset expectations of a 25bps move in March, and away from the narrative that had been suggesting we might see a move of 50bps. This corrective could get added weight later this week, if we get a weak January payrolls report on Friday. Over the last two weeks we’ve seen consensus expectations revised lower from 238k to 150k, although we are seeing some estimates which suggest that we might see a negative number, due to an increase in sickness levels as a result of Omicron. Amongst the best performers we’re seeing some decent gains amongst the basic resource and banks, with the likes of Rio Tinto, Glencore, and Anglo American near the top of the pile, while HSBC and Lloyds Banking Group are also doing well. Supermarkets have been a mixed bag after the latest Kantar grocery sales data for the 12 weeks to 23rd January showed a fall of 3.8%, on a like for like basis. Rising prices also played a part in the decline, with prices rising sharply in the period after Christmas, by as much as 3.8%, a rise of 0.3% from December. In terms of market share only Tesco and Waitrose improved their market share over the 12-week period, despite weaker sales compared to a year ago, helping to push Tesco shares up on the day. Sainsbury saw sales fall 4.8% year on year, as well as losing some market share, with the shares slipping back. Vodafone and BT shares are also lower ahead of their earnings numbers later this week. The family behind Blackwell’s, the UK’s largest independent bookseller, has put the business up for sale after ditching a plan to hand it to employees. A deal would take Blackwell’s, which operates 18 shops and a website, out of family control for the first time in its 143-year history. The retailer said it was looking for an external investor after a plan to put the business into employee ownership fell through. It said that goal “ultimately proved to be difficult, due in large part to the ongoing uncertainty on the high street caused by Covid-19”. Blackwell’s, which was founded in Oxford and operates Heffers in Cambridge as well as flagship stores in London and Edinburgh, said underlying sales for the year to December 2021 rose 1.9%, a figure that suggests falling store sales and rising online trade. Oil giant Exxon Mobil has posted its biggest profit in almost eight years, as it reaps the benefits of the rally in energy prices. Exxon made fourth-quarter profit of $8.8bn, which works out at $2.08 per share, above analysts’ forecast of $1.94. Soaring oil and gas prices, higher volumes and asset sales all boosted its income. In the same quarter a year ago, Exxon made adjusted profit of 3 cents a share. For the full year, Exxon made profits of $23bn, a recovery from the $22bn loss in 2020. It is conducting a $10bn share buyback programme to return money to shareholders. Exxon’s CEO, Darren Woods, says: “Our effective pandemic response, focused investments during the down-cycle, and structural cost savings positioned us to realize the full benefits of the market recovery in 2021,” That market recovery has also driven up the cost of fuel at forecourts and petrol stations, and is about to see UK families hit with a surge in energy bills in April. Back on Wall Street, the S&amp;P 500 index is still trading lower - down around 0.4%. The number of openings at US companies has risen, while the number of Americans quitting their jobs remains high. There were 10.925m unfilled positions at US firms in December, up from 10.775 in November, back towards the record highs last autumn. The Labor Department also reports that nearly 4.4m workers quit their jobs last month, slightly down on the record 4.5m quits in November. Just 1.17m workers were laid off, down from 1.3m in November, as firms looked to hold onto staff due to problems filling vacancies. The report shows that America’s jobs market remains tight, even as the Omicron variant hit the economy at the end of last year. Here’s some analysis from economist Nick Bunker of jobs site Indeed.com A second survey of America’s factories, from the Institute of Supply Management also shows that growth slowed in January, but prices kept rising. The ISM’s healthcheck on purchasing managers report found that the sector kept expanding, in a “demand-driven, supply chain-constrained environment”. Its January Manufacturing PMI came in at 57.6%, a decrease of 1.2 percentage points from December’s 58.8%, with growth in new orders and production both slowing. The prices charged by manufacturers increased, “indicating that supplier pricing power continues to rise.” The employment index rose, while many firms still reported problems with suppliers and deliveries. US manufacturing grew at the slowest rate since October 2020 last month, as demand softened and factories struggled to hire staff. Data firm IHS Markit’s US manufacturing PMI, just released, found that output and new order growth slowed last month, amid supply and labor shortages. The rate of job creation eased to the lowest rate in the 18-month sequence of growth, while absences due to the surge in omicron cases also led to staff shortages. But encouragingly, business confidence picked up to 14-month high, with purchasing managers hopeful that supply chain problems were easing. This meant the IHS Markit US Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index dropped to 55.5 in January, down from 57.7 in December, showing slower growth. It’s a little higher than the earlier released ‘flash’ estimate of 55.0, implying the sector picked up towards the end of January. Shares in logistics giant United Parcel Service have jumped 13% after it reported strong results before the opening bell. UPS beat expectations with its profits and revenues in the last quarter, as its domestic package business continued to perform well, and lifted its quarterly dividend by almost 50% UPA also gave a rosy outlook for 2022, predicting revenues would beat market expectations, as higher shipping rates and e-commerce demand boosted its operations. After ending a volatile January with a late rally, Wall Street has begin February cautiously. The Dow Jones industrial average is flat in early trading, while the broader S&amp;P 500 index has dipped by 0.2%. The Nasdaq Composite index of tech stocks has dropped by 0.6%. In other car news...Aston Martin plans to phase out vehicles that rely solely on the internal combustion engine, and only sell electric or hybrid cars within four years. Lawrence Stroll, chair of the luxury carmaker, has told the FT: “By 2026 we will be fully electrified.” Customers will still have the option of a combustion engine in its hybrid cars, though, with Stroll saying: “I can’t tell you that 100 per cent of Aston Martin customers want an electric vehicle. Tesla is recalling nearly 54,000 cars and SUVs because their “Full Self-Driving” software lets them roll through stop signs. Associated Press has the details: Documents posted on Tuesday by US safety regulators say Tesla will disable the feature with an over-the-internet software update. The “rolling stop” feature allows vehicles to go through intersections with all-way stop signs at up to 5.6mph (9 km/h). Tesla agreed to the recall after two meetings with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), according to documents. Tesla said it knows of no crashes or injuries caused by feature. The recall covers Model S sedans and X SUVs from 2016 through 2022, as well as 2017 to 2022 Model 3 sedans and 2020 through 2022 Model Y SUVs. Selected Tesla drivers are “beta testing” the “Full Self-Driving” software on public roads. The company says the cars cannot drive themselves and drivers must be ready to take action at all times. A firmware release to disable the rolling stops is expected to be sent out in early February. The pound has risen to its highest level in nearly a week against the US dollar, as traders move out of safe-haven assets into riskier currencies. Sterling has gained half a cent to above $1.349, as markets anticipate UK interest rates rising on Thursday. Lawrence Kaplin, chief market strategist at international business payments firm Equals Money, says: Market attention is now firmly on Thursday’s Bank of England rate-setting meeting where rates are 100% priced in to rise from 0.25% to 0.5%. Following last week’s US Fed meeting where markets were completely wrong-footed by a very hawkish Chair Powell, positioning ahead of the MPC is returning to neutral as traders square up for fear of being caught out again. Back in the markets, shares have pushed higher in the City and across Europe. The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares is nearly 80 points higher, or 1.05%, while the pan-European Stoxx 600 is 1.5% higher as stocks make a good start to February. Production of carbon dioxide for use in producing meat, beer and fizzy drinks has been secured for at least three months under a new industry deal. Meat processors, brewers, bakers and soft drink producers all use CO2 in making and packaging their goods. It is also required for the humane slaughter of animals including pigs and chickens, and is used by hospitals and nuclear power plants. A short government statement said a new deal would enable CF Fertiliser plant in Billingham, County Durham, to continue to operate. The plant was scheduled for potential shutdown this week after a three-month emergency deal brokered by the government came to an end on Monday. That deal was prompted by a crisis in CO2 supplies in late September as high energy prices combined with annual maintenance shutdowns to bring UK production to a near halt. UK food producers and brewers had warned there could be shortages of meat, beer and fizzy drinks, as well as higher prices, unless CO2 supplies were secured. Here’s the full story: UK bank Virgin Money struck an upbeat tone about the UK recovery this morning, as the economic backdrop strengthened and Covid-19 restrictions are eased. Virgin Money’s chief executive, David Duffy, told the City: “Virgin Money’s performance in the first quarter has been strong. Our balance sheet is performing well, asset quality remains robust and we have increased guidance on net interest margin for 2022. We are optimistic about the pace of recovery of the UK economy based on growing consumer and business confidence, underpinned by lower unemployment.” The net interest margin is the difference between the rates at which Virgin Money raising money through deposits, and lends it out to borrowers. Virgin Money also reported a 3% rise in unsecured lending, driven by growth in credit cards, while mortage lending dipped 0.5%. Business lending fell by 2.2%, due to “weaker market demand, seasonality and lower Government-backed lending”. Almost 1,500 jobs are at risk at Tesco as the supermarket ditches night shifts in more than 80 stores and almost 40 petrol stations. The potential job cuts emerged only a day after the UK’s biggest supermarket chain said it would be shutting its Jack’s discount chain, with the potential loss of about 130 jobs, and closing more of its deli and meat counters. Overnight stock replenishment will now be done during the day in 36 large stores and 49 convenience stores. At 36 stores, petrol stations will be converted to be “pay-at-pump only” overnight. Jason Tarry, the chief executive of Tesco’s UK and Irish business, said: “We operate in a highly competitive and fast-paced market and our customers are shopping differently, especially since the start of the pandemic. “We are always looking at how we can run our business as simply and efficiently as possible, so that we can reinvest in the things that matter most to customers. The changes we are announcing today will help us do this.” Unemployment across the eurozone has dropped to a record low, as the region recovered from the economic shock of Covid-19. Despite the impact of the Omicron variant, the number of unemployed people fell by 185,000 in the euro area last month, and by 210,000 in the wider EU. That pulled the eurozone unemployment rate down to 7% in December, the lowest since the eurozone was created. A year earlier it was 8.2%, before vaccine rollouts helped hospitality firms, shops and travel businesses to reopen, spurring the recovery. Government spending programmes and job protection schemes, and the European Central Bank’s stimulus package, also supported the economy. Paolo Gentiloni, European Commissioner for Economy, says the drop in unemployment shows the success of the ‘collective response’ to the crisis. Carsten Brzeski of ING points out there are still wide regional differences, despite the recovery. Except for the Netherlands, all eurozone economies saw unemployment rates dropping or at least remaining constant in December. Still, there are significant differences across the eurozone with unemployment rates ranging from 3.2% in Germany to 13% in Spain. Demand for workers remains strong, resulting in vacancy rates breaking pre-pandemic highs. Admittedly, furlough schemes still support – part of – the job market, but the support has been reduced and we expect a further drop in furlough schemes in the coming months without adverse effects on unemployment. Staff at the UK’s financial watchdog have taken a step closer to striking over planned cuts to pay and conditions, following an indicative ballot in favour of industrial action, my colleague Julia Kollewe reports. The Unite union said its members who work for the Financial Conduct Authority had voted by 87% in support of industrial action in a non-binding ballot, without giving further details on the number of people who had voted. It urged the FCA to come to the negotiating table and threatened to proceed to a full industrial action ballot unless a negotiated settlement is reached. Unite, which is not formally recognised by the FCA as its staff union, argues that the pay cuts, drawn up by the new chief executive Nikhil Rathi as part of a transformation plan, would damage the interests of savers, borrowers and businesses by creating a “bargain basement regulator”. The City watchdog plans to overhaul itself after scathing criticism over its handling of the London Capital &amp; Finance (LC&amp;F) investment scandal, which wiped out the savings of 11,600 investors. The FCA chair Charles Randell, a former Slaughter and May lawyer, is stepping down early from his post amid the turmoil. The plan involves abolishing cash bonuses (which make up 10%-12% of pay), as well as what the union calls “unfair” changes to the staff appraisal system, plans to cut staff pension rights and lower pay for staff in Edinburgh. Unite said pay inequality was unusually high by the standards of public sector regulators, arguing that the FCA has around 40 executives who earn more than the prime minister. The union said the changes had sent morale among FCA staff plummeting and led to an exodus. The FCA, which employs 4,200 people, denied that the staff appraisal system was changing. It said it had already responded to staff concerns, by upping pay rises for those who meet their performance objectives to 5% this year and 4% next year from an initially planned 2%. New pay bands, including different pay ranges for those based outside London, meant that 800 of the lowest paid staff, such as support, would receive average pay rises of £3,800 this year, it added. Sharon Graham, Unite general secretary officer, said: “It is time for the FCA management to come to the negotiating table and ensure they avoid damaging the important work of the regulator. Unite will sit down and negotiate through ACAS [Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service] as soon as the FCA agrees; the ball is in FCA’s court now. “While the proposed cuts at the regulator is good news for fraudsters and rip-off merchants it is bad news for people with savings, loans, mortgages and pensions as experienced and committed staff are being forced out of the door.” An FCA spokesperson defended the planned changes, saying the regulator had held 77 meetings with staff: “The proposals in the consultation would ensure the FCA continues to provide one of the best, if not the best, employment packages of any regulator or enforcement agency in the UK. Under the proposals, most colleagues will receive base salary rises of at least 5% this year and 4% next, with many receiving significantly higher amounts. “We have undertaken significant consultation with our colleagues on these proposed changes and expect to publish the outcome by March, following consideration by the FCA board.” German unemployment fell in January, official figures showed this morning, despite the recent surge in Covid-19 cases. The Federal Labour Office said the number of people out of work fell by 48,000 in seasonally adjusted terms to 2.345 million, pulling the seasonally adjusted jobless rate down to 5.1%. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a fall of 6,000. Daniel Terzenbach, a senior official at the Labour Office, says: “The job market got off to a good start in 2022.” Back in the housing market, UK lenders approved more mortgages than expected in December. The Bank of England reports that approvals for house purchases, an indicator of future borrowing, rose to above 71,000 in December, up from 67,859 in November. That’s above the average in the year before the pandemic. It’s another sign that the housing market remained solid at the turn of the year, despite the end of the stamp duty holiday and the Omicron surge. Joshua Elash, director of property lender MT Finance, explains: ‘With inflation beginning to bite and interest rates expected to rise further, we anticipate increased demand for mortgage borrowing in the immediate to short term as would-be homeowners seek to secure a good, fixed-rate mortgage before they become less attractive. The BoE’s data also shows consumers borrowed an extra £831m in credit last month, including £386m more on credit cards. That’s a little lower than the £1bn increase in November, showing that Omicron didn’t put a big dent in household borrowing. Adam Hoyes, assistant economist at Capital Economic, says: The £0.8bn rise in consumer credit in December shows that consumers exercised a touch more caution as Omicron COVID-19 cases surged at the end of last year, but it still suggests the economy didn’t collapse. What’s more, with restrictions now eased and COVID-19 cases now much lower than they were at their peak in early January, consumers’ appetite for borrowing may soon strengthen a bit. Household savings slowed in December, though. Around £2.7bn was deposited in banks and building societies, and £500m into National Savings and Investment accounts - much slower than the average monthly net flow of £10.6bn in the previous year. Fhaheen Khan, senior economist at Make UK (which represents manufacturers) warns that cost pressures will continue to rise this year, piling pressure on producers: Manufacturing continues to expand and recruit thanks to a robust backlog of work, although January has evidently been a bit slow for business as many companies aimed to get ahead of the inflation spiral by stock building just before the end of last year. Fortunately, there are early signals of lead times improving and the pace of input inflation slowing, signs which offer a glimmer of hope for the sector’s desire to return to normal. However further cost pressures are just around the corner and this year will test the limits of manufacturers’ ability to survive as the economy continues to rebound. For now, it’s too early to say whether the precautionary “just in case” decisions manufacturers are making will serve to shield them from upcoming challenges.” Factories fared well in the face of the omicron variant, says Maddie Walker, Accenture’s Industry X lead in the UK: “The uptick in production output shows the UK economy is making a jump start in 2022, with manufacturers showing remarkable resilience during the Omicron wave. While the pandemic continues to pose threats on factories and labour shortages, we are seeing evidence that supply chain bottlenecks are easing. However, with inflation set to surge, a sharp rise in prices of raw materials will be a major cause of concern this year. Many manufacturers continue to invest in digital technologies, like intelligent automation and 5G connectivity, to help overcome inflationary pressures and maintain their margins. It’s a vital reminder that British manufacturers must revise their operations and upskill their workers in order to embrace digitisation and work towards long-term growth, improved worker safety, and productivity.” Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, points out that export growth remains modest, despite the improvement at supply chains: UK January final manufacturing PMI hit 57.3, firmly above the 50 boom-bust divide and comfortably topping expectations for 56.9. However it was a slight slowdown month-on-month following December’s 57.9 point reading, extending the declines we’ve seen since the peak in May last year. In the UK’s latest monthly GDP estimate for November, manufacturing was the biggest contributor to the production sector, increasing by 1.1%, with positive growth in 9 out of the 13 manufacturing sub-sectors. As supply chain bottlenecks start to ease, manufacturing and production have started to pick up. However demand growth remains sluggish driven by a slowdown in exports. Duncan Brock, Group Director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, says: “The UK economy continued to strengthen at the beginning of the year buoyed up by strong confidence amongst the UK’s makers, higher job creation levels and output at the strongest rate since July 2021. “There was some disappointment in the lowest levels of new orders since February 2021 but moderate improvements in export orders balanced out the weaker rise in domestic work. But price pressures remain at “stomach-churning levels”, he adds: Prices rose for another month and every month for the last two years as higher food, energy and material prices continue to act as a drag on business costs and recovery in the UK marketplace.” British manufacturing output grew at the fastest pace in six months in January as factories shrugged off the impact of Omicron, and global supply chain pressures began to ease. Factories have reported that output and employment grew at a faster rate last month, while inflation pressures became less intense. The IHS Markit/CIPS Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) showed the output index rose to 54.5 in January - its highest since July 2021 - up from 53.6 in December. That’s stronger than an initial flash estimate of 53.8 released last month, indicating that the economy may have strengthened as Covid-19 cases fell back from record levels last month. Markit says: Production volumes rose for the twentieth successive month in January. The rate of expansion accelerated for the third month running to its highest since July 2021. Increased output reflected rising new order intakes, efforts to tackle backlogs of work and a slight improvement in export demand. Some firms also noted that supply chain stresses, staff shortages and slower growth of new work had stymied efforts to raise production further. The headline PMI, which measures activity across the sector, dipped to a four-month low of 57.3 in January from 57.9 in December. It was pulled down by a slowdown in new order growth, and faster deliveries from suppliers, as the strains on global supply chains eased (delays push up the PMI, as they typically show higher demand, rather than supply chain disruption). But, manufacturers did warn that raw material shortages, supplier capacity, transportation delays and difficulty in sourcing goods were still issues. Rob Dobson, Director at IHS Markit, says: “UK manufacturing made a solid start to 2022, showing encouraging resilience on the face of the Omicron wave, with growth of output accelerating as companies reported fewer supply delays. Causes for concern remain, however, as new orders growth slowed, exports barely rose, staff absenteeism remained high and manufacturers’ ongoing caution regarding supply chain disruptions led to the beefing up of safety stocks. Here’s a breakdown of how UK supermarkets fared in the last three months: Supermarkets were up against ‘tough comparisons’ against the high demand of the lockdowns at the start of 2021, with spending still 8.0% higher than pre-pandemic times. Eurozone factories grew at the fastest pace in five months in January, as the manufacturing sector gained momentum. Data firm IHS Markit reports that production, new orders and employment all grew at a faster rate, alongside encouraging signs that supply chain issues are starting to abate. Its latest survey of purchasing managers across the euro area found that: Final Eurozone Manufacturing PMI at 58.7 in January, up from 58 in December, showing faster growth [any reading over 50 indicates expansion] Faster expansions in output and new orders; employment growth improves to five-month high Least marked deterioration in supplier performance for a year Austria (whose economy shrank in the last quarter of 2021 during Covid-19 lockdowns) had the strongest-growing manufacturing sector in January, while faster expansions were also seen in the Netherlands, Germany and Ireland. Manufacturing growth in Spain was strong and unchanged from December, while slower improvements were seen for Italy, Greece and France. Input price inflation eased to a nine-month low, meaning costs rose at a slower rate. But firms took “a more aggressive approach to price setting”, with factory gate charges rising at a faster rate -- showing that inflationary pressures are still rippling through the economy. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit said: “Eurozone manufacturers appear to be weathering the Omicron storm better than prior COVID-19 waves so far, with firms reporting the largest production and order book improvements for four months in January. Prospects have also brightened, with a further easing in the number of supply chain delays playing a key role in prompting producers to revise up their expectations for growth in the coming year to the highest since last June. Prices of savoury snacks, crisps and beef rose the most as grocery inflation increased to 3.8% in the four weeks to January 23, reports Reuters, adding: Kantar also noted there was evidence of people scrubbing up as work from home directives ended and socialising increased. It said razor blade sales rose by 14% and spend on deodorant increased by 20% as Britons strived to make themselves presentable. There was also a Dry January effect -- sales of alcohol-free beer rose by 5%, while sales of retailer’s own-label ‘healthy’ ranges were up 8%. Annual shopping bills in the UK are set to rise by around £180 on average as inflation pushes up the cost of groceries. Market analysts Kantar report that annual grocery price inflation rose to 3.8% over the last four weeks (to 23 January), up 0.3 percentage points from December. Prices are rising on many fronts, and the weekly shop is no exception, says Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight, at Kantar’s Worldpanel Division. Like-for-like grocery price inflation, which assumes that shoppers buy exactly the same products this year as they did last year, increased again this month. Taken over the course of a 12-month period, this 3.8% rise in prices could add an extra £180 to the average household’s annual grocery bill. This squeeze is likely to push shoppers towards low-cost products, McKevitt adds: We’re now likely to see shoppers striving to keep costs down by searching for cheaper products and promotions. Supermarkets that can offer the best value stand to win the biggest slice of spend.” Last month, journalist and campaigner Jack Monroe warned that lower-cost alternatives were “stealthily being extinguished from the shelves”, hurting the poorest in society: Kantar also reports that supermarket sales in the UK fell by 3.8% over the latest 12-week period, despite the omicron variant hitting hospitality over the Christmas period. Basket sizes are now 10% smaller than this time last year, hitting their lowest level since the beginning of the pandemic, while footfall increased by 5% as every major retailer was busier in their stores. McKevitt adds: Changing habits were most marked in London, where take-home sales of food and drink decreased by 11%. This suggests that people in the capital were the quickest to embrace eating out in cafés, pubs and restaurants, as many of us returned to city centres. Retail analyst Steve Dresser, the chief executive of Grocery Insight, has tweeted more key points: In the City, stocks have made a solid start to February. The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares has jumped 0.9%, or 70 points, to 7534 points. Investment trust Scottish Mortgage, which invests in technology companies, is leading the risers, up 3.3%, following the recovery on the Nasdaq last night. Mining companies are also higher. European stock markets have also rallied in early trading, after a weak January. Graham Cox, founder of the Bristol-based Self-Employed Mortgage Hub, reports that the cost of living squeeze is weighing on demand: “Mortgage demand has picked up a little in the second half of January. But overall, we’re noticing borrowers are turning cautious, fearful of the economic outlook. While there is a fundamental shortage of properties on the market, and housing supply generally, all the factors on the demand side are going in the wrong direction. National Insurance, energy bills, the cost of food, fuel and mortgages are all going up. There could be a rude awakening in 2022 for those who believe house prices can only ever go up.” Limited supply of homes on the market could support prices, though, points out Andrew Montlake, managing director of the UK-wide mortgage broker, Coreco: “Though the property market smashed it in January, the rest of the year will likely see a cool-down in the rate of price growth due to inflation and rising interest rates. However, values are unlikely to fall as mortgage rates remain exceptionally low, people are keen to avoid renting and the ‘race for space’ continues apace. As ever, prices are also being propped up by a chronic lack of supply.” Britain’s housing market has made its strongest start to the year since 2005, with annual house price growth rising to 11.2%, according to the UK’s biggest building society. Nationwide said the average price of a home hit £255,556 in January, the sixth consecutive monthly increase. The annual growth rate accelerated 0.8 percentage points from 10.4% the previous month, reaching its highest level since June. Robert Gardner, Nationwide’s chief economist, said: “Housing demand has remained robust. Mortgage approvals for house purchase have continued to run slightly above pre-pandemic levels despite the surge in activity in 2021 as a result of the stamp duty holiday, which encouraged buyers to bring forward their transactions to avoid additional tax. “Indeed, the total number of property transactions in 2021 was the highest since 2007 and around 25% higher than in 2019, before the pandemic struck. At the same time, the stock of homes on estate agents’ books has remained extremely low, which is contributing to the continued robust pace of house price growth.” Here’s the full story: Irn-Bru owner AG Barr is lifting its prices as it battles rising cost pressures. In a trading update, AG Barr reports that it is facing inflationary pressures, particularly across packaging and energy linked commodities, and responding with higher prices. We have initiated several cost control actions to reduce the impact of these rising costs and have adjusted our pricing with customers where appropriate. With the published rate of inflation in the UK now above 5%, the highest level for 20 years, we will continue to seek opportunities across the coming year to offset the impact on our business. AG Barr also makes the Rubicon sparkling drinks range, and Funkin cocktail mixers. It says trading was strong in the year to 30 January 2022, with sales expected to be 17.5% higher than the previous year -- marginally ahead than its revised guidance issued in November. Irn-Bru was a surprise hit at the Cop26 climate talks three months ago, with US congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez posting an Instagram video of herself praising the beverage. Marc von Grundherr, director of London estate agent Benham and Reeves, says demand is picking up in the capital (after the pandemic encouraged people to move of London): The London market looks poised to outperform the wider UK over the coming year. We’ve seen a huge uplift in both tenant and homebuyer demand following the pandemic inspired exodus and many have now realised that London is where they want to be, not just where they need to be. Foreign homebuyers are also returning at quite a rate, many of whom are unphased about rising inflation or the resulting increase in interest rates and this will help rejuvenate the London property market considerably.” Property experts are agreeing that the market will slow during 2022, after a rapid start to the year: Jeremy Leaf, north London estate agent, says the market was resilient in January: ’[Nationwide’s survey] It confirms what we have seen on the ground – a resilient market with prices still rising in response to improving but continuing low stock levels. ‘Looking forward, higher interest rates and inflation will inevitably have some impact on the pace of price increases and number of transactions.’ Tomer Aboody, director of property lender MT Finance, says an ‘overflow’ of deals boosted the market in January: ‘A strong start to 2022 with the overflow of deals which didn’t transact in December continues the trend of the extraordinary past 15 months or so, with near continuous growth month-on-month. ‘There’s still huge demand from buyers who are taking advantage of the low interest rate environment and stretching themselves to get their dream home. ‘However, with interest rates expected to increase along with inflation, impacting disposal income and deposits saved by buyers, the market is likely to slow down this year as affordability gets tougher.’ Emma Fildes of property agency Brick Weaver also sees a slowdown later this year: While the outlook remains uncertain, it is likely that the housing market will slow this year, adds Nationwide’s chief economist Robert Gardner. He points out that house price growth has outstripped earnings growth by a wide margin since the pandemic struck and, as a result, houses are less affordable: “For example, a 10% deposit on a typical first-time buyer home is now equivalent to 56% of total gross annual earnings, a record high. Similarly, a typical mortgage payment as a share of take-home pay is now above the long run average, despite mortgage rates remaining close to alltime lows. The pressures on household finances will also dampen demand: “Consumer price inflation reached 5.4% in December, its fastest pace since 1992.This is more than double the Bank of England’s 2% target and inflation is set to rise further in the coming months as the energy price cap is increased. This rapid rise in inflation has been an important factor denting consumer confidence in recent months, especially how people see their own personal financial situation evolving, although as yet, this has done little to dent housing market activity. Plus, higher interest rates could cool the markets -- if it leads to higher mortgages rates, Gardner concludes: This will further reduce housing affordability if it feeds through to higher mortgage rates, although to date a significant proportion of the rise in longer term interest rates seen in recent months has been absorbed by lenders Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. UK house prices have begun 2022 with strong gains, as robust demand and a shortage of properties for sale continue to support the market. Average house prices jumped by 0.8% in January, lender Nationwide reports this morning, which lifts the annual rate of house price inflation to 11.2%, up from 10.4% in December. It’s the strongest start to the year since 2005, and takes the average house price on Nationwide’s survey to £255,556 mark. It’s the sixth consecutive monthly increase in house prices, explains Robert Gardner, Nationwide’s chief economist: “Housing demand has remained robust. Mortgage approvals for house purchase have continued to run slightly above pre-pandemic levels, despite the surge in activity in 2021 as a result of the stamp duty holiday, which encouraged buyers to bring forward their transactions to avoid additional tax. “Indeed, the total number of property transactions in 2021 was the highest since 2007 and around 25% higher than in 2019, before the pandemic struck. “At the same time, the stock of homes on estate agents’ books has remained extremely low, which is contributing to the continued robust pace of house price growth. Higher borrowing costs might slow the market this year, though, as the cost of living crisis also squeezes household budgets. The Bank of England is widely expected to raise UK interest rates on Thursday, from 0.25% to 0.5%, after inflation hit its highest levels in almost 30 years. Also coming up today Surveys of purchasing managers in the UK, US and eurozone will show how factories were hit by omicron, and the persistent supply chain problems, in January. European stock markets are on track to open higher, as investors look to put January behind them. As we blogged last night, the pan-European Stoxx 600 fell almost 5% last month, the worst month since October 2020. On Wall Street, the US S&amp;P 500 lost 5.3% during January, its weakest performance since March 2020, as worries about US interest rate rises hit tech stocks hard. 2022 has certainly been volatile, with energy stocks surging and technology notable weak: Markets are adjusting to the Federal Reserve’s phasing out of the massive stimulus provided over the last two years, says Naeem Aslam of Avatrade. Moving forward, the American economy is expected to expand further, and companies are expected to report solid earnings supported by strong demand and a global economic recovery. Furthermore, the Federal Reserve is likely to continue tapering with extreme caution so that investors are not scared off and a tantrum is avoided. This perspective was evident in Esther George’s, President of the Kansas City Fed, comments that it is in “no one’s interest to try to upset the economy with unexpected adjustments” and that Fed officials are working hard to keep shifts in its monetary policy “gradual” and less “disruptive”.

Presenter Nick Robinson concludes the programme by saying Liz Truss is still considering an interview request from the programme and has been unable to fit in a slot in her schedule thus far. Truss had declined to be interviewed by Andrew Neil on Channel 4 last month. Liz Truss signals Kemi Badenoch would get promotion to cabinet if she became PM. Liz Truss told GB News she would like to see Britons use Dutch ports more as alternative to French ones. The Rishi Sunak campaign is now formally accusing Liz Truss of doing a U-turn following her concession that she is considering offering people payments to help them with energy costs. (See 10.11am, 11.40am and 3.45pm). Last week she ruled out giving people “handouts”. A spokesperson for the Sunak campaign said: “This is a major U-turn on the biggest issue currently facing the country.” Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, has revealed that, when she met Liz Truss at the Cop26 climate crisis conference in Glasgow last year, one of the main things Truss was interested in was how to get featured in the fashion magazine Vogue. And when Truss learned that Sturgeon had appeared in it twice already, Truss “looked a little bit as if she’d swallowed a wasp”, Sturgeon said. Bridget Phillipson, the shadow education secretary, told BBC Breakfast that the party would be proposing extra measures “very, very soon” on tackling rising energy bills. This blog is closing now. Thanks for reading. The Guardian’s Peter Walker on Sunak’s interview. Jeremy Corbyn has said he stands by statements he made on the supply of western weapons to Ukraine. In an interview with Al Mayadeen in July he said “pouring arms in” would “prolong and exaggerate” the war, saying more effort should be placed on securing a ceasefire. Al Mayadeen is a Middle Eastern TV channel based in Lebanon seen as being sympathetic to the Syrian government and Hezbollah, PA reports. On Wednesday, the former Labour leader spoke to LBC’s Iain Dale at an event during the Edinburgh Fringe. The Islington North MP said his removal from Labour’s parliamentary group was “completely wrong” and also described the Aukus defence deal between the UK, US and Australia as “dangerous”. Dale said asked him about his comments on Al Mayadeen and whether he wanted the supply of weapons to Ukraine to stop. Corbyn said: “I think the words I used was, the only policy being followed by most of the west is to pour arms into the Ukraine. “The point I was making was there is nobody as far as I can see pushing enough to get some kind of ceasefire.” Robinson concludes the programme by saying Liz Truss is still considering an interview request from the programme and has been unable to fit in a slot in her schedule thus far. Truss had declined to be interviewed by Andrew Neil on Channel 4 last month. Robinson ends with a question about the series of emergencies the country is embroiled in after 12 years of Conservative rule. Sunak said: “Well, no actually, there was lots that I was very proud of to have participated in government. “We talked about the pandemic response, protecting over 10M jobs, saving business, ensuring that our economy remained resilient through the worst shock it had faced in 300 years. “I’m proud of what I achieved in government, I’m not going to run away from that and actually, that’s why people should now look at me as the person who can be the person to lead us forward. “I’ve got the experience to handle difficult things. They know that because they’ve seen it.” On accusations that he is a “gloomster”, Sunak responds: “Nick, we started this programme, you put a graphic up there that talked about energy bills going up to almost £4,000. “No amount of boosterism language is going to help Graham figure out how to get through the winter. “What we need is someone who actually understands what’s going on, has got a clear sense of how to manage our economy through what is going to be a challenging time. “Focus on getting the help to people like Graham that we’ve talked about and then bring this country to a place where it can look forward to a much brighter future. “That’s what I can do and no amount of starry-eyed boosterism is going to solve any of the emergencies that we’ve just talked about.” On his position as the underdog with three weeks to go, Sunak says: “I knew what I was doing when I got into this and I was going to tell people what I think they needed to hear, not necessarily what they wanted to hear. “As I said, I would rather lose having fought for the things that I passionately believe are right for our country and being true to my values than win on a false promise.” On criticism that he resigned by tweet after thinking about it for months, Sunak replies: “No actually resigning is a difficult thing to do, and I did it because it came to a point where enough was enough for me. “I had a big difference of opinion on how to manage the economy, it’s not possible for a chancellor and prime minister not to be on the same page as that, and you’re seeing that in this leadership contest, because there are two very different approaches to how I think we should do it.” On whether he told Boris Johnson he was no longer fit to be PM, Sunak said: “No. I just resigned, Nick, it was clear he was not going to go, he’d made that crystal clear.” He added: “Well I’ve had many conversations with the prime minister over the time that I’ve been in office with him, I’m sure, I know we talked about lots of things, right, and I’m not going to sit here and talk to you about private conversations I have, that wouldn’t be right…” On a perceived lack of experience for the job as PM and the ability to look “at a dictator in the eye”, Sunak said: “Yes, because throughout my career, in politics and before, I’ve been willing to stand up for things that I believe in and fight for them. “You talked about Brexit, a lot of pressure was put on me not to support that, and I did. When it came to locking down the country last December with omicron, that’s what lots of people wanted to do, I stood up against the system and I said no. When it comes to wanting to reform the NHS, I’m prepared to have some difficult conversations; so yes, being tough and making sure that I focus on the things that matter is core to who I am and as chancellor I designed a very stringent packet of economic sanctions to do exactly that with Putin.” On Ukraine, Sunak says the defence secretary deserves credit for being one of the first to make sure that we provide arms to Ukraine. “I will continue with that policy, continually strengthening Ukraine, and continuing to weaken Russia. I did that as chancellor, I put in place a set of economic sanctions, together with my colleagues from around the world, that are tightening the grip on Putin’s war machine and I would want to do more of that as prime minister, and actually when it comes to energy, one of the things I was working on as chancellor, was a different way of doing the sanctions on Russia to see if we could find a way to do it, which would actually mean that we don’t have such high energy bills and could cut off the supply of money to them, and I’d like to find a way to make that work as PM.” On the long queues at Dover last month, Sunak says on the French side appropriate staff need to be in place, which did not appear to be the case then. On the previous Tory promise of bringing net migration down to tens of thousands, Sunak dodges the question and says the most pressing problem is illegal immigrants coming across the Channel. On climate change and the target of the UK reaching net zero by 2050, Sunak says he believes in the target and wants to focus on innovation and how we power our homes. On his previous comments that the NHS was “swallowing up cash”, Sunak says the NHS needs to use the resources it has and reform. And he wants to tackle missed appointments by having people cancel them in advance. On NHS funding, the former chancellor says from this point on it is “about getting reform and efficiency” out of it having previously given an injection of funding to help with the pandemic. Sunak says he stands by the video footage of him saying he had diverted funds away from deprived urban areas. He says he stands by the comments and government support is required in small towns and rural areas too. In response to Martin Lewis’s comments that rising energy bills is a “crisis” on the scale of the Covid pandemic, Sunak says his package of support at the time was praised by Lewis and independent commentators for being “well targeted and helped the poorest”. Sunak keeps on the line that the tax cuts proposed by Truss benefit “very large companies” and not pensioners. Sunak says his approach differs from Liz Truss’s approach which is billions of extra borrowing each year. For those on the lowest incomes, Sunak said he has proposed extra top-up payments. For pensioners, he pledges an extra payment in the winter, which he estimates will be a few billion pounds. Sunak reiterates that he will reduce VAT on energy bills this autumn, which Nick Robinson says will be £150 on average. Sunak does not give the specifics of the help he will offer, adding the situation is about £400 worse than when the package of support was announced. Sunak told the BBC there was a “moral responsibility” to get extra help to people with energy bills this winter. He said: “I do feel a moral responsibility as prime minister to go further and get extra help to people over the autumn and the winter to help them cope with what is going to be a really difficult time. “I think that is the right priority.” Sunak said he will go further in his help for families as the “situation is worse” than when he announced the package of support. Rishi Sunak’s interview with Nick Robinson is coming up on BBC One at 7pm, which we will be liveblogging. Asked if the base was a legitimate target for the Ukrainians to strike, Wallace said: “First and foremost, Russia has illegally invaded, not just in 2014, but now Ukrainian territory. “Ukraine, under United Nations articles, is perfectly entitled to defend its territory and take what action it needs to against an invading force. “So, is it legitimate? It’s absolutely legitimate for Ukraine to take lethal force, if necessary, but take force in order to regain not only its territory, but also to push back its invader. “And that air force base has been used by Russian air forces to bomb Ukrainian targets. So I think in anybody’s sort of manual of war it would be a legitimate target.” Ben Wallace said the UK has “pretty much dismissed” most of the Russian “excuses” for explosions at an air base in Crimea, and said he thinks the site would be a “legitimate target” for the Ukrainians. The defence secretary told the BBC: “I think when you just look at the footage of two simultaneous explosions not quite next to each other, and some of the reported damage even by the Russian authorities, I think it’s clear that that’s not something that happens by someone dropping a cigarette.” Truss has come under renewed pressure to spell out how she would shield families from energy price hikes as she was confronted face to face by a social housing manager who said he was looking for a second job in order to pay his own family’s bills. Challenged by a question from a viewer on GB News who said that her mother was “petrified” of winter, the foreign secretary declined to say that she would make direct payments but reiterated her plans to reverse the recent increase in national insurance and to temporarily suspend green levies on energy bills. “I completely understand how bad it is and that families are struggling with costs of food and energy,” she told a questioner who said that tenants who he knew from his job as a social housing manager were in distress because of worries about fuel costs. He told her that his own energy bill has gone up from £180 a month to more than £300 and could go up to more than £500. Truss said she would do everything she can to help families “who work hard and do the right thing” and said that her plans could come in “well before April”, when the tax year starts. Challenged to get rid of VAT on gas and electricity, she said that all issues should be under consideration in an emergency budget. In answer to another question, about Britain’s fraught recent relations with France and the possibility of building up alternative trade links with the Netherlands, Truss said that she was an MP for South West Norfolk Norfolk and “loved the old Hanseatic League” – a medieval trading and defensive confederation encompassing northern European towns and cities. She said that King’s Lynn – a port which had been part of the League – was in her constituency and she “wanted to restore links like that.” Liz Truss got through her GB News Q&amp;A without running into any big problems. Her answers on the cost of living crisis were repetitive and not especially convincing, but the audience did not seem to react badly to her, and at one point she had the confidence to say no when asked if she could promise extra help for Waspi women. She got a bit of credit for that too. At 7pm Rishi Sunak will face his own grilling, from the BBC’s Nick Robinson. Here is a preview. That’s all from me for today. My colleague Nadeem Badshah is taking over now. Q: How do you feel about cats? What will your relationship be with Larry the Downing Street cat? Truss says she has a very positive relationship with Larry. She thinks she is one of his favourite ministers. And that’s it. The programme is over. Q: Do you support Lexit – Leigh breaking away from Wigan council? If we became independent, would our council tax go up? Truss says too much local government reform has been top down. There are council areas where people do not feel like they live. She says she has spoken to James Grundy, the Leigh MP, about this. He is a big supporter of Lexit. He has put a “very strong case”, she says. Q: How can you justify keeping VAT on fuel. It was a Brexit promise that it should go. It should go now. Truss says she is not a fan of taxes. She refers to the taxes she has promised to reverse. She will not make any promises. She cannot write the budget for a chancellor she has not yet appointed. Q: VAT on fuel increases inflation. Truss says getting rid of the green levy will have the same effect. She says her preference, when it is affordable, is always to have lower taxes. Q: I am a carer and I work very hard for just under £70 a week. We save money for the NHS. I am having to use my life savings. What will you do to help? Truss thanks the man for what he does. It is incredibly important, she says. She says it is better for people to be looked after by their families. She wants to look at the tax system to ensure it can better support people who do take time off to care for someone, she says. But she would have to see how that interacts with the benefits system. The questioner says carer’s allowance is a benefit. Changes to the tax system would not help, he says. Truss says she wants to ensure money goes to councils, so they can help. But we need to look at the system, she says. She says she does not have a detailed answer. But in principle she wants to help people caring for people at home. The questioner says government has had plenty of time to think about this. Carers cannot withdraw their labour, he says. Truss says she will support families “who do the right thing”. Q: Will you agree to a public inquiry into child sexual exploitation in Oldham and Rochdale? Labour keep blocking it locally. Truss says she will think about that. But she agrees that it is important to find the root causes of the problem, and some sort of inquiry sounds a good idea. Truss says she wants to make things work better in the health service. She wants it to have the extra funding it is expecting, but from taxation, not from the health and social care levy. But we face a massive challenge, she says. A huge backlog has built up because of Covid. She will look at the issue of doctors’ pensions, which is encouraging some of them to leave. And she says she would like to encourage people to return to work in the NHS. Truss says she will look at the issue of war widows losing their pension if they remarry. Q: What will you do to help the Waspi women? We were told there was no money to help them. But money is available for everyone else. Truss says she has huge sympathy for the Waspi women. She does think women have been treated unfairly. She will review the tax system. But, on the Waspi system, she says, although it was not handled well at the time, she does not think it is possible to go back. She has to be honest, she says. Q: The parliamentary ombudsman said there had been maladministration. They said there should be restitution. Truss says she does not want to make promises she cannot keep. She says she is sorry she is not able to promise anything. The questioner says an honest answer is good, but a positive one would be better. Q: What will you do to help first-time buyers? Truss says she wants more young people to be able to afford a house. She wants to ensure that people’s rental history can contribute to their qualification to get a mortgage. She also says she wants local communities to have more power over planning decisions. Q: Is it the job of the state to help people buy a house? The government regulates these things, Truss says. So it is involved. She says she wants its involvement to be more positive. Q: What will you do to stop grooming gangs. We live in a country where the police will turn up if you insult someone on Twitter, but they ignore grooming gangs. Truss says she agrees the police should not be policing Twitter. They should be fighting crime. She would have league tables for police forces, she says. She says what has happened in places like Telford is “repulsive”. And she says in some cases people like council officials have enabled these crimes. She will make sure these people are “gone after”. Q: A report on this said one problem was the political correctness meant the police were afraid to say Pakistani gangs were responsible? Truss says she wants to stop that. It is an endemic problem, she claims. Q: What will you do to stop future disruption by strikes? Truss says as soon as possible she will legislate to protect essential services from strike action. She is also concerned by protesters, like those from Extinction Rebellion, disrupting services, by gluing themselves to trains, for example. She will take action to stop that, she says. Nigel Farage, the former Ukip and Brexit party leader and a GB News presenter, was not impressed by what Truss said about small boats in the Channel. Truss says she will be looking for three things when she selects a ministerial teams. She wants people who are competent, people who have Conservative values, and people who are are loyal, and who get on with their jobs instead of briefing the press. (According to Truss’s critics, one of the worst offenders in recent years in terms of briefing the media has been Truss herself.) The questioner says she would like to see Kemi Badenoch in a major role, like foreign secretary. Truss says she thinks Badenoch is “brilliant” and wants her as part of her team. Truss signals that Badenoch would get promotion to cabinet if she became PM. Truss also says she wants a “leaner No 10”. Q: The number of migrants crossing the Channel is rising. This is having a massive impact on public services. What will you do to stop this? These people are illegal criminals. We don’t know who they are. Some have weapons. Truss says what is happening in the Channel is appalling. Boats are not seaworthy. This is a huge illegal operation. Q: Why can’t you revoke French fishing licences? That would focus their minds. And we should not be sending planes to Rwanda. It should be boats, stationed in the Channel. Q: Would you turn boats round in the Channel? Truss claims she had a “very tough” conversation with her French opposite number because they were not deploying enough staff at the border. The Northern Ireland protocol bill shows she can be tough. As for boats, she says it is more effective to put people on planes. Q: Why can’t we use Dutch ports more? The French have us over a barrel. Truss says she agrees. She is a Norfolk MP. She would like to see the King’s Lynn port used more. Presented with a question from someone who needs to keep the heating on for 10 hours, and who is petrified of winter, Truss just repeats what she said earlier. Stewart quotes Margaret Thatcher saying you cannot buck the market. Will Truss change the market, to stop energy companies making such big profits. Truss says she supports more fracking, and more nuclear power. Q: My energy bill has gone up from £180 a month to over £300. It could go up to over £500. What will you do to help me? I need to get a second job to get by. Truss says she understands how difficult things are. She would reverse the national insurance rise, and have a temporary ban on the green levies. She would do that on day one. Q: Can you literally do that on day one? Truss says she will do that as soon as possible. She will start on that on day one. It will go through before the next tax year starts. The questioner says he needs help now. Q: Rishi Sunak will give money straight away. You will change the rules by April. Truss says the moratorium on the green levy will save everyone money. But she wants to address the root cause too of why energy bills are so high. She will deal with supply. That will bring prices down. We are predicted to have a recession. So it is important to grow the economy. Truss says she will do everything she can to help families “who work hard and do the right thing”. Truss says people will only trust the Tories when they deliver. They want to see spades in the ground, the town transformed. Q: We are still shackled by the EU. What will you do to get EU law off the statute book? Truss says she will get rid of those laws by the end of 2023, and replace them with British laws. Q: What will you do for white working class kids? Truss says a third of kids are leaving primary schools without basic English and maths. She would address this. She wants more free schools. The GB News show has started. Q: This town has not seen much levelling up. What are you going to do about it? Liz Truss says Leigh had Andy Burnham as its MPs for years. What did he do for the town? She grew up in Leeds, she says, and she knows lots of parts of the north have been left down. She wants to attract entreprise and business. So she would keep taxes low, get Brexit done, get the EU laws off the statute book and generate wealth. She is someone who delivers, she says. Polling from Ipsos suggests a Labour government led by Keir Starmer would be better than a Conservative one led by Liz Truss in most policy areas, Keiran Pedley from Ipsos reports. Liz Truss is about to take questions from viewers on GB News’s People’s Forum. The programme is coming from Leigh, and Alastair Stewart is presenting. There is a live feed here. The Rishi Sunak campaign is now formally accusing Liz Truss of doing a U-turn following her concession that she is considering offering people payments to help them with energy costs. (See 10.11am, 11.40am and 3.45pm). Last week she ruled out giving people “handouts”. A spokesperson for the Sunak campaign said: This is a major U-turn on the biggest issue currently facing the country. It’s all very well offering empty words about ‘doing all you can’. But there aren’t lots of different ways to act on this. Taking action means providing direct support, which Truss had previously dismissed as ‘handouts’. Twice now, Truss has made a serious moral and political misjudgment on a policy affecting millions of people, after last week reversing plans to cut the pay of teachers and the armed forces outside London. Mistakes like this in government would cost the Conservative party the next general election. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, has said that she will make a judgment as to whether to lead the SNP into the next Holyrood election, in 2026, but that her “default assumption” is that she will. In her Q&amp;A with Iain Dale at the Edinburgh festival fringe (see 3.02pm) she was asked if she was worried about losing touch with public opinion after being FM for eight years. She replied: I think every person in a position like mine, particularly when you’ve been in a job like this for the length of time I have, you have to constantly be making sure that you are in touch. Now, I mentioned earlier on that in eight years I’ve fought eight elections as SNP leader. That’s a pretty good way of keeping yourself in touch and making sure you’re listening and hearing the messages of people. But you should never take that for granted. I like to think, in fact I know, that I’m surrounded by a family that if I ever got myself out of touch or above myself, would very quickly drag me back into line. The default position is that, of course, I will fight the next election. But I will make a judgment on that nearer the time, because this is a serious job and anybody in a job like this owes it to the public to make sure that they are certain they are the right person to do it, that they’ve got the energy to do it, that they’ve got the appetite, that they’re prepared to make the enormous commitment that a job like this involves, and to constantly be assessing and reassessing that. Rishi Sunak is losing his advantage over Liz Truss with the general public, new polling has found. PA Media reports: A poll from Ipsos showed the proportion of people saying they thought the former chancellor would make a good prime minister fell from 38% to 32% in the last week of July. Over the same period, Liz Truss’ figures have remained largely stable at 30%, giving Sunak a lead of only two points over the foreign secretary. Among Conservative voters, Sunak’s fall has been even steeper. More than half of 2019 Tory voters said he would be a good prime minister in a poll carried out on July 20-21, but that figure fell to just 42% 10 days later. The reverse is true for Truss, whose support among Tory voters rose from 46% to 53% over the same period. Keiran Pedley, director of politics at Ipsos, said: “Any public perception that the Conservatives would be more likely to win a general election under Rishi Sunak than Liz Truss appears to have disappeared.” The SNP says the UK government’s submission to the supreme court for the hearing on the legality of the Scottish parliament’s independence referendum (see 2pm) shows that it has run out of arguments for the union. In a statement the SNP MP Joanna Cherry said: Scotland voted to hold an independence referendum, and the Scottish government has a mandate to deliver that manifesto commitment – with the backing of the Scottish parliament. A clear precedent was set by the negotiations leading to the 2014 referendum, when there is a majority in the Scottish parliament to hold an independence referendum the two governments should come together and negotiate the details. The Tory government is desperate to prevent a referendum because it fears the result and has run out of any positive arguments for Westminster control. By arrogantly dismissing Scotland’s democratic decisions, Westminster is making the case for independence stronger. Liz Truss has issued a new press statement signalling that she is open to offering people payments to help them cope with rising energy bills if she becomes prime minister. It is the culmination of a U-turn (see 11.40am) that has been gradually under way since the end of last week, when she told told the Financial Times in an interview: “I would do things is in a Conservative way of lowering the tax burden, not giving out handouts.” In the press notice she still stresses that her priority is cutting taxes. But whereas at the Tory hustings last night she was happy not to match what Rishi Sunak was saying about the need to offer extra help to people who would not benefit from her proposed national insurance cut, or would not benefit enough, now she is suggesting that she would implement some sort of energy support package like the one he is proposing. This has all the hallmarks of the sort of correction you get from a campaign that realises it is on the wrong side of an argument. The press notice quotes Truss as saying: I understand how difficult the rising cost of living is making life for many, and if elected I will do all that I can to help struggling households. The press notice also points out that she has used language like this before in the campaign, and in an interview in the Evening Standard today she also talks about doing “all I can” to help people with fuel bills. The release also includes a quote from a campaign spokesperson accusing Rishi Sunak of “Gordon Brown-style politics of envy”. The spokesperson says: Rishi Sunak wouldn’t know how people benefit from a tax cut because he has never cut a tax in his life. People didn’t vote for the Conservative party to be subjected to old-fashioned, Gordon Brown-style politics of envy. Liz Truss has received two newspaper endorsements today – from the Daily Express, and from the Evening Standard. Truss has had plenty of other support from Tory-leaning papers too – although this does not seem to have stopped her demonising the media as leftwing. She did it three times during the Tory hustings last night. Here is the video. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, has revealed that, when she met Liz Truss at the Cop26 climate crisis conference in Glasgow last year, one of the main things Truss was interested in was how to get featured in the fashion magazine Vogue. And when Truss learned that Sturgeon had appeared in it twice already, Truss “looked a little bit as if she’d swallowed a wasp”, Sturgeon said. She was speaking in a Q&amp;A with the broadcaster Iain Dale, and responding to a question about Truss dismissing Sturgeon recently as an “attention seeker”. The comment attracted considerable controversy, partly because it was a slur against an elected head of government, and partly because Truss is not exactly publicity shy herself. Sturgeon said when she initially heard about the comment, she thought “it was made up, it was a spoof”. Then she said she met Truss at the Cop26 summit last year, shortly after being interviewed by Vogue. Sturgeon went on: That was the main thing she wanted to talk to me about, she wanted to know how she could get into Vogue – and she calls me an attention seeker. I said to her they came and asked me. I didn’t really mean to do this, but I said to her it hadn’t actually been my first time in Vogue, it had been my second time. It looked a little bit as if she’d swallowed a wasp. I’m sure she’ll be in Vogue before too long. I remember it because there we were at the world’s biggest climate change conference in Glasgow, world leaders about to arrive That was the main topic of conversation she was interested in pursuing. And once we’d exhausted that it kind of dried up. I’m sure we’ll have many more conversations about many more substantive things. Asked about her dealings with previous Tory leaders, Sturgeon said: I think perhaps uncharitably I described my conversations with Theresa May when she was prime minister, as being soul-destroying. I look back somewhat fondly now on that. At least May took the job of being prime minister seriously, Sturgeon said. By comparison, dealings with Boris Johnson were “one long bluster”, she said. You know, he was a third prime minister I’ve dealt with as first minister. It was literally like nothing I’ve ever dealt with before in terms of any senior politician. You know, I’m going to be blunt here, he was a disgrace to the office of prime minister. Downing Street has no plan to put a hosepipe ban in place in and around the prime minister’s residence, the Guardian can reveal, despite ministers calling for water companies to enforce restrictions. My colleague Helena Horton has the story here. At the Tory hustings last night Liz Truss said that, if she had the chance, she would vote to end the privileges committee inquiry into whether Boris Johnson lied to MPs about Partygate. Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, said today this showed: Liz Truss is continuing to prop up the disgraced prime minister even after he has been forced from office. She is aiding and abetting his attempts to dodge scrutiny and evade accountability to the public for his behaviour. Boris Johnson created a rotten culture at the heart of Downing Street and toxified the Tory party from top to bottom. Liz Truss enabled him and is showing she would continue to follow his lead if she is installed into No 10. Liz Truss must now confirm in no uncertain terms that she will not undermine the privileges committee and she will appoint an ethics chief on day one of her leadership. While the Tories offer more of the same, only Labour will stop the rot and bring the change our country needs. The UK government has published its legal submission to the supreme court explaining why it believes the court should declare that the Scottish parliament does not have the right to legislate for a second independence referendum. As PA Media reports, the Scottish government says its bill for a second independence referendum is lawful, under devolution law, because the referendum would only be advisory. But the UK government says this argument is not credible. PA says: Lord Stewart QC, the advocate general for Scotland, published his written submission on behalf of UK ministers today. It argues the case on whether a prospective bill, which would legislate for another referendum, would be within the powers of Holyrood. But the case, brought forward by Scotland’s lord advocate, Dorothy Bain, “does not fall within the jurisdiction” of the supreme court because the bill has not yet passed through the Scottish parliament, according to UK law officers. Stewart also argues that even if the court does decide it has jurisdiction over the matter, Holyrood would be unable to hold a lawful referendum Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, has stated she intends to hold a referendum on 19 October 2023, depending on the court’s ruling. Stewart said: “A referendum on Scottish independence plainly (at least) relates to the reserved matters of the United Kingdom of Scotland and England and of the parliament of the United Kingdom. That conclusion is unaffected by whether the referendum is, in its outcome, advisory or legally binding.” In its submission to the court, submitted last month, the Scottish government leaned heavily on any future referendum not being “self-executing”, meaning it would be purely advisory and only meant as a way to ascertain the views of the Scottish people. Stewart said it was wrong to consider the referendum as “advisory”. If the decision favoured independence, he said it would be used to “build momentum” towards the “termination of the union”. His submission said: “It is, of course, right that the outcome of the referendum provided for by the draft bill has no legal effect: it is not self-executing. But nor can it credibly be suggested that the outcome of the referendum will be advisory in the sense of being treated as a matter of academic interest only. “Were the outcome to favour independence, it would be used (and no doubt used by the SNP as the central plank) to seek to build momentum towards achieving that end: the termination of the union and the secession of Scotland. It is precisely in that hope that the draft bill is being proposed.” Speaking to reporters in Belfast, Nadhim Zahawi, the chancellor, also said that at his meeting with energy company bosses tomorrow he will encourage them to invest in energy security. He said: The moment I walked into the Treasury I tasked my leadership team to look at options so whoever is prime minister on 5 September they have options in front of them. So, all that work we need to make sure happens. What I want to do tomorrow is understand better how [the energy companies are] committed to that investment in gas, because whatever happens we need energy security and we’ve got a strong strategy that Kwasi [Kwarteng, the business secretary] and I will continue to push hard. The other area I want to look at is some of the energy producers, if you look at the renewable energy producers, the amount that they get paid is linked to gas prices. So, they haven’t changed anything they’re doing, they haven’t had any increase in their input costs at all, but they’re getting a much higher return because of the unusually high gas price because of Putin. I want to understand what they can do for their customers, what more they can do, because they’re clearly in a place now where they’re making very large profits because of that peg to the gas price. I think it’s important we all get round the table, I will continue to do the work I need to do as chancellor, but I also want to challenge them, to say are you making the investment? How can you help your customers? What more can we do together? That’s the reason for the meeting. Nadhim Zahawi, the chancellor, has defended the government’s decision to draw up contingency plans for power cuts this winter in the event of the UK running short of gas. He said he thought the UK would be “in a good place” in terms of energy supply. Speaking on a visit to Belfast, Zahawi said the government was making “all sorts of contingency plans” for what might happen over the winter. He went on: One of the reasons that I think we had one of the most successful vaccine programmes in the world is because we prepared for all sorts of scenarios. I am very, very confident that the work we will do with the energy producers and suppliers will mean we will be in a good place. Zahawi also said he would ensure the people in Northern Ireland receive the £400 per household payments promised by the government to help people with energy bills. There has been uncertainty about how these payments will be delivered in Northern Ireland because the power-sharing executive is not functioning. Zahawi said: My pledge is that we will operationalise this and deliver it because that is what the prime minister wants me to do, that is what I will do. Today is about making sure that I work with the utility regulator, with the economy and community ministers to make sure we now deliver against that, and do it as quickly and as efficiently as possible, so the meeting today is to make sure we get that done. Simon Clarke, the chief secretary to the Treasury and a leading Liz Truss supporter in the Tory leadership contest, has posted a thread on Twitter about her response to the energy bill crisis. He defends her decision not to announce firm proposals to help people with rising costs now, and says she will take decisions in the light of all the facts when, or if, she becomes prime minister. (Rishi Sunak has not announced firm plans for extra payments either, although he has been a lot more specific about the type of approach he favours.) Clarke also says Truss will “look at what more needs to be done” if she becomes PM and “do the responsible and honest thing by considering [proposals drawn up by government officials] when in office”. Given that these proposals are very likely to involve some form of targeted help for people most in need (because that is what the Treasury has done before), this is confirmation that Truss has moved quite a long way from last week, when she was ruling out “handouts”. Suella Braverman, the attorney general, is giving a speech to the Policy Exchange thinktank on equalities and rights. There is a live feed here. In a preview of the speech published in the Daily Telegraph, Braverman says she wants to clarify the law on trans rights as it applies in schools. She says: When it comes to gender-questioning children, we should always have compassion. At the same time, our compassion should never blind us to the harm it is possible to do to children by misplaced affirmation. Many schools and teachers believe – incorrectly – that they are under an absolute legal obligation to treat children who are gender questioning according to the preference of the child. Many are scared of the consequences of not doing so. I want to make it clear that it is possible, within the law, for schools to refuse to use the preferred opposite-sex pronouns of a child. She also says that schools that only offer gender-neutral toilets are acting unlawfully. China’s ambassador to the UK has been summoned to the Foreign Office over Beijing’s “aggressive and wide-ranging escalation” against Taiwan. Liz Truss, the foreign secretary and Tory leadership frontrunner, said in a statement that the Chinese government’s actions following the visit of the US House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, to the self-governing island were a threat to regional stability. Truss said: The UK and partners have condemned in the strongest terms China’s escalation in the region around Taiwan, as seen through our recent G7 statement. I instructed officials to summon the Chinese ambassador to explain his country’s actions. We have seen increasingly aggressive behaviour and rhetoric from Beijing in recent months, which threaten peace and stability in the region. The United Kingdom urges China to resolve any differences by peaceful means, without the threat or use of force or coercion. The Rishi Sunak camp are accusing Liz Truss of a U-turn in the light of her latest comments about cash payments (see 11.40am), my colleague Jessica Elgot reports. Liz Truss, the foreign secretary and frontrunner in the Tory leadership contest, has insisted that she is not ruling out giving cash payments to people struggling with their energy bills. In a pooled broadcast interview, shown on Sky News, when she was asked what she would do on this issue, she restated her commitment to cutting taxes, by reversing the national insurance increase and removing the green levy from fuel bills, as a priority. But, when she was asked if that meant she was ruling out cash payments in any form (or targeted support, as it could be described), she replied: That’s not what I said. What I said is my priority is making sure we’re not taking money off people and then giving it back to them later on. I believe in people keeping their own money and I believe in a low-tax economy. That’s the way we’re going to drive growth. I’m not going to announce the contents of a budget in the future at this stage in August, but I can assure people I will do all I can to make sure that energy is affordable, and that we get through this winter. The Mirror’s Dan Bloom takes this as a hint that a U-turn is coming. Arguably we’ve had the U-turn already. At the end of last week Truss told the Financial Times: “I would do things is in a Conservative way of lowering the tax burden, not giving out handouts.” But she abandoned that position at the weekend, and now she and her team (see 10.11am) are sounding ever more disposed towards “handouts”. The Rishi Sunak campaign are saying that Liz Truss’s policy on providing help to people with energy bill is now “as clear as mud” following the latest comments from her supporter James Cleverly. (See 10.11am.) These are from the i’s Hugo Gye. Keir Starmer is reportedly on holiday at the moment, and the parliamentary Labour party has been largely absent in recent days from the public debate about what the government should be doing about soaring energy bills. Instead people such as Gordon Brown, Ed Davey and Martin Lewis have emerged as the most vocal critics of the government. But Bridget Phillipson, the shadow education secretary, told BBC Breakfast this morning that the party would be proposing extra measures “very, very soon”. She said: We will hear further very, very soon about additional measures that Labour will put in place to make sure that families get the support that they need. She also claimed that, if Labour had been in power, it would already have taken steps that would have helped. “We would not have got to this point,” she said. She explained: We’ve known that this has been coming and we think we should cut VAT on gas and electricity bills to deliver immediate support to families and pensioners. Lord Howard, the former Conservative leader and a Rishi Sunak supporter in the leadership contest, has joined those Tories saying Liz Truss’s economic policies would be “suicidal” for the Conservative party. Dominic Raab, the justice secretary, said this in a Times article published yesterday, and Sunak himself made the same point during the hustings in Darlington. In an interview on the Today programme, Howard said: I really do agree with Dominic Raab that the method that Liz Truss is proposing would be suicidal. We’ve seen it before in the 1970s, it led to a recession and the Labour government, and I didn’t want to see it again. Howard, who served in the cabinet under Margaret Thatcher, said that Truss’s plans were similar to those of Anthony Barber, the chancellor in the early 1970s under Edward Heath. Barber cut taxes to inflate the economy, but the so-called “Barber boom” is now remembered as an economic disaster because it fuelled inflation. Howard explained: Anthony Barber, who became chancellor after the tragic death of Iain Macleod, cut taxes and increased borrowing, which is exactly what Liz Truss is proposing. The outcome of what Anthony Barber did, which was exactly what Liz Truss is proposing, was higher inflation, even higher inflation, more and more borrowing, recession and inevitably leading to a Labour government. Margaret Thatcher learned the lessons of those years. She did not countenance unfunded, irresponsible tax cuts, she hated inflation, she hated the thought of more borrowing and she took action, direct action, to deal with the problems. The Liz Truss camp claims the defection of Chris Skidmore (see 9.28am) could be the start of a “bigger exodus” of MPs from the Rishi Sunak campaign. A Truss campaign spokesperson said: We’re in talks with others from camp Rishi, and Chris coming over could trigger a bigger exodus of MPs from Sunak to us. Rishi’s flip-flopping on the economy is clearly upsetting a lot of his backers. Our supporters like Liz’s optimistic vision for the future, her Conservative plan for the economy based around tax cuts, and her credentials as a leader who will stand up to dictators like Putin and prioritise national defence. James Cleverly, the education secretary, was doing a media interview round this morning. He was speaking both as a member of the government, and as a support of Liz Truss for next Tory leader. This created some tension; at one point he was talking about what the government is doing now about energy bills, while at another point he was explaining why a full response would have to wait until the leadership campaign was over. Here are the key points. Cleverly confirmed that Nadhim Zahawi, the chancellor, and Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, are holding a meeting with energy company bosses tomorrow. The ministers will discuss increasing the scope of the windfall in the light of rising energy profits. Cleverly said: The chancellor of the exchequer and the business secretary are actually calling in the leaders of those big energy companies to knock some heads together and basically hold them to account about what they’re going to do with those profits. The increase in energy costs has been driven by the war in Ukraine and a global crunch, this is affecting everyone pretty much across the world, everyone in the developing world is seeing those energy bills go up. What we need to do is make sure that we have a short, medium and long term plan, so the chancellor and the business Ssecretary are getting those energy companies in as part of the short-term response. My colleague Alex Lawson has more on tomorrow’s meeting here. But Cleverly also said calls for an emergency budget now were unrealistic. He said that it was a “well-established principle” that an outgoing prime minister should not make major decisions and that the leadership contest could not be speeded up. He went on: In order to bring about changes to tax systems or to financial support systems, we need to have votes in the house, that needs to go through a proper scrutiny process. It is not as simple as recalling parliament to have an emergency debate on something like military action, which is a very simple one-question yes or no answer. An emergency budget needs to be a comprehensive and by definition, therefore, a complicated thing, it’s not just one day sitting, it’s an extended process of debate in parliament, and that is best done when Parliament has come back in September and that’s what Liz has committed to do. He insisted that Truss would bring forward “targeted help” for people needing help with energy bills in the emergency budget she is planning for the autumn if she becomes prime minister. In recent days Truss has refused to explicitly commit herself of offering extra targeted support to people struggling to heat their homes. She has not ruled it out (and she has resiled from the firm ‘no handouts’ position she set out in an FT interview last week), but she has repeatedly stressed that her priority is cutting taxes. In an interview on the Today programme, Cleverly said Truss would hold an emergency budget. He would not say what would be in it, but when it was put to him that tax cuts would not help people on benefits, or very low earners, he replied: She has said that she will look at support packages for people that need it most. So, for the people who won’t benefit directly from tax cuts, she is looking at targeted help. For those people who do pay tax, what she has, quite rightly, is to make sure that we don’t take any more money from them than we really need. This is quite different in tone, and a bit more committal in substance, from what Truss was saying at the Tory hustings last night. She avoided making commitments on “targeted help”, but Cleverly says she is “looking at” it. From the interview it was not clear whether this was an intentional shift, or whether Cleverly was just reflecting the widespread assumption at Westminster that, whatever Truss is saying now, she will have to offer people targeted support with energy bills in the autumn because the alternative would be social catastrophe. (This may be a good example of how leadership campaigns can be poor guides to future policy. Truss is campaigning in opposition to a policy she will probably end up implementing within months. In the campaign three years the main policy difference between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt was Johnon’s insistence the UK would have to leave the EU by the end of October 2019. Johnson won, and the UK was still in the EU at the start of 2020.) Good morning. Last week my colleague Aubrey Allegretti reported on how the Liz Truss team were hoping to get endorsements from Conservative MPs who had committed in public to backing Rishi Sunak. This sort of public vote-switching by MPs in a leadership contest is rare, because the MP involved looks duplicitous and indecisive and because MPs tend to know the candidates very well, which means they don’t change their minds easily. The story suggested the Truss camp might have been getting over-confident in their briefing. But (as usual) Aubrey was absolutely right, and in an article for the Daily Telegraph, Chris Skidmore, the former universities minister, has explained why he is defecting from the Sunak camp and backing Truss. He blames Sunak’s “constantly changing position”, especially on the economy. He says: The status quo cannot be an option. Initially, I had backed Rishi Sunak during the MPs’ stage of the contest. Yet over the past few weeks, I have grown increasingly concerned by his campaign’s consistently changing position, especially on the economy, to chase votes. I am convinced that we need a bolder, more positive approach to the UK’s future. Above all, we need a leader who will unite the party. Liz Truss has demonstrated that she has the leadership and personal ability to bring us all together. We cannot afford to be seen as a divided party, and I now believe that Liz is the best person to unite us and the country in meeting the challenges we face. At this stage in the contest, endorsements from MPs probably have no direct impact at all on members as they decide how to vote. But MPs tend to be quite astute observers of where the political wind is blowing and so, even though Skidmore is hardly a household name, his defection represents a significant morale boost for the Truss camp. There are now so many Tory MPs trying to clamber aboard the bandwagon that the campaign resorted to announcing the latest endorsements as a big job lot. Truss and Sunak are both doing major TV appearances later today. In the meantime pressure continues for both to make firmer commitments on what they will do about rising energy prices. My colleague Julia Kollewe covers some of the latest developments on that story on her business live blog. Here is the agenda for the day. 12pm: Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, is interviewed by the broadcaster Iain Dale at an event at the Edinburgh festival fringe. 12.30pm: Suella Braverman, the attorney general, gives a speech to the Policy Exchange thinktank on equalities and rights. 5pm: Liz Truss takes part in a People’s Forum for GB News in Leigh, Greater Manchester.

You had to be selective but, still, it’s a pity that we don’t get a glimpse, in your rear-view mirror, of the Spanish civil war. Not just for the event itself, but for the fact that it was here that the then Manchester Guardian distinguished itself for its journalism, for taking the trouble to print the truth rather than just the slogans on both sides. How sad is it that all the truth-telling in the world doesn’t seem to be able to stop human destructiveness in its tracks. Indeed, as we know, negative energies have always ensured that truth is the first casualty. Damian Grant Villeneuve d’Ascq, France • The 100 years of the Guardian Weekly commemorative supplement provided a splendid panorama of events since the very first Weekly of 4 July 1919. The French historian Fernand Braudel said events are like fireflies briefly lighting up history’s stage, some disappear into oblivion, some light up a dark corner, some reveal a wider vista of history. What they do not do is highlight the smouldering fires of change driving movements in global economic, social and cultural tectonic plates over time, over these past 100 years. It has been said that journalism is the first, rough draft of history; it is perhaps better to think of it as making a moment in time available for ever and that is priceless as we seek to clarify the past, understand the present and use imagination and hope, along with organising and campaigning, to create a better next 100 years. Stewart Sweeney Adelaide, South Australia • Congratulations on the very engaging 100th anniversary edition. I was perplexed, however, that Venezuela was positioned both in South America and north of Belgium, in what ought to be the Netherlands on your Global Report map (5 July). John G Soos Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada Private schools are at the root of Britain’s woes Gary Younge points out the problem at the root of our political system: the class divide, deeply reinforced by so-called public schools (12 July). I would support the political party brave enough to abolish this system. Of course, this requires a complete shift of attitude. It won’t come from the elite clique who assume they deserve power: it must come from ordinary human beings. Pat Bryden Edinburgh, UK Decrease in plastic was even more impressive The article on the banning of some plastics on the Pacific island of Vanuatu (5 July) says that the proportion of plastic in household rubbish went down from 18% to 12%, a reduction of 6%. This is another example of the difficulty in describing changes in a percentage quantity. The actual decrease in the amount of plastic is 38% because the final amount is 12% of a smaller total. This gives a more realistic description of the effect of the ban. Graham Davey Bristol, UK Trump can’t be expected to watch what he says Trump said: “Kim Jong-un was putting somebody in charge of the North Korean team who we know and who we like” (Border buddies, 5 July). This must be the world’s worst-ever job, seeing as North Korea executed five foreign ministry officials after the collapse of the Hanoi summit. If Trump does “know and like” this team, at the next summit he should be careful of what he says and how he behaves, which unfortunately for some, is highly improbable. Rhys Winterburn Perth, Western Australia Nuclear power is not a clean source of energy In your 28 June issue, your Global Report piece on the UK referred to “clean electricity generated by ... nuclear power reactors”.

Thank you for joining us for today’s live coverage. We will be launching a new blog shortly. In the meantime, you can read our comprehensive summary of the day’s events below. China is to begin its second day of unprecedented live-fire drills after launching huge military exercises in the air and seas around Taiwan on Thursday, including firing ballistic missiles close to the island some of which landed in Japanese waters. The exercises, which included rockets, attack helicopters and gunships, were arranged in reaction to a defiant visit to the island by the US House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, on Wednesday. The US condemned the missile launches. “China has chosen to overreact and use the speaker’s visit as a pretext to increase provocative military activity in and around the Taiwan Strait,” White House spokesman John Kirby said. Kirby also warned of the risk of a mistake and calculation of the drills, saying, “One of the things that’s troublesome about exercises like this or missile launches like this is the risk of calculation, the risk of a mistake that could actually lead to some sort of conflict.” US secretary of state Antony Blinken said he “hopes very much that Beijing will not manufacture a crisis or seek a pretence to increase its aggressive military action”. Foreign ministers from the 10-member Asean bloc, meeting in Cambodia this week, called for “maximum restraint”, without mentioning the US or China by name. In a statement it said the situation could lead to “serious confrontation, open conflicts and unpredictable consequences among major powers”. Japan said at least five of the 11 Dongfeng ballistic missiles fell into its exclusive economic zone, which extends 200 nautical miles (370km) from Japan’s coast. Japan also speculated that four missiles flew over Taipei, Taiwan’s capital city, according to a statement issued by its US embassy. Taiwan’s defence ministry said the missiles flew high into the atmosphere and constituted no threat to the island. Taiwan’s leader, Tsai Ing-wen, urged Beijing to “act with reason and exercise restraint” while maintaining Taiwan would not escalate conflict but would “resolutely defend our sovereignty, our security &amp; our democracy”. Foreign governments and multilateral groups including the G7 and the Association of South-east Asian Nations (Asean) condemned the hostilities and called for calm. The drills were in unprecedented proximity to Taiwan, and included PLA warplane and navy vessel incursions over the median line of the Taiwan strait – an unofficial border between China and Taiwan. Notices of the exercises identified six areas encircling Taiwan, with warnings for all ships and aircraft to “not enter the relevant sea areas and airspace”. On Thursday, local media reported the last-minute announcement of a seventh. Some of the zones overlap with Taiwan’s territorial waters, and are near key shipping ports. Several cyber-attacks also struck Taiwan, targeting websites of the defence ministry, the foreign ministry and the presidential office. Beijing’s Taiwan affairs office said the dispute was an internal affair. “Our punishment of pro-Taiwan independence diehards, external forces, is reasonable, lawful,” it said. Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen has called on Beijing to “act with reason and exercise restraint”. With China initiating military exercises in areas around Taiwan today, we call on Beijing to act with reason and exercise restraint. Taiwan will not escalate conflict, but we will resolutely defend our sovereignty, our security &amp; our democracy.” Taiwan’s defence ministry said missiles fired by China on Thursday flew high into the atmosphere and constituted no threat to it, responding to public concern about whether they passed over the main island of Taiwan. The ministry said in a statement it would not disclose the Chinese missile flight path due to intelligence concerns. Earlier, it said 11 Chinese Dongfeng ballistic missiles had been fired in waters around the island. Taiwan also scrambled jets on Thursday to warn away 22 Chinese aircraft in its air defence zone, the Taiwanese defence ministry said. All 22 Chinese aircraft crossed the Taiwan Strait median line, a ministry statement said. The last time China fired missiles into waters around Taiwan was in 1996. The Chinese government’s top diplomat Wang Yi walked out before the start of a gala dinner of foreign ministers at a meeting in Cambodia on Thursday and was seen leaving the venue in a vehicle, witnesses said. Wang Yi waved to media as he entered a holding room for the dinner then walked out of the venue, without giving a reason, according to Reuters journalists. Two witnesses working at the venue told Reuters Wang Yi was seen leaving in a vehicle. The dinner was attended by more than a dozen foreign ministers including US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Japan’s Yoshimasa Hayashi, and senior diplomats of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean). Japan’s foreign minister Yoshimasa Hayashi has also called for an “immediate stop” to China’s military exercises. “China’s actions this time have a serious impact on the peace and stability of the region and the international community. I once again demand the immediate stop of these military exercises,” Hayashi told reporters. His comments came after the Japanese defence minister said five Chinese ballistic missiles fired during the exercises were “believed to have landed within Japan’s (exclusive economic zone)“. Australian foreign minister Penny Wong has called for de-escalation in the Taiwan Strait and warned against the risk of miscalculation. “All parties should consider how they can contribute to de-escalating current tensions,” Wong told Agence France Presse. “One of the risks the region is concerned about is the risk of miscalculation.” Wong will join the Asean Regional Forum (ARF) on Friday, a 27-member body set up to discuss security issues. It’s just past 6am in Taipei. Here’s where things stand: The US said on Thursday that China’s launch of ballistic missiles around Taiwan was an overreaction to the visit of US House speaker Nancy Pelosi to the island. “China has chosen to overreact and use the speaker’s visit as a pretext to increase provocative military activity in and around the Taiwan Strait,” White House spokesperson John Kirby told reporters. China has called the US “the biggest saboteur of peace”, as its foreign ministry spokesperson slammed the US and US House speaker Nancy Pelosi for her recent visit to Taiwan. “Pelosi’s stunt is another bankruptcy of US politics, diplomacy and credibility. It proves the US to be the biggest saboteur of peace and the biggest troublemaker to regional stability,” Hua Chunying said. South Korea has temporarily cancelled its flights to Taiwan as a result of the ongoing military drills conducted by China. According to local Korean media, Korean Air cancelled flights between Incheon and Taiwan on Friday and Saturday. The airline also delayed the schedule of Sunday’s flights by an hour. Similarly, Asiana shifted Thursday’s flight up by three hours and cancelled Friday’s flight to Taiwan. US secretary of state Antony Blinken said Thursday he “hopes very much that Beijing will not manufacture a crisis or seek a pretense to increase its aggressive military action.” Addressing the Asean-US summit, Blinken said “many countries around the world believe that escalation serves no one and could have unintended consequences that serve no one’s interests, including Asean members and including China.” The Biden administration postponed a routine test launch of an air force Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile to avoid escalating tensions with Beijing amid China’s show of force near Taiwan, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday. US officials did not say how long the delay might last, but one said it might last 10 days, the report added. The US has been watching the Chinese military exercises near Japan “very very closely,” said John Kirby, the US’s national security council coordinator for strategic communications. In an interview with MSNBC on Thursday, Kirby said: “We’ve been watching this very, very closely. It’s concerning. It’s not just concerning to us, but it’s concerning, of course, to the people of Taiwan. It’s concerning to to our allies in the region, especially Japan.” Taiwan’s defence ministry said its troops fired flares late on Thursday to deter four drones that flew above the area of its Kinmen islands, which are just off the southeastern coast of China, Reuters reports. China has sent 22 fighter jets across the “median line” running down the Taiwan Strait on Thursday, according to Taipei’s defence ministry. The Ministry of National Defense said “air defense missile systems” were deployed to track the jets and radio warnings were broadcast, according to an update on its website. US House of Representatives speaker Nancy Pelosi and South Korea’s national assembly speaker Kim Jin-pyo vowed on Thursday to support deterrence against North Korea and achieve its denuclearisation. “Both sides expressed concerns about the dire situation of North Korea’s growing threat,” they said in a joint statement after meeting in Seoul. That’s it from me, Maya Yang, as I hand the blog over to my colleagues in Australia who will bring you the latest developments. Thank you. The US said on Thursday that China’s launch of ballistic missiles around Taiwan was an overreaction to the visit of US House speaker Nancy Pelosi to the island. “China has chosen to overreact and use the speaker’s visit as a pretext to increase provocative military activity in and around the Taiwan Strait,” White House spokesperson John Kirby told reporters, Reuters reports. Kirby called China’s actions part of a “manufactured crisis” and added that Beijing was attempting to alter the regional power balance. “It’s also a pretext to try to up the ante ... and to actually try to set a new status quo, to get to a new normal where they think they can keep things at,” Kirby said. “And my point coming out here today was making clear that we’re not going to accept a new status quo. “The temperature’s pretty high,” Kirby said. Tensions “can come down very easily by just having the Chinese stop these very aggressive military drills and flying missiles in and around the Taiwan Strait”, he said. Kirby confirmed earlier reports that the Pentagon had delayed a scheduled test launch of a nuclear-capable ballistic missile to avoid stoking tensions. “We do not believe it is in our interests, Taiwan’s interests, the region’s interests, to allow tensions to escalate further,” Kirby said. “As China engages in destabilizing military exercises around Taiwan, the United States is demonstrating instead the behavior of a responsible nuclear power by reducing the risks of miscalculation.” But he said the US navy’s USS Ronald Reagan carrier taskforce would remain in the area. According to a Chinese military-backed research group, South China Sea Probing Initiative, the Reagan was about 600 miles (1,000km) due east of Taiwan on Wednesday. Kirby said the carrier group has been ordered by the Pentagon to “remain on station in the general area to monitor the situation.” “We will not be deterred from operating in the seas and the skies of the Western Pacific consistent with international law, as we have for decades, supporting Taiwan and defending a free and open Indo-Pacific,” he added. China has called the US “the biggest saboteur of peace”, as its foreign ministry spokesperson slammed the US and US House speaker Nancy Pelosi for her recent visit to Taiwan. On Thursday, Hua Chunying fired off a series of tweets condemning the US and warning of Chinese retaliation. “Pelosi’s stunt is another bankruptcy of US politics, diplomacy and credibility. It proves the US to be the biggest saboteur of peace and the biggest troublemaker to regional stability,” she said. “This incident is single-handedly orchestrated and provoked by the US and the cause, consequences and merits of the incident are crystal clear. China has done everything that is diplomatically possible to prevent this crisis which has been imposed on China,” she added. Chunying warned that China will not “tolerate any act that harms our core interests” and that it will not “sit by and watch the US play the ‘Taiwan card’ to serve the US’s domestic politics and selfish interests of some politicians”. Describing the recent flurry of military drills China has conducted in recent days, Chunying said that they were “necessary countermeasures that are defensive in nature which have gone through serious consideration and careful assessment”. South Korea has temporarily cancelled its flights to Taiwan as a result of the ongoing military drills conducted by China. According to local Korean media, Korean Air cancelled flights between Incheon and Taiwan on Friday and Saturday. The airline also delayed the schedule of Sunday’s flights by an hour. Similarly, Asiana shifted Thursday’s flight up by three hours and cancelled Friday’s flight to Taiwan. Singaporean carriers have also been avoiding areas that are impacted by China’s military drills and live firing exercises, according to the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore on Thursday. CAAS said that China released a notice to airmen on Tuesday that banned aircraft from flying into certain areas that are affected by the live firing exercises between Thursday and Sunday. “Singapore carriers have taken note of the (notice) as part of their standard operating procedures and are avoiding the affected areas,” CAAS said. US secretary of state Antony Blinken said Thursday he “hopes very much that Beijing will not manufacture a crisis or seek a pretense to increase its aggressive military action.” Addressing the ASEAN-US summit, Blinken said “many countries around the world believe that escalation serves no one and could have unintended consequences that serve no one’s interests, including ASEAN members and including China.” “We’ve reached out to engage our PRC counterparts in recent days at every level of government to convey this message … Maintaining cross-stability is the interest all countries in the region, including all of our colleagues within ASEAN,” he said. He added: “The US continues to have an abiding interest in peace and stability across the Taiwan strait. We oppose any unilateral efforts to change the status quo, especially by force.” The Biden administration postponed a routine test launch of an air force Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile to avoid escalating tensions with Beijing amid China’s show of force near Taiwan, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday. US officials did not say how long the delay might last, but one said it might last 10 days, the report added. The air force had planned on conducting the test launch from the Vandenberg base in California. The test is usually conducted a few times a year to test the ICBM’s reliability. “This is a long-planned test but it is being postponed to remove any misunderstandings given the PRC’s [People’s Republic of China] actions around Taiwan,” a defense official told Wall Street Journal. In March, the Pentagon cancelled a flight test of a Minuteman III missile to avoid heightening tensions with Russia after Moscow invaded Ukraine. The US has been watching the Chinese military exercises near Japan “very very closely,” said John Kirby, the US’s National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications. In an interview with MSNBC on Thursday, Kirby said: “We’ve been watching this very, very closely. It’s concerning. It’s not just concerning to us, but it’s concerning, of course, to the people of Taiwan. It’s concerning to to our allies in the region, especially Japan.” In recent days, China has been conducting its largest-ever military drills near Taiwan following a controversial visit from US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to the self-ruled territory. When asked whether Pelosi’s trip triggered China’s military drills, Kirby said, “The provocateur here is Beijing. They didn’t have to react this way to what is completely normal travel by congressional members to Taiwan...The Chinese are the ones who are escalating this.” He also warned the risk of calculation of the drills, saying, “One of the things that’s troublesome about exercises like this or missile launches like this is the risk of calculation, the risk of a mistake that could actually lead to some sort of conflict.” Taiwan’s defence ministry said its troops fired flares late on Thursday to deter four drones that flew above the area of its Kinmen islands, which are just off the southeastern coast of China, Reuters reports. Taiwan has been on alert as China conducts a series of military exercises in response to a visit to the island this week by US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi. China has sent 22 fighter jets across the “median line” running down the Taiwan Strait on Thursday, according to Taipei’s defence ministry. The Ministry of National Defense said “air defense missile systems” were deployed to track the jets and radio warnings were broadcast, according to an update on its website. The median line is an unofficial but largely adhered to border that runs down the middle of the Taiwan Strait, separating China and Taiwan. It is rare for military jets to cross it. Over the last two years, Beijing has increased its military incursions into Taiwan’s air defence identification zone (ADIZ). The ADIZ is not the same as Taiwan’s territorial airspace but includes a far greater area that overlaps with part of China’s own air defence identification zone and even includes some of the mainland. The vast majority of China’s ADIZ flights occur off the southwestern edge of Taiwan. However, in recent days, there has been a significant increase in the number of median line incursions after Beijing announced massive military drills to protest US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to the island territory this week. Of the 49 incursions Taiwan reported on Wednesday and Thursday, 44 involved Chinese aircraft crossing the median line. U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and South Korea’s National Assembly Speaker Kim Jin-pyo vowed on Thursday to support deterrence against North Korea and achieve its denuclearisation. “Both sides expressed concerns about the dire situation of North Korea’s growing threat,” they said in a joint statement after meeting in Seoul. “We agreed to support the efforts of the two governments to achieve practical denuclearisation and peace through international cooperation and diplomatic dialogue, based on the strong and extended deterrence against the North.” Pelosi added that she and Kim talked about ways to boost cooperation on regional security and economic and climate issues. Pelosi arrived in South Korea on Wednesday night after her stop in self-ruled Taiwan which infuriated China. South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol did not meet Pelosi due to his scheduled vacation this week. Nevertheless, he held a 40-minute phone call with her where he promised close cooperation with the US Congress, Deputy National Security Adviser Kim Tae-hyo said. South Korean media speculated that Yoon could be shunning meeting Pelosi in person to avoid antagonising China, after her visit to Taiwan outraged Beijing, which claims the self-governed island as its own. Taiwan’s military has said it is “preparing for war without seeking war” after China’s military began an unprecedented four days of live-fire exercises close to Taiwan’s shores, in reaction to Nancy Pelosi’s visit to the island. Taiwan’s defence ministry said the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) had launched 11 Dongfeng series ballistic missiles into the waters north-east and south-west of Taiwan’s main island. Taiwan activated its defences as soon as the first missile was detected at 13.56 local time. Taiwan’s foreign ministry said it “strongly condemns” Beijing for “following the example of North Korea in willfully test-firing missiles into waters near other countries”. Taipei also called on the international community to “condemn China’s military coercion”. The People’s Liberation Army’s eastern theatre command announced it had conducted “long-range live-fire shooting training” in the Taiwan strait, including “precision strikes on specific areas in the eastern part”. It said “expected results had been achieved” but did not clarify what that meant. A Taiwanese official said about ten Chinese navy ships briefly crossed the median line – the informal line dividing Chinese and Taiwanese territorial waters – before they were “driven away” by Taiwanese navy boats. “They sneaked in, and were driven away by us,” they said. Taiwan also said multiple Chinese air force planes briefly crossed the median line several times on Thursday morning, forcing Taiwan to scramble jets and deploy missile systems to track their movement. Japan’s defence ministry said five missiles launched by China during the drills had fallen into its exclusive economic zone, which extends 200 nautical miles - or 370km -from Japan’s coast. Tokyo has protested to Beijing. Video footage purporting to show the launch of several missiles was shown on Chinese state television. The footage has not been independently verified. Taiwan’s de facto ambassador to the US, Hsiao Bi-khim, has said on social media that “China’s irresponsible and dangerous behaviour has jeopardised regional peace. Taiwan will resolutely defend ourselves.” The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, on a visit to Cambodia, said the US opposes any unilateral efforts to change the Taiwan status quo, especially by force, and its policy on Taiwan has not changed Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said China had the sovereign right to hold major military drills around Taiwan, and accused the US of artificially fuelling tensions in the region, calling Pelosi’s visit “an unnecessary provocation.” The Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, earlier described US house speaker Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan as a “complete farce” at meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) in Cambodia. “The irreversible historical trend of Taiwan’s return to the motherland cannot be changed. Those who offend China will surely be punished,” he said. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said China had no reason to overreact after Pelosi visited, saying “The US and other Nato allies have paid visits with high-ranking officials to Taiwan regularly over the years, and therefore this is no reason for China to overreact.” Notices of the exercises identified six areas encircling Taiwan, with warnings for all ships and aircraft to “not enter the relevant sea areas and airspace”. Some of the zones overlap with Taiwan’s territorial waters, and are near key shipping ports. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said that China has no reason to overreact after US politician Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan. Reuters quotes his saying: The visit of Nancy Pelosi is no reason for China to overreact or threaten Taiwan or to use threatening rhetoric. The US and other Nato allies have paid visits with high-ranking officials to Taiwan regularly over the years, and therefore this is no reason for China to overreact Japan’s defence ministry said five missiles launched by China during its drills near Taiwan had fallen into Japan’s exclusive economic zone, which extends 200 nautical miles – or 370km – from Japan’s coast. Tokyo has protested to Beijing. Taiwan’s defence ministry confirmed that 11 Chinese Dongfeng ballistic missiles had been fired in waters around the island today. The last time that happened was in 1996. Taiwan officials said the drills violated UN rules, invaded its space and threatened free air and sea navigation. In response to Taiwan’s protests against the military drills, Reuters reports that China’s Beijing-based Taiwan Affairs Office said: “Our punishment of pro-Taiwan independence diehards, external forces, is reasonable, lawful.” Here are a couple of images sent to us from Beijing today, where people have been going about their day-to-day business while footage of China’s military exercises in the Taiwan Straits plays on TV screens around them. Taiwan’s de facto ambassador to the US, Hsiao Bi-khim, has said on social media that “China’s irresponsible and dangerous behaviour has jeopardised regional peace. Taiwan will resolutely defend ourselves.” She shared a post from Taiwan’s ministry of defence in which it confirmed that its defence systems had been activated once it had detected the firing of the first Chinese missiles at 1.56pm local time. China launched several Dongfeng ballistic missiles into waters around the north-east and south-west coasts of Taiwan early today. The US and Taiwan don’t officially have diplomatic relations, but Hsiao Bi-khim acts as Taiwan’s representative. Here are some still images of Chinese missile launches that have been shown on China’s CCTV state television today, which purport to be the missiles fired in Taiwan’s direction. The images have not been independently verified. Daily life continues in Taiwan, even with the increased political tension. Here is the full text of the statement issued by Taiwan’s foreign ministry today: On 4 August, China launched multiple ballistic missiles into waters to the northeast and southwest of Taiwan, threatening Taiwan’s national security, escalating regional tensions, and affecting regular international traffic and trade. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) of the Republic of China (Taiwan) strongly condemns the Chinese government for following the example of North Korea in wilfully test-firing missiles into waters near other countries, and demands that China exercise self-restraint. MOFA urges the international community to condemn China’s military coercion towards Taiwan. The ministry also calls on countries around the globe to continue to speak up in support of democratic Taiwan in order to jointly safeguard the values of freedom and democracy, to maintain the rules-based international order, and to ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific. The Associated Press has spoken to a couple of residents of Taiwan about the Chinese military drills. “Everyone should want money, not bullets,” joked one, referring to recent troubles in the economy. 63-year-old Lu Chuan-hsiong had been out enjoying his morning swim. He said he was not worried. “Because Taiwanese and Chinese, we’re all one family. There’s a lot of mainlanders here, too,” he said. Those who have to work on the ocean were more concerned. Chou Ting-tai, who owns a fishing vessel, said “It’s very close. This will definitely impact us, but if they want to do this, what can we do?” The video team at the Guardian have compiled some of the clips that purport to show China firing missiles into waters off Taiwan. Russia has backed China’s right to carry out military exercises. Reuters reports a Kremlin spokesperson said China had the sovereign right to hold major military drills around Taiwan, and accused the US of artificially fuelling tensions in the region. “The tension in the region and around Taiwan was provoked by the visit of Nancy Pelosi,” Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call. “It was an absolutely unnecessary visit and an unnecessary provocation.” The US opposes any unilateral efforts to change the Taiwan status quo, especially by force, and its policy on Taiwan has not changed, secretary of state Antony Blinken has told his south-east Asian counterparts. Cross-straits stability was in the interests of the whole region, Reuters reports that Blinken told a meeting in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. Taiwan’s foreign ministry has said China “imitated” North Korea by firing missiles into waters near the island earlier in the day and called for self-restraint amid high tensions with Beijing. It said it strongly condemned the actions, and called on the international community to jointly condemn China’s military threat. It urged other countries to continue to support democratic Taiwan, and to continue to hold up the international rule of law. In addition, Reuters reports Taiwan now says that the Chinese missile launches came in waves lasting from 1356 to 1600 local time. It is now just gone 6pm in Taiwan. Over at CNN, Brad Lendon has asked the question “does Taiwan have its own airspace?” and the answer is somewhat more complicated than you might imagine. De facto it does, but legally it is less clear. Lendon writes: Under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (Unclos), a country’s territorial boundaries extend 12 nautical miles (22.2km) from its coastline. The area above is considered the country’s territorial airspace. China is a signatory to Unclos, signing on 10 December, 1982, and ratifying it in 1996. Taiwan is not. Most countries in the world do not recognise Taiwan as an independent country. However, Drew Thompson, visiting senior research fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore and a former US Defense Department official, said most of the world treated Taiwan as if it were an independent country – and for that reason, it should be considered as having its own airspace. “Under that principle, then perhaps we decide that international law applies, in which case Taiwan’s airspace extends to 12 miles beyond its baseline. Beyond the 12-mile limit is international waters, international airspace,” he added. Thompson said there was also a matter of precedent and that even China’s military appeared to tacitly recognise this. Despite the “fact that the PLA doesn’t recognise Taiwan, they’ve respected Taiwan’s airspace,” he said. Chinese commercial aviation companies also respected Taiwan’s airspace, Thompson said, recognising a “convention that effectively treats Taiwan as independent under civil aviation guidelines.” The Global Times, which is a Chinese state media outlet, has published this video, which purports to show China launching missiles earlier today aimed at the waters around Taiwan. The video has not been independently verified. Earlier Agence France-Presse distributed this video, which it said are projectiles firing upwards in the Taiwan strait. Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council, the government body that manages Taiwan’s relationship with the People’s Republic of China, has issued a response to todays events. Reuters reports it said that the Chinese drills will not change the fact that the two sides don’t belong to each other, that it will be on high alert for infiltration and psychological warfare, and that using force will not solve problems and disagreements. It said it hoped both sides would see that peace and stability are beneficial to all people. In a statement yesterday, it had said: It is an objective truth that the two sides across the Taiwan strait are not subordinate to each other; no amount of maximum pressure from the Beijing authorities can change this. Our government remains consistent in our policy to maintain peace across the Taiwan strait: we firmly safeguard our national sovereignty and will never condone any “military invasion.” The Chinese Communist party’s illegitimate and unjustifiable actions have undermined the status quo of the Taiwan strait, put people’s lives and assets at stake, and severely breached the rules-based international order. Here are some of the latest images that have been sent to us from Taiwan. Taiwan’s military is on high alert, but spectators also appear to have gathered to watch the exercises being carried out by China’s People’s Liberation Army. Newspapers in Taiwan have understandably put Nancy Pelosi’s visit front and centre on their front pages today. Reuters reports that China’s eastern theatre command has said it has completed multiple firings of conventional missiles on waters off the eastern coast of Taiwan today as part of planned exercises. The relevant sea and airspace controls had been lifted after the firing was completed, a spokesperson at the eastern theatre command said in a statement. We earlier reported on claims of 900 rerouted flights because of the drills. Taiwan’s transportation department has clarified in local media that some of the identified zones for PLA activity – with the strong advice that air and sea craft steer clear – have impacted 18 international routes in and out of Taiwan. The department estimated this would affect about 900 flights over the three days that the drills are scheduled. Vietnamese media reported that up to 36 Vietnam Airlines flights and 82 VietJet flights have had to adjust their routes to northeast Asia and north America to avoid the drills. Agence France-Presse is carrying this image which shows plumes of smoke going up into the sky, which its journalists witnessed. Taiwan’s defence ministry appears to have confirmed those reports of missiles fired near Matsu. In a statement a short time ago it said the PLA had launched a number of Dongfeng series missiles into the waters northeast and southwest of Taiwan’s main island. Earlier the PLA announced it had conducted long range “precision strikes” into the Taiwan Strait at 1pm, and civilian videos purportedly of projectiles launching from behind an otherwise picturesque Chinese beach in Pingtan spread across social media. The Guardian has not independently verified the footage. We reported earlier that China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, is in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, for a meeting of the foreign ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) group. Reuters reports that, in another sign of rising tensions, China’s foreign ministry has confirmed that Wang has cancelled a planned bilateral meeting with his Japanese counterpart, Yoshimasa Hayashi. Two missiles were launched by China near Taiwan’s Matsu islands, which lie off the coast of China, at about 2pm local time. They were seen headed in the direction of the #2 and #3 drill zones previously announced by China, according to an internal Taiwan security report that has been seen by Reuters and confirmed by a security source. Taiwan’s military has said it is “preparing for war without seeking war”, after China’s military began an unprecedented four days of live-fire exercises close to Taiwan’s shores on Thursday, in reaction to Nancy Pelosi’s visit to the island. At midday local time, Chinese state broadcaster CCTV announced the beginning of “important military training exercise and organised live fire”, which are expected to include missile tests. Notices of the exercises identified six areas encircling Taiwan, with warnings for all ships and aircraft to avoid the areas. Some of the zones overlap with Taiwan’s territorial waters, and are near key shipping ports. Taiwan’s defence ministry has accused China of in effect mounting a blockade. A Taiwanese official said about ten Chinese navy ships briefly crossed the median line – the informal line dividing Chinese and Taiwanese territorial waters – before they were “driven away” by Taiwanese navy boats. “They sneaked in, and were driven away by us,” they said. Taiwan also said multiple Chinese air force planes briefly crossed the median line several times on Thursday morning, forcing Taiwan to scramble jets and deploy missile systems to track their movement. Unverified video appears to show live rockets being fired from the China towards Taiwan. AFP journalists in the border island of Pingtan saw several small projectiles flying into the sky followed by plumes of white smoke and loud booming sounds. Taiwan’s Maritime and Port Bureau has issued warnings to ships to avoid the areas being used. The Taiwanese cabinet said the drills would disrupt 18 international routes passing through its flight information region (FIR). Earlier today, amid the tension of the live-fire drills around Taiwan, China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, stressed his country’s efforts to strengthen ties with south-east Asian nations at a meeting with top diplomats from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. The Associated Press reports that in his opening marks, Wang did not mention the situation in Taiwan directly, but instead stressed how China and the ASEAN countries had strengthened cooperation in recent years. “We have safeguarded the oasis of peace in the face of the turbulence in the international security situation,” he said. ASEAN is made up of Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. Reuters is carrying some quotes from a Taiwanese official, who it says spoke to them on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue. The official describes todays events so far, saying about 10 Chinese navy ships briefly crossed the median line before they were “driven away” by Taiwanese navy boats. “They sneaked in, and were driven away by us,” the Taiwanese source said. Multiple Chinese air force planes briefly crossed the median line several times on Thursday morning, forcing Taiwan to scramble jets and deploy missile systems to track their movement, the person said. “They flew in and then flew out, again and again. They continue to harass us and increase our air defence pressure.” It is Martin Belam here on the blog now, you can contact me at martin.belam@theguardian.com Chinese state media outlets are reporting Beijing conducted long-range artillery live-fire shooting drills in the Taiwan Straits, noting that “expected results have been achieved”. “PLA Eastern Theatre Command Army conducted long-range artillery live-fire shooting drills in the Taiwan Straits, striking targets on the eastern side of the Straits and achieving the expected outcome,” China’s Global Times reported. “The Eastern Theatre Command of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) conducted long-range live-fire shooting training in the Taiwan Straits on Thursday at around 1:00 p.m. and carried out precision strikes on specific areas in the eastern part of the Taiwan Straits,” state broadcaster CGTN added. “The PLA Eastern Theatre Command said that expected results had been achieved.” Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi earlier described US house speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan as a “complete farce” at meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) in Cambodia. “The irreversible historical trend of Taiwan’s return to the motherland cannot be changed. Those who offend China will surely be punished,” he said. You can watch Wang Yi’s remarks in the video below. China’s military drills in the north, east and south areas bisect Taiwan’s claimed 12 nautical miles of territorial waters and encircle the island in an “unprecedented formation” a Chinese military professor has said. Meng Xiangqing, a professor at the National Defence University, told Chinese state television, the locations could provide a snapshot as to how an actual military operation against Taiwan could play out. “In fact, this has created very good conditions for us when, in the future, we reshape our strategic landscape conducive to our unification,” Meng said, according to a Reuters report. Chinese forces in two areas off the northern coast of Taiwan could potentially seal off Keelung, a major port, while strikes could be launched from an area east of Taiwan targeting the military bases in Hualien and Taidong, he said. The “doors” to Kaoshiung could also be closed by Chinese military off the southwestern coast, Meng added. Here are some of the latest images showing Chinese military helicopters flying past China’s mainland ahead of military drills off Taiwan this afternoon. China’s foreign minister Wang Yi has called US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan a “manic, irresponsible and highly irrational” action by the United States, state broadcaster CCTV is reporting. Wang, speaking at the Asean foreign ministers meeting in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, said China has made the “greatest diplomatic efforts” to avert crisis, but will never allow its core interests to be hurt. China’s current and future measures are necessary and timely defensive countermeasures, carefully considered and evaluated, aimed at safeguarding national sovereignty and security, in line with international and domestic law, CCTV cited Wang as saying. Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen has thanked the Group of Seven (G7) nations for supporting regional peace and stability after the group called on China to resolve tensions in the Taiwan Strait in a peaceful manner. Tsai, in a Twitter post, wrote: Taiwan is committed to defending the status quo and our hard-earned democracy. We’ll work with like-minded partners to maintain a free &amp; open Indo-Pacific.” Our south-east Asia correspondent, Rebecca Ratcliffe, has some more details surrounding comments made by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations as foreign ministers meet in Cambodia today. Foreign ministers from the 10-member bloc have called for “maximum restraint” regarding the Taiwan Strait, warning the situation could lead to “serious confrontation, open conflicts and unpredictable consequences among major powers.” The bloc, which is currently gathering in Phnom Penh, said in a joint statement that it is “concerned with the international and regional volatility, especially in the recent development in the area adjacent with the Asean region, which could destabilise the region and eventually could lead to miscalculation, serious confrontation, open conflicts and unpredictable consequences among major powers.” “Asean calls for maximum restraint, refrain from provocative action,” it added, without mentioning the US or China by name. Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi and his American counterpart Antony Blinken are both visiting Cambodia for talks with Asean ministers. However, they reportedly have no plans to meet together. While some Asean members, including host country Cambodia, have close ties to Beijing, others are concerned by China’s growing assertiveness, including in the South China Sea. The world is in dire need of wisdom and responsibility of all leaders to uphold multilateralism and partnership, cooperation, peaceful-coexistence and healthy competition for our shared goals of peace, stability, security and inclusive and sustainable development,” the Asean statement said. It also reiterated “Asean member states’ support for their respective One-China Policy”. We have a little more detail on how Taiwan is responding to the drills which began just after midday on Thursday. Ten minutes before the drills were due to begin, Taiwan’s department of defence issued a statement accusing the Chinese government of “irrational behaviour” with its live-fire exercises. The exercises had “the intention of changing the status quo and disrupting regional peace and stability”, it said. “The national army will continue to strengthen its alert, and troops at all levels will conduct daily training.” Meanwhile, the US Navy has said the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier was conducting scheduled operations in the Philippine Sea in the Western Pacific, a 5.7m square kilometre (2.2m square mile) stretch of ocean that includes waters southeast of Taiwan. “USS Ronald Reagan and her strike group are underway in the Philippine Sea continuing normal, scheduled operations as part of her routine patrol in support of a free and open Indo-Pacific,” a US Navy Seventh Fleet spokesperson said, as reported by Reuters news agency. Our correspondent in Taipei, Helen Davidson, is reporting that two unidentified aircraft are appearing on flight trackers around Taiwan. One has no call sign and has been doing laps of Taiwan’s southern coast in an area aligning with one of the PLA exercise zones, she reports. The second aircraft has since disappeared but carried the ID FFAB123... It was east of Taiwan’s Lanyu island before dropping off radar. A Taiwan-based pilot has since replied saying that the FFAB123 aircraft is likely a Seahawk and the one without a callsign is a Poseidon P-8. Both are likely US aircraft. As Beijing has confirmed its military drills are now underway, Taiwan has said it will strengthen its self-defence capabilities and closely coordinate with the United States and like-minded countries. Foreign ministry spokeswoman Joanne Ou made the announcement during a news conference on Thursday, when asked about China’s planned military drills. The series of military drills China is undertaking surrounding Taiwan can be seen in the map below. The Chinese military drills around Taiwan’s main island have started, according to Chinese state media. At midday local time, state broadcaster CCTV said: From 12:00 today to 12:00 [0400 GMT] on the 7th, the People’s Liberation Army is conducting an important military training exercise and organised live fire. During this actual combat exercises, six major areas around the island were selected and during this period all ships and aircraft should not enter the relevant sea areas and airspace.” The six identified zones surround the island, and occasionally overlap with Taiwanese territorial waters. Some are also very close to key ports and Taiwanese authorities have accused the PLA of in effect conducting a blockade - a very serious accusation. “The Eastern Theatre Command of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army on Thursday conducted large-scale military exercises and training activities including live-fire drills around Taiwan island,” the broadcaster added. Taiwan’s ministry of defence said its armed forces are “operating as usual” and monitoring surroundings. “We seek no escalation, but we don’t stand down when it comes to our security and sovereignty,” the ministry said. Multiple reports are suggesting that tensions in the region surrounding Taiwan has led to mass flight re-routing and cancellations due to China’s planned military exercises. BBC’s China correspondent Stephen McDonell reported that some 900 flights have had to alter their routes because of PLA military exercises off the coast and that 50 flights have been cancelled. Multiple airlines were advised on Wednesday to adjust their flight routes over the coming days to avoid six “danger zones” near Taiwan. The Guardian contacted airport authorities on Wednesday, who said the cancelled flights were unrelated to the Chinese military activity. Southeast Asia’s regional bloc Asean has warned that an increase in international and regional volatility could lead to “miscalculation, serious confrontation, open conflicts and unpredictable consequences among major powers”. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations made the remarks in a statement from foreign ministers after the bloc’s chair Cambodia had called on all sides to de-escalate tensions over Taiwan. The statement was released as China’s foreign minister Wang Yi met with his Asean counterparts in Phnom Penh. China’s ambassador to France has said the Taiwanese people would be “reeducated” after any successful annexation by China, in a fiery interview on French television. The ambassador, Lu Shaye, accused Taiwan’s governing Democratic Progressive Party of conducting “extremist” propaganda and turning the Taiwanese people against “reunification” with China. We will re-educate. I’m sure that...the Taiwanese population will again become favourable of the reunification, and will become patriots again,” he said. Online, many observers noted the term “reeducation” is also used to describe Chinese authorities treatment of Uyghurs and other ethnic Muslims in Xinjiang. There, authorities have sent an estimated 1-2 million people through what Beijing terms as “vocational education and training centres”. Human rights groups and other governments say they are in fact part of a massive detention network. Lu denied the re-education would happen under threat, comparing it to French education of students on the values of its republic. Challenged by the interviewer that Beijing wanted to have people thinking “correctly” in line with its own position because it did not like resistance, Lu said resistance “is not...the problem”. “The Taiwanese authorities apply an approach of... how should I say... slicing the salami - advancing bit by bit. If we don’t react, if we don’t respond, in the end they will achieve their goal: independence.” Lu said “the majority” of Taiwan’s population were in favour of formally becoming a part of China just one or two decades ago. It wasn’t clear what his claim was based on. An analysis of dozens of polls conducted by various organisations between 1994 and 2000 show that only on two occasions have a majority of respondents supported unification. Both were polls conducted by the policy council of the current opposition Kuomintang party, in 2000. All other polls showed support between 15 and 30%.Recent polling has found support for unification to be at record lows. One poll conducted by National Chengchi University’s Election Study Centre (ESC) in June found just 1.3% of respondents wanted unification “as soon as possible”, and 5.2% wanted to maintain the status quo before an eventual “move toward unification,”. China’s foreign minister Wang Yi has called US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan a “complete farce”. “The irreversible historical trend of Taiwan’s return to the motherland cannot be changed. Those who offend China will surely be punished,” he said. Wang made the remarks on the sidelines of the foreign ministers’ meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) in Cambodia on Wednesday. The United States is violating China’s sovereignty under the guise of “democracy,” he told reporters. Taiwan’s Tsai Ing-wen and others ride the coattails of the United States and act against the noble cause of the Chinese nation. These perverse actions will not alter the international consensus on the one-China principle, nor the historical trend that Taiwan will return to the motherland.” Taiwan has pledged to step up security against possible disruptions by “overseas forces” including cyber-attacks as tensions with China rise following Pelosi’s visit to Tapei on Wednesday. Taiwan Cabinet spokesman Lo Ping-cheng told a media briefing authorities had stepped security at key infrastructure including power plants and airports and increased the cybersecurity alertness level across government offices, according to a report from Reuters. Lo said Taiwan expects to be the target in coming days of increased “psychological warfare”, which describes influence campaigns including misinformation to sway public opinion. We are seeing psychological warfare that is stronger than ever before, and it will intensify in the coming days,” Lo said. Taiwan officials have repeatedly warned about what they see as a Chinese campaign to weaken people’s support for the government. Digital minister Audrey Tang said cyber-attacks on Taiwan government units on Tuesday surpassed 15,000 gigabits, 23 times higher than the previous daily record. Several government websites including the presidential office were subject to overseas cyber-attacks, some of which authorities said were launched by China and Russia. EU foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, has again reiterated the G7’s stance on China’s planned military exercises following Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan. “There is no justification to use a visit as pretext for aggressive military activity in the Taiwan Strait. It is normal and routine for legislators from our countries to travel internationally,” he said. “We encourage all parties to remain calm, exercise restraint, act with transparency.” The president of Paraguay has offered solidarity to Taiwan. The South American nation is one of just 14 nations formally recognising Taiwan as a country. “Paraguay expresses its solidarity with the Republic of China (Taiwan) in the context of the threats it has been subjected to,” Mario Abdo Benítez said on Twitter. “The democratic values of the Taiwanese people are an example to their region and the world, and deserve to be vindicated by the international community.” US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi arrived in Seoul on Wednesday night where she is scheduled to meet with South Korea’s National Assembly Speaker Kim Jin-pyo and leaders of the ruling conservative People Power Party, as well as the opposition Democratic Party of Korea. Earlier reports suggested South Korea’s President Yoon Suk-yeol had no plans to meet with the senior US official as he is currently on a summer holiday. However, Yonhap news agency is now reporting that Yoon will speak by phone with Pelosi during her visit. The Taiwan defence ministry has said its website suffered cyber-attacks and went offline temporarily on Thursday, adding it is working closely with other authorities to enhance cybersecurity as tensions with China rise. Earlier this week, several government websites, including the presidential office, were subject to overseas cyber-attacks, some of which authorities said were launched by China and Russia. US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi concluded her visit to Taiwan on Wednesday with a pledge that the American commitment to democracy on the self-governing island and elsewhere “remains ironclad.” Pelosi received a euphoric welcome as the first US House speaker to visit in more than 25 years. Before leaving, a calm but resolute Pelosi repeated previous remarks about the world facing “a choice between democracy and autocracy.” America’s determination to preserve democracy, here in Taiwan and around the world, remains ironclad,” she said. The Biden administration, and Pelosi, have said that the United States remains committed to the so-called one-China policy, which recognises Beijing but allows informal relations and defence ties with Taipei. Thanking Pelosi for her decades of support for Taiwan, President Tsai Ing-wen presented her with a civilian honour, the Order of the Propitious Clouds. Here is a little more detail on the suspected drone activity above the Kinmen islands on Wednesday night. Taiwan’s defence ministry said on Thursday that unidentified aircraft, probably drones, had flown on Wednesday night above the area of its Kinmen islands and that it had fired flares to drive them away. Major General Chang Zone-sung of the Army’s Kinmen Defence Command told Reuters that the Chinese drones came in a pair and flew into the Kinmen area twice on Wednesday night, at around 9pm (1pm GMT) and 10pm. We immediately fired flares to issue warnings and to drive them away. After that, they turned around. They came into our restricted area and that’s why we dispersed them,” he said. We have a standard operating procedure. We will react if they come in,” Chang said, adding that the alert level there remained “normal”. Chang said he believed the drones were intended to gather intelligence on Taiwan’s security deployment in its outlying islands. The heavily fortified Kinmen islands are just off the southeastern coast of China, near the city of Xiamen. Last week, Taiwan’s military fired flares to warn away a drone that “glanced” its Matsu archipelago off the coast of China’s Fujian province and was possibly probing its defences, Taiwan’s defence ministry said. Taiwan’s defence ministry said on Thursday that unidentified aircraft, probably drones, had flown on Wednesday night above the area of its Kinmen islands, which are just off the southeastern coast of China, and that it had fired flares to drive them away. A senior military official at Taiwan’s outlying Kinmen islands added that the situation is “normal” on the islands, including it military alertness level, according to a recent Reuters report. The world’s most powerful democracies have slammed China for “increasing tensions and destabilising the region” over its response to US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan. The G7’s top diplomats on Wednesday said they were “concerned by recent and announced threatening actions by the People’s Republic of China, particularly live-fire exercises and economic coercion, which risk unnecessary escalation”. The statement from the foreign ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK, the US and the EU, read: There is no justification to use a visit as pretext for aggressive military activity in the Taiwan Strait. It is normal and routine for legislators from our countries to travel internationally. The PRC’s escalatory response risks increasing tensions and destabilising the region. It urged China not to “unilaterally change the status quo by force in the region, and to resolve cross-strait differences by peaceful means”. They also made clear there was “no change in the respective one-China policies, where applicable, and basic positions on Taiwan of the G7 members”. [We] encourage all parties to remain calm, exercise restraint, act with transparency, and maintain open lines of communication to prevent misunderstanding.” Following US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s high-profile visit to Taiwan, the senior US official arrived in Seoul on Wednesday night as part of her Asian tour. The congresswoman, who is second in line to the US presidency, will on Thursday meet South Korea’s National Assembly Speaker Kim Jin-pyo and leaders of the ruling conservative People Power Party, as well as the opposition Democratic Party of Korea. However, South Korea’s President Yoon Suk-yeol has no plans to meet Pelosi as he is currently on a summer holiday, an official at the presidential office told SCMP. The official denied earlier press reports that Yoon, who is taking a break at his home in Seoul, may head out to receive Pelosi. In the first place, there was no such a plan (for Yoon’s meeting with Pelosi) as the president’s vacation schedule coincides with her visit here.” The presidential office “welcomes” Pelosi’s visit to South Korea and it hopes her talks with National Assembly Speaker Kim will be productive, the official said. Asked about Pelosi’s controversial visit to Taiwan, she said: “Our government’s stance is that we will maintain close communication with the nations concerned on all issues under the banner of the need for peace and stability in the region through dialogue and cooperation.” Speculation mounted on social media. “Because of vacation? No way. Yoon is not meeting Pelosi as he is nunchi-ing around China,” one post read. Had this happened to Yoon’s predecessor – liberal former president Moon Jae-in – conservatives and news media would have “raised hell with it” and accused Moon of nunchi-ing around Beijing, the post added. The former Chinese ambassador to the UK issued a scathing statement overnight, warning the US to stop obstructing China’s “great cause of reunification” and describing the process as a “historical inevitability”. Liu Xiao Ming said: The United States should not fantasise about obstructing China’s great cause of reunification. Taiwan is part of China. Realising complete national reunification is the general trend and a historical inevitability. We will never leave any space for ‘Taiwan independence’ split and interference from external forces. No matter what way the US supports and condones ‘Taiwan independence’, it will ultimately be a sham, and it will only leave more ugly records of the US grossly interfering in other countries’ internal affairs in history. The Taiwan issue was born out of the country’s weakness and chaos, and it will surely end with the rejuvenation of the nation in the future.” Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of tensions between China and Taiwan. I’m Samantha Lock and I will be bringing you all the latest developments. It is approaching 7am in Beijing. Here is everything you might have missed: China is to begin a series of unprecedented live-fire drills that would effectively blockade the island of Taiwan, just hours after the departure of US House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, whose controversial visit this week has sparked fears of a crisis in the Taiwan strait. Taiwan has characterised the drills as a violation of international law. The drills will last until Sunday afternoon – and will include missile tests and other “military operations” as close as nine miles to Taiwan’s coastline. Ahead of the drill, Taiwan said 27 Chinese warplanes had entered its air defence zone. Pelosi arrived in Taipei on Tuesday night under intense global scrutiny, and was met by the foreign minister Joseph Wu and the US representative in Taiwan, Sandra Oudkirk. Pelosi addressed Taiwan’s parliament on Wednesday before having public and private meetings with the president, Tsai Ing-wen. “Our delegation came to Taiwan to make unequivocally clear we will not abandon Taiwan, and we are proud of our enduring friendship,” she said, adding that US solidarity with Taiwan was “crucial” in facing an increasingly authoritarian China. In a later statement, she said China could not prevent world leaders from travelling to Taiwan “to pay respect to its flourishing democracy”. Pelosi’s trip generated condemnation from Beijing and sparked fears of a new Taiwan strait crisis. China vowed “consequences” and announced military exercises in waters around the island on Thursday to show its dissatisfaction. Taiwan’s defence ministry accused Beijing of planning to violate the international convention on the law of sea, by breaching Taiwan’s sovereign territory. Taiwanese authorities have said the proximity to some major ports combined with orders for all aircraft and sea vessels to steer clear of the area amount to a blockade. While China’s military often holds live-fire exercises in the strait and surrounding seas, those planned for this week encircle Taiwan’s main island and target areas within its territorial sea."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/nils-pratley-on-finance/2017/sep/11/hinkley-nuclear-power-no-match-for-renewables","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-11T18:12:14Z","webTitle":"Hinkley nuclear power is being priced out by renewables | Nils Pratley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/nils-pratley-on-finance/2017/sep/11/hinkley-nuclear-power-no-match-for-renewables","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/nils-pratley-on-finance/2017/sep/11/hinkley-nuclear-power-no-match-for-renewables","fields":{"headline":"Hinkley nuclear power is being priced out by renewables","bodyText":"Hinkley Point C nuclear power station was conceived in the days when offshore wind cost £150 per megawatt hour and a few misguided souls, some of them government ministers, thought a barrel of oil was heading towards $200. Successive governments swallowed the line that Hinkley represented a plausible answer to the UK’s threefold energy conundrum – keeping the lights on, reducing carbon emissions and producing the juice at affordable prices for consumers and business. Hinkley still scores on reliability and low carbon (if one ignores the effect of spoiling the Somerset countryside with so much concrete), but the extent to which its costs are obscene is now plainer than ever. In Monday’s capacity auction, two big offshore wind farms came in at £57.50 per megawatt hour and a third at £74.75. These “strike prices” – a guaranteed price for the electricity generated - are expressed in 2012 figures, as is Hinkley’s £92.50 so the comparison is fair. The dramatic improvement in offshore wind’s competitiveness is easy to explain because it was predicted. The turbines have become bigger and more efficient, installation costs have fallen and operators are able to use existing infrastructure. Even the post-Brexit fall in sterling has not altered the script because more of the equipment is produced in the UK these days. By contrast, nuclear – a technology that has been around for half a century – seems to only become more expensive in a world of tighter safety regulation. Hinkley Point’s construction tripled between conception and contract, remember. As for the argument that we must pay up for reliable baseload supplies, there ought to be limits to how far it can be pushed. A nuclear premium of some level might be justified, but Hinkley lives in a financial world of its own, even before battery technology (possibly) shifts the economics further in favour of renewables. A credible energy strategy would concentrate on wind- and gas-fired stations, and invite nuclear to the game only if it can vaguely compete on price. The government should draw the obvious conclusion from Monday’s successful auction. One Hinkley is bad enough; a series of follow-on white elephants would be a disgrace. Carillon clear-out sets stage for turnaround If you’re going to clear out an executive team after a corporate calamity, you might as well do a thorough job. Stand-in boss Keith Cochrane, sifting though the mess at contractor Carillion, has decided his recovery plan, whatever it turns to be, can proceed without five of eight members of the executive committee. They include finance director Zafar Khan, who has been in post for only nine months but should waste no time feeling sorry for himself. When the numbers are as horrible as Carillion’s – a colossal £845m provision and net debt that had soared to £695m at the last count – any turnaround plan is bound to require a new bean-counter. Other notable departees include Richard Howson, who was stood down as chief executive after July’s profits warning only to reappear as chief operating officer. Given the 80% fall in the share price, the surprise is only that he got a temporary reprieve. Cochrane’s clear-out sends a message of determination ahead of the main event, the unveiling of the review of strategy and capital structure at the end of this month. The strategy part should be the simpler: flog any peripheral business that can be sold and, given that Carillion has been felled by just a handful of contracts, take a vow of scepticism on risks in future. The capital review, think analysts, means either a rights issue or a debt-for-equity swap. The former is preferable but tricky if Carillion, an employer of 48,000 people valued at only £185m, requires the rumoured £500m. Still, a new line-up of managers, and a temporary hire from Ernst &amp; Young as “chief transformation officer”, meets one minimum condition of a self-help story to pitch to investors. A second requirement is a parallel cull of the non-executive directors. Philip Green, former boss of United Utilities, has been chairman since 2014 and his dispatch to shareholders in last year’s annual report now reads as a risible piece of corporate hubris. One trusts his resignation letter, assuming it’s being drafted, will adopt a humbler tone when explaining to investors how Carillion’s “progressive” dividend policy progressed to zero. Tough lessons of Brexit “If I were able to give you an investment recommendation it would be to invest in a company that is planing to open international schools in Frankfurt.” So says Sir Howard Davies, former City regulator and now chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland He isn’t joking. Talk to senior bankers about Brexit and the conversation quickly turns to the practical difficulty in persuading senior employees to move to Frankfurt. Those supposedly footloose types really don’t like the schools. True believers in the City’s post-Brexit future may view this worry as yet another demonstration of London’s superiority in all matters cultural and linguistic, as well as financial. But, if the biggest concern is education, London needs to look out. As Davies suggests, a shortage of over-priced schools for the offspring of overpaid bankers sounds like a problem the market can fix."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2019/feb/19/white-house-saudi-arabia-nuclear-technology-house-oversight-inquiry-report","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2019-02-19T19:31:55Z","webTitle":"House investigates 'White House plan' to share nuclear technology with Saudis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/19/white-house-saudi-arabia-nuclear-technology-house-oversight-inquiry-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2019/feb/19/white-house-saudi-arabia-nuclear-technology-house-oversight-inquiry-report","fields":{"headline":"House investigates 'White House plan' to share nuclear technology with Saudis","bodyText":"Top White House officials pushed a plan to share nuclear technology with Saudi Arabia, despite objections from career national security staff, according to a new congressional report. The report from the House oversight committee said that whistleblowers within the Trump administration have come forward to warn about the proposed nuclear power deal, which could violate the law. The Democratic-controlled committee has launched an investigation into the whistleblowers’ claims, its chairman, Maryland representative Elijah Cummings, said Tuesday. Donald Trump’s former national security adviser Michael Flynn was a key backer of the plan for a consortium of US companies to build dozens of nuclear power plants in Saudi Arabia, according to the report’s account. During the presidential campaign and transition, Flynn was listed as an adviser to a subsidiary of IP3 International, the company behind the power plant proposal. Flynn was fired in 2017 and has since pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI in the Russia investigation. But planning for the Saudi nuclear project may be ongoing to this day, according to the report. “The whistleblowers who came forward have expressed significant concerns about the potential procedural and legal violations connected with rushing through a plan to transfer nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia. They have warned of conflicts of interest among top White House advisers that could implicate federal criminal statutes,” the report said. “They have also warned about a working environment inside the White House marked by chaos, dysfunction and backbiting.” Career and political staff at the White House repeatedly warned that an order to proceed with the nuclear power plant plan could violate the law, since it did not comply with steps required by the Atomic Energy Act. Without proper safeguards, technology transferred for use in power plants could be used to create nuclear weapons. Lawyers at the National Security Council also warned that Flynn had a conflict of interest that might break the law, and the council’s legal adviser, John Eisenberg, ordered NSC staff to stop all work on the plan, according to the report. But the White House continued to pursue it. The report also cites the role of Trump’s son in law, Jared Kushner. A top NSC official told colleagues that he was promoting the IP3 plan “so that Jared Kushner can present it to the president for approval”, according to the whistleblowers’ account. Kushner plans a tour of the Middle East next week, with a stop in the Saudi capital of Riyadh, to discuss economic aspects of the administration’s Middle East peace plan. The report notes a complex financial connection between Kushner and the plan to build nuclear power plants in Saudi Arabia. Brookfield Asset Management, the company that eased a financial crunch for Kushner’s family by taking over a troubled Manhattan property, has acquired Westinghouse Electric, the bankrupt nuclear services company that is one of the firms participating in the Saudi nuclear deal. Trump met with nuclear power developers at the White House just last week to discuss sharing nuclear technology with Middle Eastern countries, including Saudi Arabia. “Further investigation is needed to determine whether the actions being pursued by the Trump administration are in the national security interest of the United States, or, rather, serve those who stand to gain financially as a result of this potential change in US foreign policy,” the committee said in its report. Cummings, a Maryland Democrat, said he had attempted to begin an investigation of the Saudi nuclear talks before this year, but was blocked when Republicans controlled the committee. The White House has so far not commented on the report."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2020/apr/01/what-are-labour-leadership-candidates-green-policies","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2020-04-01T06:00:14Z","webTitle":"What are Labour leadership candidates' green policies?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/01/what-are-labour-leadership-candidates-green-policies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2020/apr/01/what-are-labour-leadership-candidates-green-policies","fields":{"headline":"What are Labour leadership candidates' green policies?","bodyText":"These questions were put to the candidates before the coronavirus crisis 1. Is the climate crisis the biggest issue the UK faces as a nation and will you commit to making it Labour’s priority for the duration of this parliament? Rebecca Long-Bailey The climate crisis is the greatest challenge we face as a nation and as a globe, not just for this parliament but in the decades and century to come. The inactions of previous governments have escalated the urgency of the challenge we face; and it is a challenge we can only meet by addressing the crisis in our living standards and the crisis of faith in our democracy. As leader I will continue the work I’ve been doing with trade unions, Labour activists and technical experts to develop a plan on how we do this, for example, developing our policies such as insulating 27m homes, using public ownership to transition to a green, affordable energy system, creating an industrial strategy to deliver high-quality, unionised jobs across the country and developing a detailed, properly funded plan to make sure no one loses out from this transition. As a Labour party we need to work with communities about what policies they want to see that would transform their lives and meet the climate crisis. We need to continue to harness the energy and enthusiasm of campaigners and young climate strikers who have helped push the climate crisis to the top of the political agenda through their actions, and work with them to show the world we are opposed to Trump’s climate crisis denial when our country hosts Cop26 this year. Lisa Nandy Yes. As prime minister I would make reaching climate safety the top priority for the whole of my government. I know it is not beyond us not only to build a zero-carbon economy but also to lead the global effort required to reach climate safety. I know that solving the climate crisis means integrating the solutions into every part of what the government does and that means hard-wiring the answers into the very foundations of our country’s economic and foreign policies. One of the first things I did on becoming Labour’s shadow energy secretary back in 2015 was to read Elizabeth Kolbert’s book, Field Notes From A Catastrophe. It brought home to me the scale of the risks from the climate emergency. Climate breakdown isn’t just a far-off threat to other people in other places in some distant future. You can already see the impact that even the warming to date is having in terms of the horrific fires raging across Australia and California, the shifting rain patterns damaging livelihoods for millions of people across Asia and Africa, and the unprecedented flooding we’ve seen here in Britain in recent years. We don’t have the luxury of time so yes it would be a top priority for me during this parliament too. Kier Starmer Yes – and for the next parliament when we are in government. We all have a common interest in rapid decarbonisation, so it needs to be a guiding thread across all policy areas: from foreign policy to local government, from transport to housing. 2. As Labour leader, how will you tackle the climate crisis between now and the next general election [ie what can be done while you are in opposition?]. Can you give three specific examples? RLB As leader I will continue my record of forcing the Tories to U-turn and back down on some of their most destructive policies, such as their support for fracking. It was Labour that meant parliament declared a climate and environmental emergency, work that I led. In parliament we need to keep piling the political pressure on the Tories, for example, using our presence there to bring an end to the ban on onshore wind in England and fighting any attempt to water down our environmental commitments in any trade deals we strike, particularly with the US. At the Cop26 later this year as Labour leader I will be stood shoulder to shoulder with campaigners and activists fighting for a landmark series of commitments and agreements. The eyes of the world will be on us when Trump, the climate breakdown denier, arrives and our prime minister gives him a warm welcome. Moves to curb the civil liberties of, or label peaceful activists as extremists, must be resisted. As Labour leader I also want to give prominence to what Labour can do in power. Many Labour local councils and mayors are declaring climate emergencies and developing their own Green New Deals with their local communities. The Labour councillors and community activists taking this lead are examples of how we can reach into local communities, organise and campaign – lessons we need to learn ahead of the next general election. LN As shadow energy and climate secretary, before the Paris summit, I initiated a collaboration between more than 60 Labour councils across Britain to cut the UK’s carbon footprint by 10% through action in the places where Labour is in power. Before the next election there is the opportunity to build on this with more on-the-ground activism to deliver on the Paris agreement through everything from solar energy coops to community tree-planting schemes and investment in bus services. By showcasing the solutions in our communities, and seizing on the opportunity for good new jobs in every town, Labour can help build out the climate movement into the more broad-based, society-wide force that we need it to be. Only through a movement will we stop a reckless Trump trade deal, which would threaten decades of hard-won rights and protections, and pave our way back to No 10 Downing Street. KS The climate crisis cannot wait until 2024. So, I will work with Labour administrations wherever they are in power – from councils, city mayors to devolved governments – as they involve communities, trade unions and businesses, to design their own pathways to zero net carbon by 2030. We need to encourage bottom-up solutions through supporting climate assemblies and green cooperatives. We must also be an effective opposition in parliament, holding the government to account on the basis of the pace of decarbonisation our planet needs – not the unambitious targets they have set themselves. 3. Will Labour under your leadership commit to: • Retrofitting all UK homes [27m] and buildings by 2030 and fight to ensure all new buildings are zero carbon by the end of this parliament? • Producing 90% of the UK’s electricity from renewable sources [through 7,000 offshore, 2,000 onshore turbines and 3x expansion of solar] by 2030? • Producing 50% renewable heating through 8m heat pumps and investment in hydrogen? RLB Yes, I commissioned the expert report, Thirty by 2030 (pdf), these recommendations are based on. It gives us a real plan to not only hold the government to account on what they are failing to do – but also helps turn what can be abstract targets to most people into real, everyday changes for the better. Insulating homes will end fuel poverty. An active industrial strategy will make sure that Britain is the producer of the wind turbines and other technologies we need for the future, creating good jobs and apprenticeships in our towns, cities and regions. The opportunities for large-scale renewal are endless – we just need to be ambitious and creative. It is a central part of how I believe Labour can sell our aspirational socialism to people across the country. LN I know we need a wholesale transformation in the way we power and heat our homes and businesses but that this is possible and necessary and offers huge economic opportunities. As a windswept nation we can be the Saudi Arabia of clean energy, but all too often we are losing out on the jobs and factories to other countries with a different approach to industrial strategy and that has to change. KS I fully support Labour’s Green New Deal and the proposals for a Green Transformation Fund (pdf) and a National Investment Bank (pdf). The proposals offer a pathway to a greener economy married to social justice, which our country badly needs. It should be hardwired into everything we do as a country and as a party. 4. If yes, how should this work be financed and organised? RLB These are huge challenges and it requires bold and ambitious thinking. We already have deepening wealth inequality in this country and a crisis in living standards. The Conservative approach has been to load costs on to households that are already struggling, while letting energy companies profiteer. We can’t have this approach if we are going to turn this into an opportunity to deliver better lives and a better Britain. It’s why the proposal I set out at the 2019 election had public ownership and public investment in our energy system as a central plank, so we can be strategic and make sure that extra costs are not loaded on to homes that can’t afford it. For example, when it comes to insulating homes, it makes sense for the government to pay for the work upfront, and for the costs to be repaid by households who can afford it over time through savings on their energy bills. Lower-income households should not have to repay the cost of the works, so they can benefit from all the bill savings immediately. Delivering such a large programme in partnership with local communities, with local councils and public bodies playing a central role, can guarantee the quality of work to people’s homes and the quality of jobs we create. When it comes to developing the renewable energy sector and where the public is helping to provide the investment, the public should also get a long-term stake in what are profitable enterprises. The UK, as the world’s largest offshore wind market, should have a far greater role in manufacturing the technology, creating good, skilled jobs here, rather than relying on imports, as is currently the case. We should use our public stake to make sure these projects benefit communities, with local procurement boosting local supply chains. LN I would like to see a bigger role for people in every part of the country to influence and shape the transition so I’m fascinated to see what ideas will emerge from the first national citizens assembly on climate change. What’s clear is that the transition to date has not been funded fairly because low-income households have paid a disproportionately high contribution and the debate so far has been too technocratic and too driven from Brussels and Westminster. For the transition to work the solutions in the next phase must have broad support and benefit communities across the country and that’s more likely to happen if everyone can get involved. KS (see previous answer) 5. How will you ensure the poorest people in the UK and around the world are not made to pay disproportionately for the climate crisis? RLB For too long in this country, too many of our communities have been ignored and seen the erosion of their local public services. We cannot tackle the climate crisis by loading the costs on to the shoulders of those just making ends meet. As leader I will continue to pursue progressive mechanisms, such as public ownership and strategic public investment in the infrastructure we need for the future, in a way that delivers our broader goals of aspirational socialism. For example, expanding our bus networks and creating a public transport system that is integrated, accessible and affordable will improve our air quality and cut emissions, while improving regional connectivity, making life more convenient for millions. Internationally, we need to make sure the UK is a world leader not a world lagger – as the first in the world to industrialise and one of the wealthiest, we need to reduce our emissions at a rate that takes our fair share of the global responsibility to avoid more than 1.5 degrees of warming, as well as ensuring we are doing it in a way that is just and equitable at home. Social justice and aspiration go hand in hand with global justice. When Trump comes to this country for Cop26 Labour needs to join the voices from around the globe calling for urgent action. The poorest parts of the globe are already experiencing the worst impacts of climate breakdown, which they are least responsible for creating. That is why I support increasing the amount of international public climate finance the UK provides for mitigation and adaptation, and channelling these funds through the UN’s green climate fund, and away from the World Bank. Rather than welcome Trump to our country, we should be leading international efforts to establish a new fund to compensate countries in the global south for loss and damage suffered due to climate impacts. We can ensure the technologies developed in the UK and create jobs here through our green industrial revolution are also made available at reduced cost in the global south. LN It’s a tragedy and an injustice that it is the poorest and most vulnerable people in the world who are most exposed to the impacts of the climate crisis around the world. Their voice must be heard as we debate the solutions to the crisis, not just because it’s the right thing to do but also because it will help unlock the answers to a just transition. It was Europe’s approach of working together with the small island states of the South Pacific and the vulnerable countries in sub-Saharan Africa, which built the global alliances that unlocked the Paris agreement. Britain’s leadership in international development helped to build these special relationships and shows why social justice and environmental justice go hand in hand. We should never see offsets as a cheap alternative to reducing pollution here at home and we must pay for the investments needed by ensuring the wealthiest who did most to cause the problem invest the most in fixing it, and by exploring the role that well-designed pollution taxes could play to ensure the fossil fuel industry helps clean up the mess it caused. KS The Green New Deal needs to be married to social justice both domestically and internationally. Domestically we need a just transition which provides good unionised green jobs, addresses regional inequalities and does not leave workers behind. The UK has profited from burning fossil fuels in the past, so we must assist developing countries in their leap forward, skipping our bad habits, building renewables rather than coal power stations. We should use our development budget – and work for greater international financial assistance – to help developing countries grow their own low-carbon economies. 6. Do you support more new nuclear power stations after Hinkley C is completed and, if so, how will they be funded? RLB I support new nuclear power where it is needed for the UK’s future energy security. We need to find the right funding model that will guarantee value for money for the taxpayer and ensure any public stake is used in a way that benefits local communities. Lisa Nandy I’m not writing my manifesto for the next general election just yet but I have argued consistently and for many years that now – right in the middle of a climate emergency – is not the time we should rule out a role for nuclear power or any other low-emission technology. The biggest challenges for the nuclear industry are the high costs associated with new nuclear stations, and their lack of a long-term sustainable solution to deal with the harmful waste they produce, but we will have to weigh these problems against the contribution nuclear power can make to meeting our energy demands in a way that creates good jobs and is consistent with building a zero-carbon economy and it is most important that we are guided by the science and the evidence on this. KS I support the Labour position that nuclear power is part of the mix of moving away from fossil fuels. But our overwhelming focus must be on increasing the energy share of renewables including solar, wind and tidal energy, and with decentralised energy. 7. Do you support HS2? RLB Yes. The government’s mismanagement of the cost and delivery date is a national scandal, and much more needs to be done to manage the local environmental impacts. However, HS2 is needed to increase the UK’s rail capacity, reducing reliance on our roads for passengers and freeing up capacity for more freight travel. This should be part of a more ambitious programme for public transport. For example, we should be building high-speed rail down from Scotland, projects like Crossrail for the north, connections between our towns and reopening branch closures. LN The government has completely mishandled the HS2 project. They have let costs spiral and failed to make the argument for the merits of the scheme. HS2 should never be allowed to justify any failure to invest in the bus networks and other clean public transport projects, which should be a higher priority than this single railway, but it should be possible to both improve the capacity of the existing rail and bus network and expand it too so yes, it should go ahead. KS If we are serious about the climate emergency, we must invest in green public transport. For that to work effectively there has to be a national plan for an integrated public transport network, and HS2 should have been a part of that. I voted against HS2 because of the social and environmental impact it will have on Euston in my constituency. But the project is now inevitably going ahead, and my focus is compensation and mitigation locally. I recognise the need for connectivity in the north and Midlands but the project should have started there, not from London. HS2 should not proceed at the expense of other really important rail upgrades like Crossrail for the north. 8. Do you support or oppose the third runway at Heathrow and/or all airport expansion? RLB Labour was clear in our manifesto that any expansion of airports must pass our tests on air quality, noise pollution, climate change obligations and countrywide benefits, including the current proposals for Heathrow expansion. We need to be rigorous in upholding these tests; as leading scientists have again pointed out the proposals do not meet Labour’s tests, particularly on climate change and as such I do not support them. LN I voted against a third runway at Heathrow because of the extraordinary environmental damage it would clearly cause, not just to our climate but to Londoners’ air quality too. I was a councillor in west London and the experiences I witnessed of people suffering from asthma was already shocking many years ago, and it absolutely can’t be allowed to get so much worse because of a failure of imagination in fixing our transport system. On airport expansion elsewhere in the country, we must be guided by the expert advice of the Committee on Climate Change in terms of what level of aviation growth could be consistent with our climate change laws and international commitments. KS I voted against Heathrow expansion because of the impact on climate change. We need to be serious about the climate emergency and our commitments under the Paris agreement. I personally don’t think that’s consistent with approving airport expansion but, of course, I’ll look at any proposals and measure them against climate tests. 9. Do you back financial support specifically for rewilding projects and commit to Labour’s existing policy to create 10 new national nature parks; rewild the 10 existing national parks and create “natural corridors” in the form of local parks, walking pathways, cycling lanes and canals? RLB Yes. These are examples of actions we need to take to tackle the climate crisis, but will also make our cities, towns and local communities nicer and healthier places to live, bringing public luxury to the spaces and services we care about. LN Tackling the climate emergency needs to go hand-in-hand with restoring our natural environment. Our country is one of the least wooded in the whole of Europe, and yet we know that trees lock up carbon, provide vital habitat for wildlife, and improve air quality in towns and cities. I also believe that every child deserves to have access to trees and green spaces as they grow up, wherever they live and whatever their parents’ income. So I would absolutely create 10 new national nature parks and back natural corridors. I would also enable more people to take control of the management of their local parks, and ensure that local government had the powers and funding to maintain them. Rewilding is something I think we need to explore with local communities in the places where schemes like this might go forward. I am convinced we can find the right mixture of natural regeneration, new tree-planting and support for sustainable farming in this country, but to do so we first need to see off the risks of a Trump trade deal that would sacrifice environmental, food safety and animal welfare standards and throw many UK farmers on the scrapheap. KS Rewilding is an essential part of the fightback against the climate and environmental emergency. I support ambitious tree-planting schemes and new nature parks to halt the devastating loss of biodiversity and to help in the fight against air pollution which plagues our streets. Our children are breathing toxic air in 71% of UK towns and cities - this is a national scandal and more green spaces must be part of the solution. 10. Do you support a post-Brexit agricultural subsidy regime to support environmental schemes such as tree planting, soil and peat restoration and flood protection? Should that funding be at least £1bn a year, ie a third of the current EU CAP scheme? RLB I support maintaining the current level of funding support to British farming and farmland management. However, I will pursue a “public money for public goods” approach, and would want to see agricultural subsidies conditioned on sustainable land use practices like tree planting, soil and peat restoration, flood protection and biodiversity promotion. Under my leadership, Labour would invest in forestation and landscape restoration, for example, our commitment to invest £3.7bn over a decade in tree planting, but this funding would be additional to payments in the agricultural subsidy regime. LN It’s bonkers that millionaires on the rich list are still raking in vast subsidies of taxpayers’ cash from farm subsidies. Investing public money should always be about securing public goods, not offering backdoor handouts to wealthy Tory donors. Our farmers will need to play a crucial role in restoring nature, storing carbon to cut emissions, and growing healthy and sustainable food, and these are public goods our subsidy regime should be helping us to meet. With Boris Johnson pursuing such a hard Brexit, there is a real risk that these goals could be undermined in the pursuit of a low-standards, reckless trade deal with Trump and we must fight that every step of the way. KS Trees, soil, and peat are natural carbon sinks so restoring and replanting them will be key to our aims of net zero carbon emissions. As the recent floods across much of England and Wales demonstrate, the UK’s flood protections are already insufficient, and the worsening climate crisis promises even more violent weather and rising sea levels. Significant investment in flood defences is therefore a priority to mitigate the worse effects of climate change. 11. Do you support the implementation of policies to reduce red meat consumption in the UK? If so what form might that take? RLB Growing numbers of people are cutting down on red meat, or becoming vegetarian and vegan, as people think about the environment and their health. It’s been really positive how we’ve seen businesses respond to that growing demand in producing substitutes for old favourites like the sausage roll. Too often the green movement has been painted as telling people what they can and can’t do. We need to find a different way of having discussions as a country on these issues while not losing focus on the most urgent questions facing us. Fighting climate change is about key players across the world coming together to collectively address the challenge we face, and working out in this country how we can restructure our economy so that it is both sustainable and able to support a high quality of life for everyone. LN The priority for governments must be to focus on the biggest driver of emissions, which is the global fossil fuel industry; but the Committee on Climate Change has made it clear that we also need to think about how we manage our land and produce our food. In my view this is not about telling people what to eat – it’s about tackling food waste, working with farmers to reduce pollution from things like artificial fertilisers and pesticides, and protecting high-quality food production in the UK from the impacts of reckless trade deals. I also think we have to have a much stronger focus on food poverty. Children going to school hungry in one of the richest countries in the world is both heart-breaking and shameful. KS After fossil fuels, the food industry – particularly the meat and dairy sector – is one of the most significant contributors to climate change and, in many countries, to deforestation. All of us should therefore think about how we might reduce our consumption of red meat. But changes in behaviour, important as they are, should not distract us from the systemic nature of the problem of climate change. That’s why I support Labour’s plans for a radical Green New Deal to combat the climate and environmental emergency. 12. Do you support a frequent flyer tax to reduce air travel? RLB At the moment the vast majority of the population fly once a year or less – they shouldn’t be unfairly taxed. We don’t want to penalise or make it harder for people to go on holiday. But it is right to consider how we ask wealthy frequent flyers to shoulder more responsibility, or reduce the frequency of their flights. In government as Labour leader I would ensure we review aviation taxation and consider and consult on the development and implementation of proposals recommended by the Committee on Climate Change. LN It cannot be right that when 70% of flights are taken by just 15% of the public, the wealthiest people who are polluting the most do not pay a level of tax to reflect this and instead pay the same as the family taking their hard-earned rest once a year, so yes as prime minister I would look to make the system fairer and greener. KS Air travel is a particularly fossil fuel-intensive form of travel so, especially while we do not have the technology for green flights, we should encourage people to use alternative forms of transport where possible. We need to make sure that our tax system encourages that. 13. Will you commit to greater funding for public transport, cycling and walking than for road building? RLB Yes. We need greater funding for and an expansion of public transport, cycling and walking for all sorts of reasons – not just in tackling the climate crisis, but to improve our economy, the connections between cities and towns, and rural areas, making our public transport more accessible and to encourage healthier lives and cleaner air. LN It is absolutely scandalous that when 60% of journeys are by bus, literally thousands of local bus routes have been cut since the Tories came back to power, hundreds just in the last year, and fares have been allowed to rocket too. I would invest properly in public transport – and yes nationalise the railways, but also give councils the power to run bus routes for people not profit so they can set the fares and the routes and ensure all the buses in the fleet are zero carbon by 2025. I know that where Labour is in power, our mayors and councils are paving the way on cycling and as a result the number of cyclists is going up, so I would work with them to ensure communities get the investment they need to build on these successes. KS The government has made a political choice to spend transport budgets on roads rather than greener and cheaper forms of transport. I would lead a Labour government with different priorities: building a more sustainable, affordable, accessible and integrated transport system – with investment in bus services, renationalisation of our railways, and support for cycling and pedestrians. 14. Do you back clean air zones that charge or ban polluting vehicles in urban areas, which government research shows are the most effective policy to reduce air pollution? RLB Yes, I support a new Clean Air Act enshrining the World Health Organization’s advisory air quality standards into domestic law. This would include clean air zones around schools. I was proud to announce Labour’s electric car revolution at Labour conference last year, setting out how an industrial strategy can support the sector to transition to manufacturing electric vehicles and batteries, and proposing creative measures such as electric community car clubs. So alongside an expansion in public transport we are also ensuring that we are transitioning over to zero emission vehicles, and that transition supports jobs and industries here in Britain. LN It is truly shocking that one in 19 deaths in our largest cities and towns are linked to air pollution when we can and should do much more to prevent this. In London, Oxford, Reading and most of the south-east, levels are above the limits recognised as safe by the World Health Organization and on some days many kids can’t even play outside in their school playgrounds without a high risk of suffering an asthma attack caused by the toxic state of the air. Labour in local government is leading the way on tackling this through schemes like [London mayor Sadiq Khan’s] Ulez [ultra-low emission zone] and [Bristol mayor Marvin Rees’s] diesel ban in Bristol. We need the new clean air legislation expected this year to ensure our air is healthy to breathe, in line with WHO advice, and to bolster the strong local government action Labour is leading. KS Air pollution already contributes to over 40,000 premature deaths a year in the UK, and is particularly damaging to the health of our children, who are breathing unsafe levels of air pollution in 71% of our towns and cities. That’s why I’ve called for an immediate Clean Air Act to tackle air pollution by creating clean air zones. 15. The Committee on Climate Change says the UK is unprepared for the impacts of climate change. Will you increase funding for adaptation and what policies do you support to prepare for the inevitable increases in flooding, heatwaves and summer water shortages? RLB Yes. I stand by Labour’s 2019 commitment to invest an additional £5.6bn to level up flood defences over 10 years, paid for through public capital investment. The new fund will prioritise areas of need, particularly in regions such as the north-west, Yorkshire and the east Midlands that have been neglected under the Tories. Climate change will place huge pressures on our freshwater resources. But the UK’s privatised water companies have done a terrible job managing that resource, with only 14% of rivers safe for swimming, record fines issued for sewage leaks, and 20-25% of our water wasted before it even reaches our taps. That is why managing our water security in a warming climate will require publicly owned, democratically accountable water companies. Better insulated homes, delivered through Labour’s mass retrofitting programme, will be better adapted to extreme summer heat as well as keeping us warm in winter. LN Short-term Tory cuts to flood budgets left scars on communities across the country and are one of the worst impacts of their damaging austerity programme. We’re lucky to have some of the foremost experts in the entire world in the Met Office, the Committee on Climate Change, and in many of our universities, to advise us on what we should do to prepare for climate change and so we should heed their advice about what dangerous impacts we must prepare for to ensure we are limiting the damage from worsening extreme weather wherever we can and that means properly investing in flood defences. KS As demonstrated by the recent flooding of much of England and Wales and the fact that the last five years have been the hottest five years on record, the effects of climate breakdown have already begun. Mitigating those effects will be essential and funding needs to match our new needs – but it should not distract from our absolute commitment to prevention through urgent emission reductions and a Green New Deal. 16. What direct diplomacy should Labour undertake with international partners to help make Cop26 a success? RLB The eyes of the world will be on us at Cop26; we need to show them we reject those who deny the climate crisis or continue to fail to act on its urgency. World leaders have to heed the warnings of young climate activists whose future is at stake; the world is increasingly in flames as we have seen in the Amazon, California, Australia and in Scotland last spring. As Labour leader I will work directly with our sister parties in Europe and across the world, both in power and in opposition, to help make sure an ambitious set of demands and commitments are agreed at Cop26. LN I was proud to lead Labour’s international delegation to the historic Paris summit and to meet the civil society leaders and diplomats who worked so tirelessly to secure that deal. So I know how precious and hard-won it was and is and why it is essential we now defend it and see it implemented in full. Across the world it is gutsy, young women like the prime ministers of Finland and New Zealand, who are carrying the hopes and dreams of Greta and the youth movement into the global diplomatic arena and making strides forward and if I am prime minister I promise to join them. Ahead of the Cop26 summit in Scotland later this year, there is an opportunity for Labour to build on the initiative I kick-started five years ago to showcase climate solutions where we are in power in local government, city halls and the Welsh assembly and to share the learning from these experiences internationally, as I know Sadiq has been doing with London’s experiences through the C40 network of cities who helped secure the Paris agreement. KS We know that climate change is an unavoidably international problem. So we must match our efforts for a Green New Deal at home with our efforts abroad. The UK should use our Cop26 presidency to build and lead an international net-zero coalition. On 8 March 2020, I’m meeting with activists and experts in Birmingham to begin co-designing the demands that we think the Labour party should make of our government and of governments around the world at Cop26. We will be there in Glasgow alongside our European sister parties to hold governments to account for future generations. 17. Would you support a progressive alliance with the Liberal Democrats, SNP, Greens and Plaid Cymru around climate action and backing for a green new deal? RLB Labour’s green industrial revolution is one of the most ambitious policy platforms in the world for how a country can decarbonise and be sustainable. It can be a rallying call for the concrete demands we need to implement to meet our climate targets, and put the achievement of social justice and the creation of good, unionised jobs at its heart. I will work with anyone who supports those demands in parliament, across our trade unions, the labour movement, civil society and activists. As Labour leader I will make sure that Labour is part of the coalition keeping this issue high on the political agenda and will resist any moves to restrict the civil liberties of peaceful activists and campaigners ahead of Cop26. At Cop26 I think Labour should push for the UK to adopt more ambitious national targets on climate change, to provide increased levels of public climate finance, and to lead international efforts to establish a new fund for loss and damage. LN I have seen the leadership [Green party MP] Caroline Lucas has brought to the climate debate, and I know that like me she has championed a Green New Deal so yes of course I would work with her and MPs from all parties to make it a reality. KS We need a Labour government to implement a Green New Deal, hardwired into all our policies to mitigate the damage of climate and environmental breakdown, while empowering communities and creating good, green jobs across the country. Every community deserves the right to vote for a Labour government. But we will work with other parties in parliament where they share our aims."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2019/oct/25/central-african-republic-russia-military-base","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2019-10-25T11:20:16Z","webTitle":"Central African Republic considers hosting Russian military base","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/25/central-african-republic-russia-military-base","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2019/oct/25/central-african-republic-russia-military-base","fields":{"headline":"Central African Republic considers hosting Russian military base","bodyText":"The president of Central African Republic has said his country would consider hosting a Russian military base, as Vladimir Putin woos dozens of African leaders in an effort to spread Moscow’s influence at an investment summit in southern Russia. In an interview with Russian state media, President Faustin-Archange Touadéra said he had also asked Russia for new weapons shipments for CAR’s soldiers, who have fought a civil war against rebel forces in the country since 2012. Asked about a potential military base, Russia’s first in Africa, he said that his government was “considering the possibilities”. The Kremlin later denied that Putin had discussed the establishment of a Russian military base in CAR. Touadéra said the question was being reviewed by the two countries’ defence ministries. The remarks came as Russia holds its first Russia-Africa summit, an estimated £55m effort to charm African leaders with the prospect of arms deals, and investments in mining, nuclear energy and other spheres, while promising no political strings attached. Russia believes it can extend its influence to become a geopolitical powerbroker in Africa and begin to make up ground against China’s massive investment in the region, while edging out other powers like the US and France. The timing for the summit has also been fortuitous, with Putin recently brokering a deal with President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan of Turkey to take joint control over previously Kurdish-held territory in north-eastern Syria. The deal highlighted Russia’s role as a dealmaker in the conflict and ability to withstand western pressure, as well as the abrupt US pullout from its alliance with the Kurds under Donald Trump. Leaked documents revealed by the Guardian in June showed that Russia has sought to bolster its presence in at least 13 countries in Africa through military deals, private business contracts, and by grooming a new generation of leaders. That mission to spread Russian influence was led by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a businessman close to Putin whose interests include a private military group that has deployed to Ukraine, Syria and CAR. But while Prigozhin’s efforts to spread influence have largely remained in the shadows, Russia this week has sought to shine a spotlight on its growing relationship with Africa. On Wednesday, Putin rolled out the red carpet in Sochi, holding marathon bilateral sessions with African leaders to say Russia was open for business. “We currently export to Africa $25bn [£19.5bn] worth of food – which is more than we export in arms, at $15bn,” he said. “In the next four to five years, I think we should be able to double this trade, at least.” As the conference began, Russia flew two Tupolev Tu-160 nuclear bombers to South Africa, the first time the planes have landed on the continent. Russian trade with Africa is about 10% of China’s, which exceeded $200bn last year, but Moscow has traditionally dominated certain sectors like weapons exports. Agriculture, mining and civilian nuclear power were also a focus during the summit. Overall, Russia said $12bn in deals had been struck at the conference, although many were in memorandums of understanding that may not be fulfilled."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2019/may/07/chernobyl-review-chaos-reigns-in-confusing-nuclear-disaster-epic","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2019-05-07T21:00:06Z","webTitle":"Chernobyl review – chaos reigns in confusing nuclear disaster epic","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/07/chernobyl-review-chaos-reigns-in-confusing-nuclear-disaster-epic","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/07/chernobyl-review-chaos-reigns-in-confusing-nuclear-disaster-epic","fields":{"headline":"Chernobyl review – chaos reigns in confusing nuclear disaster epic","bodyText":"Chernobyl is like the 80s nuclear horror-drama Threads crossed with the disaster-movie classic The Towering Inferno – but delivers neither the shocking realism of one nor the schlocky flair of the other. Sky Atlantic’s five-part miniseries (co-produced with HBO) dramatises the 1986 disaster at the nuclear power station in what is now Ukraine. It is – at least so far – a confusing sprawl for anyone not au fait with the details of the catastrophe itself, the workings of nuclear reactors generally, or with a very good eye for faces obscured by dust and smoke, and a knack for remembering complicated names drowned out by the sound of reactor cores exploding. We begin with the suicide of nuclear physicist and state apparatchik Valery Legasov (Jared Harris) two years to the minute after the event, before heading back to 1986 as the good people of Pripyat note a distant glow on the horizon and – seconds later – are bracing themselves against a blast wave. It is a bad sign when the first few minutes of a drama raise more extra-narrative questions than answers. Did the residents have no fear of what such a sight might mean? Why are they not running around trying to flee, as we would be? I am sure it is something to do with soothing, Communist-era propaganda and a well-trained, incurious mindset, but the writers need to sketch these things in a bit if they want viewers to be involved rather than instantly baffled by their story. This particular example becomes more pressing in a later scene, when we see the townspeople gazing in wonder at the distant fire and ionised blue air above it as their children play in the radioactive ash accumulating at their feet. I mean, I have questions. The story is so unclear. At the plant, everyone is dressed indistinguishably in white uniforms, and any understanding of the situation the average viewer can glean is likely to come more from his or her knowledge of disaster-movie tropes than the action or dialogue here. The man in charge, Anatoly Dyatlov (Paul Ritter, part of a uniformly excellent parade of performances fighting to make coherence out of chaos) is largely in denial. He insists, despite irradiated eyewitness accounts, that the core cannot have exploded. So he is not our hero. Maybe it’s going to be the nurse at the nearby hospital, who takes a squiz at the raging fire at the local nuclear power plant and wonders if they have any iodine tablets in stock, just in case. “Why would we?” says the doctor cheerfully, silhouetted in front of the orange-blue glow of the raging fire at the local nuclear power plant. We know things are Worse Than They Seem because a) the firemen who attend have increasingly uneasy expressions and keep keeling over and vomiting into bushes, b) everyone keeps insisting a core cannot explode as they pick their way over pieces of exploded core and c) Dyatlov refuses to countenance the suggestion from underlings that the radiation readings from the plant’s geiger counter-type thing are inaccurate because it has maxed out rather than taking a faithful record. Amid the depicted and narrative chaos, which involves repeated “reveals” of the shattered core – it looks like a nuclear apocalypse in there! – we glean that opening the plant’s water valves will kill the men who do it, but will save the lives of millions. I assume that it will do this by averting something worse than a nuclear reactor’s core exploding and scattering itself over a wide area, but what this is I am not sure. The two men in charge of the safety test that immediately preceded the disaster go down and start turning wheels and obliquely noting that, contrary to their claims in the control room, they did do something wrong during the test. We should be engaged by the tragic flaws and nobility of all this by this point, but the story and characters have gone so uncorralled that it takes all your viewing energy just to keep it fractionally straight. I understand that it was a time of chaos – and very shortly after that, lies, half-truths and obfuscations that endangered lives and protected careers – but you can’t reflect that literally in a drama without incurring severe and pointless costs. Things may improve over the coming weeks as the smoke clears, and I hope so. Chernobyl is a story that has everything, but at the moment, comrades, justice is not being done to it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/live/2022/may/26/boris-johnson-sue-gray-report-partygate-rishi-sunak-uk-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-26T17:03:35Z","webTitle":"Cost of living payments for millions as Sunak announces windfall tax on oil and gas profits – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2022/may/26/boris-johnson-sue-gray-report-partygate-rishi-sunak-uk-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/live/2022/may/26/boris-johnson-sue-gray-report-partygate-rishi-sunak-uk-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"Cost of living payments for millions as Sunak announces windfall tax on oil and gas profits – as it happened","bodyText":"Rishi Sunak has announced a £15bn package of support for households struggling with the cost of living crisis, part-funded by a £5bn windfall tax on energy companies. My colleague Hilary Osborne has more details of how the new payments will work here. Sunak has confirmed that benefits will be uprated next year in line with the rate of inflation this September. That is the normal practice, but with inflation at its highest level for 40 years, there has been concern the government might uprate in line with a lower rate. In his Q&amp;A with Martin Lewis a few minutes ago Sunak stressed this in response to concerns that claimants were not getting enough help, saying that because inflation would be high this year, that would mean a significant increase in the value of benefits next April. Sky’s Ed Conway explains the significance of this here. The government’s £15bn cost of living handout is not enough to help struggling families, and only a “drop in the ocean” compared with the pressures consumers are facing, the boss of Asda has said. The Metropolitan police investigated parties inside Downing Street “without fear or favour”, and found no evidence that Boris Johnson had breached Covid regulations more than once, the force’s interim head has insisted. Four Conservative MPs have called for Boris Johnson to resign in the aftermath of the Sue Gray report, saying they cannot reconcile themselves with his previous statements on Partygate. The former Labour MP Claudia Webbe has lost an appeal against her conviction for harassing a love rival, but her sentence has been reduced. And this is from the Green MP Caroline Lucas on the government’s decision to exempt renewables from the new investment allowance for energy companies. (See 5.36pm.) Rishi Sunak is taking part in a live Q&amp;A with Martin Lewis, the consumer champion and founder of the MoneySavingExpert website. You can watch it here. The investment allowance announced by Rishi Sunak today, which will allow energy companies to get a total of 91p of their tax bill for every £1 they invest in the UK and which has been introduced to partially offset the impact of the windfall tax, will not apply to investment in renewable energy, the government has confirmed. It will only apply to investment in oil and gas. Joanna Penn, a government whip in the House of Lords, confirmed this when she was taking questions on the plans, in response to a question from the Green peer Natalie Bennett. Bennett says it is unbelievable. On a visit to a B&amp;Q in Watford, Rishi Sunak rejected claims that his cost of living support package was announced today as a distraction from Partygate. When asked if it was, he replied: I’m focused on delivering for people and that is what today was about. And the timing of today is because we now have more clarity about what is going to happen to energy bills in the autumn. We heard from Ofgem earlier this week about the potential scale of the increase. And that is why we took decisive action to provide £15bn worth of support to help the country get through the challenging months ahead. Sunak also said he respected the police decision to fine him for attending a surprise birthday event for Boris Johnson in the cabinet room during lockdown. Sunak was there inadvertently, because he had arrived for a separate meeting. Commenting on it today, Sunak said: With regard to my situation, I fully respect the decision that the police came to. And I sincerely and deeply apologise for the hurt and anger that caused. There were get well wishes at first minister’s questions in Holyrood earlier as Nicola Sturgeon missed the session after testing positive for Covid last Friday. Nearly a week on, Sturgeon says she has been “floored” by the virus and is planning to spend the rest of the week at home to recover. Her absence comes in the week that Sturgeon became the longest-serving first minister of the Scottish parliament after 2,743 days in office, overtaking her predecessor Alex Salmond’s day tally on Wednesday. While there has been much analysis of her time in power as Scotland’s first female FM – covering the SNP’s stellar electoral record, Brexit, the Salmond case and inquiry, and of course, the pandemic – Sturgeon’s voice has been conspicuously absent. It’s worth noting how seldom Sturgeon has taken time off, full stop, over the period. Particularly during the early months of Covid, her work ethic made the Stakhanovites look like part-timers. Here is reaction to Rishi Sunak’s cost of living support package from two thinktanks seen as being on the left. From Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation The chancellor has announced a big and very welcome package of support for households facing fast rising energy bills. It almost doubles the level of energy support to over £30bn, and fills the huge gap in previous announcements with large targeted support for those hit hardest. The decision to provide one-off payments this year to poorer households, pensioners and those with a disability is a good attempt to target those with higher energy bills – although the relative lack of support for larger families stands out. The chancellor’s commitment to uprate benefits next April in line with very high inflation also offers important security for lower income households that their living standards will be protected from surging prices tomorrow as well as today. From Miriam Brett, director of research and advocacy at Common Wealth The biggest threat facing our future is the climate emergency and key to the transition is the need to create a green and just tax system. The UK is already an enormously profitable place for oil and gas companies. Today’s announcement by the Chancellor on the investment allowance to encourage firms to invest in oil and gas extraction in the UK casts fresh doubt on the UK government’s willingness to tackle the climate and environmental crises. Research by Common Wealth and NEF found that despite its climate commitments, the UK continues to offer a number of tax reliefs for both domestic production and consumption of fossil fuels. In the last five years, the value of UK support to fossil fuels amounted to an average of approximately £12bn a year. A rapid and just phase out of fossil fuel subsidies should be a core component of a just transition. And here is reaction from two thinktanks on the right. From James Heywood, head of welfare and opportunity at the Centre for Policy Studies This is a significant package of support targeted at those on the lowest incomes, and it will bring welcome relief to many families facing eye-watering increases in their bills. The Chancellor is right to use the means-tested benefits system to ensure cash goes to those who need it most, as we have been advocating for at the CPS. It is important to emphasise that these measures are pain relief, not a complete anaesthetic. The government cannot completely offset the impact of rising prices for every household - many still face an incredibly tough year ahead. The reference in this quote to “pain relief” is a reminder than in the Sunday Times at the weekend Tim Shipman said Boris Johnson was willing to back Sunak’s plans for a windfall tax, but only if some of the money was spent on nuclear power stations and offshore windfarms, that would cut energy bills in the long run. Shipman quoted an adviser arguing that spending on “surgery” was ultimately more beneficial than spending on “pain relief”. If Shipman was right, today’s announcement shows that Johnson lost the argument. From Mark Littlewood, director general at the Institute of Economic Affairs The worst way to make policy is to oppose something half-heartedly in principle, then procrastinate and finally change position as a result of political expediency. It is painfully obvious that in the battle of ideas, the government enters the arena wholly unarmed. Rachel Reeves, the Shadow Chancellor, is right to say that this represents a policy victory for Labour. The default setting of the Conservatives now is to respond to virtually any problem by increasing taxes and spending even more money. The appetite and ability of the government to lower taxation or reduce the regulatory burden on businesses is approximately zero. The consequence will be a prolonged cost of living crisis and woefully disappointing economic growth. Another Conservative MP, Stephen Hammond, has come out to declare that they can no longer support Boris Johnson. Hammond has been very critical of Johnson in the past over Partygate, but until now he has not publicly joined those calling for a no confidence vote. Today, however, he suggests that Johnson is “indefensible” and he implies that he submitted a letter to the 1922 Committee calling for a vote on Johnson’s leadership some time ago. In a statement he says: I have said consistently throughout I cannot and will not defend the indefensible. I am struck by a number of my colleagues who were really concerned that it’s almost impossible for the PM to say I want to move on, as we cannot move on without regaining public trust and I am not sure that’s possible in the current situation ... Since 9 December I have been critical of the prime minister’s behaviour and the culture that existed in No 10. All I can do as a backbencher is speak out and submit a letter. I guide everyone to my website statements where I have said for several months I already have done all I can as a backbencher. Tom Larkin from Sky News, who is keeping a tally, says 19 Tories are now on the record calling for a no confidence vote. The true number is thought to be more than double that, because MPs can submit letters in secret. If 54 letters are submitted, the 1922 Committee has to hold a ballot. Cleaners and security guards contracted to work for the Ministry of Justice will protest outside Downing Street tomorrow following reports that support staff were mocked and left to mop up after lockdown parties. Sue Gray’s report into the Partygate scandal revealed that cleaners and security guards were subjected to a “lack of respect and poor treatment”, and yet felt “unable to raise [this] properly” with the authorities. The UVW (United Voices of the World) union, which represents outsourced cleaners at the MoJ, said its members will protest against the government’s “culture of disrespect” at 5.30pm tomorrow. Emanuel Gomes, one of its members, died in April 2020 just hours after cleaning an office in the MoJ. Originally from Guinea, the 43-year-old father and husband felt so ill he could barely stand but felt under pressure to continue working during lockdown because he did not receive sick pay, his family said. He had suspected coronavirus symptoms but his death was officially recorded as hypertension of the heart. Vicente Gomes, a cleaner at the MoJ and a member of the UVW union, said: Emanuel and I were from the same country, he was a good person. During the pandemic, while we didn’t have masks and we were on poverty wages, the prime minister broke the law. This is very wrong, this is not normal, he knows the law. Emanuel Gomes’s cousin, Vicente Mendes, who is also a cleaner at the MoJ and a UVW member, said: Emanuel didn’t receive sick pay and he died without receiving anything. It can’t be like this, I feel very sad. Petros Elia, general secretary for UVW, added: It is outrageous to have rowdy and illegal parties during the pandemic but to then expect cleaners to mop up after you and to pay them, as well as porters and security guards, poverty wages, and deny them full sick pay is abhorrent. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has released a full analysis of the cost of living support measures announced by Rishi Sunak earlier. It says Sunak is involved in “serious redistribution from rich to poor”. This is from Paul Johnson, the IFS’s director. Rishi Sunak has announced a genuinely big package of support for households. On average the poorest households will now be approximately compensated for the rising cost of living this year. The flat rate nature of payments to benefit recipients does mean, though, that the package is less generous to poor families with children than to those without. Even so, put these benefit increases alongside the tax rises just implemented, and Mr Sunak is engaging in some serious redistribution from rich to poor - albeit against a backdrop of rising inequality. While this is coming at substantial fiscal cost, its supposedly temporary nature means he might not be too worried about the impact on the public finances. We will wait to see how the Bank of England responds to a big fiscal loosening in a period of high and rising inflation. If energy prices remain high, or rise even further, it may turn out hard to ensure these changes are genuinely temporary. And there are inevitably going to be families on modest incomes, who are just out of reach of the means tested benefit system, who will feel hard done by relative to the generous treatment of those families not so different from them who are receiving benefits. The IFS also says that, as a result of the measures announced today, a worker on median earnings will have very little reduction in real-terms income this year compared with last year. Without any of the measures announced by Sunak this year, they would have faced a loss of more than £500. People working full-time on the “national living wage” will actually see an increase in their real-terms income, the IFS says. In the Commons MPs have this afternoon been paying tribute to the Queen, to mark her platinum jubilee. Boris Johnson opened the debate, and like other MPs he praised her lavishly. It would, of course, be far more interesting to hear what the Queen has to say about Johnson, but sadly that option is not available, and so here is an excerpt from Johnson’s speech. Since the Palace of Westminster was founded more than 1,000 years ago, it has seen war and peace, plague and plenty, the rise and fall of empires and all kinds of revolutions: scientific, industrial, political, ecumenical, stylistic. And almost 50 monarchs – in trying to rank the achievements of those monarchs it must be admitted that not all of them set exemplary standards of personal behaviour and quite a few were removed violently and prematurely from office. But in our history, no monarch has ever served this country so long as this one with the first platinum jubilee ever but far more importantly, no monarch has ever served it so well. In his evidence to the London assembly’s police and crime committee, Sir Stephen House, the acting Metropolitan police commissioner, dismissed suggestions that his force was soft on Boris Johnson when investigating Partygate. He also insisted that, just because a photograph “looks bad”, that does not mean a fine is justified. He explained: I accept that many of the photographs that we are seeing look bad and Sue Gray’s report has dealt with that. We deal with the law, not what looks bad. And just because there is alcohol present, can I just remind people that the Covid regulations are about breaching Covid regulations, they’re not about whether there’s drink there or not. We have to put fixed-penalty notices to people that we think will win in court. And there has to be evidence behind it and there is not always evidence and ... a photograph can be somewhat deceptive in these areas. We need evidence and they need to be proving there is no reasonable excuse behind what was going on. We have not, I repeat this, we have not shied away from issuing a fixed-penalty notice where we thought it was deserved. We have policed without fear or favour and I would not have presided over anything less than that. The Lib Dems say that under their plans a windfall tax on the energy sector would have raised £11bn, not the £5bn that Rishi Sunak expects his to raise. Christine Jardine, the Lib Dem Treasury spokesperson, said: This is more a levy lite than a windfall tax. The chancellor could have raised double the cash from oil and gas companies if he had the bottle. The Lib Dems want to impose a 25% windfall tax on the excess global profits of oil and gas producers headquartered in the UK. Sunak’s tax is a 25% tax on UK oil and gas profits, but the investment allowance will enable firms to cut their liabilities if they are investing in the UK. My colleague Polly Toynbee has written a column on Rishi Sunak’s windfall tax U-turn. She says, if it took Partygate to produce this, more parties are needed. Here is an excerpt. This help comes better late than never, arriving just as the Institute for Fiscal Studies finds inequality taking off again, with the top 1% roaring away, while the poorest people face the highest rate of inflation, which could hit 14% by October. But this is a humiliating U-turn for a government that has made cutting benefits time and again its signature theme. This climbdown only comes now as its polling and focus groups show most people, including many Tory voters, are not as flint-hearted as the cabinet’s ideologues. Nor do voters blame food bank-users for lack of cooking skills. The tide is turning, as the British Social Attitudes survey is showing, when so many people can see that working hard on low pay doesn’t keep a family afloat. Labour’s spirits are high. The government may “move on” from Partygate, but the stench will follow them, just as John Major’s government couldn’t shake off “sleaze”. Two imminent byelections will reveal how far Labour still needs to travel. But Rachel Reeves ended her reply today to rousing cheers from Labour benches when she called the benches opposite: “Out of ideas, out of touch and out of time … We lead, they follow.” And here is the full article. Boris Johnson’s official spokesperson has formally apologised for misleading the media in repeatedly denying any parties took place inside Downing Street during lockdown, while insisting this was entirely inadvertent, my colleague Peter Walker reports. As Peter reports, there will also be no more “wine time Fridays” in the No 10 press office. Downing Street now has a formal policy of alcohol not being allowed except for certain circumstances such as official receptions, the spokesperson told the briefing. In an interview with Sky News’s Lucy Frazer, a Treasury minister has just confirmed that the government will have to raise borrowing to fund the package announced by Rishi Sunak today. Although he is introducing a windfall tax on energy companies, that is only expected to raise £5bn of the £15bn needed. Asked how the government could afford to cut taxes if it was also having to borrow more, Frazer said the key thing was to promote growth. Back to the £15bn cost of living support package, and here is some reaction to Rishi Sunak’s announcement from welfare organisations. From Paul Kissack, chief executive of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, the poverty charity For people living with worry and fear through this cost of living crisis, and especially for those going without essentials, today’s statement will offer very welcome relief. It is right to target help at those on low incomes, who are least able to bear the shock of soaring energy bills. We are pleased by the commitment to uprate benefits in line with inflation as usual, though it is still crucial that the government invests on an ongoing basis in ensuring that everyone can get through difficult times and afford the essentials. From Sam Nadel, head of government relations at Oxfam About time! It’s right that fossil fuel companies making excess profits are being asked to contribute more at a time when so many families in the UK have run out of options and can’t afford to pay the bills, with little left to cut back on. From Dan Paskins, director of UK impact at Save the Children Today’s announcement is welcome and will provide much needed breathing space to many families struggling with the cost of living. It’s a generous package, and the chancellor has clearly listened to the unacceptable conditions people have been facing. From Vicki Nash, head of policy, campaigns and public affairs at Mind, the mental health charity Today’s announcement by the chancellor of the xchequer of financial assistance for households across the country is welcome, though we remain concerned that people on the lowest incomes will continue to struggle. We are pleased to see the UK Government recognising the extra costs faced every day by disabled people through a £150 grant to those claiming disability benefits, as well as the decision to give a grant of £650 to 8 million households on the lowest incomes to support with rising living costs. It is also reassuring to hear the Government committing themselves to raising all benefits in line with inflation next year. From Azmina Siddique, policy and impact manager at the Children’s Society The money for households announced today will undoubtedly make a positive impact and ease some of the burden for those who are being hardest hit by energy price shocks. Shockingly, when the chancellor listed the ‘most vulnerable’, children didn’t make the cut. There was an opportunity here to provide targeted support to families with children - a third of whom were already in poverty before the cost of living crisis. Expanding free school meals to all children whose parents are on universal credit or a £10 increase to child benefit could have made a real difference. House tells the police and crime committee that he has responded to the letter from Sadiq Khan, the London mayor, asking for an explanation as to why Boris Johnson received just one fine. He says the letter sets out what he told the committee earlier – that various factors were taken into account when deciding who would be fined. It will be published on the Met’s website, he says. And that’s all the questioning on Partygate. House is now being asked about other policing matters. Caroline Pidgeon (Lib Dem) is asking questions now. Q: Were there any people who refused to respond to your questionnaires? House says that the “vast majority” of people returned their questionnaires. And he says the “vast majority” paid their fines. If people did not return a questionnaire, that did not stop the Met investigating them, he says. Sir Stephen House, the acting commissioner of the Metropolitan police, is giving evidence to the London assembly’s police and crime committee. The first questions have been about Partygate, and there is a live feed here. Asked to explain why Boris Johnson was not fined for attending the Lee Cain leaving do, where he was pictured drinking, House would not give a specific answer. But he said that a variety of factors were taken into account before decisions to issue fines, including how long people spent at an event, and whether or not it was work related. Asked if the CPS has been consulted about decisions to issue fines, he said they had been asked about general points of law – but not specific cases. Asked why the Sunday Times reported several weeks ago that Johnson was telling friends he was only going to get one fine, House said he was confident that Johnson had not been given that assurance by the police. He replied: I’m very confident that no assurance were given to anyone who was subject of any investigation in relation to Operation Hillman [the Partygate inquiry]. The TUC has described today’s announcement from Rishi Sunak as “badly needed”, but criticised the government for not having a long-term plan to raise living standards. In a statement, Frances O’Grady, the TUC general secretary, said: The chancellor should have acted far sooner after his inadequate spring statement. His dither and delay has caused unnecessary hardship and worry for millions. While today’s intervention is badly needed, we should have never been here in the first place … With energy bills rising 23 times faster than wages we urgently need to get pay packets rising and to pay universal credit at a permanently higher rate – not just a one-off boost. That’s the best way to protect livelihoods and to support the economy. In his statement Rishi Sunak stressed that his windfall tax would be temporary. But the CBI is criticising it on the grounds that it could be open-ended. (See 1.50pm) How can they both be right? In his briefing note, the Treasury says that although the intention is for the tax to be temporary, it could last three and a half years. The energy profits levy will apply to profits arising on or after 26 May 2022. Companies who have an accounting period that straddles that date will be required to apportion their profits. It is temporary and will be phased out when oil and gas prices return to historically more normal levels. The legislation will also include a sunset clause, which will remove the tax after 31 December 2025. The CBI, which represents businesses, has said that while support for people with bills is welcome, it is not happy about Rishi Sunak’s plans for a welfare tax. This is from the CBI’s chief economist, Rain Newton-Smith. Helping people facing real hardship amid one of the worst cost-of-living crunches in recent memory is the right thing to do. Despite the investment incentive, the open-ended nature of the energy profits levy - and the potential to bring electricity generation into scope - will be damaging to investment needed for energy security and net zero ambitions. It sends the wrong signal to the whole sector at the wrong time against a backdrop of rising business taxation elsewhere. The government must work with business on a genuine plan for increasing business investment and get growth going again, particularly in areas like energy efficiency. And the British Chambers of Commerce has said there should have been more help for business. This is from Hannah Essex, its co-executive director. The sheer scale of the cost-of living crisis facing the British public means the government is absolutely right to provide additional support to those worst affected. For business, the toxic mix of inflation, raw material costs and supply chain disruption is the flip-side of the coin to the problems facing consumers. Unless steps are also taken to ease business costs, they will likely feed into the inflationary pressure on the economy and quickly eat into the financial support announced today. A reduction in VAT to 5% on businesses’ energy bills would directly alleviate some of this pressure to raise prices. In the Commons Alun Cairns has just highlighted the response to Sunak’s statement from Martin Lewis, the consumer champion who set up the MoneySavingExpert website. It’s here. In his video Lewis says it is “quite a good package” and probably better than he expected. Lewis, who spoke to Sunak on Monday and who is doing an online Q&amp;A with him later this afternoon, says Sunak has addressed many of the points he raised with him. Some of the earlier posts have been beefed up with direct quotes from Rishi Sunak and Rachel Reeves’s speeches. You may need to refresh the page to get those to appear. Back in the Commons Peter Aldous (Con) says he welcomes the measures, but says Rishi Sunak will need to keep the situation under review and consider the case for “further measures”, such as a social tariff and special help for people on pre-payment meters. This is from Paul Johnson, of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, on the difference between Rishi Sunak’s windfall tax, or “temporary, targeted energy profits levy”, and Labour’s version. These are from John McDonnell, the former shadow chancellor, on Sunak’s announcement. These are from Simon Evans, from Carbon Brief, who says the tax relief announced by Rishi Sunak today will incentive energy companies to invest in oil and gas extraction. These charts show how much of the help announced today is going to poorer and richer households. They are from the Treasury’s distributional analysis. As a proportion of household income, the poorest 10% of households gain almost seven times as much as the average household. In cash terms, the measures are not quite so progressive, but they still see the poorest 10% of households gaining more than double what the richest 40% of households are getting. Back in the Commons David Duguid, a Scottish Conservative MP, says he was opposed to Labour’s plans for a windfall tax because they were too “punitive”. He says he welcomes the fact that this approach to excess profits is more targeted. Here is the text of Rishi Sunak’s statement. And here are the background Treasury papers published alongside the main press announcement. This is from Gavin Kelly, chair of the Resolution Foundation and an adviser to Gordon Brown when he was prime minister. “Progressive universalism” was a New Labour concept - meaning providing help across the board, but targeting it so that those most in need receive the most. Kirsty Blackman, the SNP’s Treasury spokeperson, says Rishi Sunak should have gone much further. She says he had £28bn of headroom in terms of debt, or £32bn of headroom in terms of what was needed to balance the budget. In response to a question from Mel Stride (Con), chair of the Commons Treasury committee, Sunak says the impact of these measures on inflation will be “manageable”. Sunak is replying to Reeves. He says the government could not act earlier because it had to wait to see what Ofgem was going to say about the energy cap in the autumn. And he insists that his support package is more generous than what Labour proposed. Reeves asked why the government had not abolished VAT on domestic fuel, as the Brexiters said they would before Brexit. Sunak says that would only be worth £140 to families. His measures are worth a lot more. He ends by claiming Labour is just playing politics with the issue. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, began her response to Rishi Sunak by saying that his windfall tax U-turn showed that Labour is “winning the battle of ideas in Britain”. She says Labour supported the idea because it was best for Britain. But the Tories were only doing it because they needed a headline. She says the government should also be taxing other sources of wealth, such as looking at non-doms. She asks how the package will be funded in full (because the windfall tax will not cover the whole cost). And she asks if people with multiple homes will get multiple fuel bill discounts. UPDATE: Reeves said: After today’s announcement, let there be no doubt about who is winning the battle of ideas in Britain. It’s the Labour party. Today, it feels like the chancellor has finally realised the problems the country are facing. We first called for a windfall tax on oil and gas producers nearly five months ago to help struggling families and pensioners. Today, he has announced that policy but he can’t dare say the words: it’s a policy that dare not speak its name with this chancellor. And it was Labour that first highlighted the unfairness of this government’s buy now, pay later compulsory loan scheme. It shouldn’t have taken a rocket scientist to work out that this wouldn’t cut and we pointed it out at the time ... Every day for five months, the prime minister sent Conservative MPs out to attack the windfall tax and yet defends an increase in taxes on working people. He has made them vote against it not once, not twice, but three times - and for months he has sent his MPs to defend the litany of rule-breaking in No 10 Downing Street set out in the Sue Gray report yesterday. There is a lesson here for Conservative MPs - you can’t believe a word that this prime minister says. Labour called for a windfall tax because it is the right thing to do. The Conservatives are doing it because they needed a new headline. Here is the Treausury news release with full details of the Sunak announcement. And this is how the Treasury sums up the announcements. Almost all of the eight million most vulnerable households across the UK will receive support of at least £1,200 this year, including a new one-off £650 cost of living payment. Universal support increases to £400, as the October discount on energy bills is doubled and the requirement to repay it over five years is scrapped. This new [£15bn] support package is targeted towards millions of low-income households and brings the total cost of living support to £37bn this year. New, temporary energy profits levy on oil and gas firms will raise around £5bn over the next year to help with cost of living, with a new investment allowance to encourage firms to invest in oil and gas extraction in the UK. This is from Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies. He approves. Sunak ends his statement by saying that the 8m most vulnerable households in the country will get £1,200 from this announcement. Sunak says the £200 annnounced in February to help people with their energy bills will be increased to £400. And this will no longer be a loan to be repaid over five years. It will be a grant, he says. He says the total value of the support announced today will be £15bn. UPDATE: Sunak said: We are meeting our responsibility to provide the most help to those on the lowest incomes. I believe that is fair and I’m confident the house will agree. But there are many other families who do not require state support in normal times, they are also facing challenging times. Is it fair to leave them unsupported? The answer must surely be no. While it is impossible for the government to solve every problem we can and will ease the burden as we help the entire country through the worst of this crisis ... Since then the outlook for energy prices has changed, I’ve heard people’s concerns over the impact of [having to repay the £200 energy bill loans announced in February], so I’ve decided that those repayments will be cancelled. This support is now unambiguously a grant ... the £200 of support for household energy bills will be doubled to £400 for everyone. Sunak said eight million pensioner households who get the winter fuel payment will get payments of £300. And he says the six million people who get disability benefits will get payments of £150. He says many people in this group will also get the £650 announced earlier. He says total support for people on low incomes will be worth £9bn, and will go to a third of UK households. UPDATE: Sunak said: From the autumn we will send over eight million pensioner households who receive the winter fuel payment an extra one-off pensioner cost-of-living payment of £300. Disabled people also face extra costs in their day-to-day lives, like having energy-intensive equipment around the home or workplace. So to help the six million people who receive non-means tested disability benefits we will send them, from September, an extra one-off disability cost-of-living payment worth £150. Many disabled people will also receive the payment of £650 I’ve already announced, taking their total cost-of-living payments to £800. Sunak is now announcing measures to help people. He says around eight million of the lowest-income households will get £650. That will be worth around £5bn, he says. The money will come in two lump sums. He says this will be worth more to people than uprating benefits. UPDATE: Sunak said: Right now [low income households] face incredibly difficult choices so I can announce today we will send directly to around 8 million of the lowest-income households a one-off cost-of-living payment of £650, support worth over £5bn to give vulnerable people certainty that we are standing by them at this challenging time DWP will make the payment in two lump sums, the first from July, the second in autumn, with payments from HMRC for those on tax credits following shortly after. Sunak says households are being hit hard now. The government will provide significant support, he says. As it supports people more, it needs to think of the fairest way to fund that. The oil and gas sector is making extraordinary profits, not because of extra risk taking or efficiency, but because of surging energy prices. So he is sympathetic to the case of taxing those profits fairly. Labour MPs are jeering loudly. Dame Eleanor Laing, the deputy Speaker, asks for “quieter banter”. Sunak says there is a middle way. He will impose a tax, but with an incentive for firms to invest. The new measure will be the “temporary targeted energy profits levy”, he says. This euphemism for windfall tax generates loud laughter. It will be set at 25%, and temporary, he says. He says a sunset clause will be in the bill. And firms that invest will get tax relief on 90% of their investments. UPDATE: Sunak said: Like previous governments, including Conservative ones, we will introduce a temporary targeted energy profits levy, but we have built into the new levy ... a new investment allowance similar to the super-deduction that means companies will have a new and significant incentive to reinvest their profits. The new levy will be charged on profits of oil and gas companies at a rate of 25%. It will be temporary and when oil and gas prices return to historically more normal levels the levy will be phased out. Sunak says fiscal support should be “timely, temporary and targeted”. Sunak says high inflation should not be allowed to continue long term. The government can use monetary responsibility (interest rates), fiscal responsibility (not spending too much) and supply side activism (building more nuclear energy plants and offshore windfarms) to address the problem, he says. Sunak says no government can solve all problems, particularly global ones. But this government will not stop trying to help people. We need to make sure that for those whom the struggle is too hard, and for whom the risks are too great, this government will not sit idly by. Inflation is at it highest rate for 40 years. It is expected to average 9% this year. He says global factors are driving this. Over the course of the year, the situation has become more serious. “Core inflation” has become broader based, and elevated. And the UK is acutely exposed to the European energy market. And, like the US, it has a tight labour market. He says low unemployment is good news. But it contributes to the UK’s relatively high rate of inflation. Rishi Sunak is making his statement now. He says high inflation is causing “acute distress” for people. He will explain what is happening, why, and what the government will do about it. Labour has been calling for a windfall tax on energy companies to fund support for people with their energy bills for months and so when Rishi Sunak embraces the idea in his statement, which is likely to start in the next half an hour or so, that will mark a major victory for the opposition. Steven Swinford from the Times says Sunak will try to argue that his windfall tax is different, and more Conservative, than Labour’s. But it is likely that this nuance may be lost as the headlines get written. For a long time Sunak just argued that a windfall tax would be bad in principle, because it would deter investment. In politics it is generally good to be winning the arguments, and governments that make frequent U-turns (like Boris Johnson’s) find that their MPs can no longer be confident that they will persist with any of their policies. But the move marks a threat to Labour too. Sunak is about to pinch their best known, and most popular, economic policy, which means they will have to recraft their campaign messaging. In a tweet this morning Keir Starmer attacked Sunak for performing his U-turn too late. Presumably, once the detail is out, a more robust Labour attack line will emerge. Labour’s Emily Thornberry struck a nerve in the Commons earlier when she asked Suella Braverman, the attorney general, if she had authorised the leaking of government legal advice about the Northern Ireland protocol. Braverman ducked the question and then – as Thornberry continued to effectively heckle her by repeating the question as she was sitting on the opposition front bench – embarked on a remarkable rant about her Labour opposite number, describing her as a Leninist. Thornberry asked Braverman: The attorney general has said again today that there’s a long-standing convention that prevents her discussing either the fact or the content of her legal advice on the Northern Ireland protocol, which makes it all the more remarkable that on Wednesday May 11 the Times newspaper and BBC Newsnight not only disclosed the fact of her legal advice but actually quoted from its contents. So, can I ask the attorney general one very straightforward question, which only requires a yes or no answer: did she personally authorise the briefings to the Times and to Newsnight regarding her advice on the protocol, yes or no? In response, Braverman said she took the convention “incredibly seriously”, but she said she would not comment on media speculation. She said there were “big differences” between herself and Thornberry, and that she was “very disappointed” by Thornberry’s line of attack. Then she went on: I love the United Kingdom, [Thornberry] is embarrassed by our flag. I’m proud of the leadership the United Kingdom has demonstrated, and [Thornberry] wants us to be run by Brussels and wants to scrap Trident. My heroes are Churchill and Thatcher, hers are Lenin and Corbyn. Normally internal government legal advice is never released, although sometimes ministers do agree to publish it. Braverman has refused to discuss in public what her legal advice on the protocol may have said, but she did not seem overly upset about the leak and, as the exchanges with Thornberry showed, would not deny authorising it. We will find out what Rishi Sunak is going to announce in about an hour or so. If you are interested in what thinktanks think he should announce, here are contributions from three of them. In a briefing paper published yesterday, the Resolution Foundation says “one-off payments (delivered through existing mechanisms such as the winter fuel payment or Christmas bonus systems) to all households on benefits (including all pensioners) are now preferable and probably easier to deliver than alternatives”. The New Economics Foundation says Sunak should raise £13bn from a windfall tax set at 70%. Miatta Fahnbulleh, its CEO, explains more in a Twitter thread starting here. And the Institute for Government says, in a briefing paper published yesterday, that the government “should be wary of introducing broad based tax cuts, for example to VAT, or spending giveaways, since these would be expensive and not targeted enough to boost the household finances of those most in need”. And these are from Steven Swinford, political editor of the Times, on the Rishi Sunak package coming later. Speaking on Times Radio this morning Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, repeated the point he made on the Today programme about the need for the cost of living support package to be targeted at those most in need. (See 9.25am.) He also said Rishi Sunak should ensure that his measures were not inflationary. He said: There’s a very strong case for giveaways to help those who are struggling most. But if you’re going to do that, because of the dangers associated with inflation, there’s a case for tax rises elsewhere so that there isn’t significant additional money swirling around in the economy. Now we do have some tax rises coming in this year, so the chancellor is already taking some money out of the economy. But I think he does need to think quite hard about that balance and the risks associated with inflation. What you generally don’t want to do in the face of lots of inflation is chuck lots more money at the economy. In the Commons the Conservative MP John Baron has been speaking on the urgent question he tabled on the evacuation of Afghanistan. He criticised the Foreign Office for imposing “red tape and bureaucracy” on those trying to help Afghans trying to flee the country come to the UK. He did mention Boris Johnson personally – but only to say that he appreciated what Johnson said to him on this subject at PMQs yesterday. He did not mention, or even allude to indirectly, his earlier statement today saying he could no longer support Johnson because of Partygate. (See 9.50am.) In interviews this morning Lisa Nandy, the shadow levelling up secretary, said she hoped the government would announce measures that would provide real help to people needing help with the cost of living. She told BBC Breakfast: We’ve proposed knocking £200 off people’s energy bills, but targeted help for those who most need it. The plan that we put forward months ago would knock up to £600 off energy bills for those who most need it. Everybody is struggling at the moment, but some people are really, really unable to keep their heads above water, so the chancellor could bring forward those measures today. He could also do other things that we’ve been calling for, like bringing forward benefits uprating, not waiting till the autumn to catch up with soaring inflation rates and get help to people now. Lisa Nandy, the shadow levelling up secretary, told Sky News this morning that she thought the government was using the cost of living support package announcement today to distract attention from the Sue Gray report. She told the programme: Several times over the last few months the prime minister has taken action when he’s been in real trouble in order to distract from the troubles in government. But Stephen Barclay, the Cabinet Office minister who serves as chief of staff at No 10, told the same programme that the Rishi Sunak package was coming today because of an announcement earlier this week from Ofgem, not the one from Sue Gray. He explained: In terms of the timing, firstly we don’t control the timing of the Sue Gray report. The timing of that is shaped by the Met police investigation. What we’ve always said is, in terms of the fiscal response, we wanted to see from the Ofgem guidance what the full impact would be in the autumn on families so that we can get the design of that package right. We’ve had that guidance this week from Ofgem. That is why the chancellor is coming forward today. It’s also in terms of parliament and the parliamentary timetable. The Conservative MP David Simmonds has said that, following the publication of the Sue Gray report yesterday, he has come to the view that Johnson should resign. Mollie Malone from Sky News has his statement. Simmmonds has been highly critical of Johnson over Partygate before – on Tuesday he said it would be “very difficult” for Johnson to persuade MPs he did not lie to them about the parties - but this is the first time Simmonds has publicly called for Johnson to quit. That means there are now three Tory MPs who have, for the first time, joined those saying Johnson should go follow the publication of yesterday’s report. The others are John Baron, who spoke out this morning (see 9.50am), and Julian Sturdy, who issued a statement yesterday. In her overnight story on Tory reaction to the Gray report, my colleague Jessica Elgot says at least three more Tory MPs are thought to have submitted letters to Sir Graham Brady, the chair of the Tory 1922 Committee, asking for a vote of no confidence, over the last 24 hours. It is not clear yet whether those three are Sturdy, Baron and Simmonds, or other MPs. Yesterday morning there were only 15 Tory MPs on the record as saying Johnson should go. (See the tweet below from Tom Larkin from Sky News.) But it is thought that more than 40 MPs have privately submitted letters to Brady demanding a no confidence vote. Once 54 letters are in (15% of the parliamentary party), a ballot will take place. This is from Ben Riley-Smith from the Daily Telegraph on the Rishi Sunak announcement coming later. The Conservative MP John Baron says that, in the light of what was in the Sue Gray report yesterday, he can no longer continue to support Boris Johnson. Here is an extract from his statement: For me the most serious charge against the prime minister is that of knowingly misleading parliament. Given the scale of rule breaking in No 10, I can not accept that the Prime Minister was unaware. Therefore, his repeated assurances in parliament that there was no rule-breaking is simply not credible ... A bedrock principle of our constitution is that we can trust the responses receive in parliament to be truthful and accurate. Parliament is the beating heart of our nation. To knowingly mislead it can not be tolerated, no matter the issue. Whether or not the Prime Minister is an asset to the party or the country of less importance. Having always said I would consider all the available evidence before deciding, I’m afraid the prime minister no longer enjoys my support - I can no longer give him the benefit of the doubt. Henry Zeffman from the Times has the statement in full. We will be hearing more from Baron later because he tabled the urgent question on Afghanistan scheduled for 10.30am. (See 9.40am.) There will be an urgent question in the Commons at 10.30am on the evacuations from Afghanistan (the subject of a particularly damning report by the foreign affairs committee this week). That means the business statement won’t start until after 11pm, and the Rishi Sunak statement will probably not start until after 12pm. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, will not be taking first minister’s questions today, she says, because she is still ill with Covid. Good morning. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, will later this morning announce a colossal cost of living support package, primarily intended to help people cope with soaring energy bills. He is not calling it the “emergency budget” that Labour has been demanding, but the size of the giveaway - at least £10bn, according to overnight briefing - makes it more significant than many of the budget we’ve had over the last decade or so. But this is the third fiscal event on this scale already this year - after the £9bn energy support package announced in February, and the spring statement, which included further giveaways worth around £10bn - and we have not even had the 2022 budget. Spending interventions on this scale have become the new norm. Sunak has been promising further support measures for a week, but no one at Westminster believes that its timing, less than 24 hours after Boris Johnson made his statement to MPs about the Sue Gray report, is a coincidence. Banging on about “dead cats” is one of the most hackneyed, and often erroneous, features of modern political commentary, but today it is fully justified. As we explain in our overnight story, Sunak is going to announce a major U-turn, because he will announce a windfall tax having spent months rejecting what has been Labour’s flagship economic proposal. But his announcement today may indicate a change of approach in another respect. In his speech in the Queen’s speech debate, and in other recent inteventions, Sunak has implied that he wants to focus help on the most vulnerable. Some of the measures announced today will be targeted at the poorest households, but the overnight briefing suggests there will also be a strong universal element too it as well, with every household getting extra support. In an interview on the Today programme this morning Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, the public spending thinktank, questioned whether this was the right approach. He said: For the poorest households it’s certainly very much needed. It’s extraordinarily hard to cope with that kind of increase in your energy bills and general inflation, not least because benefits have only risen by 3% this year. Whether it’s needed for all households, I think, is more of a difficult point. £100 off for each household in the country costs, each £100, costs something like £3bn and a lot of that money, frankly, will go to households who don’t desperately need it. I’m sure they’ll appreciate it, but won’t necessarily need it. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.15am: James Cleverly, the Europe minister, gives evidence to a Lords committee on the Northern Ireland protocol. Around 11.30am: Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, makes a statement to MPs about a multi-billion cost of living support package, partly funded by a windfall tax. 12pm: Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, takes questions from MSPs. 12.30pm: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing. 12.30pm: Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, appears on ITV’s Loose Women. After 12.30pm: Boris Johnson leads tributes to the Queen in a debate marking her Platinum Jubilee. Afternoon: Sunak does a Q&amp;A with people on a visit, as well as a social media Q&amp;A with the moneysaving expert Martin Lewis. 2pm: Sir Stephen House, the acting commissioner of the Metropolitan police, gives evidence about the Partygate investigation to the London assembly’s police and crime committee. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include “Andrew” in it somewhere and I’m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can’t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter. I’m on @AndrewSparrow.

It also compiles donations, salaries, gifts and other interests registered by MPs that are linked to fossil fuel industries or organisations that have denied or cast doubt on climate science. Starting with the Climate Change Act of 2008, it covers 16 votes covering a range of approaches to reducing carbon emissions. The scores are indicative rather than conclusive; the constraints of the party system, the arcane procedures of parliament and the complexity of the voting process are all factors that are hard to quantify. Vote score methodology These 16 parliamentary votes on climate (the full list is at the bottom of this article) were chosen by the Guardian and DeSmog UK, which undertakes not-for-profit investigative environmental journalism, . The selection of votes sought to cover a spectrum of policies and motions would affect the UK’s carbon emissions, with an emphasis on votes where MPs were willing to break ranks and put the climate before their party. The list was drawn up in consultation with multiple sources, including Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace, Rebecca Willis (a research associate at Lancaster University) and others. These groups did not see the overall results before publication. Some of the organisations consulted disputed the inclusion of two of the 16 votes: on carbon capture and storage, and nuclear power. However, because of the effect that both bills would have had on carbon emissions, the Guardian included them, though it recognises they are expensive options. On the scorecards, a pro-climate vote (determined purely by its likely impact on emissions, according to the Guardian and DeSmog) is marked with a green tick; negative votes are marked with a black X. The votes were sourced from the Public Whip’s division repository. MPs were assigned points based on the following scoring system: “Negative” vote = -1 “Positive” vote = +1 Both (where an MP walks through both divisions) = 0 Each individual’s cumulative score was divided by the total number of votes he or she participated in. The result is expressed as a percentage. The scoring system was devised by the Guardian. All MPs’ voting records were later checked against the relevant record of the divisions on Hansard. Votes by assent were not included because there are no records to show which MPs were in support. For this reason, parliament’s declaration of a climate emergency and its endorsement of a carbon-neutral goal for 2050 are not included in the scorecards. Minimum qualification: MPs had to have voted on at least three occasions to receive a score. For example, MPs first elected in the 2019 byelections do not feature on the scorecards because they have not taken part in enough votes. Sinn Féin MPs do not have scores because they do not take their places in parliament. Absenteeism: Because of the pairing system operated in the UK parliament (the agreement between two MPs from opposing parties to not vote in a particular division, which in effect means they can cancel out each other’s vote), absent votes were not included in MPs’ scoring cards. The graphic only shows those votes for which an MP was present. Rebellions: The decision was taken not to award MPs extra points for rebellion votes as this would have unfairly disadvantaged individuals who consistently voted green. Tellers’ votes: Tellers (MPs appointed to verify the count when there is a division in the Commons and report the results) are included as an aye or no vote depending on what side of the division they represented. Party/cabinet/shadow cabinet scores: These are based on the average (mean) votes of the relevant group. The party average is based on MPs’ current party affiliation, which is not necessarily their party affiliation at the time of the votes. Senior cabinet members are included in the cabinet score, but not the chief secretary to the Treasury, the leader of the House of Commons, the chief whip, the attorney general or others who attend cabinet meetings, including Lady Evans, leader of the Lords, who is not an MP, and Alister Jack, who assumed office in June 2017 and therefore did not have the requisite three votes required for a score to be assigned. The same calculation was carried out for their Labour opposites, excluding Dan Carden, Keir Starmer and Lesley Laird, who also did not have the requisite three votes. Whipped/free votes: Parties do not consistently reveal whether votes are free or whipped. Our assessment of “rebellions” is based on whether MPs voted against the majority of their party, following the approach used in the Public Whip website. MPs’ interests methodology Each individual’s record of interests was taken from the They Work for You website and saved as a text document. These text documents were then compared to a list of more than 400 search terms agreed by the aforementioned panel, including (but not limited to) organisations and individuals listed on DeSmog’s Climate Disinformation Database. Every resulting interest was manually checked for errors and false positives, for example where one MP’s interests was erroneously listed on another MP’s page or where the term “BP” was detected because it formed part of a postcode. Interests registered prior to 28 October 2008 (the date of the third reading of the climate change bill) and after 3 July 2019 (the date of the final search) are not included. Wherever possible each individual’s entry was checked against the original parliamentary record. Where an individual MP had declared multiple interests, an editorial decision was taken as to which interests were of a higher priority. For example a sizeable monetary donation would potentially be prioritised over a lower value ticket to a sports event.

Since 2014 she has been writing about the role of big data and commercial surveillance in the digital era. Last year she published her third book, The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, which became a bestseller and has been described by Zadie Smith as “easily the most important book to be published this century”. 1. Music DJ Shadow: Our Pathetic Age This is a powerful compilation of rap music featuring a range of amazing artists: people like Nas, Ghostface Killah, De La Soul. Many of the songs take aim at what I have called “surveillance capitalism” and its power to influence, degrade and control our feelings and behaviours. Many lyrics blaze with insight and the righteous outrage crucial to public awakening. The album names these hidden forces, assuring us that our sense of menace is not paranoia, but recognition of “our generation’s form of nuclear power”. As one rap counsels, “How we deal with this will be the stuff of history.” 2. Food Sacha Finkelsztajn, Paris During a recent week in Paris we were dazzled by many beautiful dinners. But best of all was an afternoon roaming the Jewish Quarter in the Marais, where my son Jake and I collected golden crepes with butter and sugar and massive pittas stuffed with falafel. Sacha Finkelsztajn is a bright yellow-fronted delicatessen, and we laid out our treasures and ordered more: empanadas, pastrami, pastries filled with sweet poppy seed paste. Powered by mugs of hot coffee, we smiled, laughed, and ate joyously for an hour. 3. Exhibition Albrecht Dürer at the Albertina Museum, Vienna This extraordinary exhibition of over 200 paintings, drawings and prints follows the journey of Dürer’s life and his otherworldly mastery. You can see his genius building as painstaking studies of hands, fingers, leaves, wings, flowers are reborn in large, complex compositions. There are some revered pieces, like Young Hare, and others rarely on display. The palpable force of his commitment to the world as it is, his uncanny insight and his breathtaking technical skill moved me deeply. The centuries that separate our existences seemed to melt away, leaving only the human struggle that we share. 4. Book The Overstory by Richard Powers I find it impossible to live without the presence of trees: they focus me on what is most enduring. This Pulitzer-winning novel unfurls from the point of view of trees, creatures that grow stronger with age and die only when attacked from without – just the opposite of humans. Powers’s exquisite and soul-wrenching work is a tragic exploration of the wisdom and generosity of an Earth now doomed by modernity’s perverse refusal to embrace the non-human orders of life upon which everything depends, including now our very survival. This novel left me feeling sanctified, even as each page drove me mad. 5. Play Burn This, on Broadway Earlier this year I saw a revival of this Lanford Wilson play about grief, how it undoes us and remakes us. Adam Driver plays a character whose younger brother is revealed to him only after his sudden death. Driver’s performance was Shakespearean: one of the most extraordinary experiences of theatre I’ve had. It reminded me that a single actor, on stage as in life, can have a transformational effect. Driver gave body and soul with an incandescent ferocity that taught me and changed me – something I didn’t anticipate and will never forget. 6. Places Berlin and Normandy I am moved by the seriousness with which Berlin memorialises the Holocaust, such as with Track 17 at Grunewald train station, where Jewish families were sent to their murder; or the Wall of Mirrors, where ordinary people see only their own reflections.

It happened almost by chance. I was speaking with a local government officer who was developing the county’s economic strategy. As someone who has worked with governments on climate issues for many years, I had been asked to offer advice on how to make Cumbria a climate leader. We talked through the opportunities – investing in renewables, helping businesses reduce waste, developing Cumbria’s tourist industry. And then the government officer mentioned, almost in passing, that they had been helping a company with plans for a new coalmine, to produce coking coal for steel production. I didn’t know what to say. This would be the first new deep coal mine in the UK for 30 years, and the only active one: the last of the old ones closed in 2015. After a long silence I pointed out that digging up coal – the most polluting of all fossil fuels – is no definition of climate leadership. Yet just a couple of weeks later, Cumbria county council’s planning committee voted unanimously in favour of the mine. Two years later, the fate of the mine hangs in the balance. In March, after mounting controversy, the local government secretary Robert Jenrick took the decision out of Cumbria’s hands and ordered a public inquiry. It is now Jenrick, not Cumbria, who will decide. But behind the row over the mine lies a complex story about the politics of post-industrial communities, and about the UK’s deeply ambiguous climate strategy. To many, Cumbria may seem a vision of rural perfection. Each year, 18 million visitors come to admire the breathtaking scenery of the Lake District. The proposed mine site sits in the north-west corner of the county, sandwiched between the sandstone cliffs of St Bees Head to the west and the fells to the east. But Cumbria’s natural beauty masks a difficult economic situation. Jobs in tourism are badly paid and insecure, and farming faces an uncertain future. Decades ago, Cumbria’s west coast was a vibrant industrial centre, with coal mining, chemical plants, steelworks, shipbuilding and nuclear power. Today, all these industries are in decline, or have disappeared entirely. The Sellafield nuclear complex, which used to reprocess nuclear fuel, is now being decommissioned, with the loss of 3,000 jobs. Young people are leaving to find work elsewhere. Cumbria is, economically and geographically, a long way from London, and from the decision-makers in Westminster and Whitehall. In 2014, EMR Capital, a venture capital firm based in Australia (with an office in the Cayman Islands) saw the potential to extract coking coal – a type of coal, also known as metallurgical coal, that is used by the steel industry for powering blast furnaces – from a rich seam just off the Cumbrian coast. A local company, West Cumbria Mining, was established, and funded by EMR Capital to develop plans for a mine they called Woodhouse Colliery. Locally, the proposal was greeted with much enthusiasm, and seems initially to have passed under the radar of national policymakers and environmental groups. Speaking to local politicians, the appeal is clear. (I asked those involved in the decision to speak freely, and in return, offered them anonymity.) A Labour councillor who represents an area close to the mine site said that on the west coast, “levels of support for the coalmine would probably be 90% or more. It is very hard to find someone who is against it. They offer reasonably well-paid jobs on a semi-permanent basis, for up to 500 people, plus the supply chain. And this isn’t pie in the sky. This is plans drawn up, planning permission applied for, ready to roll … proper investment into what has been basically an abandoned area.” Although he had always pledged his support for the mine, he told me privately that he had his doubts, on climate grounds. But to oppose it publicly “would be like committing ritual hara-kiri politically”, he said. “It would be like being against fish in Hull, or tourism in the Cotswolds.” Another political candidate, and longtime opponent of the scheme, told me that West Cumbria Mining “have been very good at public relations. They’ve held frequent meetings, they’re doing newsletters, they are very reassuring.” Even before the planning application, the company was investing heavily in community relations, meeting with the political candidates in the 2017 byelection for the Copeland seat, helping with careers fairs and placing stories in local media. “In the early days,” the candidate told me, “it was very difficult to find anybody who was telling any kind of alternative story.” Everyone was surprised, they said, when, last year, the mine started to get a bad press nationally. They also said that their opposition to the scheme marked them out locally. People are willing to listen, they said, but “the kind ones think I’m well-meaning but misguided, and the other ones think I’m just malicious”. The tensions are worsened by the inequality across the county. Some of Cumbria’s most vocal opposition has come from Tim Farron, an MP in the south of the county, and the former leader of the Liberal Democrats. Politically, there’s no downside for him in opposing the mine. The south and east of Cumbria are relatively affluent. For Farron’s parliamentary colleagues in the north and west of the county, it’s a different story. As another local MP told me, “this dynamic tends to cause a lot of frustration in west Cumbria. People who, frankly, are the best part of an hour-and-a-half away from them wading in and causing trouble in a development that actually really won’t directly affect them and their families.” Mark Jenkinson, the MP for Workington, just down the coast from the site, has criticised the “climate terrorists” who oppose the mine. West Cumbria Mining and Cumbria county council have played a clever hand on the climate issue. They haven’t ignored it entirely. Instead, they have come up with an audacious narrative that the mine would actually be beneficial in climate terms – that it would reduce emissions overall. They have built this claim by commissioning consultants to say what they need, and by seeking to complicate an issue that is, at heart, straightforward. They are prolonging a debate which, in reality, has long been settled. These are tactics that fossil fuel industries have used time and time again. Cumbria county council, under strong political pressure to support the mine, has been a willing collaborator. * * * At first, it suited West Cumbria Mining to play down the climate issue, focusing on the benefits that the mine would bring to the local area and to renewable energy. On the mining company’s website, a series of “factsheets” stress that steel is needed to make wind turbines, and that coal is needed for steel production. There are no references to lower-carbon forms of steelmaking. One of the very few mentions of carbon emissions on the factsheets is an assurance that the mine site itself will be fitted with low-energy lighting and charging points for electric vehicles. West Cumbria Mining’s summary environmental statement, published in 2017, stated that “there will be no significant environmental impacts from Woodhouse Colliery”. But as questions began to be asked, the company’s tactics changed. In 2020 they commissioned a report from a multinational consultancy, AECOM, whose clients previously included the controversial Adani coalmine in Australia. This report, a greenhouse gas “assessment”, only considers the impact of the mine site itself, during the construction, operation and decommissioning phases, and not the emissions from burning the coal. As the report states, “the use of coal produced by the development is not an effect (whether direct, or indirect/secondary) caused by any phase of the development”. In other words, it’s not the mine’s problem that the coal gets burned. The same report notes that UK steel companies currently ship coal in from the US – but with a new mine in the UK that would no longer be necessary. The report provided figures for greenhouse gas emissions saved as a result. The mine’s chief executive, Mark Kirkbride, used this assessment to inform the planning committee that “Every tonne of coal from West Cumbria Mining is a tonne that will not be transported across the ocean, thereby saving on greenhouse gas emissions. The claims of a climate emergency continue to ignore the climate benefits of this project, as a result of reduced distances.” Talking to local politicians, I have heard these claims about emissions repeated many times. “If we wish to have a steel industry,” said one councillor, “we need coking coal, and that coking coal would be better to be mined in this country … If you dig it out of a hole in the ground in Russia, Australia or Kentucky, then it has to be taken into boats and shipped all the way over here.” An MP told me: “I think you can make an argument that this coalmine is creating green jobs. This is coking coal, it’s as clean as a coalmine can be, it’s producing coking coal for use in steel, for use in renewables.” It is staggering that the mine and its supporters are able to make these claims, given that the coal mined at Woodhouse Colliery would, when burned, result in 9m tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions a year, more than the combined emissions from the entire cities of Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast. These are emissions we desperately need to avoid. The scientific evidence is straightforward. Just last week, the International Energy Agency, established more than four decades ago to ensure reliable supplies of fossil fuels, declared that if climate goals are to be reached, no new coalmines could be built. It also said that there was enough coal in existing mines to cover the steel sector’s transition from coal to new methods of production. We need to be closing down mines. Opening new mines causes climate change. It’s not complicated. But if the evidence is straightforward, UK law is ambiguous. Planning law says that climate change must be taken into account, but doesn’t give clear guidance on how this should be done. The government has strong carbon targets, but doesn’t specify how these should apply to different industrial sectors. This ambiguity leaves plenty of space for confusion. And if you’re looking to build a mine, confusion can be useful. * * * Although Cumbrian councillors had voted to approve the mine in early 2019, things changed quickly after that. In June of that year, the government, with strong cross-party support, introduced a more stringent climate goal. The UK was now committed to meet “net zero” carbon emissions by 2050. Shortly afterwards, it announced the creation of a clean steel fund, to encourage investment in lower-carbon steel production. Worried about these changed circumstances, Cumbria county council decided that it would need to revisit its decision on the mine. In October 2019, the planning committee, consisting of local councillors from the three major political parties, discussed it once again. Mining company representatives, supported by council officials, reiterated its climate arguments. The council even went so far as to say that the mine would be “carbon neutral”. Yet again, with virtually no debate on the climate implications, the committee voted unanimously in favour. Until this point, I had been convinced that the committee would realise the evidence against the mine was overwhelming. But by the time of the second unanimous vote, I had to rethink. Obviously, I thought, they were not getting the right information. So I set out to provide it for them. With the carbon-footprinting expert and fellow Lancaster University professor Mike Berners-Lee, we tested each claim made by the mining company and the county council. We checked the carbon neutral claim with the leading resource economist Prof Paul Ekins. He found that emissions from shipping coal are insignificant compared to emissions from burning it. For the carbon neutral claim to be true, it would be necessary to identify mines elsewhere in the world that would shut down, or reduce production in line with increased production from the new mine. No such mine had been identified. We also talked to steel industry experts who told us that the council’s assumptions about the need for coking coal to produce steel were out of step with what the steel industry itself is saying. It was likely that the coal wouldn’t be needed for long. All steel companies are investing in lower-carbon alternatives to the blast furnaces that require coal, and are expected to move beyond coal-based steel production within 15 to 20 years, developing new techniques that use electricity or hydrogen in place of coal. If the coal was no longer needed for steel production, it is unclear what would happen to the mine, its coal or those 500 jobs. In January 2020, we published a summary of this evidence in a report for the thinktank Green Alliance. Stories about the mine were starting to appear in the national newspapers, and the council decided that it needed to look at the project for a third time. By then, it had access to work by Berners-Lee, Ekins and many other independent climate strategy and economics experts. Yet this evidence was dismissed. The council, instead, relied on its paid advisers, the consultancy AECOM and Dr Neil Bristow, a consultant and a coal industry insider who, in conference presentations, has warned audiences of threats from “the rising green movement”. West Cumbria Mining published a line-by-line rebuttal of our report, based on work by Dr Bristow. It contained factual errors, some as basic as saying the report had five authors (it had four); and claimed that we did not understand the difference between thermal coal for power generation, and metallurgical coal (coking coal) for steel production, even though our report is clear on this point. It questioned our professional standing, and claimed to have worked with “mining experts, steel industry experts, and coal quality and marketing experts”, though the only one named was Dr Bristow. It didn’t provide any references or sources for the evidence. Their report didn’t uncover any independent evidence that this mine will result in a reduction in carbon emissions – because no such evidence exists. Berners-Lee and I pointed out all these failings in a further submission, which was, rather surreally, a rebuttal of its rebuttal of our rebuttal. West Cumbria Mining did not offer to correct even the most basic factual errors. Despite access to all this evidence, in October last year, at the third planning meeting, Cumbria county council again remained committed to its arguments. The planning officer showed councillors a table summarising the overall costs and benefits of the scheme. Somehow, climate change had found its way into the benefits column. Contrary to the expert evidence, it was argued that this coalmine was better than carbon neutral – it was actually carbon negative. It would save more emissions than it caused. The argument was still: dig coal to save the climate. Farron, the only Cumbria MP to oppose the mine, spoke at the meeting to ask his fellow politicians to see sense. He pointed out that West Cumbria Mining “brazenly ignore the fact that the coal they mine will actually be burned, leaving that inconvenient truth out of their emissions calculations. If you are being kind, you’d call that slippery – but surely no councillor will fall for that?” But a large majority voted to approve the mine once more. After this meeting, the trickle of stories in national newspapers became a flood. By early 2021, the government’s independent advisers, the Climate Change Committee, had written to the government, questioning the compatibility of the mine proposal with UK climate ambitions. High-profile experts including two government chief scientific advisers, Prof Sir Robert Watson and Prof Sir David King, as well as two leading US experts, the climate scientist James Hansen and President Biden’s climate envoy, John Kerry, thought the same. As the evidence mounted in the press, and a very public row erupted, the government finally took the decision away from the local planning committee and called a public inquiry. * * * How did absurd claims about a climate-neutral coalmine gain a foothold in this debate? At that final meeting, one after another, the councillors said it was a complex case, and that they had struggled to understand it. The chairman told his committee that it was a “very, very finely balanced decision”. How was it that a scientifically straightforward issue had come to be seen as “very finely balanced”? Since the basic knowledge that burning fossil fuels causes changes to Earth’s climate systems was established more than 100 years ago, well-organised and well-funded interests have sought to play down the threat. This mine is only the latest development in a story which began back in the 1980s, when fossil fuel companies deliberately questioned the science of climate change in order to avoid regulation. The historian Naomi Oreskes has charted in painstaking detail how these companies have employed a deliberate strategy of questioning scientific evidence, in order to create enough uncertainty to avoid legislation. She calls them “merchants of doubt”. Thanks to these tactics, many years were wasted disputing the science rather than tackling the problem. It wasn’t until 2018 that the BBC warned its editors about the trap of “false balance”, stating, in official guidelines, that “to achieve impartiality, you do not need to include outright deniers of climate change in BBC coverage, in the same way you would not have someone denying that Manchester United won 2-0 last Saturday. The referee has spoken.” Outright science deniers are, in the UK at least, now a rare sight. But there are still enough companies and countries that stand to gain in the short-term from digging up fossil fuels, so much so that they are throwing down any argument they can to delay the inevitable. Tactics have switched from denying climate change altogether to what a group of leading climate researchers recently dubbed “discourses of delay”. Spurious arguments and dubious data are thrown into the mix to make the issue seem more nuanced and less certain. Why should we reduce our emissions when other countries are getting away with it? Aren’t our emissions tiny compared to other countries or industries or households? How can we reduce our emissions when there aren’t any alternatives? These questions allow doubt to creep in – a new kind of false balance, which, just like the earlier futile debates about the science, means that time and effort is spent countering arguments with little or no evidence behind them. The councillors were being besieged by these discourses of delay, complicating what should have been a simple decision. Emissions from burning the coal don’t count, they were told; just one extra coalmine won’t make any difference; coal is needed to make the steel for wind turbines … These arguments worked because they provided cover to councillors desperate to approve a project that promised jobs. As the local candidate opposing the mine put it, some supporters “really understand the argument about climate change, but think, as we all tend to do, that this is just one exception that we could let through, because this place really needs it”. I am not suggesting that politicians and communities in Cumbria are somehow deliberately in league with sinister forces of climate denial. These discourses of delay, often promoted by people and companies who have fossil fuel interests, have a strong grip on the debate. They provide a way of claiming that you can be pro-mine and pro-climate, rather than having to say, “I support the mine and I don’t care about the climate.” As a local campaigner commented: “The company themselves were very reassuring that it was necessary … that it would displace coal from overseas, so there would be carbon reductions. So everybody kind of bought that line.” * * * The future of the Cumbrian coalmine remains uncertain, and it is still a deeply divisive project. But it didn’t have to be this way. There are two obvious changes that could be made to avoid similar messes in future. The first would be to make sure that there is a clear link between national climate targets and what happens on the ground. At the moment, there is no direct line of sight between targets set at a national level and individual local areas or industrial sectors. This uncertainty makes it easier to say “we must cut carbon, of course. Just not here, not like this.” If local authorities were given legal responsibilities on climate change, and guidance on how it should be taken into account in planning decisions, there would be a straight path from the science to the decisions made. The second lesson from the coalmine saga is that in ex-industrial areas like west Cumbria, the need for good jobs is paramount. It wasn’t that west Cumbria wanted a mine – it wanted jobs, and the coalmine just happened to come along. There would be equal, if not more, enthusiasm for other developments offering good jobs that didn’t contravene climate goals. But in the words of one of the politicians supporting the development, the choice was between “proper investment into jobs and a mine, or some pretty pictures on a diagram about a green economy. The reality is that unless those moves are met with substantial and committed projects, you’re not going to get people to move their position.” As far as I know, there are no such projects on the cards in west Cumbria. This is perhaps the only area where local politicians for and against the mine agree. I asked them all about what they’d like to see happen now, and time and again, they painted a picture of a confident local economic development programme with jobs aligned to climate ambitions. We’re a long way from that at the moment. Those neglected parts of the country haven’t seen the investment they need. In this context, climate policy risks being seen as another kick in the teeth, stoking further divisions between different parts of the country. But this, surely, is the opportunity. The government needs to spend and invest, to kickstart an economy devastated by Covid. In doing so, it could channel money toward the parts of the country that are crying out for jobs and renewal, and toward the industries that will help us achieve our climate ambitions. If, after three years of uncertainty, the government says no to this mine, I will certainly be relieved. But I won’t be celebrating until the deeper lesson is learned: climate ambition, economic regeneration and help for neglected communities like west Cumbria must be one and the same thing. • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, listen to our podcasts here and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2019/dec/14/walk-history-snowdonia-tomen-y-mur-hill-fort-roman-history-medieval-welsh-mythology","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2019-12-14T07:00:17Z","webTitle":"Roman remains: a walk through history in Snowdonia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2019/dec/14/walk-history-snowdonia-tomen-y-mur-hill-fort-roman-history-medieval-welsh-mythology","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2019/dec/14/walk-history-snowdonia-tomen-y-mur-hill-fort-roman-history-medieval-welsh-mythology","fields":{"headline":"Roman remains: a walk through history in Snowdonia","bodyText":"Wherever you walk in Wales, it turns out that you’re tracking some ancient, mythic storyline or other – and nowhere more so than at Tomen y Mur (“the mound on the wall”), a Roman fort and amphitheatre in Snowdonia national park, which sits beside a crossing of four Roman roads. Tomen y Mur, surprisingly unsignposted in spite of its significance, sits on the lower slopes of Mynydd Maentwrog, not far from the A470 to the north-east of Llyn Trawsfynydd reservoir. The fort, now a scheduled monument, was constructed under governor Gnaeus Julius Agricola in 78AD, as part of his campaign to control the native Ordovices, a Celtic tribe who resisted Roman rule with some enthusiasm. Agricola’s response was a brutal campaign which, according to Roman chronicler (and Agricola’s son-in-law) Tacitus, almost wiped out the tribe. The Roman remains at Tomen y Mur are extensive, and various earthworks outside the fort are believed to be a parade ground, a bathhouse, a mansio (a house for visiting officials), burial mounds, a temple and a rare, small military amphitheatre. Abandoned in 140AD, the site was reoccupied a millennium later, and a castle mound built inside the original walls. It was probably constructed by the Normans to counter the Welsh insurgency of 1095. It’s a lovely site, surrounded by fields dotted with the inevitable sheep. There are panoramic views to the west across Llyn Trawsfynydd, a large reservoir on whose north-eastern shore squats a rather less inevitable, decommissioned nuclear power station. The mountains of Snowdonia glower from all directions – the Moelwynion to the north, the Arenigau range stretching east and south-east, and the Rhinogydd to the south and west. Here history and mythology coincide. Tomen y Mur is identified with the legendary palace of Mur Castell in The Mabinogion – a masterpiece of medieval Welsh literature, replete with magical tales reflecting an ancient oral tradition. Its fourth “branch” tells of the prince Lleu Llaw Gyffes (“the fair-haired one with the skilful hand”) who lived here with his wife Blodeuwedd. Blodeuwedd (“flower-face”) had been created for him from the blossoms of oak, broom and meadowsweet after his mother, Arianrhod, cursed him and declared that he should never have a human wife. But Blodeuwedd had her own idea about what she wanted from life, and it didn’t involve Lleu. So she conspired with her lover, Gronw, to kill him and, according to the story, the two ruled together from Tomen y Mur after Lleu’s death. But unfortunately for Blodeuwedd, Lleu wasn’t altogether dead – he had simply shapeshifted into an eagle after Gronw’s attack, and was eventually transformed back into human form by his uncle, the great magician Gwydion. Lleu killed Gronw, and Blodeuwedd was turned into an owl as punishment. “You will not dare to show your face ever again in the light of day,” Gwydion told her, “and that will be because of enmity between you and all other birds.” It’s not just at Tomen y Mur that we can walk these mythic tracks: the surrounding landscape is also steeped in this story. The stone with which Gronw tried to protect himself when Lleu came after him was said by the narrator of The Mabinogion to be “on the bank of the River Cynfael in Ardudwy”, with a hole in the centre where Lleu’s spear penetrated it, so killing Gronw outright. In the early 1990s, a stone slab with precisely such a hole in it was found hidden in the corner of a field on the banks of Afon Bryn Saeth, a small stream that runs into the Cynfael. The stone is now on a farmstead known as Bryn Saeth, or Hill of the Arrow; it is locally known as Llech Ronw – “Gronw’s Slate”. History fades, but the myths embedded in the land don’t die. The soldiers at Tomen y Mur may now have been entirely replaced by sheep, but the lonely hooting of a short-eared owl on a Snowdonia hillside at dusk is a reminder that the old stories are stalking us still. • Sharon Blackie’s collection of short stories, Foxfire, Wolfskin and other Stories of Shapeshifting Women, is out now (£14.99, September Publishing); to order a copy for £13.19 visit the Guardian Bookshop Looking for a holiday with a difference?

Rose has spent the past decades in the United States. She and Hazel have not met since Hazel’s eldest child was a toddler (she is now a difficult, offstage, grown-up, needily phoning home because her washing machine has broken down). Rachel Laurence (Rose) and Maggie O’Brien (Hazel) perfectly catch the spry, spiky awkwardness of the women’s catch-up conversation, its friendly surface rippled by an undertow of dislike and/or suspicion. Lucy Kirkwood’s 2016 play unfurls information gradually (sometimes too teasingly for my taste). The cottage stands just outside a no-go zone, contaminated following a meltdown at a nuclear power plant. Both women are nuclear physicists. Hazel is retired, as is her husband, Robin (Patrick Driver). All three were involved in the construction of the defective plant, their failure fully to consider its location contributed to the scale of the disaster. When he returns home, Robin appears as surprised as Hazel by Rose’s arrival, although it becomes clear that he and Rose (single and not a parent) have been secretly seeing one another over the years. Stefan Escreet’s direction cannily develops the suspense so that the audience’s curiosity mirrors the couple’s: why is Rose here? The “children” of the title turn out to be metaphysical as well as literal (brainchildren as well as real offspring). Rose has come to ask Hazel and Robin to face up to the consequences of long-past actions by assuming responsibility for them and acting to put them right.

They seem not to understand (or don’t care about) the nature of the companies they are dealing with. Chinese state-owned enterprises are not like EDF or the German, Dutch and French state-owned firms that run our railways. They are dramatically different because China is governed by a Leninist state. Consequently, Chinese state firms are ultimately controlled not by the State Council’s State Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, but by the Communist party. Furthermore, one of the two Chinese companies initially involved in the Hinkley Point plant, China National Nuclear (CNNC), while having a civil division, is mainly involved in the production of the country’s nuclear weapons. Consequently, it is almost certainly controlled by the Chinese military: the People’s Liberation Army. With Chinese companies set to take the lead role at Bradwell and Sizewell (including building the reactors and running the stations) and, given EDF’s financial problems, a controlling stake in up to five other nuclear power plants, the British government is setting us up for a situation where the Chinese Communist party – and, assuming CNNC participation, the Chinese military – will have a decisive role in one of our most strategically important industries.

After Morrison declared at the National Press Club last week that the government needed to focus on “practical” climate change action with a focus on mitigation and resilience, MPs debated how the government should reposition its policy response. The debate followed a spill in the Nationals partyroom on Tuesday morning in which former leader Barnaby Joyce failed to topple Michael McCormack after arguing the government should do more to support coal-fired power and warning the party was at risk of losing its voice within the Coalition. In the party room meeting, Joyce also argued against “reactionary” climate policies in response to the bushfire crisis, accusing people of using the tragedy to push the “hobby horse” of climate action. He was backed by NSW National MP David Gillespie who suggested the party’s constituents did not want more action on climate policy, and it was not an issue being raised by voters. But several MPs spoke in favour of more ambitious climate action. The Liberal MP for the seat of Higgins, Katie Allen, expressed support for the “ultimate ambition of carbon neutrality” and an embrace of renewable technology to achieve that goal. Allen’s call for more action was backed by the North Sydney MP Trent Zimmerman, the member for Reid, Fiona Martin, and the Goldstein MP, Tim Wilson, who all supported the embrace of new renewable technologies to cut emissions. Sources say Wilson and Zimmerman also spoke in favour of nuclear power, commending MP Ted O’Brien for his parliamentary inquiry into the issue, which was tabled in December, and advocating for it to be further explored. Zimmerman spoke about the need to do more to address voter concern in seats such as his, pointing to the loss of the Liberal-held seat of Warringah to independent Zali Steggall at the election to highlight the strength of feeling on the issue. He is understood to have argued that the Coalition was not just a coalition of parties, but a coalition of seats with divergent views on the vexed policy matter, and that these different views needed to be respected. In response, the Queensland Nationals MP George Christensen argued his colleagues were sounding like the Greens, and the government was only in power because it won seats in Queensland based on its support for the coal sector and for its support for a new coal-fired power station in the state. This claim was rejected by some MPs. But Christensen’s view was also expressed by Matt Canavan, who addressed the party room after resigning his position from cabinet, telling colleagues the party had become the party for workers. “We have become the party of workers, workers in coalmines, workers in shipyards and workers in factories,” Canavan said. “We represent those people by fighting for their jobs, and defending their jobs.” Canavan is now calling for new coal-fired power stations to be built across the country. In an earlier meeting of just Liberal MPs, Queenslander Andrew Laming slapped down colleagues for publicly denying the science of climate change, saying it was akin to doubting “the science of the planes you fly on” coming to Canberra. He argued that while the party’s MPs should debate the policy response, it was an “impossible position” to be debating science that already underpinned the government’s emission reduction targets. The NSW senator Jim Molan was criticised for saying on ABC’s Q&amp;A program on Monday night that climate change may not be caused by humans and declaring he was “not relying on evidence” for his climate position. Conservative Craig Kelly also came under fire for telling the BBC there was no link between Australia’s bushfire crisis and climate change. Speaking after Tuesday’s meeting, Wilson argued that most MPs agreed with Morrison that the government needed to “evolve” its policies to create the jobs of the 21st century. “We are progressively going to be cutting emissions over the cycle, and that is where most MPs are, which is taking a pragmatic, sensible approach that takes the whole of the Australian community with us,” Wilson told the ABC. Addressing the party room, Morrison urged both the Nationals and Liberals to work together, saying the Coalition had a strong track record of delivering for Australians. “We come to this joint Coalition party room to do things together,” Morrison said. Morrison faces a difficult task to reposition the Coalition on climate change after assuring voters that it wanted to “evolve” its policies and do more to reduce emissions. In January the issue was also discussed in cabinet, where Morrison’s senior ministers agreed not to bolster the government’s current emissions reduction target of 26-28% of 2005 levels by 2030. Speaking in parliament on Tuesday on the government’s response to the summer bushfires, Morrison said there was a need to “heed the lessons” of a natural disaster of such magnitude. “These fires have been fuelled by one of the worst droughts on record, changing in our climate and a build-up in fuel amongst other factors,” he said. “Our summers are getting longer, drier and hotter, that’s what climate change does, and that requires a new responsiveness, resilience and a reinvigorated focus on adaptation.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2020/feb/18/government-to-take-technology-over-taxation-approach-to-climate-change","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2020-02-18T01:34:22Z","webTitle":"Government to take ‘technology over taxation’ approach to climate change","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/18/government-to-take-technology-over-taxation-approach-to-climate-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2020/feb/18/government-to-take-technology-over-taxation-approach-to-climate-change","fields":{"headline":"Government to take ‘technology over taxation’ approach to climate change","bodyText":"Scott Morrison has described a report he may adopt a technology investment target to avoid signing up to a commitment of zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 as speculation, but confirmed his government will take a “technology over taxation” approach to climate change. On Tuesday, Morrison told reporters in Melbourne the report in the Australian was “very speculative”, but said it was true that emissions reductions were achieved through technology, not “meetings”. The Australian suggested Morrison favoured a technology investment target as a way to help Australia resist an international push for a more explicit commitment to reduce emissions to net zero by mid-century at the next major UN climate summit in Glasgow in November. The government is expected to soon release what it calls a technology investment roadmap, but has said little about what it will entail. Several moderate Liberal MPs including Katie Allen and Trent Zimmerman have noted Australia effectively committed to net zero emissions by signing the 2015 Paris agreement. Under that deal, countries agreed to keep global heating above pre-industrial levels below 2C and to pursue policies to restrict it to 1.5C. Morrison has begun the political year torn between moderate Liberals attempting to build traction internally for the government to increase climate action and resistance from the Nationals, who want more government support for coal-fired power. Cabinet discussions have explored how to reposition the government’s climate policies, with a focus on technology, as the bushfire crisis caused a spike in concern about the environment and a hit to Morrison’s popularity. At a press conference on Tuesday, Morrison reiterated that Australia would not make commitments without “having thoroughly looked at what is the impact on jobs”. Asked if an investment target would create tension with those who want a net zero emissions commitment, Morrison said “currently no one can tell me that going down that path won’t cost jobs, won’t put up your electricity prices, and won’t impact negatively on jobs in the economies of rural and regional Australia”. A major report by CSIRO last year found there was no trade-off between strong economic growth and transitioning to zero emissions. The result of two years’ work by 50 leaders across the community, the CSIRO’s Australian National Outlook report found bold action to combat rising challenges could lead to GDP growth of 2.76% to 2.8% annually, a 90% increase in real wages and net zero emissions by 2050. On Tuesday, Morrison suggested investment in technology would enable steel plants to use hydrogen power and increase uptake of renewable energy. “The smart way in dealing with this to get emissions down … is to focus on the technology and making sure that that technology is affordable and it is scalable,” he said. “You want to get global emissions down? … You need technology that can be accessed and put in place, not just here in Australia, but all around the world. Meetings won’t achieve that, technology does. And I can tell you taxes won’t achieve it either.” The industry minister, Karen Andrews, told reporters at Flinders University she was focused on “what the solutions will be rather than endlessly discussing targets or whether or not climate change is real”. Andrews said it was “clear that we do have businesses … that are already investing”, citing BAE and the Innovative Manufacturing Cooperative Research Centre. Labor’s climate change spokesman, Mark Butler, said a technology target would be a throwback to 2007, when then prime minister John Howard and US president George W. Bush rejected emissions reduction targets agreed under the Kyoto Protocol in favour of a “technology approach” that including support for nuclear power and “clean coal”. “Of course technology is the key to lowering emissions, but industry has made it clear that the take-up of new technology requires a serious energy and climate policy,” Butler said. “This is something the Morrison government will never deliver as long as the hard-right climate deniers continue to run the show on climate policy.” The leader of the Greens, Adam Bandt, said: “Instead of a technology smokescreen, we need a Green New Deal to work with affected communities and workers to phase out coal, create new industries and look after the workers in those communities who are affected”. Erwin Jackson, policy director with the Investor Group on Climate Change, said acting on technology was important but not enough. He said all policy needed to be tied to an emissions goal. Net zero emissions was the most credible long-term scenario and had widespread backing, including within the business community. “Setting a path to net zero emissions is prudent economic risk management,” Jackson said. “The only question is if it’s going to happen in a smooth way or in a disruptive way.” Martijn Wilder, a partner at climate advisory and investment firm Pollination and chairman of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (Arena), said technology would play a critical role in reaching net zero emissions if backed by strong policies. “With the right mix of technologies and policies, Australia is easily capable of reaching net zero well before 2050 and in doing so building an incredibly strong decarbonised economy,” he said. Wilder said having strong public institutions, such as Arena and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, and policies similar to Britain’s promised ban on new petrol, diesel and hybrid cars by 2035 could “greatly accelerate the transition”. In addition to the technology investment roadmap, the government has commissioned a review of its climate policies led by the businessman Grant King, and promised an electric vehicle policy and a long-term emissions strategy. It has also made it known it is likely to give an $11m grant to the owners of the Vales Point coal-fired power plant in the May budget."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2023/mar/16/australia-news-live-aukus-defence-submarines-economy-interest-rates-weather-heatwave-health-housing-welfare-vic-qld-nsw","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-16T07:52:58Z","webTitle":"Myer to close flagship Brisbane store – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2023/mar/16/australia-news-live-aukus-defence-submarines-economy-interest-rates-weather-heatwave-health-housing-welfare-vic-qld-nsw","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2023/mar/16/australia-news-live-aukus-defence-submarines-economy-interest-rates-weather-heatwave-health-housing-welfare-vic-qld-nsw","fields":{"headline":"Myer to close flagship Brisbane store – as it happened","bodyText":"And that wraps our news for this evening. Here is what hit the headlines today: The Australian Council of Social Service called for an increase to jobseeker and the youth allowance payment, a disability and illness supplement of $110 a fortnight and a 50% boost to commonwealth rent assistance. The Queensland youth justice minister, Liane Linard, claimed it was not true that a 13-year-old boy was held for at least 45 days in solitary confinement. The federal court began hearing Bruce Lehrmann’s application to extend the time limit for lodging his defamation claim, which would allow him to sue Network Ten, News Corp and two journalists for reporting the rape allegations made by Brittany Higgins. Consumer lender Latitude Financial was hit by a “sophisticated and malicious cyber-attack” that has resulted in the theft of more than 100,000 identification documents and 225,000 customer records. The unemployment rate in Australia fell back to 3.5% from January’s 3.7% despite interest rate rises. Chinese embassy officials attended an Australian government briefing on the Aukus nuclear-powered submarine plans. And prime minister Anthony Albanese told reporters “the relationship with China is improving and that’s a good thing”, after former Labor prime minister Paul Keating criticised Labor’s Aukus involvement. Qantas has made a statement on extending its Covid credits, saying: Qantas and Jetstar are giving customers an extra 12 months to use their Covid credits, which are a carryover from the unprecedented upheaval to borders and travel during the pandemic. Credits have been extended three times since 2020 and this final extension to the travel date is designed to make it easier for customers to use their remaining credits for domestic or international travel. Before today, customers had to book and complete their travel by 31 December 2023. Following this change, they will still have to book by 31 December this year but have until December 2024 to complete their travel … The travel date extension makes the Qantas and Jetstar Covid credit program more flexible than our main domestic competitor and one of the most flexible among global carriers – some of which have already expired their Covid credits. Myer will shut its flagship department store in Brisbane’s Queen Street mall after more than three decades, AAP reports. The retail giant announced it would vacate its five-floor store that became the namesake of the Myer Centre. It has been the centrepiece of Myer’s holdings in Queensland since it first opened in 1988 as Australia’s second-largest department store. Myer chief executive John King says talks broke down with landlords: Whilst we remain committed to the Brisbane market, we have been unable to negotiate a reasonable commercial outcome with the landlord and as such will continue to look for an alternative CBD location. Sydney surfer goes for world record for charity At Cronulla beach in Sydney, Blake Johnston is attempting to withstand the longest surf session anybody has ever attempted, AAP reports. The current record is 30 hours – Johnston is aiming for 40. He plans to catch 500 waves by Friday evening. The 40-year-old former pro surfer could face blindness, infected ears, dehydration, sleep deprivation, hypothermia and drowning, but he says he is prepared for the challenge. Johnston hopes to raise $250,000 for youth mental health and suicide prevention. Nearly $200,000 has already been donated. Andrew Forrest’s gas import terminal still a plan despite operator downgrade Much has been made today about the warning from the Australian Energy Market Operator about possible gas shortages during extreme weather, particularly winter, in south-eastern Australia (as reported here). Most of the gas in eastern Australia is exported, some of it from Victoria despite its declining gasfields. In a slightly incongruous move given the apparent abundance of gas, there are plans to import the fuel, including at Andrew “Twiggy” Forrest’s proposed Port Kembla energy terminal. Well, the delay in the PKET, as it’s known, was one reason why shortages in gas supplies may emerge over the next couple of years. AEMO in its latest report said it “no longer considers PKET as an anticipated project”. That prompted Forrest’s Squadron Energy to respond. “Squadron Energy will deliver crucial gas in 2026 to ease the forecast shortfall,” said CEO Jason Willoughby. Port Kembla energy terminal will play a critical role in supplying the east coast energy market and it will be a strategic asset for Squadron Energy, providing firming capability as we develop our Australia-leading 20-gigawatt renewable project pipeline. We also asked Squadron if they were concerned their proposed LNG import facility might have to compete with a nuclear-powered submarine base one day. (Port Kembla, near Wollongong on the NSW south coast, is considered to be one of the preferred sites for a base.) Sadly, we didn’t get a response to that one. South Sydney coach criticises ‘fear-mongering’ on concussion South Sydney NRL coach Jason Demetriou has told his players not to buy into the “hysteria” surrounding concussion, AAP reports. As the NRL makes the biggest changes to its concussion policy in a decade, Demetriou applauds the NRL for safeguarding its players and sticking to the science. Now any player who suffers a head knock will be subject to an 11-day layoff. Current head injury assessment protocols will remain, where an independent doctor conducts mid-game testing for players experiencing symptoms. The new rule comes after Newcastle five-eighth Kalyn Ponga suffered a fourth concussion in 10 months. Demetriou said: There’s a lot of hysteria around concussion at the moment and a lot of it’s fear-mongering, to be honest. Players that play the game need to understand that it is a contact sport. There’s risk in contact sport and these players are looked after better now than they’ve ever been, and rightfully so. These problems that players have had from the old days, these guys that are playing now, they won’t have these problems because the game – as it should be – is looking after them. A lot of ex-players are getting involved and having an opinion on a lot of things that they don’t have the medical training to have advice on. The comments come a day after a class action lodged in the Victorian supreme court against the AFL chases up to $1bn compensation for alleged long-term concussion damage to AFL players. Ancient eagle named Australia’s largest-ever bird of prey More breaking animal news in: an eagle with talons large enough to grab a kangaroo has been confirmed as Australia’s largest-ever bird of prey, AAP reports. Fossil hunters from Flinders University have pieced together the eagle’s story, and named it Dynatoaetus gaffae. Fossil remains in South Australia’s Mairs Cave connected to bones previously found in Naracoorte Caves, Wellington Caves and near the Lake Eyre Basin. The eagle had a three-metre wingspan and 30cm talons, making it twice the size of a modern-day species. Closely related to the old-world vultures of Africa and Asia, it is now known to be the top avian predator in the late Pleistocene period. Palaeontology researcher Ellen Mather said: We were very excited to find many more bones from much of the skeleton to create a better picture and description of these magnificent, long-lost, giant extinct birds. It’s often been noted how few large land predators Australia had back then, so Dynatoaetus helps fill that gap. Blue-ringed octopus bites woman at Sydney beach A potentially deadly blue-ringed octopus has bitten a woman in her 30s in Sydney’s north shore, AAP reports. Paramedics were called to Chinamans Beach at 2.45pm today and the woman was taken to Royal North Shore hospital for treatment. The name “blue-ringed” comes from iridescent blue markings that glow on the octopus’ skin when threatened. They produce a toxin that causes paralysis and can be fatal. Although a bitten person will stay conscious, the octopus’ toxins paralyse muscles such as in the respiratory system – meaning some victims can die from a lack of oxygen. If a victim of a bite is given air manually, they will generally make a full recovery. At least two Australians have died from a blue-ringed octopus bite, according to the Australian Institute of Marine Science. The octopus is native to much of the Australian coastline, but only attacks when provoked. Lehrmann grilled over delay in launching defamation case Bruce Lehrmann has just been cross-examined by Sue Chrysanthou SC, representing Lisa Wilkinson, on the reasons he delayed bringing a defamation claim against her client, as well as Network Ten, News Corp and Samantha Maiden. Lehrmann is arguing he had delayed bringing the claim because of prior legal advice, which told him not to launch defamation proceedings, and due to the prospect of a criminal trial. Chrysanthou put it to Lehrmann that he had wanted to sue Wilkinson from the night her interview with Brittany Higgins aired on 15 February 2021 and had formed the view from 18 June 2021 that there would soon be a resolution to clear the criminal allegations against him. Lehrmann agreed. Chryanthou said: You were acutely aware ... that you were in a position to sue for defamation? Lehrmann responded: I reject that I was in a position to sue for defamation. The court also heard Lehrmann kept a “blue book”, in which he noted what he had seen in the media and planned his fightback against news outlets. He listed friendly journalists – including Andrew Clennell and Andrew Bolt, of Sky News – who may be willing to share his version of events, the court heard. Still on Jim Chalmers and the treasurer was asked to respond to former treasury secretary Dr Ken Henry’s assertion that Australia’s tax system needs an overhaul. The Howard government handed out a lot of treats in the form of tax concessions and tax breaks for people, particularly higher income earners, and trying to reform that system is like, well, taking candy from a baby – loud and uncomfortable. Henry told the Taxation Institute of Australia (as reported by the AFR) that “the interests of the most disadvantaged are not being served by a tax system that is punishing innovation, denying people opportunity, undermining economic growth and denying the sustainability of government service provision”. Moreover, there can be no ignoring the extraordinary intergenerational inequity inherent in our present tax system. And that meant, as Henry and other economists who have turned a serious mind to this have found, that the young are being burdened with having to pay a debt that hasn’t particularly benefited them, while being weighed down with their own debt, including for education – and unable to break into the housing market. It’s a recipe for disaster. So, will Chalmers look at reform anytime soon? Chalmers: I think for all of you that observed some of the frankly hyperventilating about what was a very modest change to superannuation tax concessions would understand, as they do, that tax reform is difficult in this country. So, in my view, make your priority known – in our case multinational taxes, we were working very closely with friends around the world on multinational tax. We have a proposal out there on superannuation tax concessions which allow for the concessions to still be allowable to everyone but slightly less generous for people who are in that top 0.5% of superannuation balances – some pretty modest change, a meaningful one when it comes to the structure of the budget. I think inevitably every budget, whether it is a Labor government or a budget handed down by the other side of politics, needs to contemplate some combination of three things: spending restraints, which we were able to show in October; trimming spending where that spending is not especially productive, where we are not getting value for money; and modest, meaningful tax reform in areas like super and multinational taxes. That is the approach we have taken. Ken is in favour and on the record multiple times over a long period of time for something more comprehensive. We’ve got a different set of priorities when it comes to that. So that’s a no then. Hello from Canberra on this warm afternoon – I hope everyone is staying hydrated! You may have seen Josh Butler’s report this morning on Jim Chalmers’ speech to Ceda. Chalmers was previewing the Productivity Commission’s five-yearly report, which is due to be released tomorrow – and the short version? Things are not great. You can read Josh’s take here: But without some major change, then we will be even further behind than we are, when it comes to boosting productivity. And that’s not the fault of workers, but the system. The report’s not yet out but Chalmers has been doing what they call in the business “managing expectations”. Which means laying out the bad news ahead of time. Australia can’t afford not to be in Aukus deal – PM On Aukus’ anticipated $10bn annual cost over three decades, Anthony Albanese says Australia cannot afford to “not do it”: The question here is, can we afford to not do it? And the answer to that is no. We need to give ourselves the best capability. It is like if you go for an inferior product, you don’t want buyer’s remorse. What you want to do is to make sure that we increase the capability of our defence force. Asked about whether the government will need to cut in spending, or raise taxes to afford Aukus, Albanese says recent changes to superannuation will go towards the budget. We understand that there are real fiscal pressures. One of those is defence, another is the NDIS, another is Medicare and health with the ageing of the population. Another is the increased interest payments … Governments are going to have to make difficult decisions. And we have shown with this that we are prepared to make a difficult decision. We have shown with the superannuation decision that we made that we are prepared to make a difficult decision. We are having the open conversation about the costs of this policy. But as I said, it is when you actually take a step back and look at this – under 10% of the defence budget, and it produces a quantum leap in the capacity of the defence force, and then I think that it is the right thing to do. It is an investment in our security. And nothing is more important than looking after our national security. That’s a precondition for a successful economy. Aukus deal will have ‘massive spinoff’ – PM More from the prime minister on 2GB – Albanese says Aukus “ticks all the boxes”. This is not just a defence policy. This is about Australian sovereignty and our manufacturing capacity. What this will do is have a massive spinoff because this is the most highly sophisticated machinery that you can think of – a nuclear powered submarine. So there will be not just 20,000 direct jobs created in Australia, there will be many more indirect jobs. And so it’s about our economy. It’s about our national sovereignty. It’s about defence. And it ticks all the boxes. ‘We have done the right thing’ – PM On 2GB Anthony Albanese assures that the Aukus engagement is “the right decision for Australia”. I take my responsibility very seriously indeed, to listen to Defence and national security experts to determine what is the best way to keep Australians safe. And the best way to keep Australians safe is to invest in improving our capability, but also invest in our relationships. This is a long-term investment with our traditional friends and allies, the United States and the United Kingdom, and it is the right thing to do. I’m very confident that we have done the right thing. PM says his government has turned international perceptions of Australia around Anthony Albanese moves away from Paul Keating’s criticism of Aukus by pointing to Australia’s improved international relationships since coming to office in 2022: In that year, what we have done is turn around the way that Australia is perceived in the international community. We are a trusted partner. We want to trade with our friends. We want to trade in the region. That is why I spent time in India as a guest to prime minister [Narendra] Modi … That is why I called in on Fiji and spoke to the newly elected prime minister there just yesterday … That is why I’ve engaged … in the Indo-Pacific. Australia is back in the international community around the table. Of course, the entry fee for credibility is action on climate change. And that is why my government’s position on climate change has been so important in transforming the relationship we have with Indo-Pacific neighbours. ‘This debate about sovereignty is absurd’: Albanese Anthony Albanese tells reporters in Aston concerns around Australia’s sovereignty as he joins the US and Britain in Aukus nuclear submarine agreements is “absurd”: Australian sovereignty is a short full stop, exclamation mark. That is what happens. This debate about sovereignty is absurd. … We will determine our sovereignty with all our assets. And that is very clear. Albanese says he respects views of former parliamentarians, but assures there has been no disagreement around Aukus in his team: There is no disagreement amongst anyone who has received any of the national security briefings in my team … This overwhelmingly has received support when the announcement was made originally about Aukus. The prime minister tells reporters “the relationship with China is improving and that’s a good thing”: We are about building investing in our capacity, but we are also about investing in our relationships. I had a very successful meeting with President Xi [Jinping]. Our foreign minister visited China at the end of last year to commemorate the 50th anniversary of relations between Australia and the People’s Republic of China. I look forward to engaging China. We will cooperate where we can, we will disagree where we must, and we will engage in our national interest. Australia has had a turbulent relationship in the past few years with China, its largest trading partner. At the height of diplomatic tensions between China and Australia in 2020, Beijing blocked phone calls and meetings between Australian government ministers and their direct counterparts in the wake of the Morrison government’s early push for a Covid origins inquiry. The Morrison government accused Beijing of engaging in “economic coercion” by rolling out tariffs or unofficial bans on a range of Australian exports, including wine, barley, red meat, lobsters and coal. The Albanese government maintains that it has not given ground on Australia’s national interests or policy positions, but it has pursued a deliberate effort to engage in dialogue to try to get the relationship on a better footing. For more context on the relationship between Australia and China, read my colleague Daniel Hurst: ‘I have no intention of engaging in a public argument with Paul Keating’: PM The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has joined a press conference with Mary Doyle, the Labor candidate for Aston, an electorate in Victoria with a big Chinese community. Albanese answers a question about the former Labor prime minister Paul Keating’s criticism of Labor’s Aukus involvement by saying he has “no intention of engaging in a public argument” with Keating. Paul Keating is a big guy. He is entitled to his opinion. I think on those issues he is wrong; I’m acting in the national interests. I’m acting in the national interest by investing in Australia’s capability, but I’m also investing in our relationships … He has my respect and I have no intention of engaging in a public argument with Paul Keating … We praise our heroes for the contributions that they’ve made, but my responsibility in 2023 is to give Australia the leadership that they need now, not what they might have needed in the 1990s. Protests should not ‘inconvenience people’, Perrottet says after climate protester’s jail term overturned The NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, says there is no place for disruptive climate change protests after climate protester Violet Coco’s imprisonment was appealed yesterday. Perrottet said he wasn’t aware of the court’s decision until questioned today, AAP reports. He told reporters: I’ll make this point – there’s no place in our state for that type of behaviour. If you want to protest in NSW, you’re free to protest. But when you protest, you do not inconvenience people across NSW. That’s exactly what occurred in that situation. A 15-month jail sentence was imposed on Coco for blocking a lane on the Sydney Harbour Bridge with a truck amid morning traffic in April last year. Yesterday she was placed on a 12-month good-behaviour bond after a district court judge Mark Williams overturned the jail term. Williams noted that she had been initially imprisoned on false information provided by the NSW police. Coco was one of the first people charged after the NSW parliament introduced greater penalties and reach of laws targeting those who block traffic on major routes. Thanks to Natasha May for feeding the blog through the day! I’ll be taking it into the evening. Chalmers says 3.5% unemployment rate a ‘pleasing result’ The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, has also responded to the jobs figures released today saying the fact more Australians are in work and the unemployment rate is around historic lows is a “pleasing result”. Since the Albanese government came to office, 278,000 jobs have been created. We’ve got a lot coming at us but we’ve got a lot going for us, including unemployment at 3.5%. A slowing global economy and higher interest rates will inevitably impact our own economy and labour market. We expect employment growth to moderate over coming months on the trajectory we outlined in the budget. Lehrmann tells court text about potential to receive ‘millions’ in defamation claim was a fabrication Bruce Lehrmann is being cross-examined about the vast delay in bringing his defamation claim against News Corp, Network Ten, and two journalists over their coverage of Brittany Higgins’ allegations. Lehrmann has said that his legal advice immediately after the publications was that he should not pursue defamation action, and instead wait for the resolution of any criminal trial. He blames the delay, partly, on that legal advice and wants the usual 12-month time limit on defamation claims extended. But text messages show that on the day of the initial publications, 15 February 2021, while Lehrmann was in the office of his then lawyer Warwick Korn, he was texting his then girlfriend about the potential to receive “millions” in a defamation claim. He said in the text: If I’m named tonight, he says I’m up for millions as defamation. Lehrmann today said that text had been a fabrication. He said Korn had never told him that. He said he was fabricating the conversation with Korn to placate his girlfriend. Lehrmann has also blamed the delay in bringing a defamation claim on the prospect of criminal proceedings. But the court has heard that Lehrmann, also on 15 February 2021, texted his then girlfriend suggesting he had been advised the matter would never get before a criminal court. Lehrmann said on Thursday that that text was also a fabrication. Lehrmann denied that Korn had given him any such advice. Dr Matt Collins KC, representing Network Ten, responded: Your evidence is that you fabricated a conversation with Mr Korn for the purpose of conveying it to [your then girlfriend]? Lehrmann agreed he had fabricated the conversation. Rome was burning and I was trying to put on a brave face. Collins asked: So you made up a conversation with a lawyer? Lehrmann said: Yes. The court also heard he had called a friend from lobbyist firm Barton Deakin on the same day, seeking a reference for a lawyer. That call took place after he had already organised to meet Korn, a criminal lawyer. Lehrmann denied that he was asking his friend for a referral for a defamation lawyer. He said he was seeking a recommendation for a second criminal lawyer. But the court heard the friend later sent him a text saying that she bet the lawyer she had recommended was grateful. Lehrmann responded: You have no idea. Lehrmann told the court there was no second lawyer. Collins said: You fabricated conversations with a non-existent lawyer? Lehrmann said: Yes Lehrmann denied raping Higgins in the office of their then boss, Linda Reynolds, and pleaded not guilty. His first trial was aborted due to juror misconduct and a retrial was discontinued due to fears for Higgins’ mental health. The temperature is rising in Sydney, with the CBD hitting over 35C as of 2.40pm, and even higher in western Sydney where Penrith has hit 37C. According to the bureau of meteorology the hot air is being dragged over eastern Australia from heat building inland. The hot, dry and windy conditions are also bringing elevated fire danger, especially in Western NSW. Chalmers says ‘expanded research agenda’ can produce productivity commission suited to the times As Chalmers flagged in his essay in the Monthly (which Dutton continues to lampoon for its length as recently as his press conference today), the treasurer wants to see the productivity commission itself improved and made more relevant for contemporary challenges. Chalmers says an expanded research agenda should be essential in this reform: To elevate the economic reform discussion, we need to ensure we’ve got a productivity commission suited to the times. This could mean a more strategic focus on how we maximise opportunities in areas of economic transformation, including the shift to net zero. It could mean building a better understanding of how we measure productivity and the magnitude of the challenge. What it must mean, is the evolution of a more meaningful, expanded research agenda and a stronger reform blueprint. This is something I’m giving further thought to, and will have more to say about, later in the year. We all want to turn headwinds into tailwinds. We all want better living standards. We all recognise the central role of productivity growth in that effort. How we go about it is contested, as it should be when so much is at stake. That’s why so much of our government’s time and effort has been spent building a serious reform agenda here – one that can pair better productivity with a full employment economy that offers more opportunities, to more people, in more parts of the country. Chalmers ends on the note that improving productivity is not only the government’s task but a collective one which involves business, investors, all levels of government, workers and their unions, “pulling together in meaningful ways on multiple fronts to move further and faster towards our destination and collective mission”: Improved living standards for our people, decent incomes – and a better, more secure and productive future, built together. Government implementing two thirds of productivity commission’s reform directives Chalmers says “Obviously, no government is expected to pick up and run with every recommendation of the productivity commission,” calling out the previous Coalition government for implementing “precisely zero” recommendations from the last five yearly review. He says the Albanese government is working on more than two-thirds of the 29 reform directives outlined in the report and is “methodically” considering the specific recommendations. Thirty-six lie at least in part with the states – and I’ll be discussing these with my counterparts at our next meeting in June. We already have a really comprehensive reform agenda to grow our economy and lift living standards by investing the right way in productivity growth. (Chalmers gives a whole lot of examples but I will spare you the entire list.) Chalmers highlights there are more ways than one to satisfy the objectives in the productivity report. We don’t believe productivity gains come from scorched earth industrial relations, for example, or from abolishing clean energy programs. Instead, we’ll get productivity gains from investing in our people and their abilities, from fixing our energy markets, from making it easier to adapt and adopt technology so it works for us, not against us – and by creating the stability and certainty necessary for capital to flow towards areas where we have advantages and opportunities to underpin a more modern industrial base. We want to maximise opportunities in energy, not just minimise costs. We want more cooperative workplaces, not more insecurity and conflict. But I hope these points of difference don’t dominate the coverage, especially when there is so much common ground to be recognised and progress to be made. Ageing population and move to net zero will require investing in workforce: Chalmers Chalmers expands on these challenges and how the workforce needs to adapt in order to overcome them: In the [productivity commission’s] view, the non-market services sector, including the care economy – which has averaged zero productivity growth since 2000 – will naturally expand and drag on productivity as our population ages. That transition will be happening in the context of another – a move towards net zero that will require billions of investment by 2050. This will help us avoid some of the worst impacts of climate change and help create new sources of growth that will lift our productivity performance over time. These transformations will require investments in a highly skilled workforce. For that, we’ll require better education and training systems that can supply the skills and labour we need, and which can enable the digital revolution to happen in a way that enhances rather than just replaces work – helping to diffuse ideas and digital technology across more of our economy. The productivity commission report proposes five ways to respond, Chalmers says: One, building an adaptable workforce to supply the skilled workers for Australia’s future economy. Two, harnessing data, digital technology and diffusion to capture the dividend of new ideas. Three, creating a more dynamic economy through fostering competition, efficiency and contestability in markets. Four, lifting productivity in the non-market sector to deliver high quality services at the lowest cost. And five, securing net zero at least cost to limit the productivity impact caused by climate change. Chalmers optimistic economic headwinds can be turned into tailwinds The report I’m releasing tomorrow refers often to the headwinds in our economy that contribute to this – and it’s true that much of what we confront can be problematic if mismanaged or ignored. But in a spirit of optimism, I want to suggest to you today that we can turn the headwinds identified by the [Productivity Commission] into tailwinds. Chalmers says the report identifies five key trends and transitions: One, the large and growing services sector. Two, the costs of climate change. Three, the need for a more skilled and adaptable workforce. Four, our use of data and digital technology. And five, economic dynamism in a changed world of geopolitical tension and uncertainty which is putting up barriers. Chalmers acknowledges: These are hard areas for a reason. All are complex, and none will respond to quick-fix, easy win, whack-a-mole policymaking. Chalmers says he wants to share what he think are “five pretty stunning facts” from the Productivity Commission report to put in context the challenges the Australian economy is facing: “First, our productivity growth in the past decade has been the slowest in 60 years, averaging just 1.1% a year – worse than the decade before and barely half the rate achieved during the 1990s. “Second, between 1970 and 2020, Australia slipped 10 places in productivity rankings, falling from 6th to 16th in the OECD. “Third, this means our productivity is now 22% lower than the US. “Fourth, if we’d kept up with the 60-year average for productivity growth, national income would have been about $4,600 higher in 2020. “And fifth, if we stay stuck on the current course, the Productivity Commission projects future incomes will be 40% lower and the working week 5% longer.” Chalmers says the figures are “useful illustrations of the productivity challenge – but they are not forecasts, or pre-determined outcomes”. But it’s clear and it matters, that on every traditional measure of productivity Australia has been flatlining. Australia has a productivity problem. Treasurer gives address on productivity performance review The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, is giving a major economic address at the meeting of the Committee for Economic Development of Australia (Ceda) in Brisbane. Chalmers welcomes the guests in the audience, including “somebody who is more important to me than the prime minister, the chairman of the Broncos, Karl Morris”, who is sitting in the front row. There are a number of reasons why now is an absolutely perfect time to share some thoughts and perspectives about the national economy. One of those reasons is that tomorrow, I will be releasing the Productivity Commission five yearly review of Australia’s productivity performance. Today I wanted to tell you what to expect with that important report, how the Albanese government is grappling with its major themes and directions, what we are interested in progressing and where we think we already have a better way forward when it comes to satisfying some of these important economic objectives. I wanted to warn you when you see tomorrow this report it’s almost a thousand pages long, there are nine volumes and 71 recommendations. I received last month, I have been getting my head around it and briefing my ministerial colleagues on it since then. I’m not obligated to release until after budget … but I’m putting it out there a couple of months early because I want you to be able to work your way through it as well, to engage with it and make your own mind up about its key conclusions. Former New South Wales premier Gladys Berejiklian has lent her assistance to a political ally’s re-election bid days after skipping out on the Liberals’ state election campaign launch, AAP reports. The senior Optus executive was photographed outside a Penrith Chinese restaurant after having dinner with Stuart Ayres and his wife, Senator Marise Payne, on Wednesday night. Ayres, a former cabinet minister, faces a battle to retain the lower house seat of Penrith, which he holds on a margin of 0.6%. It comes days after Berejiklian was a notable absentee from the Liberals’ campaign launch on Sunday. But the premier, Dominic Perrottet, denied he was snubbed. He said today: Not at all, it’s great to have Glad as part of the campaign. She was a great premier of NSW and to see her campaigning in Penrith, I know will make a real difference. The premier joked that if she headed to his seat of Epping “that would say something”, and hoped to see more of her in marginal seats the coalition must hold to retain minority government. He said: She’s obviously very busy but … Glad knows the Liberals and Nationals have the long-term economic plan. While enjoying soaring popularity through the initial months of the pandemic, Berejiklian’s final year in power was overshadowed by an anti-corruption inquiry that exposed her romantic relationship with another Liberal MP, Daryl Maguire. She denied any wrongdoing and the Independent Commission Against Corruption’s report is not expected until after the election. The endangered long-footed potoroo is bouncing back since the black summer Bushfires, the Victorian environment department says: The endangered long-footed potoroo has been detected at around 80% of the sites they were found pre-fires. Chinese embassy officials have attended an Australian government briefing about the Aukus nuclear-powered submarine plans. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Dfat) has conducted multiple briefing sessions over the past 24 hours for representatives of dozens of countries, including from within south-east Asia and the Pacific. Guardian Australia has learned that Chinese officials attended one of these briefings yesterday. One source described the attenders as mid-level representatives; another confirmed that the Chinese ambassador, Xiao Qian, was not in attendance. The participation in the briefing is a point of interest given the strength of the Chinese government’s reaction to the Aukus plans as soon as they were unveiled by Australia, the US and the UK early on Tuesday morning. China has demanded that the International Atomic Energy Agency not negotiate an arrangement with the three Aukus countries, and has sought to present the deal as a threat to the region and a threat to the nuclear non-proliferation regime. The Dfat briefings were intended to reassure countries across the region that Australia was seeking to contribute to peace and stability, was not seeking nuclear weapons, and was committed to the highest standards of non-proliferation. Wong tells Keating to look at UN evidence of China’s treatment of Uyghurs The foreign minister, Penny Wong, has responded to former prime minister Paul Keating’s comments on China’s treatment of the Uyghur community. In a National Press Club address yesterday, as my colleague Paul Karp reported, Keating brushed aside human rights concerns about China by arguing there are “disputes about what the nature of the Chinese affront to the Uyghurs” is, in reference to documented abuses that the UN has said are likely to be “crimes against humanity”. Wong today said: [Keating] may have his views but the government has … we have raised our concerns about the treatment of Uyghurs, with the PRC, with China, at all levels. I would say to Mr Keating to consider the evidence that was presented to the UN through the UN report on this matter but I do want to say something to the Australian Uyghur community. I understand this would have been distressing and I recognise the trauma many of them have suffered. Burke accuses Coalition of ‘hysteria’ over unemployment Employment minister Tony Burke says liberal senator Michaelia Cash and the shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor, contributed to “hysteria” around unemployment figures. I put all of this against some of the hysteria that both my counterpart, Senator Cash, and the Shadow Treasurer, Angus Taylor, put out a month ago in terms of what the test of the previous figures were. A month ago we were told by Senator Cash the reason the unemployment figures had gone up was because of the new industrial relations legislation. That being the case, I don’t know how she explains they have now gone down now the legislation has been in for longer and that we also have the improvements with underemployment, the improvements in terms of the total number of hours worked. The unemployment rate has improved in every state and territory, with the exception of Queensland. But you might remember a month ago, the Queensland figure was actually really strong and so what has come back a bit there is more of a correction as to what happened in the previous month. Tony Burke says drop in unemployment due to summer holiday breaks As unemployment dropped from 3.7% to 3.5%, the employment minister, Tony Burke, says the numbers reflect Australians who decided to “take a well earned break over January”. “As a result we saw an uptick in the unemployment figures over January, and that’s now returned back to 3.5%,” he said. Burke says the numbers will moderate over time: Full-time employment is up. The total hours worked is up. The participation rate is up. Of all of that, the unemployment rate is down, and the underemployment rate is down. Even as there is some moderation, there’s still a situation where we’re talking about a very good labour market where people who want to find jobs should be able to find them. The pathway to better wages will be through the legislation in the system that the government has been putting into place. The unemployment is not irrelevant to what happens with wages but on its own a low unemployment figure doesn’t do the job. Burke says he is not worried about a wage price spiral. A wage price spiral is driven by high wages growth. Australia does not have high wages growth. That’s how I know it’s not driving inflation. Shares in Australia’s big banks fell in early trading on Thursday as concerns over the future of embattled European financial giant Credit Suisse spread through global markets. The international banking sector was roiled by the collapse of California-headquartered Silicon Valley Bank last week, which suffered a bank run after revealing a hole in its finances caused by rapidly rising interest rates. That news was followed up by a major selldown of Credit Suisse overnight amid concerns Europe’s 17th largest lender would not be able to recover from a string of scandals that has scared off customers. Shares in Australia’s big banks were down about 2% in early trading on Thursday, erasing yesterday’s gains and leading the overall market lower. Their share prices are down sharply from the strong levels recorded mid-last month amid the then optimistic mood in the sector. But Australian bank share prices have fared much better than most of their European and US counterparts, which are weighed down by market concerns that they could be harbouring losses in their investment portfolios caused by rate hikes. Whistleblower submission to Queensland youth crime bill ruled ‘out of order’ A whistleblower’s submission to Queensland’s controversial youth crime bill has been “ruled out of order” and not allowed to be tabled in state parliament. Greens MP for Maiwar, Michael Berkman, tabled the submission of watch house officer Steven Marshall on Wednesday night after it was removed from the parliament website. Marshall’s submission to the economics and governance committee outlined “human rights breaches” he claims he witnessed in Brisbane City watch house during 2018 and 2019. These included “illegal strip-searches”, adults exposing themselves to children and staff wrapping towels around prisoners’ heads to avoid spit hood protocols. Berkman said he tabled the submission, so it was “at least on the record” during the heated debate. But on Thursday morning, the speaker of the house, Curtis Pitt, ruled the submission “out of order”, saying he understood the committee “has resolved to make that particular submission confidential”. He said allowing the submission to be tabled would “subvert and undermine the decision of the committee and its proceedings” and so he deemed the document “not tabled”. Queensland police confirmed on Tuesday they were reviewing claims outlined in the submission, noting it was published by the committee “very briefly and then withdrawn”. It comes as the state parliament is debating the youth crime bill this week, which includes making breach of bail an offence for children and expanding an electronic monitoring trial for children as young as 15. Berkman was also referred to the ethics committee on Thursday morning for not withdrawing his interjections when the health minister Yvette D’Ath rose to speak on the youth justice laws. Pitt said Berkman had refused “to comply with the deputy speaker’s request” and was “disorderly”, resulting in his ejection from the chamber. All members have a right to express their views … however, members must do so in accordance with the standing rules and limits. Bruce Lehrmann tells court he was ‘not in a good way’ after publication of stories Bruce Lehrmann has told a court he had continually wanted to fight back against the media as more and more stories appeared in the media. He says that he had been “not in a good way, to put it lightly” following the initial stories on 15 February 2021. He checked himself into North Shore hospital and was put on 15-minute observations, the court heard. He then went to another health facility for 12 days and then did not return to his house, because he had heard that the media were camping outside his house. There was strong advice from my lawyers and the treating doctors that I retreat back to Queensland to live with my mum. He says that the stories kept appearing in the media. Every time an article would come out, or a Four Corners report or whatever, there was outrage, and it was apparent on social media that people knew it was me and it was a mixture of being upset, angry, and I wanted to fight back against the media. Lehrmann says his then lawyers continued to tell him to wait until the criminal proceedings or investigation was concluded, prior to lodging a defamation claim. He is attempting to convince the federal court to extend the usual 12-month limit on filing defamation claims. One of his reasons for delay is that he received advice to wait from his then lawyer, Warwick Korn. Lehrmann denied raping Higgins in the office of their then boss, Linda Reynolds, and pleaded not guilty. His first trial was aborted due to juror misconduct and a retrial was discontinued due to fears for Higgins’ mental health. Population growth will boost demand in economy – and supply of workers As we saw earlier, February’s jobless rate dropped back to 3.5%, or just above the 3.4% recorded in October. The numbers are close to the lowest in half a century even as the RBA does its best to sap excessive demand from the economy. The ABS has also released some population numbers showing “we” expanded 1.6% in the year to 30 September. Australians now number 26.1 million people. Beidar Cho, head of ABS Demography, said the population swelled by 418,500 over the year, with the pace similar to pre-pandemic times. The natural increase was 114,800, a decrease of 18.1% from the previous year, with 302,900 births and 188,000 deaths in the year to September’s end. Deaths increased 10.8% “mainly due to Covid-19” and births sank 2.3%. Cho said: Migrant arrivals have returned to similar levels to those prior to the pandemic but departures remain lower – mainly because there are fewer recently arrived temporary migrants, like international students, who are due to leave. There were 536,900 overseas migration arrivals and 233,200 departures. Bruce Lehrmann is giving evidence in open court for the first time. The federal court on Thursday began hearing Lehrmann’s application to extend the time limit for lodging his defamation claim, which would allow him to sue Network Ten, News Corp, and journalists Lisa Wilkinson and Samantha Maiden for reporting the rape allegations made by Brittany Higgins. Lehrmann began his defamation claim two years after the Higgins stories were first published in February 2021 and must convince the court that he was not unreasonable in not meeting the usual 12-month time limit. He has been called to give evidence about what his lawyers told him in February 2021, which he says caused him to delay filing any defamation claim. His barrister, Steven Whybrow SC, asked him whether he believed the initial articles referred to him, despite not naming him. Lehrmann said he did: It identified the office that the person worked in, elements like the Dock, things like that, however the element of the alleged sexual assault was not me. He got legal advice about the publications after speaking with a friend, who recommended the lawyer Warwick Korn. He went to meet Korn in Sydney on 15 February, after the News Corp article, but before The Project’s story went to air on Network Ten. Lehrmann said he did not meet Korn specifically to discuss defamation. That was not the purpose I engaged Mr Korn for. It was for obvious criminal proceedings or an investigation, it was obvious and apparent that that was about to be undertaken. But he said he did raise defamation proceedings. I was outraged from what I was seeing. He said Korn told him to wait prior to lodging any defamation proceedings. That advice was that defamation proceedings could happen, but we needed to wait for the resolution of any criminal proceedings or any investigation. Lehrmann denied raping Higgins in the office of their then boss, Linda Reynolds, and pleaded not guilty. His first trial was aborted due to juror misconduct and a retrial was discontinued due to fears for Higgins’ mental health. Dutton says changes in regional circumstances necessitate Aukus spending Asked about whether the middle of a cost-of-living crisis is the right time to spend up to $368bn on submarines, Dutton says: I think Australians understand that the circumstances in our region have changed dramatically. I think every Australian except Paul Keating gets that, and you just can’t be blind to the intelligence, to what it’s saying, and not act on it. I think that would be negligent. And we entered into negotiations for Aukus knowing that the circumstances had changed, and we want to see peace prevail in our region. We want stability. We want our very important trading partners to continue to have that relationship with us. We don’t want to see bullying in our region, we don’t want to see coercive activity, we don’t want to see our citizens the subject of data breaches, etc. So there is a lot that is in Aukus, not just the submarine deal, but it is also the investment in space, in AI and many other elements of that deterrence, which will be very important in the years to come. As I say, the negotiations that we had at the time were difficult, and it started in 2020, and ultimately it has come to fruition now. So as a coalition, I am very proud of the fact that we authored that, we did the deal. Dutton: ‘Labor never ordered a single submarine’ or ship from Australian manufacturers in the past While the Coalition have been strong on their bipartisan support for the Aukus deal, Dutton goes on to criticise Labor’s record on defence, saying the Coalition government at the time had to overcome “Labor’s valley of death in the shipbuilding industry” in order to get the deal off the ground. Now I’m incredibly proud of what we’ve been able to deliver under Aukus. It is a huge win for South Australia and for our country. Most importantly, it underpins the security of our country and interest of our neighbours within the Indo-Pacific for generations to come, and that is a very significant outcome. Simon Birmingham as finance minister was one of those crucial in the negotiations, and obviously in the contemplation of how much money this would cost. I remember many discussions over many years around the national security committee and the expenditure review committee where we had to work out what we would do with Labor’s valley of death in the shipbuilding industry here in South Australia, as well as in WA. Labor never ordered a single submarine, not a single ship from an Australian manufacturer when they were in government, and they cut defence spending when they were in government down to 1.5, 1.6% of GDP, so that meant there was no jobs, no opportunities for people in South Australia. We came into government, we restored funding. Dutton attributes electricity bill hikes to Labor decisions While Albanese was talking with 3AW, the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, was speaking in Adelaide about the hike in electricity prices which was announced yesterday: They will be 14,000 small businesses in South Australia who, from the 1st of July, are going to see yet another increase in their electricity bill. And it will be about 63,000 households here in South Australia who, from the 1st of July, will pay on average about an extra $400, and I just don’t know where people are going to continue to find this money from. Because it’s not just their electricity and their gas bills that continue to go up under Labor. We know that inflation is at a 33-year high and that many of the government decisions that they’ve made have actually fuelled inflation, and inflation going higher, of course, means your interest rates are higher and your mortgage rates are higher. Hours worked rose last month as sickness, disaster woes receded, ABS says As per the previous post on jobs, Australia’s economy has looked quite resilient this last month if those latest numbers are any guide. Bjorn Jarvis, ABS head of labour statistics, said: The February increase in employment follows consecutive falls in December and January. In January, this reflected a larger than usual number of people waiting to start a new job, the majority of whom returned to or commenced their jobs in February. This was particularly evident in the south-east of Australia, with larger than seasonal numbers of people entering into employment across New South Wales, Victoria and the ACT. NSW kept its lead as the state with the lowest unemployment rate in the nation at 3.2% (if you exclude the ACT’s 2.9%). (Cue a media release from the Perrottet government, ahead of the 25 March election.) Other signs of the labour market’s strength include a 3.9% rise in the amount of hours worked in February (seasonally adjusted). Jarvis said: Following the 2.1% fall in January, when more Australians than usual took annual leave, the hours worked in February bounced back strongly to a level similar to late 2022, and were 5.1% higher than February 2022. In February, there were also no major disruptions that affected people’s ability to work their normal hours, such as the widespread sickness or natural disasters that we have seen over recent years. Normal times, can they really be back? ‘It’s not either-or’, says PM on questions of Medicare funding versus Aukus On the cost of the Aukus deal, Mitchell also asked Albanese about those comments from Dan Andrews (which Adeshola brought you earlier on the blog) that if the government can afford the submarines they should be ale to fix medicare. Albanese says “it’s not either-or”: I have a responsibility to – as prime minister – put in place defence procurement of assets so that our capability is the best it can possibly be. If people want to discuss about Medicare or other issues, I’m happy to discuss them on their merits. Medicare, of course, is a Labor creation. Labor will always strengthen Medicare and we’re doing a range of measures including cooperation with Premier Andrews. As you know, I have a very good relationship [with him] and we’ll continue to do that. Albanese ‘absolutely convinced’ nuclear subs better than conventional sub options On why it was necessary to purchase nuclear subs, rather than conventional subs, which are cheaper and faster to build, Albanese says: The advice is – and I fully accept the advice from our defence experts – that nuclear subs [are] quieter, are less detectable. They’re faster, they’re able to stay away from port longer. They’re essentially just much, much better. And we should acquire assets which best defend our nation. I’m absolutely convinced – and this is a bipartisan position – that nuclear subs are far better than conventional submarine options, which, yes, they are cheaper, but if you have an inferior product that’s cheaper, that’s not necessarily the best way to go. Albanese denies that the nuclear subs are designed to get into the Taiwanese straits, saying that the current Collins class fleet could do so. ‘We could have … not put figures out there’: Albanese claims price of Aukus deal released for transparency On the eye-watering price of submarines, Albanese says the figures were released for transparency when the government didn’t necessarily have to, when they are projected so many decades into the future. Mitchell: We’re talking about the possibility of $360bn. Did we negotiate that or was it just sort of take it or leave it? Albanese: These have all been negotiated through. Mitchell (chuckling): We talked them down a bit did we? Albanese: If you put it in perspective, now – what we could have done is to not put figures out there because we’re talking about decades in advance. And that’s why the figure that has been put out there for transparency … PM dismisses suggestions Australia ignored second French subs offer Albanese denies that the French came back to Australia with another offer on submarines which Australia ignored, as Keating suggested. That is not right. I have respectful relations, including with France. And we had discussions with France. I’ve had discussions directly with President Macron, our foreign minister and defence minister have had a two-by-two meeting with their respective counterparts. We have respectful relationship with France. We’ve determined to go with the Aukus arrangements. We liaised respectfully with a range of nations and informed them in an appropriate manner. And none of the announcements that we made just a couple of days ago would have come as any surprise to the nations that we have good relations with them. One of those happens to be France. Australia ‘should cooperate where we can but disagree where we must’ with China, PM says Circling back to Anthony Albanese’s interview with 3AW radio in Melbourne – Mitchell asks the PM if he believes Keating is right to say China is not a threat to Australia. China has changed its posture and positon in world affairs since the 1990s when Paul Keating was acting a parliamentarian and as a leader. That’s the truth of the matter. I sat in Parliament when Xi Jinping was welcomed to the parliament. That was by the then liberal governments that was something that was a different time. Mitchell: So he is wrong? … Is China a threat to Australia? Albanese: Our position on China is that we should cooperate where we can but disagree where we must, and we disagree with China with its attitude towards human rights. We disagree with some of its actions in the South China Sea. We disagree with its much more forward-leaning position in our region, and we will stand up for Australian values and we will stand up for our national interest. We don’t seek conflict with any nation. And I have not engaged in any rhetoric aimed at increasing tension. I want good relations, but I want good relations based upon our values and I won’t shy away from that. And the truth is that Australia and China [have] very different political systems and have very different values. And it is China that has seen the fastest and most significant growth in military expenditure in the postwar period of any nation. And that is just a fact. Bumper jobs numbers for February may keep RBA on rate rise track Labour market figures that have just landed from the ABS show the economy added a net 64,600 jobs last month, and the jobless rate sank back to 3.5%. Economists, as we mentioned, had tipped 50,000 extra jobs and an unemployment rate of 3.6%. Within the numbers, though, is the jump of almost 75,000 full-time positions (and a drop of about 10,000 part-time ones). Also there were slightly more people in the market for work, with the seasonally adjusted participation rate up by 0.1 percentage points to 66.6%. The dollar has ticked up a bit against the US variety, pointing to a slight shift (so far) in the expectation the RBA will go again next month. Let’s see. Australia’s jobless rate in February was 3.5%, seasonally adjusted. Those figures for February are down from 3.7%. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, says if the Albanese government can afford to spend almost $400bn on the Aukus submarine deal, it can “fix Medicare”, as a spat over the GST carve-up intensifies. Andrews has this week pushed back against Western Australia’s share of GST, saying Victorians will not be forced to pay for “sweetheart deals” between the state and the commonwealth. Under a 2018 deal struck by then treasurer Scott Morrison, Western Australia will get $5.6bn more than it would have otherwise received next financial year under GST distributions. Speaking to reporters, Andrews said the GST carve-up should be based on “fairness”: If we can afford to spend $400bn on submarines, we can afford to fix Medicare. We can afford to make sure that states and territories are supported. The 2018 deal was struck in anticipation of falling iron ore prices that would shrink WA’s economy. Instead, iron ore prices soared. Jobs numbers to give RBA more insight on the strength of the economy Shortly we’ll get the February labour market numbers from the ABS. Economists are expecting the economy to have added a net 50,000 jobs last month, with the jobless rate coming in at 3.6%. These figures can jump around a bit. January’s reported jobless rate was 3.7%, seasonally adjusted, up from 3.5% in December. However, the ABS noted that the jump in the unemployment rate masked a larger-than-usual rise in the number of unemployed people who had a job to go to in the future. The jobs numbers will be examined closely by the Reserve Bank to determine whether it needs to lift its key interest rate again at its next gathering on 4 April. Such a move would mark 11 rate hikes in a row. Anyway, stay tuned. Albanese rules out introducing taxes or levies specifically to fund Aukus Mitchell asks if Albanese can guarantee that no taxes or levies will be introduced to pay for Aukus: Look, what we can guarantee, of course, is that this stands in its own right. We will have a range of policies put out there that aren’t connected with this. I’ve seen some comments, for example, about the NDIS says to be cut for this. That’s not what this is about. What we have done here is, on its own merits, come up with the best way to defend our nation and put out there in a transparent way what the costs will be. We have at the same time had a defence strategic review by Angus Houston and that will be released next month. And what that will do as well is look at: what are the assets we need? Where do we need them? What’s the timeframe for it? And people will see some of those measures in the budget that will be handed down in May. … I can guarantee that this stands on its own merit. We don’t have a hypothecated* system so if you’re asking me about hypothecated revenues to pay for this, the answer to that is no. We’ll continue to do what we need to do to defend Australia. *A hypothecated tax system is one where revenue from specific taxes is dedicated to particular purposes, as opposed to our system where all tax revenue is pooled as government funds and then allocated. Australia-US relationship ‘can’t be stronger’: Albanese Mitchell: Doesn’t it embarrass Australia to have [Keating] attacking India, and saying of President Biden he can barely put three sentences together? Albanese deflects the questions, pointing to the strong relationship between Australia and the US: … What he said about India, what he said about Joe Biden what he said about China, what he said about our intelligence, I think … Well, I think that people like President Biden, towards Australia’s leadership, and my relationship with him, can’t be stronger. It’s as strong as any relationship has ever been between an Australian prime minister and a president of the United States, and that’s something I’m battling with him, and I listened four times. Asked specifically about Keating insulting two of his most senior ministers, Penny Wong and Richard Marles, Albanese says he will defend himself and his ministers “for the job that we’re doing”. Paul Keating wasn’t complimentary about all three of us yesterday. But that is his prerogative to do so. I fundamentally disagree with his view, and I disagree with his attitude towards the state of the world in 2023. Neil Mitchell: Have you spoken to Penny Wong or Richard Marles to reassure them of that? Albanese: They know that. Neither of them were shocked by Paul Keating’s statements. He has had views that he’s put privately before. I think it is unfortunate that Mr Keating chose a very strong personal statement against people. I don’t think that that does anything other than diminish him, frankly. But that’s a decision that he’s made. ‘Paul Keating at Paul Keating’s best’: Albanese brushes off Aukus savaging The first question is unsurprisingly about Paul Keating’s savaging of the Aukus deal in his national press club address, which also included some pretty pointed personal attacks on the PM, the defence minister, Richard Marles, and the foreign minister, Penny Wong. I’m not going to get into an argument with Paul. Paul is someone who has my utmost respect for what he achieved as a treasurer and as prime minister of Australia. My job is to govern Australia in 2023 based upon what we see as the facts before us, and the world has changed, with respect for him yesterday. That was Paul Keating at Paul Keating’s best, if you like. PM returns to Australia after Aukus announcement The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is back in Australia after his Aukus announcement in San Diego as well a visit to Fiji on the way back. He’s now speaking to 3AW radio station in Melbourne: It’s good to be home. I’ve got to say it was a very, very big trip and a really important one, building the relationship with India. But also, of course, the important announcement that we made in San Diego just a couple of days ago and then calling in on the new prime minister of Fiji … to cement that relationship in the Pacific that’s so important for Australia at the moment. Andrews says gas ‘should be reserved for our needs first’ The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, has renewed calls for a domestic gas reserve as the state prepares for household bills to rise by almost a third in the coming months. The state’s Essential Services Commission on Wednesday published its draft decision, proposing household energy bills will rise by 31% from July. Andrews – who has long-called for a percentage of the nation’s gas to be reserved for domestic use – said struggling Australians should not be forced to pay European gas prices. We should not be competing with the other side of the world for something that starts here and is ours – belongs to us. That should be reserved for our needs first. Consumer lender Latitude Financial has been hit by a “sophisticated and malicious cyber-attack” that has resulted in the theft of more than 100,000 identification documents and 225,000 customer records. The financial company, that offers personal loans and credit cards, said in a statement to the market on Thursday that most of the identification documents were copies of drivers’ licences. The company said it had detected unusual activity on its systems over the last few days. The company said: While Latitude took immediate action, the attacker was able to obtain Latitude employee login credentials before the incident was isolated. The attacker appears to have used the employee login credentials to steal personal information that was held by two other service providers. The breach is the latest in a series of significant cyber-attacks on Australian companies, following hacks at Optus and Medibank, among others. Share trading in Latitude is suspended as the lender tries to contain the incident. The company is headed by Ahmed Fahour, a former chief executive of Australia Post. The federal court is hearing Bruce Lehrmann’s application to extend the time limit for lodging his defamation claim, which would allow him to sue Network Ten, News Corp, and two journalists for reporting the rape allegations made by Brittany Higgins. Lehrmann is suing the media outlets almost two years after they initially published the Higgins’ stories in February 2021, meaning they must convince the federal court to extend the usual 12-month time limit. His barrister, Steven Whybrow SC, will argue that Lehrmann was acting on prior legal advice from his previous firm not to initiate defamation proceedings in the immediate period after publications. He will also argue that Lehrmann faced the prospect of a high-profile criminal case, which would have necessarily delayed any defamation proceedings, and that his mental health was suffering considerably. Network Ten and News Corp are opposing Lehrmann’s efforts to extend the time limit. They also want to call Lehrmann to cross-examine him about the delay, which could mark the first time Lehrmann has given evidence in open court. The court heard on Thursday that a full report containing the contents of Lehrmann’s mobile phone has been made. Lawyers for the media outlets are arguing some text messages sent by Lehrmann to his friends are directly relevant to his state of mind at the time immediately before and after the publications, and may contradict the reasons he has given for delay, namely that he was advised by his then lawyers against pursuing defamation proceedings. In one message, Lehrmann contemplated suing as early as 15 February 2021, the day the initial Higgins stories were published. Lehrmann told a friend: If I’m named tonight, I’m up for millions as defamation. In others, he said one of his lawyers “says I’m up for a bit of money”. He also suggested to a friend that he would never face criminal proceedings. In one text, he said: One it’s false and second they have nothing. Sue Chrysanthou SC says the text messages appear to be at odds with the representations Lehrmann has given to his current lawyer, Paul Svilans, who has submitted an affidavit in support of the application to extend the time limit. In another message, Lehrmann is approached by friends after publications, who asked “do you know who the guy was?”. Lehrmann responded: Not the faintest idea, I haven’t been approached by anyone. The hearing is continuing before justice justice Michael Lee. Australians will soon receive more important details about an Indigenous voice as decision makers prepare to meet for the final time, AAP reports. The referendum working group will gather in Adelaide today before releasing their final advice. South Australia’s deputy premier and Indigenous affairs minister will address the group about their proposed state-based model for a voice. The Labor state government is hoping to have its legislation passed by Easter. The Indigenous Australians minister, Linda Burney, said she was looking forward to hearing what lessons could be learned. She said: We want to build on the strengths of the South Australian model and make sure Indigenous communities have their voices heard. Legislation to set up the referendum will be introduced to federal parliament by the end of this month, while a second bill will outline the question to be put to Australians at the national vote, which will take place later this year. Last year, the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, recommended three sentences to be added to the constitution. They would confirm the voice could “make representations to parliament and the executive government” on matters relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and that parliament would decide on the “composition, functions, powers and procedures” of the voice. He also proposed the question: “Do you support an alteration to the constitution that establishes an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander voice?” The National party has declared it will oppose the voice while the Liberals are yet to land on a formal position. Australia and India to trade avocado and okra In exciting news for lovers of okra, more of the vegetable should be on its way from India thanks to a trade deal which will also help Australian avocado growers access the Indian market in return. In a media release entitled “India ‘Hass’ a taste for the best,” the minister for agriculture, Murray Watt, has announced a two-way agricultural trade will provide new market access for Australian Hass avocados to India and access for Indian okra to Australia. Watt said the opening of a new export market was a significant opportunity for Australian producers, with industry estimating a potential market value of approximately $25m. Watt said the deal comes as part of the opportunities opened up by the Australia-India Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement. As well as adding to the $34.3bn trade relationship between the two countries, Watt highlighted the benefits would flow through to Australians’ kitchens: I’m pleased Australians will now be able to enjoy Indian okra which is known for its nutritional benefits and versatility in cooking. Successful completion of 10 trial ‘Hass’ avocado shipments to India will be required before the trade protocol with India is finalised. The Australian high commissioner to India, Barry O’Farrell, is also pretty excited, saying the deal will provide greater access to high-quality produce for consumers in both countries. Labor looks to privately owned land for conservation targets The Albanese government is calling for feedback on what privately owned and other parts of the country could be counted towards a target of conserving 30% of land by 2030. The environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, said the government planned to set up a framework that would recognise biodiversity conservation outside formally recognised parts of the country such as national parks and Indigenous protected areas. She said to be recognised the areas must have important biodiversity values and the owners must voluntarily commit to maintaining these values in the long-term. The idea is based on a global initiative, used in countries including Canada and South Africa, known as “other effective area-based conservation measures”. Plibersek said about 22% of Australia’s landmass was currently protected. That means that we still need to protect or conserve an additional 60m hectares, roughly nine times the size of Tasmania. High quality conservation areas or other effective area-based conservation measures can help us get there. A consultation paper can be found here. Labor attacks regional grants program that delivered 96% of funding to Coalition-held seats Labor has taken aim at a regional grants program that delivered 96% of its $272m of funding to Coalition-held electorates, despite projects being selected through an open, competitive process. Julian Hill, the chair of the parliament’s audit committee, said “the so-called Regional Growth Fund was yet another giant rorted slush fund”, delivering 16 projects in Coalition-held electorates and just one in a Labor-held seat, the Coalition target of Lingiari. Australian pets produce pile of poo ‘19 times heavier than Harbour Bridge’ Each year, Australian pets produce a pile of poo 19 times heavier than the Sydney Harbour Bridge, which can have serious implications for the environment, AAP reports. As well as the more than 1m tonne of excrement generated annually, plastic bags and non-compostable cat litter fill up landfill and pollute the environment, leading to dire health consequences. Single-use plastics break down into microplastics, which can be eaten by organisms and work their way up the food chain, Central Queensland University PhD candidate Emily Bryson said. There is still a lot we don’t know about how microplastics impact human and animal health. The best thing to do is try to avoid using them in the first place. But leaving pet poo where it lies can be even more damaging. Run off from nutrient-rich animal waste leaches into the soil, damaging microscopic organisms and marine life. The poo can also contain harmful bacteria and parasitic eggs that can spread to other animals or humans. Eco-friendly options such as compostable poo bags are gaining in popularity but pet owners need to know how to use them, Bryson said. Compostable plastic bags really do need to be put into compost for them to break down. Compostable bags left in the environment or put in landfill aren’t any better than regular plastic bags as they can still break into microplastics and contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. In the past year alone, sales in compostable cat litter and poo bags have jumped by almost a third, according to retailer Pet Circle. In some areas, particularly South Australia, dog poo can be included in organic waste bins where it is taken to be composted at industrial facilities. But in most parts of the country, pet owners will have to do their own composting at home. Following the prediction from the energy market operator of gas supply shortages, Independent MP Allegra Spender is calling for the acceleration of electrification of households with solar. Workers face longer hours for less pay without productivity boost, treasurer says Jim Chalmers says Australians’ incomes will fall and the working week will get longer without major boosts to productivity, and the nation must boost service delivery in the care sector to offset some “woeful” economic indicators. Before releasing the Productivity Commission’s five-yearly report on Friday, the treasurer again downplayed the prospect of major cost-of-living relief in the May budget but said it would be soon become a focus for the government. High to extreme fire danger across most of NSW In NSW there is extreme fire danger in the Central and Southern Ranges where a total fire ban is in the place. Remote renters head to high court over housing neglect The Northern Territory’s failure to provide adequate public housing will be examined in the high court, with implications for the nearly 3m Australian households that rent. In question will be whether the territory’s government should compensate tenants in the remote community of Santa Teresa for distress caused by lack of reasonable living conditions. The executive director of advocacy group Better Renting, Joel Dignam, said: Landlords should be held accountable for making sure rental homes are habitable. This means more than just a few walls and a roof, it means people should be able to live a full and decent life in their homes. The case comes after multiple bodies, including the NT supreme court, found the territory government was obliged to provide tenants in Santa Teresa with housing that was not only safe but also reasonably comfortable. Residents of the Arrernte community near Alice Springs first brought their case to the NT civil and administrative tribunal in 2018. Many reported dealing with a lack of electricity, hot water, cooking and functioning toilets for extended periods. Jasmine Cavenagh had a blocked toilet for eight months while Enid Young, the lead tenant in the case, had no air conditioning for 17 months and no door for five years. The nearly 70 tenants will be represented by Australian Lawyers for Remote Aboriginal Rights and not-for-profit litigators Grata Fund. Lawyer Dan Kelly said: Housing is a human right and the deplorable state of housing in remote communities, its impacts on health, education and employment opportunities, should not be tolerated in a country as wealthy as Australia. Territory Families, Housing and Communities said in a statement it was committed to ensuring remote public housing was safe, habitable and appropriate but declined to comment further. It is expected a decision by the high court will be reached later this year. – AAP The Queensland youth justice minister, Liane Linard, is claiming that it is not true that a 13-year-old boy was held for at least 45 days in solitary confinement. RN Breakfast host Patricia Karvelas: Last Friday the children’s court in Cairns heard of a 13-year-old Aboriginal boy referred to as Jack who spent a total of 45 days locked in a cell while awaiting trial. We know that between February 1 and February the 23rd this year he did not leave his cell for 22 days. Do you think that’s acceptable? Linnard: I’m certainly aware of those media reports. And of course, as soon as I heard them, I asked my department to review that case. The advice I received is that it was not the case that that young person was in solitary confinement. What was indeed released, the department reviewed a small sample of logbooks and records, reviewed these and have confirmed for me that the young person was attending programs and interacting with peers and staff. So of course I looked at those allegations they were very serious and on that advice is that they’re not the case. … the court was provided with a download of information that I believe did not provide as fulsome a picture as it could have. When asked what state the child was in if he was not in solitary confinement, as Linnard confirmed, she said: Well, the young person was subject to a separation, and the separation is an event defined in the act, it could be the child is ill or the child’s request. It could be on the basis of health safety or security requirements, where it’s required, the young person is still participating in health services, education services, cultural programs, they can still access phone calls. This story was an exclusive that Guardian Australia’s Ben Smee brought you and other media have subsequently followed: O’Connor ‘surprised by the tone’ of Keating’s comments about Penny Wong O’Connor says he “fundamentally” disagrees with Keating’s criticisms of Penny Wong’s diplomacy as running around the Pacific Islands with a lei handing out money: I fundamentally disagree with that description. Penny Wong has been mending our relationships in the region and beyond. In a very short space of time, the foreign minister has been working assiduously with not only Pacific Island countries but around the world to stabilise and improve our relationships. I think some of the relationships Australia had with other countries wasn’t in the best possible shape. … I think therefore the criticism is unwarranted. And no way accurate. Lisa Millar: Are you disappointed a former Labor prime minister was speak like that about your colleagues? O’Connor replies that Keating has the right to say what he wishes but admits he is “surprised by the tone of his comments”: Well, Paul Keating is, you know, when he decides on a particular view, may say things that we don’t always agree with. But he’s got every right to say what he wishes. But I would actually – I believe most people would agree that the government has done a very good job in the foreign policy space, improving relationships, mending, I would argue, relationships with some countries within our region and beyond. And that’s been critical in terms of our standing in the world. I would have to disagree with him. I’m somewhat surprised by the tone of his comments. But he’s got – he has the right to say when he said yesterday but I disagree with him entirely. Brendan O’Connor disagrees with Paul Keating’s Aukus views The interview with O’Connor turns to Keating’s savaging of the Albanese government for making the “worst deal in history”. O’Connor said he disagrees with Keating’s belief the majority of rank and file Labor members would share his concerns of the Aukus deal. 18 months ago the federal parliamentary Labor party made the decision to support the in-principle position of Aukus. This is not new, the Aukus proposition was put in September 2021. I have to say the briefing to caucus was one that was overwhelmingly supported at the time. And indeed, the shadow cabinet supported it at the time. Without dissent. So there’s been strong support within the federal parliamentary Labor party. I would believe within the Labor party generally, because of the need for us to build capability to protect our interests, and to make our region more stable and secure. And I think for the reason we have made the right decision and I have enormous respect for Paul Keating. But on this occasion I don’t agree with him. And as I say, it’s not anything new, it’s something that was in-principle supported a year and a half ago. Minister says gas export contracts must be honoured as Aemo warns of supply gaps The minister for skills and training, Brendan O’Connor, is speaking to ABC News Breakfast about the energy market operator’s announcement this morning there could be shortages of gas supply this winter, extending for several years. Asked about whether it’s a sign that the transition to renewable energy supplies is not happening fast enough, O’Connor says Australia is undertaking the “massive transformation” as quickly as possible. It’s fair to say we as a nation should have moved quicker to transform the sector in order to bring down energy – well, to provide secure and certain energy but to reduce prices. But we know also some of the more recent very significant and very difficult increases in energy costs are a result of other factors, including the invasion by Ukraine of Russia and it’s been a significant price increases across the world, including Australia. But we put something in place as recently as late last year to bring – to put downward pressure on prices. Lisa Millar: Minister, I do just want to stick with gas, because we’re going to be speaking to an expert very shortly and others concur, we don’t have a shortage of supply in this country, it’s been exported. So, when does the domestic market take the priority? When does the government have to actually pull that trigger to ensure the domestic market is served? O’Connor: As a responsible country of course we need to fulfil our obligations in so far as contracts we have entered into. Some of these go back many, many years and they’re ones that we must honour. But I agree we need to examine the domestic consumption of gas … and make sure we are able to provide energy to households and businesses and they’re the sort of things we can look at that. But we can’t do that at the cost of breaking contracts that have been entered into many years ago. Breaking news out of West Gippsland, where “Happy” the calf has been born with a smiley face pattern in its fur on a dairy farm in Ripplebrook. Turnbull concerned about UK economic situation Malcolm Turnbull rounded out his concerns there with one shared with Paul Keating – although the language he used was a little more moderated than the former Labor PM is famous for. Turnbull noted that the UK economy was not in a good place. And because of that there are questions over whether Britain can sustain investment in its defence force over the years and what that will mean for the Aukus deal. The bottom line is their economy is sick. It’s got fundamental, sort of existential problems. And you’ve got to ask yourself, whether Britain is going to be able to sustain investment in its navy and its military in the years ahead, given this huge demand that they’ve got elsewhere, not least the National Health Service. French submarines better because they used low enriched uranium – Turnbull Turnbull says France’s submarines were better suited in terms of cost and crew size, but also because they used low enriched uranium – which is about the same as a civilian nuclear power plant. But the US and UK reactors use weapons grade. His concerns also extend to what will happen once the naval staff who are nuclear trained retire, as Australia doesn’t have a nuclear industry. So where do they go? The list of former prime ministers lining up to criticise the Aukus deal is growing – Malcolm Turnbull has joined the list. He says he thinks it is a “tragic omission” that the option of a nuclear propulsion submarine with France was not pursued. And we will be paying for it … in dollars, in years lost and in a very, very high risk of execution. Turnbull says he accepts that it’s a done deal but it’s going to take a lot more time than the French program that “[Scott] Morrison recklessly cancelled”. Turnbull on Aukus Malcolm Turnbull is speaking to ABC Radio about the Aukus submarine deal, starting off with the proviso he is “sorry my concerns can’t be expressed as colourfully as Paul’s” – referring to Keating’s savaging of the deal at yesterday’s National Press Club address. Keating called Aukus “the worst deal in all history” yesterday but Turnbull says he doesn’t “buy into that”: I accept this Aukus deal is done and it’s set. I don’t think there’s any transit turning back from it. But he is concerned Aukus will take more time and cost a “great deal” more money than the French deal would have. Heating demands Aemo chief executive Daniel Westerman spoke to ABC Radio this morning. Asked whether consumers should be worried this winter if it’s really cold, Westerman said: These risks do present themselves when there is high demand for heating and for power generation at the same time. We saw the same thing in the middle of last year when we had some disruptive period in the national electricity market. That is why we are calling for new investment to increase capacity and increase gas supply. Gas supply warning Risks remain for Australia’s winter gas supply in the southern states, according to the latest official forecasts. The Australian Energy Market Operator has released an update that calls for urgent investment to ensure supply, with all future scenarios forecasting long-term demand for additional gas. The 2023 gas report released today anticipates gas production will meet customer demand in central and eastern Australia. But it says supply risks remain in the southern states as gas production declines, particularly in Victoria where production is forecast to almost halve by 2027. It will be important for production from liquefied natural gas exporters, in excess of existing export contracts, to be available. The operator said in its report: The risk of supply gaps increases if excess northern production is exported as spot cargoes rather than used to meet domestic demand. From 2026, without additional commitments to expand domestic supply, or hydrogen or biomethane coming online as an alternative, gas contracted for export by Queensland LNG producers may need to be used to maintain domestic gas adequacy. Australia’s energy ministers have already extended the market operator’s powers to tackle immediate east coast supply shortfalls. Taking effect for winter 2023, these new powers are intended to secure the gas and electricity markets and protect domestic gas consumers. The Australian domestic gas security mechanism and heads of agreement between the federal government and LNG producers are tipped to be important for domestic supply. The objective of the mechanism is to ensure there is enough gas to meet the needs of consumers by – if necessary – controlling LNG exports. Aemo chief executive Daniel Westerman said: Existing instruments, such as the heads of agreement with LNG exporters, which includes the gas supply guarantee, to offer additional gas into the east coast domestic market in 2023 will help in managing supply adequacy. – AAP Good morning!

In NSW there is extreme fire danger in the Central and Southern Ranges where a total fire ban is in the place. Former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull will be giving his two cents about the Aukus deal on ABC Radio this morning after another former PM, Paul Keating, absolutely savaged the deal yesterday in a National Press Club address. Turnbull has previously raised concerns about whether the nuclear submarines built with the US and UK could compromise Australian sovereignty. Let’s get into it. Marles defends Aukus deal An attack by the former Labor prime minister Paul Keating on a landmark military deal has not shaken the government’s confidence in the security arrangement, the defence minister says, according to Australian Associated Press. Keating condemned the $368bn price tag and questioned Australia’s sovereignty within the arrangement. He also fired shots at senior federal government ministers including defence minister Richard Marles, and issued withering assessments of US President Joe Biden and UK prime minister Rishi Sunak. The landmark military deal is largely seen as an arrangement to combat China’s rising influence but Keating said it was unnecessary. Marles said Keating remained a revered figure within the Labor party. He told ABC 7.30 no matter what the former prime minister said about him, Anthon Albanese or Penny Wong, the government would not say a bad word about Keating: The Hawke-Keating government was the great peacetime, reformist, long-term government in our history. It’s a government that finished in 1996 [and] our responsibility is to be governing the country in the national interest in 2023. Marles said the government had worked hard to stabilise Australia’s diplomatic relations with China: We want to have a productive relationship with China but we do observe that we are seeing the biggest conventional military build-up in the world today since the end of the second world war. Opposition leader Peter Dutton said the former prime minister’s comments showed there was division within the Labor party over Aukus. He told reporters in Melbourne: “I think it is incumbent upon Richard Marles and others ... to rebuke the unhinged comments of Mr Keating. [The government] should be taking the advice of the military and intelligence chiefs as opposed to Paul Keating. The Australian Council of Social Service called for the increase to jobseeker and youth allowance payments, a disability and illness supplement of $110 a fortnight and a 50% boost to commonwealth rent assistance. In a pre-budget submission, Acoss said boosting the jobseeker payment for single people to the rate of the pension ($1,026 a fortnight) would require a $350 a fortnight rise, while the increase would be worth $232 for single people on youth allowance. The policy would cost $10.5bn in 2023-24. The peak body said payments should be indexed to whichever measure would deliver the highest increase out of wages or inflation. While recent increases, including a $24.70 a fortnight rise to jobseeker payments due on 20 March, have been larger than usual due to rising inflation, jobseeker has already fallen well behind the age pension, which has more generous indexation rules. The Acoss chief executive, Cassandra Goldie, said it was a “disgrace” Australia’s unemployment benefit was among the lowest in the OECD given it was one of the wealthiest countries in the world: We say now is the right time for us to be fixing the adequacy of our key social protection for people who are on the lowest incomes who are being locked out of paid work. The Acoss proposals also included an extra 25,000 social housing dwellings a year for 10 years, which would cost $10bn over the decade, and a subsidised jobs offer for people experiencing long-term unemployment. Acoss also proposed a range of revenue measures, including scrapping the stage-three tax cuts, saving $18bn in 2024-25 alone. Another option was proceeding with some aspects but keeping the 37% rate and keeping the 45% threshold at $180,000. It said this would “leave in place a tax cut of up to $37 per week for individuals on incomes up to $120,000”. The submission comes before a statement from the Albanese government’s independent economic inclusion advisory committee, which will report on the adequacy of working-age payments including jobseeker before the May budget. Good morning and welcome to our rolling news coverage. I’m Martin Farrer and I’ll be bringing you some of the top breaking stories before Natasha May fires up her work station to take charge. The defence minister, Richard Marles, has defended the Aukus submarine deal in the wake of a blistering attack from the former labor prime minister Paul Keating who dubbed it the “worst deal in all history”. Speaking on 7.30 last night Marles declined to criticise Keating personally but pointed out he had last been in government in 1996 when the world was very different. Marles said the government had worked hard to stabilise Australia’s diplomatic relations with China but “we are seeing the biggest conventional military build-up in the world today since the end of the second world war”. There is fresh uproar this morning about Scott Morrison’s secret ministries after an FOI request revealed that his former assistant minister Ben Morton was appointed to administer the home affairs department in March 2021. The move was not disclosed at the time in official ministry lists or a swearing-in ceremony and follows the shocking revelations that Morrison secretly appointed himself to run five ministries during the pandemic without telling the relevant ministers. A group of Indigenous leaders will meet in Adelaide today to finalise advice to the government on the voice to parliament referendum, including what they want the constitutional amendment to say. The voice referendum working group – which was set up by the government – will make recommendations on the referendum question that will be posed to Australia. We’ll have all the updates as they happen. The Albanese government has been urged to lift the jobseeker payment to the same rate as the pension, offering a $350-a-fortnight lift to the main unemployment benefit. In a pre-budget submission, the Australian Council of Social Service said youth allowance payments should be increased and called for a disability and illness supplement of $110 a fortnight, and a 50% boost to commonwealth rent assistance.

They’re always on the lookout for what the American nuclear physicist, Alvin Weinberg, in 1965 termed the “technological fix”, be it a high-speed rail network to solve regional inequality, or nuclear power as an answer to the climate crisis. This week, one old and discredited technological fix has reared its head: eugenics, the pseudoscientific belief that humans can be bred to “perfection” in the same way we breed cattle or domestic pets for particular traits. Developed by Charles Darwin’s cousin, Francis Galton, in the 19th century, it was promoted by politicians and intellectuals in Britain, before becoming the justification for millions of involuntary sterilisations globally, mainly of the poor and disabled, and the Nazis’ devastating programme of “racial hygiene” that culminated in the Holocaust. One might think that such a morally and scientifically vacuous ideology would be behind us by now, yet one of Dominic Cummings’ fresh new hires turned out to be something of a fan. The former Downing Street adviser Andrew Sabisky, a self-proclaimed political “forecaster”, argued that forced long-term contraception might help tackle the problem of a “permanent underclass”, or as early eugenicists termed it, the “residuum”. He also suggested that black people had innately lower average IQs. Downing Street initially stood by Sabisky’s appointment, with No 10 refusing to comment on whether Boris Johnson agreed with his views. After intense media scrutiny, Sabisky announced on Twitter that he was resigning. Who could have guessed that putting out a job call for weirdos and misfits would have led to this? Sabisky is joined by the likes of Toby Young, the rightwing journalist who has made the case for what he calls “progressive eugenics”, or allowing poor parents to engineer their children in utero with intellectual and physiological capacities that would compensate for their disadvantaged start in life. Cummings has likewise suggested that human capacities are the result of heritable traits rather than external factors such as education or social mobility; he previously stated that 70% of an individual’s cognitive capacity is genetic (a wild misinterpretation of how biology works, according to even the most hereditarian of scientists). Even Johnson has displayed a fondness for biologically determinist arguments. In 2013, as London mayor, he suggested that some people would struggle to get on in life because of their low IQs. These ideas reflect a type of thinking that dates back more than a century, when powerful individuals and social reformists pathologised poverty and inequality, framing them as biological problems innate to the poor and oppressed. This brand of genetic determinism retains its allure for one reason: its political power. If it were possible to claim that entire groups of people are born stupid, lazy or in other ways inferior to other groups, governments would never need to fix their problems. Welfare or social improvements would be redundant because – let’s face it – poor families are destined to be poor, and their children are doomed at birth. Eugenics is a way of shirking responsibility for the origins of social problems, by casting blame on the disadvantaged. It suggests there is a natural order underpinning existing social hierarchies. Far better for them and the world, argues the eugenicist, that we let the poor die out. We need only look to the second world war for examples of what can happen when a group of people refuses to die fast enough: eugenicists helped them on their way. Beneath the policy proposals of leading eugenicists in the 19th and 20th centuries was a thinly veiled disgust for the poor, disabled and foreign. For more than a century the global eugenics movement has been built around the notion that those who are powerful and wealthy are there not because of privilege or good fortune, but because they are genetically better than everyone else. Eugenics was once the driving force behind the modern-day selective schooling system, which sifted children into ability buckets as early as possible in the belief they wouldn’t change. The rhetorical trick of those like Sabisky is to shift the argument away from moral defences of eugenics, which are no longer socially acceptable, and towards pseudoscientific justifications for eugenic practices. Claims that it’s possible to breed for beneficial traits in humans the same way we do with cows and dogs sound superficially plausible. But here, too, they are flawed. They ignore the physical price paid in genetic defects by these animals in meeting our demands for milk, meat and domestication. Pure-breed dogs, for example, frequently experience health issues. Even if we could breed humans for intelligence – itself unlikely given that intelligence involves many thousands of genes, social and environmental investment, and a significant dose of developmental luck – we could never be sure that a more intelligent population wouldn’t be genetically compromised in other ways. Animal breeding doesn’t create well-rounded individuals, it creates machines – and sometimes monsters. But, of course, this is not the point. What captivates Sabisky and Cummings is the notion of a fix, the dream that nonconformist geniuses will deliver bold technologies to save us from ourselves. Blinded by this light, they ignore the suffering and misery inflicted upon countless people by eugenicists who imagined they were acting for the national good. The technological fix was always a pipe dream. If policymakers truly cared about improving the lives of the poor and minorities, they would provide everyone with a high standard of nutrition and education, and root out nepotism and inequality of opportunity. It doesn’t take a genius to figure that out. • Angela Saini is a science journalist and the author of Superior: The Return of Race Science"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"australia-news/2019/apr/18/campaign-catchup-2019-shorten-hits-back-on-climate-policy-cost-as-pm-goes-nuclear","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2019-04-18T07:26:00Z","webTitle":"Campaign catchup 2019: Shorten hits back on climate policy cost as PM goes nuclear","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/apr/18/campaign-catchup-2019-shorten-hits-back-on-climate-policy-cost-as-pm-goes-nuclear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2019/apr/18/campaign-catchup-2019-shorten-hits-back-on-climate-policy-cost-as-pm-goes-nuclear","fields":{"headline":"Campaign catchup 2019: Shorten hits back on climate policy cost as PM goes nuclear","bodyText":"In a nutshell Maybe it was the Northern Territory heat. Maybe the experiment, such as it was, to stay as positive as possible, has been declared shelved after a week of unrelenting government attack. But Bill Shorten put in his strongest performance yet this campaign, officially turning up. The government had started by hoping for its third straight day of “what’s their climate policy cost” and instead ended up having to defend its own climate policy, as well as fend off details about how much its tax plan could end up benefiting high income earners. Labor had started the campaign with the aim of improving Shorten’s personal popularity. To that end, the party leader was kept back from negative attacks, with Chris Bowen, Kristina Keneally and Tanya Plibersek stepping in to hit those notes when needed. But a stumble on super and an ill-fated attempt to bat away climate policy questions essentially lost Labor two days of messaging. On Thursday, the last day of full campaigning before the Easter break and a laying down of arms on both sides, Shorten decided to step back up to the plate. He called the government’s attacks on the cost of Labor’s climate policy “malicious and stupid”. He labelled Morrison the spending “cutter-in-chief” and turned the question back on the government, saying Labor was using the same modelling as the government, the same numbers. He still didn’t answer all the questions, and to be honest, he probably won’t. But Labor finally found a line they could prosecute. And that put the government back on the defence, having to defend its own climate policy, while successive government MPs struggled to answer by how much its tax plan would benefit higher income earners. The government dismissed the Australia Institute’s figure of $77bn, but refused to put their own number on it. Meanwhile, both sides are accusing the other of launching a “scare campaign”. And thus ends week one. Elsewhere on the trail George Christensen is still grabbing headlines, forcing government MPs to defend him as an “excellent local member” in the face of reports he missed committee work while on holiday in the Philippines. Michael McCormack was left to answer questions on his Dawson MP for the third day this campaign, relying on the line that when he took over as leader of the Nationals, he “had a chat” to Christensen, and the trips stopped. Christensen has referred some of his domestic connecting travel to the independent parliament expenses authority for its assessment, but the questions keep on keeping on, somewhat dulling the Coalition’s central Queensland campaign in the meantime. The big picture “How good” is Scott Morrison’s marital advice? Jenny Morrison had some thoughts at a Launceston campaign launch, as her husband delved into that topic. Or she might just be sick of eating his curry. Required reading Adani isn’t going away as an issue for either side just yet. But today, the questions were back in the government’s court over briefing notes released under freedom of information. Meanwhile, on climate, the Greens have not ruled out torpedoing Labor’s climate policy, if the opposition wins the election and it holds the balance of power, the leader, Richard Di Natale, saying he would expect Labor to come to the negotiating table. The Greens don’t believe Labor’s policy is ambitious enough, potentially lining up the same scenario which derailed Labor’s climate policy in 2009. And it’s a slow burner, but it’s not going to go away, so Paul Karp has delved into whether the government is planning to cut spending growth by $40bn to meet its surplus plan. Tweet of the day Despite telling Tasmanian radio that it was “not, not on the agenda” and nuclear power operators were welcome to put in a submission to power Australia, as long as “it can pay its way” and if nuclear power operators wanted to put forward a submission “they can”, Scott Morrison was later made to do some clean up of his own when Labor seized on whether nuclear power was now government policy: What next? Both leaders are heading back to their respective homes for the easter weekend, with no campaigning to occur over the public holidays. But they’ll pick back up again on Sunday evening, ready for the blitz to begin again on Monday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jul/10/nuclear-renewables-are-better-bet-ministers-told","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-09T23:01:28Z","webTitle":"Cool down nuclear plan because renewables are better bet, ministers told","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jul/10/nuclear-renewables-are-better-bet-ministers-told","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jul/10/nuclear-renewables-are-better-bet-ministers-told","fields":{"headline":"Cool down nuclear plan because renewables are better bet, ministers told","bodyText":"Government advisers have told ministers to back only a single new nuclear power station after Hinkley Point C in the next few years, because renewable energy sources could prove a safer investment. The National Infrastructure Commission (NIC) said the government should cool down plans for a nuclear new build programme that envisage as many as six plants being built. The commission, launched by George Osborne in 2015, said that a decade ago it would have been unthinkable that renewables could be affordable and play a major role in electricity generation. But the sector had undergone a “quiet revolution” as costs fell, it said. Sir John Armitt, the NIC’s chairman, said: “They [the government] say full speed. We’re suggesting it’s not necessary to rush ahead with nuclear. Because during the next 10 years we should get a lot more certainty about just how far we can rely on renewables.” He argued that wind and solar could deliver the same generating capacity as nuclear for the same price, and would be a better choice because there was less risk. “One thing we’ve all learnt is these big nuclear programmes can be pretty challenging, quite risky – they will be to some degree on the government’s balance sheet,” he said. “I don’t think anybody’s pretending you can take forward a new nuclear power station without some form of government underwriting or support. Whereas the amount required to subsidise renewables is continually coming down.” Renewables were a “golden opportunity” to make the UK greener and make energy affordable, he added. Armitt said he was agnostic about whether the next power station was the one Hitachi wanted to build in Wales, or one EDF Energy hoped to build in Suffolk. The government is in the process of negotiating a deal with Hitachi to enable the project at Wylfa on Anglesey to go ahead. But the NIC’s report was unequivocal. It said: “Government should not agree support for more than one nuclear power station beyond Hinkley Point C before 2025.” Armitt said: “By that point we should be in better position on storage technology and presumably [will] continue to see a drop in price on renewables.” The NIC said that by 2030 a minimum of 50% of power should come from renewables, up from about 30% today. New figures released by energy analytics firm EnAppSys show renewables have already overtaken nuclear for electricity generation. Wind, solar and biomass power stations supplied 28.1% of power across April, May and June, with nuclear at 22.5%, the third quarter in a row that renewables have outstripped nuclear. The government has repeatedly stressed its backing for new nuclear plants, recently striking a sector deal with the nuclear industry. A government spokesperson said: “As we continue our transition to a low-carbon economy and meet this challenge the government is committed to providing a secure energy system with a diverse energy mix in which new nuclear has an important role to play.” But Armitt said he was hopeful that, as an independent adviser to ministers, his recommendations would fall on receptive ears. “We’ve seen how long it took to negotiate Hinkley – does the government really want to have to keep going through those sort of negotiations?” he said. Separate research commissioned by the NIC and published on Tuesday found that nuclear and renewables could meet climate targets for comparable costs. Aurora Energy Research concluded that, regardless of which technology was pursued, the power sector would have to reach zero emissions by 2050 to hit legally binding carbon goals. In a statement, EDF Energy said it believed “in having as much renewable power as practically possible and is making major investments in renewables. However, having too much of one energy type creates risks to security of supply and increases costs.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"cities/2018/nov/05/minnesota-experimental-city-the-1960s-town-based-on-a-comic-strip","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2018-11-05T07:30:03Z","webTitle":"Minnesota Experimental City: the 1960s town based on a comic strip","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/nov/05/minnesota-experimental-city-the-1960s-town-based-on-a-comic-strip","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/2018/nov/05/minnesota-experimental-city-the-1960s-town-based-on-a-comic-strip","fields":{"headline":"Minnesota Experimental City: the 1960s town based on a comic strip","bodyText":"If Minnesota Experimental City had been a roaring success, you’d probably have heard of it. Perhaps you’d even be living there. You’d also have heard of its chief designer: Athelstan Spilhaus. The sci-fi name sounds too on-the-nose to be true, but Spilhaus was real and so, for a time, was his utopian brainchild – at least on paper. Originally from South Africa, by way of MIT, Spilhaus was a postwar polymath in the vein of Buckminster Fuller. He seems to have been an expert in everything from engineering to urban planning to atmospheric science to oceanography. And, like Fuller, he believed that science and technology could solve most of humankind’s problems. If we could send a human into space, we could do anything. Spilhaus proposed such solutions weekly in his future-science comic-strip series Our New Age, which was widely syndicated in US newspapers from 1957 to 1973. Getting such visions off the paper turned out to be a different story, but an instructive one, as told in new documentary The Experimental City, directed by Chad Freidrichs. South African-American geophysicist and oceanographer Athelstan Spilhaus in 1962. Photograph: CBS via Getty Images Looking at projections in the early 60s, Spilhaus saw that the US population was set to grow to 400 million by the 21st century, which translated into the equivalent of building 12 new cities of 250,000 people annually. This was in an era when existing cities were dying – blighted by crime, urban decay and “white flight” to the suburbs. So in true postwar visionary style, Spilhaus rethought the entire concept of the city from first principles. He called it a “total systems experiment”. In proposing his prototype 21st-century city, Spilhaus correctly diagnosed many of the shortcomings of the 20th-century one. He cottoned on early to concepts such as air pollution, even speculating that it was changing the Earth’s atmosphere. He focused on the problem of waste, noting that prosperity in 1950s and 60s America was being measured in terms of consumption, and suggesting that “waste is a resource that we don’t yet know how to use”. In his city, everything would be recycled. He questioned the amount of urban space given over to roads, and proposed that the city of the future be free of the internal combustion engine, or at least that cars be integrated into a “dual-mode” guideway – whereby automobiles come off the road and on to a guided rail-like system that moves them around the city independent of the drivers. All of this infrastructure – transport, utilities, parking, air-pollution removal technology – could be built underground, leaving clear civic space at ground level. Spilhaus even anticipated that people would have personal computers in their homes one day, which they would use for shopping and education. Spilhaus loved the mechanics of systems – but he was no architect. Photographs: Ron Galella/WireImage/Unicorn Stencil Doc Films Minnesota Experimental City, or MXC, began in earnest in 1966, when Spilhaus found a powerful ally in the form of Otto Silha, publisher of the Minnesota Star and Tribune. Their joint PR campaign brought on other well-connected advocates: a four-star general; president Johnson’s physician; civil rights leader Muriel Snowden; even Fuller himself (at one point MXC was to be covered in a giant glass geodesic dome, like the one Fuller had proposed putting over Manhattan in 1960). With the support of vice-president Hubert Humphrey, a former Minnesota senator, MXC received some $250,000 of federal funds in 1967. Corporations including Boeing, Ford and Honeywell pledged to invest. The total cost of the project was estimated at $10bn, completion date: 1984. The devil was in the details. Judging by Freidrichs’s documentary, which makes use of personal interviews and audio of the MXC board’s meetings (you can almost smell the whiskey-breath and cigarette smoke), there was little meat on the bones. We see broad-brush schematics of the city’s organisation, even including “personal flying zones” to accommodate jet-belt commuters. But there is precious little consideration given to, say, the provision of an actual civic space where people would want to live. At one point, the MXC was to be covered in a giant glass geodesic dome. Image: Unicorn Stencil Doc Films Dedicated town-planning, let alone architecture, is very thin on the ground – the idea presumably being that planners and architects would come in later and be free to do their thing. Spilhaus loved the mechanics of systems but he was no architect. One drawing of the projected city even features a nuclear power station right in the middle of town. Spilhaus had no problem with that – this was the future, dammit! As MXC became bogged down in committee-level decision-making and real-world challenges, and Spilhaus’s control diminished, he seemed to lose patience. He resigned as MXC co-chairman in 1968, although he continued to champion the project. Hubert Humphrey’s defeat by Richard Nixon in the 1968 presidential election was another blow, but still the MXC project ploughed on. They found a site: an area of swampland in Swatara, central Minnesota, whose chief virtue seemed to be that hardly anybody lived there. Those who did weren’t exactly taken with the idea of a 250,000-person city on their doorstep, with or without the nuclear power station. “Some of the people in Swatara were incredulous that the state would think about taking their property, taking their land and creating this futuristic monstrosity,” recalls Grant Merritt, former head of the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency. Clockwise from top : the futuristic city logo; a protest by Swatara residents and the isolated woodland location chosen for the city. Photographs: Unicorn Stencil Doc Films “This was something based on a comic strip … and I was not too keen on that kind of a city.” Merritt became a leader of the David-v-Goliath campaign against MXC, fuelled by a burgeoning environmental movement that had begun to see technology as the problem rather than the solution. In the winter of 1972, activists braved sub-zero conditions to march from Swatara to the state capitol in Saint Paul, some 160 miles away. Spilhaus dismissed the environmentalists as “a body of uninformed, vocal opinion which one might characterise as supporting non-engineering or even anti-engineering”, and urged the state legislature to stand firm against their “nonsense emotionalism”. But it was to no avail. In 1973, MXC was officially defunded and wound down. MXC exhibits many of the same flaws as other failed utopian schemes of the era. For one thing, it was the vision of one very determined and somewhat arrogant man. Spilhaus, who died in 1998, never seemed to like the idea of collaboration or relinquishing control – this was his baby. In later life, he suggested building the city underwater, where those pesky protesters couldn’t jeopardise it. For another, MXC never even approached the stage of dealing with the practical challenges of realising such a vision, which is probably just as well. Who knows how many cost overruns, technical barriers, engineering disasters and other reality checks it would have faced? It might have all gone swimmingly, but it seems doubtful. Does the failure of MXC suggest that blank-slate utopias are not the answer, and never will be, or that society has become too timid about big, bold solutions? With the current global fashion for building entire cities from scratch as a way to fix the problems of our unsustainable urban lives, there’s plenty to learn from Spilhaus’s grand, ultimately fruitless vision. Even failed experiments have their value. • The Experimental City will be screening at Curzon Bloomsbury, London, on 8 November.

The New Democrat Coalition released an 11-page outline of principles on Wednesday, along with a list of bills to back them up, advocating for incremental and “pro-market” steps to cut pollution. Their pitch comes as the Swedish youth activist Greta Thunberg visits Capitol Hill to tell US lawmakers they just aren’t trying hard enough, and young people inspire global climate strikes this Friday ahead of the UN climate change summit next week. “Congress has been working for years on powerful, proven policy solutions,” they say. “Our challenge is to build on those efforts and push past entrenched partisan fights to secure durable climate legislation that ensures we lead the global transition in combatting climate change.” The New Democrats want to set a clean energy standard, encourage nuclear power and clean up methane leaks from oil and gas companies. They say they want to get carbon pollution to net-zero by 2050, calling the climate problem “unquestionably urgent”. Progressives, by comparison, have penned the Green New Deal, a blueprint for rapidly cutting heat-trapping pollution while fighting societal inequity. But the document, sponsored by the presidential candidate Bernie Sanders and congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, is not legislation and does not spell out specific policy changes. The difference in the proposals highlights a rift between Democrats that is also on display with the 2020 presidential candidates. More centrist politicians worry about playing into Republican messaging that climate-focused Democrats want to ban cheeseburgers and end air travel. And they say lawmakers should focus on what is politically achievable. Progressives say the climate crisis requires radical change. Where Sanders has called for spending $16.3tn on climate goals and for going to war with fossil fuel companies, former vice-president Joe Biden would commit $1.7tn and has struggled to commit to phasing out the US natural gas that is contributing to heating the planet. Congressman Scott Peters, vice-chair of the New Democrats, maintained that his group’s proposals aren’t inconsistent with a Green New Deal and said some might be able to gain necessary support from conservatives. Peters said “rather than arguing about a political tool like the Green New Deal”, Democrats should be making plans. Peters acknowledged his group has more to do, noting that their package of legislation doesn’t include a plan to tax carbon pollution. But he said “this is what you need to do to start a path to net-zero by mid-century”. That’s the goal the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has laid out for keeping temperatures from rising unacceptably higher. “We really don’t have time to waste,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2019/jun/14/sussan-ley-ill-be-an-environmentalist-as-minister","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2019-06-14T00:31:51Z","webTitle":"Sussan Ley: I'll be an environmentalist as minister","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jun/14/sussan-ley-ill-be-an-environmentalist-as-minister","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2019/jun/14/sussan-ley-ill-be-an-environmentalist-as-minister","fields":{"headline":"Sussan Ley: I'll be an environmentalist as minister","bodyText":"The new environment minister, Sussan Ley, has declared herself an “environmentalist”, saying she is prepared to fight for the environment around the cabinet table even when colleagues disagree with her. Ley, who welcomed the Queensland government’s decision on Thursday to give the green light to the Adani coalmine, told Guardian Australia she wanted to see more action on recycling, threatened species and biodiversity protection, and a greater focus on individual action to achieve a better environment. But in the lead-up to a 10-yearly review of the country’s Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, Ley has also flagged that she wants approval times for major projects cut, has left the door open to lifting the country’s ban on nuclear power, and has questioned whether land clearing is responsible for species loss. The former health minister, who was returned to cabinet by Scott Morrison after she quit over an expenses scandal in 2017, said she saw the role as an advocacy position. “If I was the minister for women I would say that I am a feminist, and as the minister for the environment I would certainly say that I am the minister for the environment, so my role in discussions that I have with my colleagues is for the environment,” she said. “That doesn’t mean that I will always disagree [with them], but the best public policy is made with competing views at the table, and I look forward to promoting the view of the environment at that table.” Ley welcomed the review of the EPBC Act, due in the second half of this year, saying the country’s current environmental laws were “unnecessarily arduous, complex and not productive”. “I don’t think it matters whether you are on the side promoting your development or preserving conservation, all would agree that the process under EPBC is unnecessarily tied up with green tape and unnecessarily lengthy,” she said. “Let’s not take the integrity out of a genuine environmental assessment, that is important for everyone involved in a development process, but let’s take out unnecessary paperwork, unnecessary submissions, lengthy delays, court action that is at the moment … done on process but not on merit.” She said the current framework saw both parties line up for “years” of legal action, and “every decision is challenged”. “Both would agree that getting to the end result as efficiently and effectively as possible without compromising the integrity of a decision that genuinely takes the environment into account is where I would like to see it go,” she said. Along with the approvals process, a clutch of Coalition MPs have indicated they will use the EPBC Act review to have Australia’s nuclear ban removed, a push that is being backed by the Minerals Council of Australia and industry groups. Ley said the question of nuclear power in Australia was one “where you have to listen to all of the voices” but said she was open to the review considering a removal of the ban. “To be honest, I am not strongly for or against nuclear power. I think there are good arguments for it, and there are good arguments against it. “From the perspective of the environment it is important that it is considered, so I am not going to lead that discussion at any point of the review process. Plenty of other people will.” Ley also made clear her views on the threat to biodiversity after a UN report warned that a million species across the world faced extinction. The minister said she was “concerned” about the problem, but questioned whether land clearing was to blame. The Australian Conservation Foundation has estimated that there has been a loss of more than 7.4m hectares of threatened species habitat since the EPBC Act was introduced in 1999, with Australia singled out for its high rates of deforestation. “Biodiversity and … our level of loss of species is of great concern to me,” she said. “I really believe that the biggest threat to our threatened species is probably feral cats. Loss of habitat isn’t just land clearing, if it is land clearing at all, loss of habitat is often the wrong type of vegetation and that is often introduced weeds. “If you go to any national park in Australia that is run by the states, you will see areas of significant incursions of introduced plants, so if the animal doesn’t have the right vegetation, it is the biggest threat to its survival.” Ley pointed to a $100m environmental restoration fund that was aimed at protecting threatened species but said she wanted to see “everyone and every community on the case”. “Sometimes people can feel that the environmental challenges are so huge that there is nothing they can do, that is one of the reasons why I do want my approach to the portfolio to be about what you can do, whether it be reducing plastic waste, whether it be about joining a local volunteer group, whether it be about agitating for better weeds and pest management in national parks that are near you, where you live – these are practical things that people can do and they do make a difference.” • Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning On climate change, Ley said she was “interested” in the emissions reduction task of government which is included with the energy portfolio, under Angus Taylor, rather than environment, and said she believed the Coalition’s climate solutions fund is “where we need to be”. “I am not going to discuss the emissions policy, that is Angus Taylor’s to discuss,” she said. “It is about reducing emissions and it is about our Paris targets and it is about meeting those Paris targets and it is about recognising the importance of addressing the warming of the planet.” But Ley did flag a particular interest in the water portfolio, which is under the purview of the National party’s David Littleproud and which was a controversial issue in her regional electorate of Farrer. Having argued during the campaign for the compliance and operational parts of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority to be split, Ley also said she would use her new role to push for changes being demanded by irrigators. “It is very important for farmers that … it be demonstrated that environmental water is being used for environmental benefit, because farmers have to account for every single drop of irrigation,” she said. Ley said she would advocate for the importance of environmental water but believed changes to how the basin plan was managed were needed. “I am not going to rule out advocating for changes in the way that water is managed because, as I have often said, if a piece of public policy is tolerated at best and hated at worst in the area where it plays out … it is a message to all of us that perhaps we need to work harder on that balance between environmental water and agriculture.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/live/2022/may/10/minister-says-queens-speech-will-tackle-hooligan-protesters-amid-concerns-non-tory-bills-left-out","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-10T17:40:46Z","webTitle":"Queen’s speech proposals show Johnson ‘bereft of ideas or purpose’, says Starmer – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2022/may/10/minister-says-queens-speech-will-tackle-hooligan-protesters-amid-concerns-non-tory-bills-left-out","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/live/2022/may/10/minister-says-queens-speech-will-tackle-hooligan-protesters-amid-concerns-non-tory-bills-left-out","fields":{"headline":"Queen’s speech proposals show Johnson ‘bereft of ideas or purpose’, says Starmer – as it happened","bodyText":"Keir Starmer said Boris Johnson’s government was “bereft of ideas or purpose” after a Queen’s speech that included bills to overhaul the planning system and rewrite human rights law, but few new measures to tackle the cost of living crisis. The Treasury has quashed a suggestion from Johnson that a significant government announcement about extra help for people with the cost of living is due imminently. (See 4.05pm.) The European Union has said renegotiation of the Northern Ireland protocol is “not an option”. In a statement issued this afternoon Maroš Šefčovič, the vice-president of the European Commission, said: The protocol, as a cornerstone of the withdrawal agreement, is an international agreement. Its renegotiation is not an option. The European Union is united in this position. Šefčovič said the EU was open to negotiating with the UK on how the protocol was implemented, but, for these talks to succeed, that would require “the UK government to show the same level of determination and creativity [as the EU]”. He also said that if the UK were to take “unilateral action” – ie, to abandon parts of the protocol – this would make the situation more difficult. He said: Only joint solutions will work. Unilateral action by the UK would only make our work on possible solutions more difficult. Earlier Johnson refused to give his Irish counterpart, Micheál Martin, an assurance that the UK will not unilaterally abandon the protocol. (See 11.20am.) In fact, the Queen’s speech contained a strong hint that legislation that would allow the protocol to be ditched is being prepared behind the scenes. (See 12.11am.) In the Commons a few minutes ago Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the DUP leader, said he intended to stay as an MP, instead of leaving parliament to take up his seat in the Northern Ireland assembly (he was elected last week), until the protocol issue is resolved. Rishi Sunak has moved to weaken regulation of financial services brought in after the 2008 crash amid fears he is aiming to make London into a post-Brexit “Singapore-on-Thames” pushed by Tory donors. Environmental campaign groups have hit out at the “draconian” protest crackdown bill announced in the Queen’s speech. Ports and unions have cast doubt on the viability of legislation announced in the Queen’s Speech to ensure P&amp;O Ferries and other ferry operators pay seafarers the minimum wage. The government’s proposed ban on conversion practices intended to change people’s sexuality will in fact only fully cover under-18s, Downing Street has confirmed, saying it had to “strike the right balance” on outlawing the much-condemned practice. Detectives investigating Keir Starmer’s alleged breach of lockdown rules are considering interviewing the Labour leader face to face, with his Beergate agony likely to last at least a month before a decision on a fine is made. Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London, has joined Theresa May, the Conservative former prime minister (see 4.36pm), in welcoming the inclusion of the renters reform bill in the Queen’s speech. It will abolish so-called “no fault” section 21 evictions. Khan’s office said: The mayor welcomes the government’s decision to finally introduce long-promised legislation to ban section 21 ‘no fault’ evictions. This commitment is testament to the dogged work of tenants and campaigners who have been waiting three long years for ministers to honour their previous promises. However, the government should have used the Queen’s speech to address the eye-watering costs of renting by giving the mayor powers to introduce a two-year rent freeze in London, as a first step towards delivering rent controls that would make renting more affordable. Shelter welcomed this bill and the social housing regulation bill, which will increase the powers of the regulator of social housing. Polly Neate, the charity’s chief executive, said: Today’s Queen’s Speech shows the government has listened to the voices of renters, who have been fighting for a long time to be heard. For years private renters have said they need more security, so they don’t have to live in constant fear of a no-fault eviction. And for years social renters have tirelessly campaigned to be taken seriously when they say something is wrong. It’s been five years since the fire at Grenfell Tower, and we’re now one step further on the road to justice. These are from Jayne Ozanne, founder of the Ban Conversion Therapy coalition, on the watered-down plans for a bill banning conversion practices in the Queen’s speech. (See 2.06pm.) Green campaigners were dismayed at the lack of action on insulation in the Queen’s speech, which they said was a way to bring down energy bills quickly for hard-hit households, and by the abandonment of animal welfare measures. Juliet Phillips, of the E3G thinktank, praised the government’s move to a new “market mechanism” that would encourage the take-up of heat pumps. She said: Clean, efficient electric heat pumps have a critical role to play in helping UK families get off expensive fossil gas. The proposed low-carbon mandate on heating appliance manufacturers could spur innovation and investment in UK heat pump manufacturing. This could bring new green jobs to the UK, she added. But Greenpeace’s head of politics, Rebecca Newsom, was more scathing, accusing the government of giving up on the cost of living crisis. She said: With this Queen’s Speech Boris Johnson is throwing in the towel on some of the biggest challenges our country faces and pandering instead to the whims of his backbenchers. There’s not a single extra penny of support for households struggling with energy bills and no serious plan to fix our heat-wasting homes and get the country off fossil gas. Katie White, executive director of advocacy and campaigns at WWF, said: To level up the UK while levelling down energy bills, we cannot afford for the environment to be an afterthought, but today the UK government has failed to set out the transformative changes that are needed to address the food and fuel crises, build long-term resilience, deliver on net zero and restore nature. This is from Pat McFadden, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, on the Treasury briefing saying there are no plans for an imminent announcement about helping people with the cost of living, as Boris Johnson implied. (See 4.05pm.) McFadden said: Families need a government with a plan for the cost of living crisis and a plan for economic growth. Instead, we’ve got a government devoid of ideas, and a chancellor and prime minister who can’t even agree on the emergency budget the country sorely needs. Every day this government chooses not to act, working people suffer, and we get one step further into an economic trap with low growth, low wages, and high taxes. Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, is speaking in the debate now. He says the Lib Dems want an emergency cut in VAT. On Northern Ireland, May says there was no reference in the Queen’s speech to a Northern Ireland protocol bill. She says a bill of the kind the government is said to be considering, giving it the power to ditch parts of the protocol (see 12.11pm), would not be a good idea. She goes on: I think the government needs to consider not just the immediate issues, but also the wider sense of what such a move would say about the United Kingdom and its willingness to abide by treaties which it has signed. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the DUP leader, says the Northern Ireland protocol has to be dealt with. May says she put forward a Brexit plan that would have avoided new checks at the Northern Ireland/Great Britain border. But the DUP opposed that plan, she says. She also says she is disappointed there is no employment bill in the Queen’s speech. That would have allowed the government to legislate to allow waiters and waitresses to keep their tips. And she says she is disappointed the government is not legislating to set up an independent public advocate - something the Tories promised in their 2017 manifesto. After backbench speeches from Sir Peter Bottomley and Meg Hillier, Theresa May the former prime minister is speaking now. She says she is glad the government now seems to be addressing the problem of no-fault evictions. She says her government wanted to address this. But she says she is concerned by reports that Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary, favours letting people in a street vote to decide whether a housing application in their street should be allowed. She says she can see that plan backfiring. Lewis Goodall from Newsnight says the claim from Boris Johnson that his Rwanda asylum plan is just a rehash of a New Labour proposal (see 3.39pm) is highly misleading. This is from my colleague Heather Stewart, confirming that when Boris Johnson said in his speech that the government would be saying more about helping people with the cost of living in the days to come (see 3.32pm), he almost certainly meant months not days. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, is speaking now. He begins by thanking the Prince of Wales for coming to parliament today, calling him by one of his Scottish titles, the Duke of Rothesay. He says Boris Johnson did not listen to the message from last week’s elections, which was that people want him out of office. And he contrasts the Conservatives’ electoral performance with the SNP’s. The SNP are still gaining votes and seats, despite being in office a long time, he says. He says the party has won eight elections under Nicola Sturgeon’s leadership. From my colleague John Crace Johnson has now finished. His speech was delivered with a bit more verve than Keir Starmer’s, but was even weaker on substance. Its most notable feature was the implicit promise of a cost of living bailout that appears not to exist. This is from Kate McCann from Talk TV. Referring to Keir Starmer as the “leader of the opposition of the moment”, in a joke about the slogan used by Starmer in his own speech, Johnson criticises Labour for not backing the plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda. He claims New Labour looked at something similar when it was in power. Johnson’s comment about help for people being announced in the coming days (see 3.32pm) was not a reference to an emergency budget, the Times’ Steven Swinford reports. Johnson claims Labour would not approve new nuclear power stations. He calls them “great quivering jellies of indecision”. Sarah Owen (Lab) asks Johnson for an apology to pensioners and children who are going hungry, and to people who lost relatives during the Covid pandemic. In response, Johnson rattles off a list of measures helping pensioners and children. But what the country really needs is a strong economy, he says. He says that would not have happened under Labour because the country would have remained in lockdown. Johnson says the UK had the fastest growth in the G7 last year, and will return to that next year. That will give the government the “fiscal firepower” to help families with the pressures they face. The government will continue to use “all our ingenuity and compassion for as long as it takes” to help people, he says. He says “the chancellor and I will be saying more about this in the days to come”. (It is not clear from this whether, by “in the days to come”, Johnson literally means in the days to come, or whether he means at some point before the autumn. Until recently the government has been signalling that the next big announcement about help for people with the cost of living will not come until late summer, when the government has a better sense of what will happen to energy prices in the autumn.) Boris Johnson is speaking now. He says we come to the “halfway point of this parliament” - quashing speculation that an early election might be on the cards. After some broadbrush claims about the government, he pays tribute to MPs who have died: David Amess, James Brokenshire and Jack Dromey. Starmer has finished. It was rather a poor speech, that got worse and worse as it went along. One mistake was to structure it around a slogan - “government of the moment” - that will mean little to many people. This is from Jim Pickard from the Financial Times. And this is from Paul Waugh from the i. Starmer says the country needs a “government of the moment”. A government at the moment would have grasped the nettle and set up a new approach to the economy. An approach based on a stronger partnership between governments and businesses, a partnership dedicated to grow. A government of the moment would finally abolish business rates and replace them with a system that creates a level playing field with online giants so that our businesses can compete ... And a government at the moment would have a plan to revive our town centres and new businesses, providing finance for a new generation. Starmer says the UK is forecast to have the slowest growth in the G7 next year. It used to have growth of 2 or 2.5% every year. If the government had matched the Labour record on growth, people would be richer, and the government would have an extra £40bn for public services, he says. Starmer says Britain can do more than just “get Brexit done”. But the country needs more than what this government is offering. He says the Queen’s speech was “thin” and “bereft of ideas or purpose, without a guiding principle, or a roadmap for delivery”. He says he would like to think the worst is over. But the country is “staring down the barrel of something we haven’t seen in decades - a stagflation crisis [rising inflation and rising unemployment].” The government should be introducing a windfall tax, he says. UPDATE: Starmer said: As we emerge from the pandemic, find a new place in the world outside the European Union and transition to a carbon neutral economy, our country faces great challenges. But, at the same time, great opportunities are within our reach. We can rebuild stronger, learning where our society and our services need more resilience. We can do more than just get Brexit done, we can ensure Britain is in the best position to thrive outside of the European Union. And we can lead the world in zero carbon industries, generating high skill, high wage jobs across our country. But for that to happen we need a government of the moment with ideas that meet the aspirations of the British public. This thin address, bereft of ideas or purpose, without a guiding principle or a roadmap for delivery, shows just how far this government is from that. Too out of touch to meet the challenges of the moment. Too tired to grasp the opportunities of the future. Their time has passed. Keir Starmer is speaking. He starts with a warm tribute to the Queen. And he congatulates the prime minister too. He has achieved a first, he says. It sounds as if Starmer is going to launch into Partygate - but instead Starmer says Johnson is the resident of 10 Downing Street to be represented by a Labour council (after Labour took Westminster council last week). Starmer says he hopes the council will serve Johnson well. Back in the Commons, Fay Jones is winding up. Keir Starmer is speaking next. They are all grateful he has not cancelled that speech, she says, referring to Starmer’s no-show at the Institute for Government yesterday. Animal welfare organisations say they are “deeply dismayed” by the government’s failure to pursue laws banning imports of foie gras and fur, PA Media reports. PA says: The Queen’s speech did not include an animals abroad bill to ban the imports of such products, as well as halt adverts for tourism practices abroad such as elephant riding. A coalition of 38 organisations, including the RSPCA, Compassion in World Farming, Four Paws UK, Humane Society International and Save the Asian Elephants, said the failure to bring forward the bill was a betrayal of animals and out of step with public opinion. Charities have criticised the Queen’s speech for its lack of action on the cost of living crisis. Dan Paskins, director of UK impact at Save the Children, said: The cost-of-living crisis is an emergency the UK Government should be dealing with right now. The Queen’s Speech was a major opportunity to support those most affected by rising costs and the Government didn’t take it. Alison Garnham, chief executive of the Child Poverty Action Group, said: Government offered no short-term comfort for parents struggling to feed their kids in the face of rocketing prices, and no long-term vision for ending child poverty. Fay Jones is now telling a story about wearing a “It’s DD for me” T-shirt when supporting David Davis’s leadership bid in 2005. When she stood as a candidate, and was asked if she had done anything to embarrass the party, she felt she had to mention this, she says. Had she learnt anything from it? That she did not look good in pink, she says. Fay Jones (Con) is speaking now, seconding the humble address. She starts with a series of self-deprecating stories about colleagues commenting on her joke-delivering abilities. Back in the Commons Graham Stuart is still speaking. He says that he used to tell David Cameron what he thought of how he was doing - which led to his never getting promoted to the front bench during his first 11 years in parliament. It changed when Therea May became PM, he says. It may have been because she saw merit in him, she says, but more likely it was because she had not seen very much of him. Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, has told me that “nothing in the Queen’s speech will make any material difference on the immediate squeeze households are facing.” On the expectation that there will be no major interventions until the budget in the autumn, he said: You need to get on with it - there is a real cost to people on low incomes in not telling them what help you’re going to give. An increase in benefits is the top priority. My overall view is that what it shows is British politics hasn’t got a lot of ideas at the moment ... When you have 1980s inequality with stagnation of 2010s coming together, that is a very dangerous place economically, but also for what it does to your society in the medium term. We’re out of ideas at a time of high inequality and low growth. There will be more in my First Edition newsletter. You can sign up here. Stuart congratulates Labour on backing the government’s policy on Ukraine. The government is providing rocket launchers, he says. He provokes a laugh when he contrasts this with Labour’s plan for Trident submarines under Jeremy Corbyn - which involved having the submarines, but not having any missiles (an idea Corbyn once floated in an interview). UPDATE: Stuart said: We are providing rocket launchers complete with rockets so different from the Trident submarines that the honourable gentleman’s party previously proposed which were to have been built but, you will remember, never armed. Graham Stuart (Con) is opening the debate. Being invited to propose the humble address to the Queen is an honour, and the MP chosen is expected to come up with a speech that will provide some entertainment. Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Commons Speaker, opens the proceeedings ahead of the Queen’s speech debate by reminding MPs of their obligations under the MPs’ code of conduct. There is a cheer as he tells them they have a duty to tell the truth. I have updated the post at 2.06pm to make it clear, that, although the conversion practices ban will only fully cover the under-18s, it will also cover over-18s “who do not consent and who are coerced or forced to undergo conversion therapy practices”. My colleague Rafael Behr has written a superb column on the Queen’s speech. Here’s an extract. The Johnson flagship policy for the general betterment of life in the UK will be enacted as a ‘levelling up and regeneration bill’. Its advertised benefits are formidable. A government briefing note promises, among other treats, to ‘improve productivity, boost economic growth, encourage innovation, create good jobs and enhance educational attainment’. Scroll down to find the method, and it turns out that Shangri-la is reached by way of measures no less drastic than ‘giving residents more of a say over changing street names and ensuring everyone can continue to benefit from alfresco dining’ … Johnson is reduced to these inanities because the most powerful faction among his MPs will not, as a point of ideological principle, countenance anything that seriously interferes with the accrual of wealth and privilege to those who already have them. Levelling up has hit the same obstacle that derailed David Cameron’s ‘big society’ agenda. That, too, was conceived as a way to rehabilitate unhappy parts of the country without recourse to any of the explicit financial redistribution that Thatcherite Tories despise as socialism. Johnson, like Cameron before him, has wasted time on delusions of political alchemy, trying to cook up egalitarian ends with libertarian means. The product will always disappoint. The next stage is also predictable. Someone will have to be blamed for the persistence of material discomfort, and the political subject will have to be steered away from the economy. And here is the full article. Downing Street has said that the conversion therapy bill will only fully cover conversion practices for the under-18s. The prime minister’s spokesperson told journalists at the lobby briefing: This is a difficult area and we need to strike the right balance. I think it’s important to wait for the full details of the bill to be set out. Asked whether the loophole was needed to prevent people being blocked from receiving religious counselling, the spokesperson said: It’s important that the freedom to express religious teachings is not affected by the ban, individuals will still be able to access support and counsel from religious leaders should they wish. But that’s a separate issue to seeking to force this abhorrent practice on people. According to the government’s briefing paper, the full ban on conversion practices will only cover the under-18s. But the bill will also ban conversion practices for over-18s “who do not consent and who are coerced or forced to undergo conversion therapy practices”. The government has already committed two U-turns on this bill. Boris Johnson promised a ban on conversion practices before the 2019 general election. In March, ITV’s Paul Brand revealed Johnson had abandoned plans for a bill. His story caused such backlash that within hours No 10 was briefing that there would be a bill after all, but that conversion practices for trans people would not be included. The Irish deputy prime minister, Leo Varadkar, who negotiated the breakthrough Northern Ireland protocol with Boris Johnson in Wirral in October 2019, has said that it would be “very serious” if the UK threat to get rid of the protocol was not just sabre rattling. Speaking to RTE, he said the UK could not simply “resile” from the international treaty by unilaterally tearing up the protocol. If that is their approach, then we have a real problem here. It’s one thing engage in a bit of sabre rattling … but if they were to actually go down that route, it will be very serious. Here is the government’s 139-page briefing note (pdf) about the measures in the Queen’s speech. If you need to follow government legislation in detail, it’s a useful document to have. Boris Johnson has been accused of using the Queen’s speech to prioritise “wedge” or “culture war” issues that are likely to put the Labour party on the wrong side of public opinion, instead of focusing predominantly on what is best for the economy, or for the country as a whole. (See 8.54am and 1.32pm.) This is from my colleague Peter Walker on the measures in the Queen’s speech programme that do seem to have a “wedge” function. There are seven bills arguably aimed, in part or whole, at stirring up the Tory base, creating headlines in friendly papers and annoying opponents. A public order bill will specifically target disruptive environmental protesters; a media bill will allow Channel 4 to be privatised; public bodies will not be allowed to boycott certain countries. Arguably the key bill would replace the Human Rights Act with a UK bill of rights. The higher education (freedom of speech) bill makes a return from the last parliament. The levelling-up bill promises local people “more of a say over changing street names”. Finally, the conversion therapy bill will ban practices aimed at changing sexuality, but not gender identity. This is all part of a wider No 10-led strategy to focus on such divisive issues in the hope of shoring up support among socially conservative voters. Whether there are enough of these to win another election, if more liberal Britons become alienated, remains to be seen. I’ve lifted this from Peter’s theme-by-theme summary of what is in the Queen’s speech. It’s here. This is from Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, joining those attacking the Queen’s speech for its failure to include measures that will help people with the cost of living. Blackford said: Beyond the pomp, ceremony and rhetoric, the Queen’s Speech offered nothing to help people who are suffering under a Tory-made cost of living crisis and are struggling to make ends meet This was not just a missed opportunity – it was a political choice by a broken Tory government to sit on its hands while we face the biggest inflationary crisis in 50 years. The Bank of England confirmed last week that we are on the brink of recession – meanwhile, both the prime minister and chancellor are consumed by scandals to get on with the day job. Instead of tackling the Tory cost of living crisis and focusing on people’s priorities, Boris Johnson set out measures for a race to the bottom in standards through the Brexit Freedoms Bill to repeal EU-retained law and the other Brexit legislation. The government says its public order bill, announced in the Queen’s speech, will stop “a minority of protestors from using guerrilla tactics that cause misery to the hard-working public, disrupt businesses, interfere with emergency services, cost millions in taxpayers’ money and put lives at risk”. It is aimed at people like those behind the Just Stop Oil protests. My colleague Damien Gayle has been looking at what they have been doing, and why, and he has just made this video about their campaign. These are from Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader. And here is a senior Conservative also criticising the Queen’s speech for its failure to include measures that would help people through the cost of living crisis. Gavin Barwell was chief of staff to Theresa May when she was prime minister and is never shy about saying when he thinks Boris Johnson is making a mistake. The opening sentence of the Queen’s speech said: “Her Majesty’s government’s priority is to grow and strengthen the economy and help ease the cost of living for families.” But there is a growing chorus of criticism from people saying that there is little or nothing in the legislative proposals announced by the government that will address these two key priorities. Opposition politicians (see 12.25pm and 12.43pm, for example), trade unions (see 12.40pm) and thinktanks (see 12.52pm) have all been making this argument. The New Economics Foundation, another leftwing thinktank, has also made the same point. Miatta Fahnbulleh, its chief executive, said: Last week, voters sent a clear message to the government: you’re not doing enough to tackle the cost of living crisis. People have had enough of the government doing nothing whilst millions are forced to turn their heating off, and skip meals. Today’s Queen’s speech was a chance for the government to act – to tackle the cost of living crisis and truly level up the country. Not one that plays politics and stokes culture wars, without making any material difference to people’s lives. Here is the clip of Boris Johnson and Keir Starmer chatting on their way to listen to the Queen’s speech. The Beergate controversy does seem to be having a significant, but not catastrophic, impact on Keir Starmer’s poll ratings, new figures from YouGov suggest. But Starmer still has a clear lead over Boris Johnson on the best PM measure. Here are comments from two leftish thinktankers on the Queen’s speech. From Ian Mulheirn, head of policy at the Tony Blair Institute From Torsten Bell, head of the Resolution Foundation In a Twitter thread starting here, the Resolution Foundation has more on the econonomic problems facing the UK that it thinks the Queen’s speech is not addressing. Plaid Cymru has criticised the Queen’s speech. This is from Liz Saville Roberts, its leader at Westminster. This Queen’s speech was a disappointing series of platitudes by a government utterly detached from reality. This legislative programme will do nothing to address the worsening cost of living crisis and will only deepen divisions by persevering with an increasingly authoritarian agenda. Here is some trade union reaction to the Queen’s speech. Referring to the absense of an employment bill in the package, Frances O’Grady, the TUC general secretary, said: The prime minister promised to make Britain the best place in the world to work. But he has turned his back on working people. Today, bad bosses up and down the country will be celebrating. No employment bill means vital rights that ministers had promised – like default flexible working, fair tips and protection from pregnancy discrimination – risk being ditched for good. And it means no action on the scourge of insecure work and ending exploitative practices like zero-hours contracts and fire and rehire. This is from Sharon Graham, the Unite general secretary. Workers and communities are suffering. We are in the middle of a cost of living crisis and a recession is looming. So where is the programme to address these issues head on? Where are the laws to stop profiteering and prevent attacks on workers? Where is the help for the millions who are already faced with the shocking decision of whether to heat or eat? And these are from Christina McAnea, general secretary of Unison. These are from Caroline Lucas, the Green MP, on the Queen’s speech. This is from Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, on the Queen’s speech. This Queen’s speech does nothing to help the millions of families and pensioners facing soaring bills and eye-watering inflation. The Conservatives have failed to deliver a cut to VAT that would have saved families an average of £600, failed to help pensioners and failed to help the most vulnerable in our society. The Conservatives are continuing to neglect rural communities. There was nothing in these plans to support farmers on the brink, to tackle soaring ambulance waiting times and GP shortages, or to stop the dumping of filthy sewage into our river and seas. It shows a prime minister refusing to listen to the clear message sent by voters at last week’s local elections who are fed up of being taken for granted by this Conservative government. Last week it emerged that ministers have drawn up legislation that would give them power to abandon large parts of the Northern Ireland protocol. The bill would present this in terms of giving ministers powers to protect the Good Friday agreement. The bill was not referred to directly in the Queen’s speech, and the bill does not get an explicit mention in the 139-page briefing document released by the government explaining the measures in legislative programme. (It is not online yet, but I will post a link when it goes up.) But the Queen’s speech did implicitly refer to this legislation. The Prince of Wales said: The continued success and integrity of the whole of the United Kingdom is of paramount importance to Her Majesty’s government, including the internal economic bonds between all of its parts. The main unionist objection to the protocol is that it does disrupt those internal economic bonds - as was obvious from the moment Boris Johnson signed it. Charles also said: Her Majesty’s government will ensure the constitution is defended. Unionists argue that the protocol undermines the constitution; some of them even took the government to court on these grounds (so far unsuccessfully). In the briefing pack on the Queen’s speech the government says: As we have seen following the elections in Northern Ireland, the problems caused by the protocol continue to stand in the way of an Executive being formed. In the interests of all communities of Northern Ireland, the protocol needs to change. We urge our partners in the EU to work with us, with new imagination and flexibility, to deliver that. We will continue to talk with the EU but we will not let that stand in the way of protecting peace and stability in Northern Ireland. As any responsible government would, we will take the steps necessary to protect all dimensions of the Belfast (Good Friday) agreement and meet our obligations under the New Decade New Approach Deal to protect Northern Ireland’s place in the UK internal market. Here is a summary of what is in the Queen’s speech from my colleagues Jessica Elgot and Heather Stewart. And this is how it starts. Boris Johnson has pledged to ensure local people benefit from new housing developments and promised to overhaul human rights law, in a Queen’s speech designed to woo back disenchanted Conservative voters. Standing in for the Queen, Prince Charles announced plans for 38 new laws including a levelling-up bill giving local leaders powers to tackle decaying high streets. Local people will be given powers to shape planning decisions, in a pared-back set of changes aimed at avoiding the risk of infuriating voters in Tory heartlands by unleashing a building boom. And this is how Charles concluded. In this year of the Platinum Jubilee, I look forward to the celebrations taking place across the United Kingdom and throughout the Commonwealth, and to the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham this summer. MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS Estimates for the public services will be laid before you. MY LORDS AND MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS Other measures will be laid before you. I pray that the blessing of Almighty God may rest upon your counsels. Finally, some remaining measures. Her Majesty’s Government will introduce legislation to improve the regulation of social housing to strengthen the rights of tenants and ensure better quality, safer homes.. Legislation will also be introduced to ban conversion therapy. Proposals will be published to establish an independent regulator of English football. The government will defence the constitution, Charles says. Her Majesty’s Government will ensure the constitution is defended. Her Majesty’s Ministers will restore the balance of power between the legislature and the courts by introducing a Bill of Rights.. Legislation will prevent public bodies engaging in boycotts that undermine community cohesion. And now Northern Ireland. The continued success and integrity of the whole of the United Kingdom is of paramount importance to Her Majesty’s Government, including the internal economic bonds between all of its parts. Her Majesty’s Government will prioritise support for the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement and its institutions, including through legislation to address the legacy of the past. Charles addresses defence. Her Majesty’s Government will lead the way in championing security around the world. It will continue to invest in our gallant Armed Forces. Her Majesty’s Ministers will work closely with international partners to maintain a united NATO and address the most pressing global security challenges. Next come the economic crime bill, and the national security bill. A bill will be brought forward to further strengthen powers to tackle illicit finance, reduce economic crime and help businesses grow.. Measures will be introduced to support the security services and help them protect the United Kingdom. Charles turns to the public order bill briefed overnight. Her Majesty’s Government will protect the integrity of the United Kingdom’s borders and ensure the safety of its people. Her Majesty’s Ministers will take action to prevent dangerous and illegal Channel crossings and tackle the criminal gangs who profit from facilitating them. Legislation will be introduced to ensure the police have the powers to make the streets safer. Next comes the genetic technology (precision breeding) bill. Her Majesty’s Ministers will encourage agricultural and scientific innovation at home. Legislation will unlock the potential of new technologies to promote sustainable and efficient farming and food production. Charles turns to trade. Her Majesty’s Government will continue to champion international trade, delivering jobs across the country and growing the economy. Legislation will be introduced to enable the implementation of the United Kingdom’s first new Free Trade Agreements since leaving the European Union. From Andrew Fisher, who used to be Jeremy Corbyn’s head of policy Charles turns to the financial services bill and the data reform bill. New legislation will strengthen the United Kingdom’s financial services industry, ensuring that it continues to act in the interest of all people and communities. The United Kingdom’s data protection regime will be reformed. Now we’re on to Brexit. Her Majesty’s Government will continue to seize the opportunities of the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union, to support economic growth. Regulations on businesses will be repealed and reformed. A bill will enable law inherited from the European Union to be more easily amended [Brexit Freedoms Bill]. Public sector procurement will be simplified to provide new opportunities for small businesses. Education comes next, and a reference to the draft mental health act reform bill. Reforms to education will help every child fulfil their potential wherever they live, raising standards and improving the quality of schools and higher education. My Ministers will publish draft legislation to reform the Mental Health Act. Charles goes on: Her Majesty’s Government will establish the UK Infrastructure Bank in legislation, with objectives to support economic growth and the delivery of net zero. That is the UK infrastructure bank bill. Next Charles refers to the energy bill. Her Majesty’s Ministers will bring forward an Energy Bill to deliver the transition to cheaper, cleaner, and more secure energy. This will build on the success of the COP26 Summit in Glasgow last year. Draft legislation to promote competition, strengthen consumer rights and protect households and businesses will be published. Measures will also be published to create new competition rules for digital markets and the largest digital firms. Transport comes next. Her Majesty’s Government will improve transport across the United Kingdom, delivering safer, cleaner services and enabling more innovations. Legislation will be introduced to modernise rail services and improve reliability for passengers. That’s the transport bill. Charles turns to levelling up. A Bill will be brought forward to drive local growth, empowering local leaders to regenerate their areas, and ensuring everyone can share in the United Kingdom’s success. The planning system will be reformed to give residents more involvement in local development. This is a reference to the levelling up bill. He turns to the economy. Her Majesty’s Government will drive economic growth to improve living standards and fund sustainable investment in public services. This will be underpinned by a responsible approach to the public finances, reducing debt while reforming and cutting taxes. Her Majesty’s Ministers will support the Bank of England to return inflation to its target. The Prince of Wales is speaking. Her Majesty’s Government’s priority is to grow and strengthen the economy and help ease the cost of living for families. Her Majesty’s Government will level up opportunity in all parts of the country and support more people into work. My Ministers will continue to support the police to make the streets safer, and fund the National Health Service to reduce the COVID backlogs. In these challenging times, her Majesty’s Government will play a leading role in defending democracy and freedom across the world, including continuing to support the people of Ukraine. From the Tory MP Greg Hands MPs are now in the Lords for the speech. Boris Johnson and Keir Starmer are leading MPs into the Lords. From the TV feed, we can see them talking to each other, and smiling. It may not have been particularly sincere, but it did look amicable. Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May used to process together in virtual silence. Sarah Clarke, Black Rod, has just summoned MPs to attend the House of Lords. Labour says abandoning parts of the Northern Ireland protocol (see 11.20am) would start a trade war with Europe. This is from Jenny Chapman, Labour’s Brexit spokesperson. The government’s threat to tear up the protocol risks a trade war during a cost of living crisis. Instead of negotiating practical fixes that would benefit businesses and communities, the government plans to break the agreement they themselves negotiated and sold to the British public. Tensions are high in Northern Ireland while families across the country face rising prices and higher bills. There is no consensus to scrap the protocol in cabinet, let alone in Northern Ireland. The last thing the country needs is more instability and a damaging trade dispute with our nearest trading partners. This is from Caroline Lucas, the Green party MP, on the public order bill proposals briefed by the government overnight. Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Commons Speaker, is now processing into the Commons chamber before the state opening ceremony. The Irish prime minister, Micheál Martin, urged Boris Johnson in a phone call this morning not to take unilateral action over the Northern Ireland protocol. (See 10.26am.) Downing Street has just released its version of the call, and it makes it clear that Johnson refused to give Martin the assurance he wanted about not abandoning the protocol. A No 10 spokesperson said: Following last week’s Northern Ireland assembly elections, [Johnson and Martin] both agreed on the vital importance of restoring the devolved institutions, both the assembly and executive, as soon as possible. The prime minister said that the UK government would remain in close contact with the parties following initial engagement yesterday. The prime minister made clear that the situation in respect of the Northern Ireland protocol was now very serious. The balance of the Belfast (Good Friday) agreement was being undermined and the recent elections had further demonstrated that the protocol was not sustainable in its current form. Despite repeated efforts by the UK government over many months to fix the protocol, including those sections related to the movement of goods and governance, the European Commission had not taken the steps necessary to help address the economic and political disruption on the ground. The prime minister reiterated that the UK government would take action to protect peace and political stability in Northern Ireland if solutions could not be found. The Prince of Wales has now arrived at the Houses of Parliament before the state opening. As Caroline Davies reports, the Prince of Wales will be reading out the Queen’s speech on behalf of his mother. It will be the first time Charles has performed this role at the ceremony, and a harbinger of what we can expect at some point in the years ahead when he takes the throne. The Queen, who is 96, has only missed the state opening twice before, when she was pregnant with Prince Andrew and Prince Edward in 1959 and 1963 respectively. The Queen is understood to be watching the proceedings on television from Windsor Castle, PA Media reports. She will have her weekly phone audience with Boris Johnson on Wednesday. The regalia – the imperial state crown, the cap of maintenance and sword of state – were transported to the Palace of Westminster in three state limousines before the Queen’s speech, PA Media reports. In past years the symbolic items would have travelled in a carriage but this year vehicles are being used and a state limousine will also carry the royal party later. This is what Sarah Jones, the shadow policing minister, said about plans for the public order bill briefed before the Queen’s speech this morning. Home Office ministers should be asking themselves why they are taking no action to tackle the shameful collapse in prosecutions, put more rapists behind bars or crack down on criminal fraudsters scamming the vulnerable. After more than a decade of Tory government, victims of crime are being let down. The government is completely out of ideas, and it is communities across the country who are paying the price. And this is from Sam Grant, head of policy and campaigns at the human rights group Liberty. These rehashed measures to crack down on protest in today’s Queen’s speech are yet another power grab from a government determined to shut down accountability. Protest is a right, not a gift from the state – and measures like these are designed to stop ordinary people making their voices heard. Parliamentarians and the general public rejected these dangerous measures when they were first rushed through in the policing bill, but the government has refused to listen. From restrictions on protest to scrapping the Human Rights Act, this is all part of the government’s continued attempts to rewrite the rules so only they can win, and prevent ordinary people from having their say. There is no end to the ingenuity of the British tabloid press and, having campaigned aggressively for a fresh Durham police investigation into Beergate, this morning the Daily Mail has run a story criticising Keir Starmer for saying he will resign if said investigation shows he has broken the law. The Mail headline is based on comments from an unnamed government source, the digital minister Chris Philp and a barrister called Francis Hoar saying Starmer’s intervention amounts to putting the police under pressure. Rachael Venables from LBC points out the hypocrisy inherent in the paper’s approach. In an interview on the Today programme this morning Lord Macdonald, the former director of public prosecutions, said the claim that Starmer’s intervention would put undue pressure on the police was “wide of the mark”. He said: My experience of working with the police in very sensitive cases under full glare of public and press interest was that, very quickly, you find your focus taking over and, in a sense, a sort of bloody-mindedness creeps in: ‘This is my case and I’ll decide it, thank you very much, without any help from you.’ So, that sort of pressure actually becomes, in my experience, reinforcing of independence, which I’m sure is what we want. I don’t think Durham police will be troubled at all by that sort of aspect. And this is from Jonathan Jones, a former head of the government legal service, on the argument used by the barrister quoted in the Daily Mail splash. Micheál Martin, the taoiseach (Irish PM), has used a call with Boris Johnson this morning to urge him not to take “unilateral action” over the Northern Ireland protocol. According to a report in the Times this morning, the government is poised to announce that it will take unilateral action over the protocol, with legislation that would abolish large parts of it. The Times says: The foreign secretary has concluded that there is little point trying to reach a Brexit deal with the European Union and will move as soon as next week to scrap large parts of the Northern Ireland protocol in British law. Officials working for Liz Truss have drawn up draft legislation that would unilaterally remove the need for all checks on goods being sent from Britain for use in Northern Ireland. It would also allow businesses in the province to disregard EU rules and regulations and take away the power of the European court of justice to rule on issues relating to Northern Ireland. The paper said an announcement could come next Tuesday. In his interviews this morning Kit Malthouse, the policing minister, also said he did not think that Keir Starmer should have to resign if Durham police fined him for breaking lockdown rules. Asked whether Starmer was right to say yesterday he would quit if that happened, Malthouse replied: That’s a matter for him. Look, my view is that this was a very difficult situation with complicated rules that were often changing quite quickly. Mistakes were made and they’re acknowledged and fixed-penalty notices are paid. I don’t see why anybody, be they so high or so humble, should lose their job. Malthouse also said that, if Starmer were to resign, that would not mean Boris Johnson (who has already been fined for a breach of lockdown rules) would have to go too. Asked if Johnson would have to follow Starmer’s example, Malthouse replied: “Not necessarily, no.” Liz Truss is reportedly preparing draft legislation that would unilaterally scrap key parts of the Northern Ireland protocol, removing the need for checks on goods between Britain and Northern Ireland, my colleague Jessica Elgot reports. John Allan, the chairman of Tesco and a former president of the CBI, has joined those calling for a windfall tax on energy companies. Asked what he would like to see in the Queen’s speech, he told the Today programme this morning: First of all, I think action to help people cope with a very, very sharp increase in energy prices. It’s harder for people to mitigate energy than it is with food, and I think there’s an overwhelming case for a windfall tax on profits from those energy producers fed back to those most in need of help with energy prices. I think that would be the single biggest thing that could be done. A windfall tax on energy companies is the Labour party’s most distinctive policy proposal. The Liberal Democrats and the SNP also back the idea. The government is opposed, on the grounds that this might deter investment by the energy companies in the UK. But there have been hints that a U-turn might be possible. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, said last month that he would consider the case for a windfall tax if energy companies did not invest in the UK. And William Hague, the former Tory leader, recently said a tax on a genuine windfall was “not a crazy idea” and something Conservatives had done in the past. Good morning. It’s the Queen’s Speech, and overnight the government has flagged up measures that will be included in a new public order bill. My colleague Rajeev Syal has a preview here. Kit Malthouse, the policing minister, has been doing the morning interview round and he told BBC Breakfast this would allow the government to tackle “hooligan” protesters. He said: We have seen a number of very, very prolific, persistent offenders who decide to just flagrantly ignore the courts and so we’ll be bringing in a new serious disruption prevention order which we can place on them as individuals to deter them, if you like, from this kind of hooligan way of protesting. We believe that protest is fundamental to our democracy but it has to be balanced against the rights of others to go about their business, and indeed keeping us all safe. I’m afraid some of the tactics we’ve seen recently haven’t done that. If you think this sounds more like the kind of language you would hear at a Conservative party conference, than in a speech setting out legislative priorities for the whole of the nation for the next year, then you would not necessarily be wrong. Legislative programmes are inherently party political but, as Jim Pickard and George Parker report in the Financial Times, this one has gone through a particularly rigorous filtering process, with non-Tory measures removed. They attribute this to the influence of David Canzini, Boris Johnson’s newish deputy chief of staff, who has reportedly told ministerial aides to come up with more “wedge” issues that differentiate the Tories from Labour and the Lib Dems. The public order bill is a good example. The FT says that, as a result some measures that had widespread support, but that that were deemed too regulatory and consensual, and insufficiently Tory, have been dropped. It says: Legislation to improve UK auditing and corporate governance, provide statutory powers for a technology watchdog, and create a new football supervisory authority — all meant to enhance the operation of business or to enable fairer market conditions — have been dropped from the Queen’s Speech ... With the Bank of England warning last week that the UK is heading for recession, Canzini has told colleagues in recent days that Downing Street believes that “Conservative governments don’t legislate their way to economic growth”, said one official. The government has dropped plans for a bill which would have created a single agency to enforce employee rights and made flexible working the default option for staff ... One minister said that the aversion by some in Number 10 to new business regulation was part of a “bastard form of Thatcherism” which failed to recognise that good rules could help the operation of markets — for example by stopping corporate scandals. The FT quotes the Institute of Directors, the business group, as saying this approach is “disappointing”. Here is the agenda for the day. 11.30am: Prince Charles delivers the Queen’s Speech on behalf of his mother at the State Opening of Parliament. 12.30pm: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing. 2.30pm: MPs open the debate on the Queen’s Speech. Conservative MPs Graham Stuart and Fay Jones will start, proposing and seconding the loyal address, and they will be followed by Keir Starmer and then Boris Johnson. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include “Andrew” in it somewhere and I’m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can’t promise to do this for everyone.

Thursday’s result may have been foreseeable but it was devastating both for Labour and for the people who rely on us. In the aftermath, attention is understandably turning to whether we ran the right campaign, found the right soundbite, had the right leader and if the media was to blame. But the truth is, Labour has been losing support in our northern towns and coalfield communities for decades. From Bolsover to Clacton, people who feel deeply that Labour is part of their DNA couldn’t bring themselves to vote for us. This had been billed as the Brexit election, but it was always about so much more. There is a strong feeling in towns like mine that Labour stopped listening long ago and that we no longer have much understanding or care for the things that matter deeply to them or their families. The result last week has been a long time coming. But the signs have been there for just as long. When councils in Bolton and Hartlepool turned blue, and so many voters in Wigan, who had always rejected the far right, turned to Ukip it should have been a wake-up call. The smoke signals were going up long before the result in Blyth Valley came through but we couldn’t see them. Why? Because as a party we’ve lost touch with the day-to-day lived experience of many of the people we want to represent. Taken individually, so many of the policies in Labour’s manifesto were popular with the public. But, as a package, they failed to touch the sides of what people feel is really needed. In my town, Wigan, many people have less than £1 left at the end of the week. There is an overwhelming sense of anxiety and insecurity, with a safety net that feels frayed and weak. People struggle and make real sacrifices and they want things to improve, for them, for their children. They want to get on, and to get that support – a hand-up so they can take care of themselves. Romanticising the struggle deeply offends them and the message of solidarity is undermined by some policies that make little sense. Nationalising rail is a good, sound policy but should we have staked so much of our campaign on that policy when so many of the towns we lost have no train station and rely on buses anyway? Should we really be rejecting nuclear power when it is one of the best sources of good jobs outside London? What is the point of a minimum income guarantee if you have to stack shelves for the rest of your life and want something more, or a big offer on tuition fees if you can’t see a way of getting through college? If we are going to represent the country, we need to understand it, to see it as it really is, not how we might imagine it to be, and to live and experience things as the people we fight for do. We need to understand how we protect and preserve what matters, in communities north and south, towns and cities, Leave and Remain. What holds us together as a movement is our faith in each other, in our communities – as diverse and complex as we know them in reality to be. We have to turn away from a politics that is reductionist and binary and that can only push so many people further apart. To be in government is not to pick a side but to build a bridge and demonstrate what can unite. The job of the Labour leader now must be to reconcile urgently those parts of the country that want and need a Labour government, but have come adrift. This will not be easy. It will require listening, practical solutions and being rooted in our communities. It will take humility – and putting in the hard yards to acknowledge what we got wrong. But I am hopeful we can do it. While we lost, and lost badly, if we take the right lessons from defeat I know the Conservative party will have a lot to worry about. This was a clear victory for the Tories – but it was not won thanks to any real affection for Boris Johnson and what he stands for. He knows he is on borrowed time. An open, inclusive Labour party can provide people with a vision of a future that matters to them and that they have a stake in. We can be ambitious for our communities, to believe and to show that things can be better. We can give people something to vote for. And we can win. • Lisa Nandy is MP for Wigan"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"science/2018/may/16/weatherwatch-nimbus-b-satellite-was-almost-a-disaster","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-16T20:30:10Z","webTitle":"Weatherwatch: Nimbus-B satellite was almost a disaster","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/may/16/weatherwatch-nimbus-b-satellite-was-almost-a-disaster","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/may/16/weatherwatch-nimbus-b-satellite-was-almost-a-disaster","fields":{"headline":"Weatherwatch: Nimbus-B satellite was almost a disaster","bodyText":"Weather satellites transformed forecasting in the 1960s. By watching weather systems evolve in real time, meteorologists could predict storms and save lives. But 50 years ago, a nuclear-powered weather satellite threatened disaster. The Nimbus-B, launched on 18 May 1968, was to be the third in its series. The launch went terribly wrong. An installation fault caused the control system to go haywire, and the rocket carrying Nimbus-B veered in the wrong direction. The satellite had nuclear power packs filled with radioactive plutonium; if Nimbus-B broke up in the atmosphere, it could spread contamination over a wide area. Mission control ordered the rocket to self-destruct, and the flight ended after two minutes with Nimbus-B plunging into the Pacific less than 100 miles from Los Angeles. A huge recovery operation was launched to retrieve the dangerous, and extremely valuable, nuclear power packs. Six months later, divers recovered the corroded remains of Nimbus from the sea bed. The intact nuclear power packs were refurbished and launched on Nimbus-3. Modern weather satellites rely purely on solar arrays for their electricity.

You can find a summary of where things stand here. Johnson set to demand action on Ukrainian grain at G7 UK prime minister Boris Johnson will use Monday’s session at the G7 summit in Germany to call for urgent action to help get vital grain supplies out of Ukraine’s blockaded ports to support the country’s economy and alleviate shortages around the world, PA reports. The blockade of major Ukrainian ports such as Odesa, attacks on farms and warehouses and the wider impact of the Russian invasion have all added to the problems facing food from the country reaching the global market. Ukraine previously supplied 10% of the world’s wheat, up to 17% of the world’s maize and half of the world’s sunflower oil. Around 25 million tonnes of corn and wheat is currently at risk of rotting in Ukrainian silos. Mr Johnson will call for an international solution to the crisis, including finding overland routes for grain supplies to beat the Russian blockade, with 10 million in materials and equipment to repair damaged rail infrastructure. The UK has also been urging Turkey, which controls access to the Black Sea, to do more to get grain supplies out by ship. The prime minister will tell G7 leaders on Monday: “Putin’s actions in Ukraine are creating terrible aftershocks across the world, driving up energy and food prices as millions of people are on the brink of famine. Only Putin can end this needless and futile war. “But global leaders need to come together and apply their combined economic and political heft to help Ukraine and make life easier for households across the world. Nothing should be off the table.” New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern has turned down a meeting with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy on her trip to Europe, citing scheduling issues. Ardern is currently en route to the Nato leaders’ summit in Madrid, Spain. Deputy prime minister Grant Robertson said the prime minister was invited to Ukraine to meet with Zelenskiy, but had declined. “I understand that there was an invitation but it came quite late in the day and, unfortunately, the prime minister’s programme in Europe and indeed in Australia, where she’s leading a trade mission, was already set,” Robertson said in a radio interview with AM on Monday. Robertson said Ardern would attempt to speak to the president by phone. “I know she’s going to be attempting to speak to president Zelenskiy directly to continue to show New Zealand’s support for the people of Ukraine but, unfortunately, that timing didn’t quite work out.” This trip is Ardern’s first to Europe since the Covid-19 pandemic began. She is pushing to finalise a free trade agreement with the EU, and has also made plans to visit prime minister Boris Johnson in the UK. Putin to make first foreign trips since launching Ukraine war Vladimir Putin will visit two small former Soviet states in central Asia this week, Russian state television reported on Sunday, in what would be the Russian leader’s first known trip abroad since ordering the invasion of Ukraine. Pavel Zarubin, the Kremlin correspondent of the Rossiya 1 state television station, said Putin would visit Tajikistan and Turkmenistan and then meet Indonesian president Joko Widodo for talks in Moscow. In Dushanbe, Putin will meet Tajik president Imomali Rakhmon, a close Russian ally and the longest-serving ruler of a former Soviet state. In Ashgabat, he will attend a summit of Caspian nations including the leaders of Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Iran and Turkmenistan, Zarubin said. Putin also plans to visit the Belarus city of Grodno on 30 June and 1 July to take part in a forum with Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko, RIA news agency cited Valentina Matviyenko, the speaker of Russia’s upper chamber of parliament, as telling Belarus television on Sunday. Putin’s last known trip outside Russia was a visit to the Beijing in early February, where he and Chinese president Xi Jinping unveiled a “no limits” friendship treaty hours before both attended the opening ceremony of the Olympic Winter Games. It’s 1am in Kyiv. Here’s where things stand: France has become the latest country to reconsider its energy options because of the war in Ukraine, announcing Sunday it was looking into reopening a recently closed coal-fired power station. The energy transition ministry said it was considering reopening the station at Saint-Avold in eastern France this winter, “given the situation in Ukraine” and the effect it was having on the energy markets. In a video address to Belarusians, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged Belarusians to stand in solidarity with Ukraine. “Russian leadership wants to drag you into the Ukraine-Russian war because it doesn’t care about your lives. But you aren’t slaves and can decide your destiny yourself,” Zelenskiy said. The UN Human Rights division in Ukraine said on Sunday that since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February, it has “received hundreds of allegations of torture and ill-treatment, including conflict-related sexual violence.” “People were kept tied and blindfolded for several days, beaten, subjected to mock executions, put in a closed metal box, forced to sing or shout glorifying slogans, provided with no or scarce food or water, and held in overcrowded rooms with no sanitation,” the Ukrainians UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission said. Ukrainian forces have attacked a drilling platform in the Black Sea owned by a Crimean oil and gas company, Russian Tass news agency cited local officials as saying on Sunday, the second strike in a week. The platform is operated by Chernomorneftegaz, which Russian-backed officials seized from Ukraine’s national gas operator Naftogaz as part of Moscow’s annexation of the peninsula in 2014. Canada deployed two warships to the Baltic Sea and north Atlantic on Sunday, joining a pair of frigates already in the region in attempts to reinforce Nato’s eastern flank in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Her Majesty’s Canadian Ships (HMCS) Kingston and Summerside will be on a four-month deployment as part of “deterrence measures in central and eastern Europe” launched in 2014 after Moscow annexed Crimea, the Canadian navy said in a statement. That’s it from me, Maya Yang, as I hand the blog over to my colleagues in Australia who will bring you the latest updates. Thank you. Video has emerged of the ruins of a kindergarten after Russian missiles targeted the area around it this morning in Kyiv. According to Kyiv’s mayor Vitali Klitschko, two residential buildings had been hit. One man was killed and six people, including a woman from Russia, were taken to the hospital. A seven-year old girl was rescued from rubble. More residents could be trapped under rubble as rescue efforts get underway, Klitschko said. France has become the latest country to reconsider its energy options because of the war in Ukraine, announcing Sunday it was looking into reopening a recently closed coal-fired power station. Agence France-Presse reports: The energy transition ministry said it was considering reopening the station at Saint-Avold in eastern France this winter, “given the situation in Ukraine” and the effect it was having on the energy markets. “We are keeping open the possibility of being able to put the Saint-Avold station back in action for a few hours more if we need it next winter,” said a ministry statement, confirming a report on RTL radio. But France would still be producing less than one percent of its electricity through coal power, and no Russian coal would be used, the statement added. President Emmanuel Macron’s commitment to eventually shut all France’s coal-fired stations remained unchanged, the ministry statement said. Saint-Avold was only closed on March 31, and the only coal-fired power station still operating in France is in Cordemais, in the west of the country. Most of France’s electricity production comes from nuclear power: 67 percent in 2020. In the same year, coal only accounted for 0.3 percent. Austria, Germany and the Netherlands have all announced recently that they would be making greater use of coal for their energy needs because of the effects of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The war there has sent global energy prices soaring and raised the prospect of shortages if supplies are cut off. Russian energy giant Gazprom has already stopped deliveries to a number of European countries, including Poland, Bulgaria, Finland and the Netherlands. But the shift back towards fossil fuels has caused alarm in the European Commission, and among environmental campaigners. They point to the risk that the European Union will miss its targets for cutting back on polluting energy sources, and potentially disastrous consequences for the climate. In a video address to Belarussians, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged Belarussians to stand in solidarity with Ukraine. “Russian leadership wants to drag you into the Ukraine-Russian war because it doesn’t care about your lives. But you aren’t slaves and can decide your destiny yourself,” Zelenskiy said. His address comes amid growing concerns that Belarus may invade Ukraine on Russia’s side. Earlier this week, Russia announced that it will deliver missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads to Belarus in the coming months, Russian President Vladimir Putin has said as he received Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko. Putin has several times referred to nuclear weapons since his country launched a military operation in Ukraine on 24 February, in what the west has seen as a warning not to intervene. Lukashenko said last month that his country had bought Iskander nuclear-capable missiles and S-400 anti-aircraft anti-missile systems from Russia. In a gathering on Sunday, G7 leaders on Sunday joked whether it would be advisable to remove their suit jackets in order to stand up to the “formidable” and “tough” image of Russian president Vladimir Putin. “We all have to show that we’re tougher than Putin,” said UK prime minister Boris Johnson. In response, Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau said, “We’re going to get the bare-chested horseback riding display.” Ukrainian president Vladymyr Zelenskiy is due to address G7 leaders via video conference in the coming days as he attempts to solidify increased Western support against the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The UN Human Rights division in Ukraine said on Sunday that since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February, it has “received hundreds of allegations of torture and ill-treatment, including conflict-related sexual violence.” “People were kept tied and blindfolded for several days, beaten, subjected to mock executions, put in a closed metal box, forced to sing or shout glorifying slogans, provided with no or scarce food or water, and held in overcrowded rooms with no sanitation,” the Ukrainians UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission said. It went on to add, “We have also documented cases when people were tortured to death.” Ukrainian firefighters respond to an early morning missile strike by Russia on a residential complex in central Kyiv – Agence France-Presse video: More than 4,500 buildings have been destroyed in the Kharkiv region since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February, Nexta reports. Ukrainian forces have attacked a drilling platform in the Black Sea owned by a Crimean oil and gas company, Russian Tass news agency cited local officials as saying on Sunday, the second strike in a week. Reuters reports: The platform is operated by Chernomorneftegaz, which Russian-backed officials seized from Ukraine’s national gas operator Naftogaz as part of Moscow’s annexation of the peninsula in 2014. “It’s shelling by the armed forces of Ukraine, there are no casualties,” Tass cited a member of Crimea’s emergency services as saying. It gave no further details. Last Monday Crimean officials said three people were wounded with seven missing after a Ukrainian strike that forced the suspension of work on three platforms. Chernomorneftegaz is under US and European Union sanctions. Canada deployed two warships to the Baltic Sea and north Atlantic on Sunday, joining a pair of frigates already in the region in attempts to reinforce Nato’s eastern flank in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Her Majesty’s Canadian Ships (HMCS) Kingston and Summerside will be on a four-month deployment as part of “deterrence measures in central and eastern Europe” launched in 2014 after Moscow annexed Crimea, the Canadian navy said in a statement. Through October, the ships will participate in naval mine-sweeping exercises and maintain a “high readiness” allowing them to “quickly and effectively respond in support of any Nato operations”, it added. HMCS Halifax and Montreal are scheduled to return to port in July from Operation Reassurance – which is currently Canada’s largest deployment abroad. The mission also includes roughly 700 Canadian troops in Latvia with artillery and electronic warfare capabilities, as well as several military aircraft. Responding to the Russian missiles in Kyiv which left one person dead and six injured, Andriy Yermak, head of the president’s administration, said: “The Russians hit Kyiv again. Missiles damaged an apartment building and a kindergarten.” The deputy mayor, Mykola Povoroznyk, said explosions heard later in other parts if Kyiv were air defences destroying further incoming missiles, Reuters reports. The RIA agency quoted a pro-Russian separatist official as saying separatist forces had evacuated more than 250 people, including children, on Sunday from Sievierodonetsk’s Azot chemical plant. The plant’s surrounding industrial area was the last part of Sievierodonetsk held by Ukrainian forces. Russia’s Tass news agency quoted the same official as saying forces were advancing on Lysychansk across the river from Sievierodonetsk. Lysychansk is now the last major city held by Ukraine in Luhansk, Reuters reports. Ukrainian folk band DakhaBrakha and Eurovision 2016 winner Jamala performed together on Glastonbury’s Pyramid stage, sharing a message to “stop Putin”. Jamala won the Eurovision Song Contest in 2016, representing Ukraine, and was welcomed on stage as DakhaBrakha’s special guest for the performance on Sunday afternoon. Jamala, full name Susana Alimivna Jamaladinova, told the PA news agency after the set: “We can stop this evil only if we are united, only if we are together. “We are fighting for freedom, for equality … it’s my first time in Glastonbury and I see that freedom here. “It’s a treasure to be human and to express yourself, and you even don’t know how important it is.” On a weekend when Kyiv experienced its first Russian bombing in weeks, part of DakhaBrakha’s act featured an animation on a screen showing birds transforming into fighter jets. Other images included Ukrainian tractors dragging Russian tanks, and crowds marching towards armoured vehicles adorned with the letter Z, a Russian pro-war symbol. A leading historian of the outbreak of the first world war has urged admirers of his work among Germany’s political elite to stop drawing comparisons to the conflict in Ukraine, warning any parallels between 1914 and 2022 are flawed. Cambridge academic Christopher Clark’s account of the complex logic behind each of the main actors’ entry into the global conflict, The Sleepwalkers: How Europe Went to War in 1914, was an international bestseller after its publication in 2013. The book struck a particular chord in Germany, where it provided a counterview to a prevailing narrative of national war guilt and has sold more than 350,000 copies. Kyiv’s deputy mayor, Mykola Povoroznyk, has an update on the victims of the attack on a nine-storey residential block in the city. He confirmed one person was killed and at least six wounded and said the missile struck near the site of a similar attack in late April. About 400 metres away, a Reuters photographer saw a large fresh crater by the playground of a private kindergarten that had smashed windows. Some privately held storage garages in the area were completely destroyed. Blasts were heard in other parts of Kyiv on Sunday, but these were the sound of air defence destroying other incoming strikes, the deputy mayor said on national television. There was no immediate comment from Moscow, which denies targeting civilians. A Ukrainian air force spokesperson said between four and six long-range missiles were fired on Sunday from Russian bombers more than a thousand kilometres away in the southern Russian region of Astrakhan that looks out on to the Caspian Sea. One man was killed and six others injured as Kyiv came under attack for the first time since 5 June. Russian missiles struck residential buildings and a Kindergarten in the Shevchenkivskyi district of the capital. Among the injured were a seven-year-old girl. There are unconfirmed reports that her father was killed in the attack. A Russian woman was also among the injured. Another civilian was killed in a missile attack on Cherkasy south-east of the capital. A bridge over the Dnipro river was also hit. Both the attacks on Kyiv and Cherkasy are being seen message of defiance by Russia to G7 leaders gathering at a summit in Bavaria, Germany. Russia said it hit military targets in Chernihiv, Zhytomyr and Lviv. Joe Biden condemned the Russian attacks as “more barbarism”. Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said they showed the importance of G7 unity. Ukraine has called for more aggressive sanctions against Russia and naval support. Andriy Yermak, the head of office to President Zelenskiy, said the G7 should respond to the attacks with a ban on Russia gas and naval help in the Black Sea. Members of the G7 have confirmed a ban on imports of Russian gold. The move by Britain, the United States, Japan and Canada is part of efforts to tighten the sanctions squeeze on Moscow. Gold exports were worth $15.2bn to Russia in 2021, and their importance has increased since Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. The UK and France have agreed to provide more support for Ukraine, according to Downing Street. Leaders of the G7 have spoken of their solidarity for Ukraine. “We have to stay together,” Joe Biden said. G7 leaders also mocked Vladimir Putin’s tough-man image during a summit lunch. They joked about whether they should go bare-chested, with Boris Johnson suggesting they needed to show their “pecs”. Justin Trudeau said:“We’re going to get the bare-chested horseback riding display.” Russian forces are trying to cut off the strategic twin city of Lysychansk in eastern Ukraine, having reduced Sievierodonetsk to rubble. Lysychansk is set to become the next main focus of fighting, as Moscow has launched massive artillery bombardments and airstrikes on areas far from the heart of the eastern battles. Ukraine called its retreat from Sievierodonetsk a “tactical withdrawal” to fight from higher ground in Lysychansk on the opposite bank of the Siverskyi Donets river. Russian news footage has shown the defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, visiting troops involved in the Ukraine war. It is unclear if he visited Ukrainian territory, but the footage appeared to confirm that the colonel general Gennady Zhidko is now commanding troops in Ukraine. The mayors of several European capitals have been duped into holding video calls with a deepfake of their counterpart in Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko. The mayor of Berlin, Franziska Giffey, took part in a scheduled call on the Webex video conferencing platform on Friday with a person she said looked and sounded like Klitschko. “There were no signs that the video conference call wasn’t being held with a real person,” her office said in a statement. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said on Saturday that Ukraine would win back all the cities it has lost to Russia, including Sievierodonetsk. “All our cities – Sievierodonetsk, Donetsk, Luhansk – we’ll get them all back,” he said in a late-night video address. Zelenskiy also admitted that the war was becoming difficult to handle emotionally. Russian missiles struck near the central Ukrainian city of Cherkasy on Sunday, killing one person and hitting a bridge that helps connect western regions with eastern battle zones, according to Reuters citing Ukrainian officials. Cherkasy has been largely untouched by bombardment since the war started in February, but Russia has stepped up missile attacks across Ukraine this weekend. “Today, the enemy launched missile attacks on the Cherkasy region. There are 2 strikes near the regional centre. One dead and five wounded. Infrastructure damaged,” said regional governor Ihor Taburets on the Telegram app. He did not provide further details, but a presidential adviser told Reuters one of the missiles targeted a bridge across the Dnipro river. “They are trying to limit the transfer of our reserves and western weapons to the east,” adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said in a message. “It means that these kinds of transfers are going well and causing them major issues.” He did not say how damaged the bridge was. Reuters could not independently confirm the report. Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, says the Russia’s missile strikes against the city destroyed more than 220 apartments. He also said the timing of the attack appeared to be “symbolic”. Meanwhile, the G7 partners and spouses have gone for an alpine hike complete with nordic ski poles. Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, says attacks by Russia on residential buildings in Kyiv show the importance of international unity in supporting Ukraine, AP reports. Speaking after hosting the first session of the G7 summit, Scholz emphasised the unity of G7 on Ukraine. He said: We can say for sure that Putin did not reckon with this and it is still giving him a headache — the great international support for Ukraine but of course also the Ukrainians’ courage and bravery in defending their own country. That this is a brutal war that Putin is waging, we have now once again seen with rocket attacks on houses in Kyiv — that shows it is right that we stand together and support Ukrainians to defend their country, their democracy, their freedom of self-determination. Scholz said that he and US President Joe Biden were of one mind about what needs to be done. Scholz, who has faced criticism at home and abroad for perceived reluctance to send Ukraine heavy weapons, said that “Germany and the US will always act together when it comes to questions of Ukraine’s security.” Thousands of anti-war protesters people have taken to the streets of Madrid ahead of a Nato summit later this week. Amid tight security, leaders of the member countries will meet in Madrid between 29-30 June as the organisation faces the unprecedented challenge of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Nato is expected to consider the bid, opposed by alliance-member Turkey, for Finland and Sweden to join. The Nordic nations applied in the wake of the Russian assault on Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin calls the war a special military operation he says in part responds to the accession to NATO of other countries near post-Soviet Russia’s borders since the 1990s. “Tanks yes, but of beer with tapas,” sang demonstrators, who claimed an increase in defence spending in Europe urged by Nato was a threat to peace. “I am fed up (with) this business of arms and killing people. The solution they propose is more arms and wars and we always pay for it. So, no Nato, no bases, let the Americans go and leave us alone without wars and weapons,” said Concha Hoyos, a retired Madrid resident, told Reuters. Another protester, Jaled, 29, said Nato was not the solution to the war in Ukraine. Organisers claimed 5,000 people joined the march, but authorities in Madrid put the number at 2,200. Spain’s Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares said in a newspaper interview published on Sunday that the summit would also focus on the threat from Europe’s southern flank in Africa, in which he said Russia posed a threat to Europe. “The foreign ministers’ dinner on the 29th will be centred on the southern flank,” he told El Pais newspaper. Andriy Yermak, the head of office to Presisent Zelenksiy, has called on the G7 to respond to Russia’s missile attacks on Kyiv with more aggressive sanctions. He tweeted that Russian gas as well as gold should be banned. Yermak also called for naval assistance in the Black Sea, to help lift Russia grip on Ukraine’s ports. Jackets stayed on for the G7 family photo, but ties were off. World leaders mocked Vladimir Putin’s tough-man image at a G7 lunch, joking about whether they should strip down to shirtsleeves - or even less, AFP reports. “Jackets on? Jackets off? Do we take our coats off?” Boris Johnson asked as he sat down at the table in Bavaria’s picturesque Elmau Castle, where Chancellor Olaf Scholz was hosting the summit of seven powerful democracies. The leaders - from Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United States and also the European Union - pondered the dilemma. Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, suggested “let’s wait” for the official picture before disrobing, but then Johnson quipped “we have to show that we’re tougher than Putin” and the joke kept rolling. “We’re going to get the bare-chested horseback riding display,” Trudeau said, referring to Putin’s infamous 2009 photo-op of himself riding shirtless on a horse. “Horseback riding is the best,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said, without apparently weighing in on the clothing issue itself. The leaders posed - jackets on - for photos before reporters were hustled out of the room, leaving the sartorial debate behind closed doors. Boris Johnson said he would be “honoured” to host Volodymyr Zelenskiy for a state visit if the Ukrainian president felt able to leave his war-torn country, PA reports. The prime minister stressed the most important thing now for Ukraine was for western leaders at the G7 summit in Germany to remain united in support of President Zelensky. “I think that Volodymyr Zelenskiy has done an absolutely amazing job of leading his country and leading world opinion in an appalling time,” Johnson told ITV News at the summit in Bavaria. Asked if he wanted to offer the Ukrainian leader a state visit, Johnson said: If he ever becomes free to leave and it makes sense for him to leave Ukraine, then obviously the UK would be only too honoured to host him. But the most important thing is for us to continue to be united here at the G7. And we are. The Sunday Times reported that ministers were considering offering Zelensky a state visit, including a meeting with the Queen. Tory officials would also like him to address the party’s conference in October, possibly via a video link, the newspaper reported. Zelenskiy, who will address G7 leaders by video link on Monday, pleaded for more air defence support from western allies. After dozens of Russian missiles targeted Ukrainian towns and cities, he used his nightly address to say: This confirms that sanctions packages against Russia are not enough, that Ukraine needs more armed assistance, and that air defence systems - the modern systems that our partners have - should be not in training areas or storage facilities, but in Ukraine, where they are now needed. “Needed more than anywhere else in the world. France on Sunday urged oil producers to cap prices to help put the squeeze on Russia, AFP reports. Paris backs a US proposal for a maximum oil price, but the French presidency said that “it would be much more powerful if it came from the producing countries.” To make such a measure work, it was “necessary to get into a discussion with OPEC+ and with the world’s oil producers,” said the source, referring to the 23-country group. The United States had suggested a price cap decided by consuming countries, a proposal that is due to be discussed by G7 leaders meeting in the Bavarian Alps on Sunday. But Germany believes that the measure would be too difficult to put in place. A senior German official said “we are still intensively discussing how this would work and how that can fit in with the American, British, European and Japanese sanction regimes.” EU President Charles Michel also said discussions were ongoing but “we want to go more into the details”. “We want to make sure that ... the goal is to target Russia and not to make our life more difficult and more complex,” he said. Russian missiles struck a residential building and the compound of a kindergarten in central Kyiv on Sunday, killing one person and wounding five more, according to a Reuters update. Firefighters put out a fire in a badly damaged nine-storey residential building in the central Shevchenkivskiy district, the emergency services said. Debris was strewn over parked cars outside a smouldering building with a crater in its roof. “They (rescuers) have pulled out a seven-year-old girl. She is alive. Now they’re trying to rescue her mother,” Kyiv’s mayor Vitali Klitschko said “There are people under the rubble,” Klitschko said on the Telegram messaging app. He added that several people had already been hospitalised. At another site about 400 metres away, a Reuters photographer saw a large blast crater by a playground in a private kindergarten that had smashed windows. Some privately-held storage garages in the area were completely destroyed. Russia’s defence ministry said it had used high-precision weapons to strike Ukrainian army training centres in the regions of Chernihiv, Zhytomyr and Lviv, an apparent reference to strikes reported by Ukraine on Saturday. There was no immediate comment about Sunday’s strikes on Kyiv. Moscow denies targeting civilians. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba called on Group of Seven countries holding a three-day summit in Germany to impose further sanctions on Moscow and to provide more heavy weapons. A Ukrainian air force spokesperson said between four to six long-range missiles were fired from Russian bombers more than a thousand kilometres away in the southern Russian region of Astrakhan that looks out onto the Caspian Sea. He said some of the incoming missiles were shot down by Ukrainian air defences. Ukraine’s police chief Ihor Klymenko said on national television that five people had been wounded. Police later confirmed that one person had died. Kyiv has come under attack for the first time since 5 June, with Russian missiles striking at residential buildings and a Kindergarten in the Shevchenkivskyi district of the capital. At least five people were injured including a seven-year-old girl. There are unconfirmed reports that her father was killed in the attack. A Russian woman was among the injured. Later there were further reports of attacks on the outskirts of Kyiv and in Cherkasy south-east of the capital. The attacks are being seen as a defiant signal by Russia to G7 leaders gathering at a summit in Bavaria. Russia said it hit military targets in Chernihiv, Zhytomyr and Lviv. Members of the G7 have confirmed a ban on imports of Russian gold. The move by Britain, the United States, Japan and Canada is part of efforts to tighten the sanctions squeeze on Moscow. Gold exports were worth $15.2bn to Russia in 2021, and their importance has increased since Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. The UK and France have agreed to provide more support for Ukraine, according to Downing Street.

Zelenskiy also admitted that the war was becoming difficult to emotionally handle. The UK and France have agreed to provide more support for Ukraine in its war with Russia, Boris Johnson’s office said on Sunday as the leaders met on the sidelines of the G7 summit. “They agreed this is a critical moment for the course of the conflict, and there is an opportunity to turn the tide in the war,” a Downing Street spokesperson said in a statement. Both men “stressed the need to support Ukraine to strengthen their hand in both the war and any future negotiations. President Macron praised the Prime Minister’s ongoing military support to Ukraine and the leaders agreed to step up this work,” the spokesperson said. A French presidency official said France backs banning Russian gold exports. The official said Paris was not opposed to a cap on Russian oil prices, but wanted the G7 to discuss a price shield that would cap oil and gas prices to rein in inflation. The official added that the G7 were fully united in intensifying their support for Ukraine after the intensification of the conflict in recent days. Ukraine fears Russia could attack Kyiv throughout the day. Russia’s defence ministry said on Sunday it had used high-precision weapons to strike Ukrainian army training centres in the Chernihiv, Zhytomyr and Lviv regions of Ukraine, Russian news agencies reported, Reuters reports. Earlier on Sunday Ukraine had said that Russian missiles struck the Ukrainian capital Kyiv. Meanwhile, Russia’s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov has accused Ukraine of trying to cancel its Russian history. The Russian embassy in London tweeted Lavrov saying that Ukraine has no history at all without Russia. US President Joe Biden on Sunday praised Germany’s Chancellor Olaf Scholz for his leadership in the wake of Russia’s war against Ukraine and urged the West to stay united, AFP reports. “We have to stay together,” Biden told Scholz at a meeting ahead of the G7 summit in the German Alps. Russian President Vladimir Putin had been hoping “that somehow NATO and the G7 would splinter,” Biden said. “But we haven’t and we’re not going to.” Biden met his German host in the picturesque Elmau Castle where the G7 - Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States - was holding a three-day summit dominated by the crisis in Ukraine. Biden praised Scholz’s leadership as current chair of the G7 at a time of upheaval in Europe triggered by Russia’s war and subsequent global economic fallout. “I want to compliment you for stepping up as you did when you became chancellor” and “the way you had a great impact on the rest of Europe to move, particularly relating to Ukraine,” Biden told Scholz. The 79-year-old Democrat also fondly recalled his skiing days, telling Scholz that the Alpine setting was “beautiful.” A senior US official said Washington has been “investing very heavily” in the relationship with Germany since Biden took office almost two and a half years ago. Their talks were “a good opportunity to affirm the deep and enduring ties between our two countries. In terms of the meeting agenda, expect that Russia and Ukraine are going to be at the top of the list, including our continued close coordination on the political and diplomatic front,” the official said. The BBC’s Myroslava Petsa puts today’s missile strikes against Kyiv in context. Meanwhile, at the G7 summit in Bavaria: Speaking at the G7 summit in Germany, Boris Johnson stressed the need for continued unity in response to the war in Ukraine. He said: “Realistically there is going to be fatigue in populations and politicians.” Asked if he was worried about that support fracturing, the prime minister said: I think the pressure is there and the anxiety is there, we’ve got to be honest about that. But the most incredible thing about the way the West has responded to the invasion of Ukraine by Putin has been the unity - Nato has been solid, the G7 has been solid and we continue to be solid. But in order to protect that unity, in order to make it work, we’ve got to have really, really honest discussions about the implications of what’s going on, the pressures that individual friends and partners are feeling, that populations are feeling - whether it’s on the costs of their energy or food or whatever. Ahead of a meeting with Emmanuel Macron, Boris Johnson was asked whether France and Germany are doing enough over Ukraine. In his response, Johnson focused on the German response without mentioning France. Just look at what the Germans alone have done. I never believed in my lifetime that I would see a German Chancellor stepping up in the way that Olaf Scholz has and sending weaponry to help the Ukrainians to to protect themselves. He’s made huge, huge strides. We have 4% of our gas comes from Russia, in Germany, it’s 40%. They’re facing real, real pressures, they’re having to source energy from elsewhere. But they’re doing it. They’re making the effort. They’re making the sacrifice. That’s because they see that the price of freedom is worth paying. This is something that it’s worth us standing up for together. And that is the principle that a free, independent sovereign country like Ukraine should not be violently invaded and should not have its boundaries changed by force. And the consequences of what’s happening for the world are tough, but the price of backing down, the price of allowing Putin to succeed , to hack off huge parts of Ukraine, to continue with his programme of conquest, that price will be far, far higher and everybody here understands that. Kyiv was hit by four Russian missile strikes early on Sunday morning for the first time in three weeks, during which life had been slowly returning to the Ukrainian capital in the relative calm. Columns of smoke rose over the central Shevchenkivskyi district, home to a cluster of universities, restaurants and art galleries at 6.22am. Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said two residential buildings had been hit in what he called an attempt to “intimidate Ukrainians” before a Nato summit in Madrid beginning on Tuesday. Around 11am, there were at least several unconfirmed reports of two more explosions in Kyiv. Read the full story here: A price cap on Russian oil, deferral of climate change commitments, a potential famine in Africa and the further supply of weapons to Ukraine are to crowd into a meeting of G7 world leaders over the next three days held against the backdrop of the biggest geopolitical crisis since 1945. The agenda reveals how the world has been turned upside down since leaders of the industrialised nations last met in Cornwall a year ago in a summit chaired by Britain, largely to focus on the threat posed by China. Before the summit in Germany, Boris Johnson issued a warning for the west not to show war fatigue, a point that will be echoed when the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, addresses the meeting by video link. He is expected to emphasise the difficulties his troops are facing in eastern Ukraine as well as the need for heavier long-range weapons. Read the full story here: Anton Gerashchenko, an advisor to Ukraine’s minister of internal affairs, confirms that one of those injured in the missile strike against an apartment block in Kyiv was a Russian woman. “Russians shoot Russians,” he tweeted. Ukrain’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said G7 countries must respond to new missile strikes against Ukraine on Sunday by imposing further sanctions on Russia and providing more heavy weapons to Ukraine. Members of the G7 have confirmed a ban on imports of Russian gold at the start of their summit in the Bavarian Alps, Reuters reports. The move by Britain, the United States, Japan and Canada is part of efforts to tighten the sanctions squeeze on Moscow. Boris Johnson said in a statement: The measures we have announced today will directly hit Russian oligarchs and strike at the heart of Putin’s war machine. “We need to starve the Putin regime of its funding. The UK and our allies are doing just that. A senior US administration representative said the G7 would make an official announcement on the gold import ban on Tuesday. “This is a key export, a key source of revenue for Russia in terms of their ability to transact with the global financial system,” the US official said. Russian gold exports were worth £12.6bn ($15.45bn) last year and wealthy Russians have been buying bullion to reduce the financial impact of Western sanctions, the British government said. As well as the gold import ban, G7 leaders were also having “really constructive” talks on a possible price cap on Russian oil imports, a German government source said. Explosions were heard in the central Ukrainian city of Cherkasy on Sunday, regional governor Oleksandr Skichko said on the Telegram app, according to Reuters. He did not give further details. Cherkasy, which is 200km south-east of Kyiv, has been largely untouched by bombardment since Russia invaded Ukraine in February. Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, says the EU will “stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes”. Boris Johnson, who is also in Bavaria for the G7 summit made a similar statement of solidarity with Ukraine. There are several unconfirmed reports of more explosions in Kyiv. A Reuters reporter heard two explosions in the southern outskirts of the capital. Carl Bildt, Sweden’s former prime minister and co-chair of the European Council on Foreign Relations, sees this morning’s attack as an escalation of the conflict and a signal to today’s G7 summit in Bavaria. One person was killed in the Russian missile attack on Kyiv, according to an unconfirmed update from Iuliia Mendel, a former presidential spokesperson. The Ukraine MP, Lesia Vaylenko, said the victim was the father of a seven-year-old girl who was injured in the attack. Analysts have been examining Russian news footage of defence minister Sergei Shoigu’s troop visit to try work out who is now in command of Russian forces. Rob Lee of the Foreign Policy Research Institute tweets: “It appears to confirm that Colonel-General Gennady Zhidko is the commander.” Another Ukraine MP, Lesia Vasylenko, says seven people may have been injured in the Kyiv missiles strikes. She said at least eight missiles were fired. Earlier a fellow MP said 14 missiles were launched. Euromaidan Press has video of one of those injured in the Kyiv missile strike being taken away on a stretcher by rescue workers. At least five people were wounded when a missile hit a building in central Kyiv on Sunday, the head of Ukraine’s police force Ihor Klymenko said on national television. And the Ukraine MP Oleksiy Goncharenko has more detail on the scale of Russia’s missile attack against Kyiv this morning. AP quoted him saying: According to prelim data 14 missiles were launched against Kyiv region and Kyiv. Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu has inspected Russian troop units involved in Ukraine, Reuters reports citing the defence ministry. “At the command posts of Russian units, Army General Sergei Shoigu heard reports from the commanders on the current situation and actions of the Russian Armed Forces in the main operational areas,” the ministry said in a statement. It was not immediately known when the visit took place. The Wall Street Journal’s Yaroslav Trofimov reckons this is the first time Shoigu has visited Ukraine since the war began. Update: Reuters later clarified that it was unclear from the footage if Shoigu actually visited Ukraine. Kyiv has come under attack for the first time since 5 June, with Russian missiles striking at least two residential buildings in the Shevchenkivskyi district of the capital. Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said that two people had been taken to hospital and rescuers were working to free people trapped under rubble. “They (the rescuers) have pulled out a seven-year-old girl. She is alive. Now they’re trying to rescue her mother,” Klitschko said. The UK, US, Canada and Japan will ban imports of Russian gold in the latest stage of the effort to cripple Russia’s economy in response to the war in Ukraine, the Press Association reports. Gold exports were worth $15.2bn to Russia in 2021, and their importance has increased since Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Russian forces are trying to cut off the strategic twin city of Lysychansk in eastern Ukraine, having reduced Sievierodonetsk to rubble. Lysychansk is set to become the next main focus of fighting, as Moscow has launched massive artillery bombardments and airstrikes on areas far from the heart of the eastern battles. Ukraine called its retreat from Sievierodonetsk a “tactical withdrawal” to fight from higher ground in Lysychansk on the opposite bank of the Siverskyi Donets river. Russia will send missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads to Belarus in the next few months, Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, said on Saturday while hosting the Belarusian leader, Alexander Lukashenko. “In the coming months, we will transfer to Belarus Iskander-M tactical missile systems, which can use ballistic or cruise missiles, in their conventional and nuclear versions,” Putin said. The mayors of several European capitals have been duped into holding video calls with a deepfake of their counterpart in Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko. The mayor of Berlin, Franziska Giffey, took part in a scheduled call on the Webex video conferencing platform on Friday with a person she said looked and sounded like Klitschko. “There were no signs that the video conference call wasn’t being held with a real person,” her office said in a statement. Ukrainian shelling on Saturday forced Russian troops to suspend the evacuation of people from a chemical plant in Sievierodonetsk, just hours after Moscow’s forces took the city, Reuters reported the Tass news agency as saying. Separately, a senior adviser to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said special forces were still in Sievierodonetsk, directing artillery fire against the Russians. The adviser, Oleksiy Arestovych, spoke in a video address. British prime minister Boris Johnson urged G7 leaders to not “give up” on Ukraine as he pledged additional financial support for Ukraine as it attempts to fight the Russian invasion. “Ukraine can win and it will win. But they need our backing to do so. Now is not the time to give up on Ukraine,” Johnson said on Saturday. Britain stands ready to provide another $525m in loan guarantees, a statement from Downing Street. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said on Saturday that Ukraine will win back all the cities it has lost to Russia, including Sievierodonetsk. “All our cities – Sievierodonetsk, Donetsk, Luhansk – we’ll get them all back,” he said in a late-night video address. Zelenskiy also admitted that the war was becoming difficult to emotionally handle. The UK, US, Canada and Japan will ban imports of Russian gold in the latest stage of the effort to cripple Russia’s economy in response to the war in Ukraine, the Press Association reports. Gold exports were worth $15.2bn to Russia in 2021, and their importance has increased since Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, as oligarchs have rushed to buy bullion to avoid the impact of sanctions, Downing Street said. Officials believe that because London is a major gold-trading hub, UK sanctions will have a huge impact on Putin’s ability to raise funds to finance his war effort. Boris Johnson confirmed the move as he arrived at the G7 summit in Bavaria, Germany. The ban is due to come into force shortly and will apply to newly mined or refined gold. It will not affect Russian-origin gold that has been previously exported from Russia, the British government added. Indonesia’s president, Joko Widodo, said on Sunday that he would urge his Russian and Ukrainian counterparts to open room for dialogue during a peace-building mission to the warring countries, and ask Russia’s Vladimir Putin to order an immediate ceasefire. “War has to be stopped and global food supply chains need to be reactivated,” Jokowi, as the president is popularly known, said before leaving for Germany to attend the G7 summit on Monday. The president also said he will encourage the G7 countries to seek peace in Ukraine following Russia’s invasion, and find an immediate solution to global food and energy crises. Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a “special operation”. Separately, Indonesia’s foreign minister, Retno Marsudi, said food and fertiliser products from Russia and Ukraine need to be “reintegrated into the global market, despite the war”. “It is necessary to secure a grain corridor from Ukraine and open food and fertiliser exports from Russia. All countries must refrain from actions that further exacerbate this food crisis,” Marsudi said in a statement on Sunday. Indonesia has condemned the war and expressed sympathy to Ukrainians. However, Jokowi in April said he had declined a request for arms from Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, says two people have been taken to hospital after Sunday morning’s missile strikes, with search and rescue operations continuing. In a Telegram post, Klitschko said people may still be trapped under rubble at a residential building in the Shevchenkivskyi district. Some of the dozens of long-range Russian missile strikes on Saturday were, for the first time, launched from Tu-22 bombers deployed from Belarus, Ukraine’s military says. Russia struck multiple targets across Ukraine on Saturday, including the port city of Mykolaiv in the south, the Chernihiv region in the north and a “military object” near Lviv in the west. About 30 Russian missiles were also fired on the Zhytomyr region in central Ukraine, killing one Ukrainian soldier. Ukraine’s military intelligence agency said the Russian bombers’ use of Belarusian airspace for the first time was “directly connected to attempts by the Kremlin to drag Belarus into the war”. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address on Saturday that as a war that Moscow expected to last five days moved into its fifth month, Russia “felt compelled to stage such a missile show”. Photographer Alessio Mamo and I had just arrived in Kyiv on a night train from Lviv, and as soon as we set foot out of the railway station, we saw four missiles hitting an area of the capital about 5km away from us. Columns of smoke were rising over the city which has not not come under Russian bombardment for nearly three weeks, and we decided to go right away to the spot to see what happened. The site of the explosion looked really familiar. And the closer we got to the site, the more I realised that I had already been there. The same area (the same road actually) was hit almost 2 months ago, on 28 April, in a menacing display of defiance while at the time the UN secretary general was visiting the city and a few hours after Joe Biden had announced a doubling of US military and economic aid to Ukraine. That day, journalist Vira Hyrych, who worked for Voice of America and lived in the apartment hit by the strike, was killed in the attack. And I was there, exactly two months ago, reporting from that spot. The latest UK defence intelligence briefing says Russia’s capture of Sievierodonetsk in eastern Ukraine was a “significant achievement” for Moscow’s ambitions in the Donbas region. Pictures of the aftermath of the missile strikes are coming in from our photographer Alessio Mamo. The Kyiv Independent reports that Kyiv Oblast governor Oleksiy Kuleba posted on Telegram that the local air defence system downed a Russian missile early on 26 June. Missile fragments fell in the outskirts of one of the region’s villages. Russia hit Kyiv on Sunday with four cruise missile strikes. At least one struck the lower floors of a residential building in the Shevchenkivskyi district of the capital. The area was previously hit almost two months ago, on 28 April, in a menacing display of defiance while the UN secretary general was visiting the city and a few hours after Joe Biden had announced a doubling of US military and economic aid to Ukraine. At the time, journalist Vira Hyrych, who worked for Voice of America and lived in the apartment hit by the strike, was killed in the attack. There was no immediate information on the cause of the latest explosions or casualties. The historic district, one of Kyiv’s central, is home to a cluster of universities, restaurants and art galleries. G7 leaders are gathering in Germany in a meeting set to be dominated by Ukraine and its far-reaching consequences, from energy shortages to a food crisis. The leaders are expected to seek to show a united front on supporting Ukraine for as long as necessary and cranking up pressure on the Kremlin – although they will want to avoid sanctions that could stoke inflation and exacerbate the global cost-of-living crisis. The partners are set to agree to ban imports of gold from Russia, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. A German government source later said that leaders were having “really constructive” conversations on a possible price cap on Russian oil imports. Hello and welcome to today’s ongoing coverage of Russia’s war on Ukraine. We are now on day 123 of the invasion and you can find a summary of the latest developments here, and shown below: Russian forces are trying to cut off the strategic twin city of Lysychansk in eastern Ukraine, having reduced Sievierodonetsk to rubble. Lysychansk is set to become the next main focus of fighting, as Moscow has launched massive artillery bombardments and airstrikes on areas far from the heart of the eastern battles.

Zelenskiy also admitted that the war was becoming difficult to emotionally handle. Russian attacks have killed three civilians on Saturday in Bakhmut, New York and Pervomaiske in the Donetsk region, according to the region’s governor Pavlo Kyrylenko. Additionally, Russian missile strikes have killed at least three and injured four others in Sarny, a city in Rivne, a western region in Ukraine. The US has announced that it will provide 18 patrol boats to Ukraine as part of the 13th security package promised on Thursday. “Included in the package announced Thursday are two 35-foot, small-unit riverine craft; six 40-foot maritime combat craft; and ten 34-foot, Dauntless Sea Ark patrol boats,” the defense department said on Thursday. Russia attacked the Ukrainian capital in the early hours of Sunday morning, striking at least two residential buildings in the Shevchenkivskyi district, Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko said. Emergency services said that as a result of the Russian shelling a fire broke out in a nine-storey residential building, which had been partially damaged in the attack. Klitschko said that residents are being rescued and evacuated from two buildings. “There are people under the rubble,” Klitschko said on the Telegram messaging app. He added that several people had already been hospitalised. “They (the rescuers) have pulled out a seven-year-old girl. She is alive. Now they’re trying to rescue her mother.” Air raid sirens regularly disrupt life in Kyiv, but there have been no major strikes on the city since 5 June, when a rail car repair facility was hit on the outskirts, and a late April shelling when a Radio Liberty producer was killed in a strike that hit the building she lived in. The historic district, one of Kyiv’s central, is home to a cluster of universities, restaurants and art galleries. The blasts occurred around 6.30am local time, half an hour after air raid sirens sounded in the capital.

Don't turn it into an imaginary war","bodyText":"The language of war is baked in to most of us, to one degree or other. Our new daily discourse runs deep with talk of field hospitals, frontlines, the battles against an invisible enemy. The shock of the news that prime minister Boris Johnson lies seriously ill in intensive care drew a tide of messages and well-wishes from world leaders and other politicians, many of which invoked a kind of martial courage. “You are a fighter and we need you back.” “He is a fighter and will beat this virus.” Together, “we will be able to win this battle”. “You fight for a swift recovery.” “You are a fighter, and you will overcome this challenge.” I truly hope he does. For his part, Dominic Raab – who will deputise for Johnson – was described as looking “shell-shocked” last night, before this morning chairing the “war cabinet”. According to the breakfast interview inquiries thrown at Michael Gove, it seems that one of the primary questions is whether Raab is now technically in charge of the UK’s response to a notional nuclear attack. I suppose we have to treat this as a matter of vital pertinence, though like many people living through this 100-year deadly pandemic, I’d have just three words for any nuclear power contemplating an imminent first strike at the UK: not now, mate. As the news gets more horrifyingly real each day – and somehow, at the same time, more unmanageably unreal – I’m not sure who this register of battle and victory and defeat truly aids. We don’t really require a metaphor to throw the horror of viral death into sharper relief: you have to think it’s bad enough already. Plague is a standalone horseman of the apocalypse – he doesn’t need to catch a ride with war. Equally, it’s probably unnecessary to rank something we keep being informed is virtually a war with things in the past that were literally wars. “Your grandparents were called to war,” runs one popular meme. “You’re being asked to sit on a couch. You can do this.” Unsurprisingly, given this level of bellicose confusion, we have already seen those who visit the park literally branded “traitors”. Perhaps most importantly, it should be said that people don’t die from this ghastly illness because of a lack of fight, whatever that might mean. Patients don’t “lose” against coronavirus because they failed to smite it or to personally out-strategise it. In recent years there has been a growing attempt to actually listen to people with cancer on the language used around the disease, and mountains of evidence has found that they largely disdain and frequently loathe the characterisation of their sickness as a “battle”. The absurdity of putting the burden of healing on the patient incenses many, who don’t care to be told that they are “winning their war”, or to be remembered as having “lost their battle”. Writing on the death of Robin Gibb, Jenni Murray (herself a former cancer patient), righteously refused to characterise him as having lost any battle, instead stating the reality: “he drew the short straw of a difficult disease”. Or think of the late great Deborah Orr’s withering refusal to tolerate this nonsense in her rules on how to talk to cancer patients. “Funnily enough,” ran some typically twinkly menace, “it’s not comforting to be told that you have to go into battle with your disease, like some kind of medieval knight on a romantic quest. Submitting to medical science, in the hope of a cure, is just that – a submission. The idea that illness is a character test, with recovery as a reward for the valiant, is glib to the point of insult.” Perhaps it would be better for us all if we resisted talking about coronavirus in this way. Last year, new research found that the ubiquity of military metaphors in cancer discussions could do more psychological harm than good, making people fatalistic about treatment chances and encouraging the feeling that altering their own behaviours was beyond them. In our current crisis, it is interesting how the language of war is used, and by whom. Without wishing to over-generalise about that innate desire to be a hero, women in public life seem to do it rather less. Health workers themselves do it even more sparingly. Easily the most powerful thing I have seen thus far in the coverage of the deepening virus crisis was a report screened on BBC News, which was given access to an intensive care ward at University College hospital in London. The BBC correspondent framed his film entirely in terms of war: “This is the frontline in a war,” it began. “Every day some battles are won and some are lost.” That’s certainly not a judgment on the excellent report – it may be a helpful way of communicating the desperation to many people. But it was notable that the hospital workers themselves never strayed into that kind of terminology. I can’t shake the memory of the female ER worker talking about how impossibly difficult some doctors and nurses found the unique work of the Covid-19 ICU. I don’t know how long she’d been on shift, but she spoke absolutely fluently and with absolutely no judgment. “Some of our staff can’t cope with it … not all of them can deal with it.” Not for her the veil of platitudes about heroes or battlers or victories. The grim bathos of reality is more powerful. I felt the lurch again reading a Guardian report about the desperate shortage of PPE in care homes, in which the executive chair of the National Care Association spoke plainly. “Once you run out,” she said, “you are down to Marigolds and bin liners.” Oof. I wonder, incidentally, if I am alone in having felt the absence of any women in the government’s “war cabinet” of five top ministers, and whether we’d be hearing quite so much about wars and battles if there were more? I understand, of course, that this is where the cards fell – there are a whole six women in the cabinet, and ministers can only do the jobs that were put in front of them months before this crisis exploded. Even so, I feel the imbalance. Then again, on Sunday night, the Queen made an address to the nation that – to surprise in some quarters – ended up being powerful even to many of those who feel the Jedi mind trick of royalty does not usually work on them. Her Majesty certainly mentioned the war. But she provided something that has not been in ready supply from government podiums over the past few weeks, yet is arguably needed more and more as the darkness sets in: a strangely homespun oratory. Castlespun, whatever. This was not the oratory we associate with soaring wartime speeches or martial inspiration. The callback to her first broadcast, made in 1940 to evacuated children, was particularly affecting. For all the second world war metaphors we’ve had over the past month, this was the first time the parallel was made explicitly with what war really means for the vast, vast majority, who don’t regard it as a chance to be the hero of popular stereotype and earn their glorious mentions in dispatches. For them – for us – war is a state of fear, of seeing our children frightened, of being the victims of immense disruption, and of being separated or sundered from many of those we love. War is not epic poetry. Death is all around us; let’s dispense with the endless conscription. • Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/live/2022/jan/24/markets-fed-rate-rises-omicron-profit-warning-uk-economy-oil-gas-ukraine-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-01-24T21:26:47Z","webTitle":"Omicron knocks UK and eurozone growth to 11-month lows; banknote maker De La Rue warns on profits – business live","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2022/jan/24/markets-fed-rate-rises-omicron-profit-warning-uk-economy-oil-gas-ukraine-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2022/jan/24/markets-fed-rate-rises-omicron-profit-warning-uk-economy-oil-gas-ukraine-business-live","fields":{"headline":"Stock markets and bitcoin fall amid Ukraine worries and US interest rate rise fears – as it happened","bodyText":"After that astonishing turnaround on the New York stock market, it’s time to wrap up. Goodnight! GW The Dow Jones industrial average also rebounded strongly. Having been down over 1,000 points at one stage, it finished 99 points, or 0.3% higher. Ding ding! The Wall Street closing bell has rung.... and stocks have clambered off the mat to stage a remarkable recovery. Having tumbled into correction territory earlier, the S&amp;P 500 index rebounded from its steep selloff to close 0.3% higher. Bloomberg calls it a ‘breathtaking’ recovery: A stock selloff that at one point rivaled any of the last two years was all but wiped out as dip buyers emerged by Monday’s close, the latest breathtaking reversal in markets rattled by geopolitical tensions and the Federal Reserve’s campaign against inflation. Retail, industrial and energy companies led a rebound in the S&amp;P 500 into the close after the gauge tumbled as much as 4% earlier in the day. The dollar gained, while 10-year Treasuries were little changed. The Nasdaq 100 technology index has closed 0.5% higher, having been down more than 4% at one stage of today’s nervy session. Reuters reckons that bargain hunters pushed the indexes into positive territory, adding: “I would not be surprised if today is the low point for the major averages,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist of CFRA Research in New York. Still, Stovall added that January is often a barometer for the rest of the year. “As goes January, so goes the year,” Stovall added. “A negative January in 2022 along with a negative first five days of the year would not bode well for the entire year’s performance.” Here’s some reaction: After posting steep losses earlier, the US stock market is staging a late recovery! The Dow Jones industrial average is now down just 168 points, or 0.5%, in late trading while the tech-focused Nasdaq is almost flat for the day.... The Nasdaq 100 index of tech stocks is on track for its worst January performance ever, surpassing even the 2008 losses, says Bloomberg. Here’s their take on this month’s market selloff: Nasdaq 100 Index’s worst start ever to new year, S&amp;P 500 Index losing 10% and Russell 2000 approaching bear market -- the global stock selloff is gathering pace and the market value losses on Monday alone are now ballooning to almost $3 trillion. British producers have raised fears of beer and burger shortages and higher prices for shoppers after the government said it would stop propping up the CO2 industry. A three-month deal to support the UK’s main producer of the gas, brought in as an emergency measure after a crisis in the autumn, ends next week and it is understood it will not be renewed. The government provided a temporary bailout to CF Fertilisers, which accounts for 60% of the UK’s CO2 supplies, to counter the threat of chaos in supply chains, after its US owner shut its factories amid the soaring cost of natural gas. Any holdup in supplies would affect soft drinks and bakery producers as well as meat processors and brewers, who all use CO2 in making and packaging their goods. Our energy correspondent Jillian Ambrose has analysed the impact that rising tensions between Russia and Ukraine could have on the UK’s gas supplies, and those of continental Europe: How vulnerable are the UK’s gas supplies? The good news is that the UK imports barely any gas from Russia. It meets about half of its gas requirements from the North Sea, while another third is sourced from Norway. The rest is imported by pipelines connecting the UK to Europe, or in the form of liquified natural gas (LNG), which is transported by tankers typically from Qatar or the US. The bad news? The UK’s gas sources could all becoming eye-wateringly expensive if markets in Europe soar. The UK’s market is closely connected to markets in Europe, so a price rise in Germany or the Netherlands would lead to higher prices in Britain. There is no end in sight to Europe’s gas market woes. The US investment bank Goldman Sachs said on Monday: “The high energy prices seen in recent months are not necessarily a one-off.” Gas prices are likely to stay twice as high as normal until 2025, it said, and if Europe faces colder than average temperatures in March and February, blackouts could be likely. How vulnerable are Europe’s gas supplies? Very. Russia typically supplies about a third of Europe’s gas via a complex network of pipelines that run through Ukraine, Belarus and Poland to Germany. From Germany, pipelines carry gas to the rest of western Europe and through to the UK. A major gas supply disruption to Ukraine, last seen in 2008, could cause severe market volatility and a shutdown of factories to help conserve gas. Market experts at S&amp;P Global warned that “any conflict impacting gas supplies into Europe could have knock-on impacts on power, carbon and coal prices”. At the same time, Europe may become more dependent on gas to run its gas power plants after EDF warned that it would reduce the electricity it generates from nuclear power by 10% this year because of technical problems at a handful of its reactors. Aviva Investors, an important UK asset manager, has put the directors of 1,500 companies on notice that it is willing to seek their removal if they fail to show enough urgency in tackling issues including the climate crisis and human rights. The firm said the way it votes on the re-election of company board members in the upcoming AGM season would be heavily influenced by its four key stewardship priorities for the year, which also include biodiversity and executive pay. In its annual letter to 1,500 companies in 30 countries including the UK, Aviva Investors urged companies to develop their own biodiversity action plans, publicly state their commitment to human rights, with appropriate due diligence, and ensure that executive pay plans – particularly bonuses – are linked to its four stewardship priorities. More here: Stock markets across Europe have racked up heavy losses today, ending at the lowest level since October. Fears of conflict in Ukraine unnerved investors, adding to their concerns about looming US interest rate rises. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index has closed 3.8% lower, its biggest one-day fall since June 2020. Germany’s DAX fell by 3.8%, while France’s CAC index lost 4%. David Madden, market analyst at Equiti Capital, says: Traders continue to be in selling mode as fears mount surrounding the Russia-Ukraine situation. Also playing into the mix are the concerns the Federal Reserve will issue a hawkish update on Wednesday. The growing Russian military presence on the Ukrainian border is adding to the speculation there will be an invasion, and those fears have been fuelled by the news that UK and US embassy staff in Ukraine have been instructed to leave the country. Dealers are worried about the prospect of a war in Eastern Europe as the human and economic cost would be huge. Some central European economies like Germany are heavily dependent on energy from Russia, and should a war break out, it’s a possibility those energy supply lines would be cut, which would cripple economic output in the EU. Today’s selloff has wiped £53bn off the value of the FTSE 100 index. Wall Street is sliding deeper into the red. The Dow Jones industrial average has now lost 930 points, or 2.7%, to 33,335, while the Nasdaq Composite has fallen 4%. After a rough day’s trading, the UK’s blue-chip stock index has closed at its lowest level in a month. The FTSE 100 index ended the day down 197 points, or 2.6% at 7297. That’s its worst fall since 26th November, when the Omicron variant sent markets reeling. Educational publisher Pearson led the fallers, down 9.1%, followed by housebuilder Barratt Development (-8.9%), tech-focused investor Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust (-8.5%), and Russian steel maker Evraz (-8%). The smaller FTSE 250 index of medium-sized firms had its worst day since September 2020, tumbling 3.6% to its lowest level since March 2021. Bloomberg’s Tim Stenovec has more details of the US stock market selloff: Today has brought another woeful start to trading on Monday, as heightened geopolitical risk compounds investor anxiety and drags on risk assets. So says Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA, who explains this could be a pivotal week for markets: It could be a make or break week for the markets, with the Fed meeting on Wednesday, big tech earnings, and ongoing tensions on the Ukraine/Russia border. That may sound a bit over the top given how deep a correction we’ve already seen, particularly in the Nasdaq, but it could get much worse before it gets better. Wednesday is going to be massive. The Fed needs to strike the right balance between taking inflation seriously and not wanting to cause further unnecessary turmoil in the markets. Not an easy balancing act when four hikes are already priced in, alongside balance sheet reduction, and some are arguing it’s not enough. That’s a lot of pressure for a meeting that’s not really live but investors will be hanging on every single word. It won’t take much for the Fed to add to the anxiety but if they manage to strike the right chord, it could help settle the markets and draw investors back in. And then there’s earnings. Netflix got things off to a rotten start for big tech but there’ll be plenty of opportunities to turn that around this week. The Nasdaq has fallen more than 16% from its highs and sits very close to bear market territory. Will investors be tempted back in at these levels if the other big tech names deliver? Whatever happens, it promises to be a really interesting week in the markets and one that could go terribly wrong or be the turning point. Perhaps that’s oversimplifying things but when fear is in control as it seems to be now, it creates these kinds of extremes. The Russian rouble has weakened to its lowest level in over a year, as soaring tensions between Moscow and the West over Ukraine hits Russian assets. The rouble has dropped by 2% today to around 79 to the US dollar, the lowest since November 2020. The pressure on the rouble led the Bank of Russia to halt purchases of hard currencies (Bloomberg has more details). Shares tumbled in Moscow today too. The MOEX index of Russian companies fell almost 6%, hitting its lowest level over a year. It’s fallen by 15% since the start of 2022. Russian government debt also fell, pushing up Russia’s 10-year bond yields hit 9.76%, their highest since early 2016, Reuters reports (yields move inversely to prices). Stocks in the US have fallen further, with the S&amp;P 500 dropping over 2%. That put the broad index of US stocks into correction territory (more than 10% off its record high, set at the start of January). The Nasdaq also fell further, and was down 3%. Growth across the US private sector has slowed sharply to its lowest rate since July 2020, in a sign that the Omicron variant has weakened America’s recovery. US output growth slowed to an 18-month low in January as the Omicron wave exacerbates supply delays and labor shortages, data firm IHS Markit reports. Its flash US Composite Output Index has dropped to 50.8, a sharp tumble on December’s 57.0, close to the 50-point mark showing stagnation. The slowdown in output growth was broad-based, with both manufacturing and service sector firms reporting that output nearly stalled this month. Covid-19 cases in the US hit record levels at over one million a day earlier this month, leading to labour shortages and supply chain disruption. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said: “Soaring virus cases have brought the US economy to a near standstill at the start of the year, with businesses disrupted by worsening supply chain delays and staff shortages, with new restrictions to control the spread of Omicron adding to firms’ headwinds. “However, output has been affected by Omicron much more than demand, with robust growth of new business inflows hinting that growth will pick up again once restrictions are relaxed. Furthermore, although supply chain delays continued to prove a persistent drag on the pace of economic growth, linked to port congestion and shipping shortages, the overall rate of supply chain deterioration has eased compared to that seen throughout much of the second half of last year. US stock indexes have dropped at the start of trading, as soaring tensions between Russia and the West over Ukraine worry investors. Shares are under pressure, ahead of the key Federal Reserve policy meeting on Wednesday that could cement expectations of a March interest rate rise. The Dow Jones Industrial Average of 30 large US companies is down 386 points, or 1.1%, at 33,878 points. Boeing (-3.5%), Disney (-2.9%), Goldman Sachs (-2.7%) and Visa (-2.3%) are leading the fallers. The S&amp;P 500 is down 1.5%, as is the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite. The UK’s smaller stock index, the FTSE 250, is having a torrid day. The index of mid-size companies has tumbled by 3.25% today, down 723 points at 21540 points. That’s its lowest level since the end of March 2021, and on track for its worst day in over a year (although it could yet recover some ground). Cinema chain Cineworld (-13%) and cyber security firm Darktrace (-12.3%) are the top fallers. Wall Street is set for a sharper drop at the open, with the Dow Jones industrial average down 1% in the futures market: Bitcoin’s moving lower too, down over 7% in the last 24 hours at around $33,200 - still a six-month low. The Stoxx 600 index of European company shares has now dropped by 2.8%, to its lowest level since November 30th. The FTSE 100 index has now lost all its gains so far this year. It’s down 123 points, or 1.65%, at 7370 points, still on track for its worst day in eight weeks. Russian steelmaker Evraz is now among the big fallers, down 7.1%, just behind tech-focused investment trust Scottish Mortgage (-7.5%) which continues to be pummelled by the correction in technology stocks. Basic materials producers are weaker too, including copper producer Antofagasta (-5.8%) and Glencore (-5.3%). Educational publisher Pearson (-6.5%), gambling group Entain (-6.3%) and airline group IAG (-5.6%) are also high in the fallers. The US stock market is on track to open lower, led by further losses on the tech-focused Nasdaq: Gas prices have jumped sharply today, on concerns that Russian supplies to Europe could be disrupted. The wholesale day-ahead contract for UK gas has risen 14% to 217p per therm, adding to gains on Thursday and Friday. That’s more than triple the price a year ago, but still below its record highs last autumn: The UK wholesale weekend gas price has risen 9.7%, while the winter 2022 gas contract is 21% higher. European benchmark gas prices have also jumped today, with the February and March contracts both up over 6%. 1.20pm GMT update: the Dutch wholesale gas contract for February is now up 18.5% today. Russian energy supplies are in the spotlight as the United States and Europe both promised to impose new, much harsher sanctions on Moscow should it invade Ukraine. But the Kremlin has insisted that it is reliable energy supplier, as Reuters reports: Russia has been a reliable energy supplier to Europe even at difficult times in relations, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday, calling reports in British media that Moscow may cut supplies in case of sanctions “fake hysteria”. Europe relies on Russia for around 35% of its gas and is also a major consumer of Russian oil coming both via pipelines and sea ports “In the most uneasy times in our relations, Russia was a reliable guarantor of Europe’s energy security, faultlessly fulfilling its contractual obligations,” Peskov told a conference call on Monday. More here: Kremlin says Russia is a reliable energy supplier for Europe Today’s losses follow the worst week for global equity markets since October 2020. The MSCI’s index of world markets dropped by 4.25% last week, with volatility rising amid a growing sense of investor unease. Worries about tighter US Federal Reserve policy, the tensions between Russia and Ukraine, and disappointing earnings calls from some high-profile companies are all factors, says Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management: “With a number of critical market factors still in flux, the short-term market direction can remain volatile. But for longer-term investors, we don’t think it is a bad thing if market volatility takes some of the air out of the more speculative corners of the market—Bitcoin is down 23.8% year-to-date. Nor is it a bad thing if current volatility means that some secular growth names are being offered at their best prices in months. Meanwhile, it’s important to remember we remain in a very strong economic growth environment, which should stay supportive of cyclical and value sectors in the short term.” The selloff in Europe’s stock markets is gathering pace, as tensions over Ukraine rise. The UK’s FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares has now dropped by 93 points, or 1.25%, to 7400 points. That’s its lowest level since the start of January, as a risk-off mood sweeps markets after Nato said it is reinforcing its eastern borders with land, sea and air forces. European markets have fallen deeper into the red, with Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC both down 1.9% today. It puts European stocks on track for their worst day in two months (since the discovery of Omicron sparked a selloff in November). Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, explains: “The threat of conflict breaking out on the doorstep is hanging over European indices, as hopes begin to fade that there will be fresh meaningful moves from diplomats. The tech sector jitters are continuing, unsurprising given the seemingly unstoppable slide of the Nasdaq composite and the march downwards of the S&amp;P 500 on Friday.” Investors are also worried that the US Federal Reserve could tighten monetary policy sharply this year, after America’s inflation rate hit a 40-year high. The Fed meets this week, and could signal that it will lift interest rates in March. Some are wondering if the Fed could hike rates by 50-basis points [0.5%] in March, rather than the 0.25bp rise expected. Raffi Boyadjian, lead investment analyst at XM, warns there could be more jitters ahead: Wall Street just had its most bruising week since the onset of the pandemic in March 2020 and it could get even rockier for stocks in the coming days. The Federal Reserve is poised to give a formal nod to liftoff on Wednesday and the earnings season is about to heat up with a host of major names set to report this week. Meanwhile, tensions between the West and Russia over Ukraine show no sign of easing, adding to the market angst as a conflict could potentially deepen the global energy crisis. Housebuilders are among the top fallers in London, such as Barratt Development (-6.6%) and Persimmon (-5.8%). Analysts at Jefferies cut their rating on some building firms this morning, as the government demands the sector foots the bill for removing dangerous cladding. Technology-focused investment trust Scottish Mortgage has dropped 5.8% today, as tech stocks continue to come under pressure (the Nasdaq fell into a correction last week). Bitcoin has tumbled to its lowest level since last July, as traders ditch risky assets such as crypto currencies. Bitcoin has fallen to around $33,800, down over 5% in the last 24 hours. It’s now shed more than half its value since hitting record highs around $69,000 in November. Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, says the crypto market is “in turmoil”, and there could be further falls ahead. It looks as though the [Bitcoin] downtrend remains intact with the potential for further downside towards $30,000 as the next major round number support level, which coincides with the summer trough. Similarly, ether has shed around 50% with $2000 as the next key level to watch. It looks like the bubble has burst as panic selling grips the market. What this episode has taught us is that this is still a very nascent asset class with a high level of correlation between individual crypto assets, particularly on the way down. It has also taught us that for those willing to enjoy the ride higher, traders need to be able to stomach the sharp volatility and steep declines as well. Brave traders might use this major repricing as an opportunity to buy the dip.” The tumble in crypto prices in recent weeks as wiped $1trn off the combined value of the sector since November’s peak. Anxiety that US interest rates could be hiked several times this year is one factor hurting speculative assets. The Ukraine crisis is another. Chris Weston of brokerage Pepperstone says macro forces, such as “higher US real rates, lower inflation expectations and a focus on reduced liquidity from the Fed” are hitting the crypto sector. The UK economy grew at its slowest pace in almost a year in January as hospitality, leisure and travel businesses felt the impact of the Omicron variant, our economics editor Larry Elliott writes. The monthly flash PMI (purchasing managers’ index) estimate of activity from IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply reported a two-speed recovery with an easing of supply-chain bottlenecks for manufacturing offset by weakness in consumer-facing service companies. Service sector growth eased for a third month, according to the survey, amid reports from businesses of a loss of momentum caused by pandemic disruptions and very subdued demand. Amid widespread reports of severe cost pressures, the IHS Markit/Cips measure of output fell from 53.6 to 53.4 in January – its lowest level in 11 months. Any finding above 50 denotes that the economy is expanding rather than contracting. Chris Williamson, IHS Markit’s chief business economist, said: “A resilient rate of economic growth in the UK during January masks wide variations across different sectors. Consumer-facing businesses have been hit hard by Omicron and manufacturers have reported a further worrying weakening of order book growth, but other business sectors have remained encouragingly robust.” Here’s our news story on banknote printer De La Rue’s profit warning, after the firm suffered from higher Covid-19 costs including staff absences and computer chip shortage: The Swiss franc has risen to its highest level against the euro in over six years, as worries over the Ukraine crisis helped to push investors into safe-haven assets. The franc strengthened to €1.0325, its highest level against the single currency since June 29, 2015, as markets grow more jittery this morning. Reuters has the details: Concerns about the security situation on Ukraine’s border with Russia as well as the possibility of a snap election in Italy were driving investors’ demand for the franc, analysts said. “Given that the Japanese yen is also up, and to some extent gold, it points to an increase in safe-haven demand,” said Maxime Botteron, an economist at Credit Suisse. “It clearly seems that we have another risk-off move today – mainly in equity markets but that spills over to FX [foreign exchange],” said Karsten Junius, an economist at J.Safra Sarasin. “Additionally, I can fully understand that some investors are getting more nervous about the developments in Ukraine which is then leading to a stronger CHF [Swiss franc] as well.” This month’s PMI surveys have also shown that Omicron knocked the recovery in Japan and Australia: The fall in the UK composite PMI this month shows that omicron continued to hit growth, economists say. But the impact could be modest, as Covid-19 cases fall and restrictions are relaxed. That means interest rates are likely to rise next week, from 0.25% to 0.5%. Adam Hoyes, assistant economist at Capital Economics, says the “Omicron hangover won’t last long”, with signs that supply shortages are easing. All told, this PMI survey suggests that the economy is suffering a hangover from the surge in Omicron cases. Even so, we still think GDP will recovery fairly swiftly over the rest of Q1. And the further rise in the price balances supports our forecast for CPI inflation to climb higher in the coming months. That means that the Bank of England is likely to raise Bank Rate from 0.25% to 0.50% on 3rd February. James Smith, developed markets economist at ING, says the UK PMIs show a modest Omicron economic hit. A more modest fall in the PMIs relative to past Covid waves hints that the cumulative hit to UK monthly GDP from Omicron will be less than 1%. This latest survey also hints at renewed service-sector cost pressure, and that reinforces our view that the Bank of England will hike rates again in February. Thomas Pugh, economist at RSM UK, agrees that the economic damage from Omicron has been limited, and growth probably stabilised this month. We expect most of the output lost in December to be made up in February as the number of people self-isolating drops, workers return to offices and consumers get back to socialising in person. Indeed, the rise in the future output balance of the composite PMI from 72.5 in December, a year long low, to 75.8, a six month high, suggests firms are gearing up for a bounce back in demand. UK services companies were hit by expensive raw material costs, pay rises and soaring energy bills this month - leading many to lift their own prices in return. January’s survey of purchasing managers found that inflationary pressures continued to build in the service sector. Input costs and output charges increasing at the second-fastest rate since the survey began in July 1996 (exceeded only by November 2021). Survey respondents “overwhelmingly” said higher raw material costs, staff wages and energy bills had led to a repricing of their services, Markit says. Duncan Brock, Group Director at CIPS, says: “In the gloomiest month of the year what is also disappointing for the UK economy is price inflation returning with a vengeance with the second highest jump in business expenses since 1998. Staff wages and energy price hikes made up the bulk of the extra burden and businesses will inevitably pass on these costs to consumers. The Omicron variant has dragged UK company growth to its slowest since the lockdowns nearly a year ago. British business activity cooled to an 11-month low in January, led by a slowdown in the services sector, a closely-watched survey of UK purchasing managers from IHS Markit shows. Customer-facing parts of the economy were, understandably, worst hit by Omicron, as the UK experienced a “two-speed recovery in January”. The service sector slowed for the third month running, with hospitality, leisure and travel all struggling due to the restrictions which were introduced last month, and which are now being eased. Companies across the economy reported rising backlogs of work due to staff absences, as record numbers of Covid-19 infections led to more people off ill or isolating. But there’s good news too -- manufacturing output hit a five-month high, thanks to a “sustained turnaround in materials availability” which may show the supply chain crisis is finally easing. Business confidence in the outlook also picked up, driving sustained solid jobs growth. The IHS Markit/CIPS Composite PMI, which tracks activity in the economy, dipped in January to 53.4 from 53.6. That’s the lowest in 11 months, and weaker than expected (economists forecast a rise to 55, which would have shown a pick-up). But it is higher than the eurozone’s composite PMI of 52.4 (see earlier post), suggesting the UK has started 2022 a little stronger. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, says there were wide variations across different sectors this month. Consumer-facing businesses have been hit hard by Omicron and manufactures have reported a further worrying weakening of order book growth, but other business sectors have remained encouragingly robust. Looking ahead, while the Omicron wave meant the hospitality sector has sunk into a third steep downturn, these restrictions are now easing, meaning this downturn should be brief. Many business and financial services companies have meanwhile been far less affected by Omicron, and saw business growth accelerate at the start of the year With inflationary pressures remaining elevated at near-record levels, this all adds to the likelihood of the Bank of England hiking interest rates again at its upcoming meeting, he adds: European markets have now dropped further, with the FTSE 100 index down 50 points, or 0.66%, at 7444 (still around a two-week low). Germany’s DAX is down 1%, and France’s CAC is 1.3% lower, as Ukrainian tensions and worries about potential interest rate hikes in the US continue to loom. And here’s some reaction to the eurozone flash PMI surveys, from Frederik Ducrozet of Pictet Wealth Management: Here’s AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould on De La Rue’s profits warning: Banknote printer De La Rue left its shareholders feeling poorer as it warned on profit thanks to supply chain issues and staff shortages associated with the Omicron variant of Covid-10. “While it insists a turnaround plan has been delayed rather than derailed, many investors are not sticking around to find out.” Just in: Growth across the eurozone has slowed to its lowest in nearly a year, despite signs of recovery in Germany. The eurozone’s recovery weakened again this month, as restrictions imposed to combat the Omicron variant caused a sharp slowdown at companies in the services sector. Tourism, travel and recreation firms were especially hard hit by a drop in spending. Firms were also hit by rising costs, leading them to hike their own prices. But encouragingly, manufacturers reported that supply chain delays were improving. This pulled data firm IHS Markit’s Flash Eurozone PMI Composite Output Index down to 52.4, from 53.3 in December. That’s an 11-month low, closer to the 50-point mark showing stagnation. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, says the overall impact of Omicron on the wider economy appears relatively muted: Not only has the alleviating supply crunch helped factories boost production, but cost pressures in manufacturing have also moderated. “Importantly, while the Omicron wave has dented prospects in the service sector, the impact so far looks less severe than prior waves. Meanwhile, perceived prospects have improved among manufacturers, linked to fewer supply shortages adding to the brightening outlook. “In the meantime, however, prices for goods and services are rising at a joint-record rate as increasing wages and energy costs offset the easing in producers’ raw material prices, dashing hopes of any imminent cooling of inflationary pressures.” Here’s the details: Flash Eurozone Services PMI Activity Index fell to 51.2 (53.1 in December). 9-month low. Flash Eurozone Manufacturing PMI Output Index rose to 55.8 (53.8 in December). 5-month high. Flash Eurozone Manufacturing PMI rose to 59.0 (58.0 in December). 5-month high. De La Rue isn’t alone in being buffeted by supply chain problems. There was a 19% jump in profit warnings issued by UK listed companies in the last quarter of 2021. A record proportion cited supply chain disruption and rising costs, according to EY-Parthenon’s latest Profit Warnings report. It found that: UK listed companies issued 203 profit warnings in 2021 - down from the record-breaking 583 warnings in 2020 One-in-five companies in consumer-facing sectors issued a warning over the year A record 44% of profit warnings issued in Q4 2021 were blamed on supply chain disruption Retail, Software &amp; Computer services and Aerospace &amp; Defense were amongst the hardest hit FTSE sectors in 2021 Alan Hudson, EY-Parthenon partner and UK&amp;I turnaround and restructuring strategy Leader, says : “Sporadic growth made it a difficult year for many companies to navigate, despite healthy headline growth. By the second half of the year, an increasing number of companies were issuing profit warnings as forecasting and earnings challenges evolved and multiplied.” The biggest driver of warnings in 2022 is likely to be the rise in inflationary pressures and its impact on disposable incomes and margins, Hudson adds: We have already recorded profit warnings relating to rising energy prices. Labour shortages and wage increases are also beginning to feature more in company concerns, especially in logistics, hospitality and healthcare – including care homes.” Germany’s economy is showing resilience, with the private sector returning to growth in January after a difficult December. Service sector companies in Germany are expanding again, while manufacturing is growing at the fastest pace in five months, the latest ‘flash’ survey of purchasing managers shows. IHS Markit says: The goods-producing sector drove a renewed increase in new orders at the start of the year. Overall inflows of new business showed the strongest rise since last September as manufacturing order books expanded markedly and to the greatest extent for five months. There was a slightly better month of new business across the services sector as well, with demand improving somewhat after falling in each of the previous two months. New export business received by services firms continued to fall, however, hinting that the upturn here was driven by the domestic market. Growth across France’s private sector has hit a nine-month low. Data firm IHS Markit reports that French economic activity is rising at a slower rate this month, due to rising Covid-19 infections and the supply chain crisis. Although manufacturing sped up, there was a “notable easing in services growth”, which hurt the wider performance of the French economy Inflationary pressures also intensified across France, with output prices increasing at the fastest rate on record amid a stronger rise in cost burdens, Markit adds. Factory activity in Japan is growing at its fastest in four years this month, as output growth picked up. However, manufacturers are still facing persistent chip shortages and rising prices, the latest survey of purchasing managers shows. And Japan’s wider private sector slipped into contraction for the first time in four months, after a surge in Omicron variant coronavirus cases hurt customer-facing businesses in the services industry. Shares in Unilever have jumped almost 5% this morning, after Nelson Peltz’s activist hedge fund built a stake in the consumer goods maker. Peltz’s interest piles more pressure on Unilever to shake up its business model, as my colleague Zoe Wood explains: The consumer goods company, best known for Dove soap, Hellmann’s mayonnaise and Marmite, has been thrown into turmoil after a £50bn tilt at GlaxoSmithKline’s consumer healthcare division caused fury among its shareholders. On Sunday the Financial Times reported that Trian Partners, Peltz’s New York-based hedge fund, had taken a position in the UK group, adding to the problems of its embattled chief executive, Alan Jope. Martin Deboo, an analyst at investment bank Jefferies, said the “fox would now appear to be inside the henhouse”. “Trian has a long and successful track record of unlocking value,” said Deboo. “This has frequently centred on splits and spin-outs. Unilever are the top FTSE 100 riser, after plunging a week ago as investors baulked at its plan to buy GSK’s consumer healthcare arm. European markets have opened in the red, with Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC both down around 0.3%. The UK’s FTSE 100 is holding up slightly better, down 0.2% or 13 points. The pan-European Stoxx 600 is now down 3% so far this year, as worries about US interest rate rises weigh on markets, while the FTSE 100 is still up 1.35% during 2022. Richard Hunter, Head of Markets at interactive investor, says January has been difficult for investors: The earnings season so far has been a patchy affair, marked by missed earnings reports so far set against high expectations. The likes of Apple and Microsoft have the opportunity later in the week to lift spirits, while a first reading of US GDP for the December quarter could show that prior to the Omicron variant the economy was showing real signs of recovery. In the meantime, January has been a difficult month for investors and in the year to date the Dow Jones has lost 5.7%, the S&amp;P500 7.7% and the Nasdaq 12% with few signs of immediate respite on the table. More broadly, the apparently worsening of relations between Russia and Ukraine has put investors on alert, as any possible attacks by Russia will have wider implications which other major powers will be unable to ignore. Whether this results in military action or strict sanctions remains to be seen, but in any event the developments are adding to general investor unease. Shares in De la Rue have tumbled by 30% at the start of trading, after it warned profits will miss expectations. They’ve dropped 45p to 105p each, the lowest since June 2020. British banknote printer De La Rue has issued a profit warning, after suffering supply chain shortages and staff absences due to the pandemic. De La Rue told the City that annual profit will miss market expectations, after “significant headwinds”, primarily due to the Covid-19 pandemic, become more pronounced. Those headwinds include increased employee absences at its manufacturing facilities globally due to coronavirus infections. De La Rue says: The Omicron and Delta variants have caused substantially increased employee absences in our manufacturing facilities globally, which will result in lower total operational output for the full year. It has also suffered supply chain shortages, including semiconductors, and other process raw materials, plus rising costs due to supply chain cost inflation. De La Rue now expects to make adjusted operating profits of £36m to £40m this financial year (to March 26th), missing market expectations of £45m-47m. This disruption will delay the results of its Turnaround Plan by 12 months, De La Rue says, rather than derailing it. Clive Vacher, CEO, says: “Despite the macro challenges that are delaying aspects of the Turnaround Plan, De La Rue continues to increase adjusted operating profit in both divisions year on year, and the Plan anticipates this to continue going forward. While this trading update is disappointing, it should be seen as a delay to reaching our Turnaround Plan objectives, rather than indicating that a change of direction is required. The Company’s leadership has worked hard to mitigate many of these external effects, with the cost reduction activities we have implemented since early 2020 having a significant impact in supporting our underlying performance while we navigate these external factors. The markets in which we operate, and our position in them, remain strong, and we continue to execute substantial investment for the future.” Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Global stock markets are starting the new week on the back foot, as investors fret about looming interest rate rises and the Ukraine crisis. Shares have dropped in many Asia-Pacific markets, after Wall Street ended last week with more losses. The S&amp;P 500 fell 1.9% on Friday, as January continues to be one of the worst months for stocks since the pandemic began. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index, and South Korea’s KOSPI, are both down 1.25% today, while India’s Sensex has lost 2%. European stocks are expected to open lower too, as traders brace for a Federal Reserve meeting on Wednesday. The US central bank is likely to confirm it is on track to soon start raising borrowing costs and running down its balance sheet. As Oliver Allen, a market economist at Capital Economics, puts it: “With inflation eye-wateringly high, the Fed is on course to steadily remove the ultra-accommodative monetary policy that has been a key prop to stock prices for over a decade now.” There is also anxiety about the situation in Ukraine, after the US government ordered the families of all American personnel at its embassy in Ukraine to leave the country amid heightened fears of a Russian invasion. Jim Reid of Deutsche Bank says: Geopolitics doesn’t always impact markets even if they feel very tense and fraught. However the current Russia/Ukraine situation does seem to be adding to the risk off at the moment and merits close attention. But Wall Street could claw back some of last week’s losses, at the start of a very busy week for company earnings - including Microsoft, Apple and Tesla. Also coming up today Some UK workers will be returning to the office today for the first time in weeks, as the Plan B Covid-19 restrictions are rolled back. The latest ‘flash’ PMI surveys of firms in the UK, France, Germany and the wider eurozone will be released this morning. They could show that the UK economy picked up in January, after Omicron hit in December, as Alvin Tan of Royal Bank of Canada explains: The economic impact of the omicron variant is likely to have been relatively mild. Data for early January already point to some degree of recovery in restaurant bookings while card spending data has also shown signs of recovery. The recovery along with expectation of restrictions being lifted should buoy the PMI survey, and we expect the January services PMI to strengthen to 54.8.

Lately, he’s been applying his modelling to Covid-19, and using what he learns to advise Independent Sage, the committee set up as an alternative to the UK government’s official pandemic advice body, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). How do the models you use differ from the conventional ones epidemiologists rely on to advise governments in this pandemic? Conventional models essentially fit curves to historical data and then extrapolate those curves into the future. They look at the surface of the phenomenon – the observable part, or data. Our approach, which borrows from physics and in particular the work of Richard Feynman, goes under the bonnet. It attempts to capture the mathematical structure of the phenomenon – in this case, the pandemic – and to understand the causes of what is observed. Since we don’t know all the causes, we have to infer them. But that inference, and implicit uncertainty, is built into the models. That’s why we call them generative models, because they contain everything you need to know to generate the data. As more data comes in, you adjust your beliefs about the causes, until your model simulates the data as accurately and as simply as possible. Can you give an example of what you mean by uncertainty, with respect to Covid-19, and how you build it into your models? A common type of epidemiological model used today is the SEIR model, which considers that people must be in one of four states – susceptible (S), exposed (E), infected (I) or recovered (R). Unfortunately, reality doesn’t break them down so neatly. For example, what does it mean to be recovered? We know that with Covid-19 you can be infected but asymptomatic, so does it mean recovered from the symptoms or recovered from the infection? And that question hides a host of others, including questions relating to national testing strategies. SEIR models start to fall apart when you think about the underlying causes of the data. You need models that can allow for all possible states, and assess which ones matter for shaping the pandemic’s trajectory over time. This is the first time the generative approach has been applied to a pandemic. Has it proved itself in other domains? These techniques have enjoyed enormous success ever since they moved out of physics. They’ve been running your iPhone and nuclear power stations for a long time. In my field, neurobiology, we call the approach dynamic causal modelling (DCM). We can’t see brain states directly, but we can infer them given brain imaging data. In fact, we have pushed that idea even further. We think the brain may be doing its own dynamic causal modelling, reducing its uncertainty about the causes of the data the senses feed to it. We call this the free energy principle. But whether you’re talking about a pandemic or a brain, the essential problem is the same – you’re trying to understand a complex system that changes over time. In that sense, I’m not doing anything new. The data is generated by Covid-19 patients rather than neurons, but otherwise it’s just another day at the office. You say generative models are also more efficient than conventional ones. What do you mean? Epidemiologists currently tackle the inference problem by number-crunching on a huge scale, making use of high-performance computers. Imagine you want to simulate an outbreak in Scotland. Using conventional approaches, this would take you a day or longer with today’s computing resources. And that’s just to simulate one model or hypothesis – one set of parameters and one set of starting conditions. Using DCM, you can do the same thing in a minute. That allows you to score different hypotheses quickly and easily, and so to home in sooner on the best one. Any other advantages? Yes. With conventional SEIR models, interventions and surveillance are something you add to the model – tweaks or perturbations – so that you can see their effect on morbidity and mortality. But with a generative model these things are built into the model itself, along with everything else that matters. Our response as individuals – and as a society – becomes part of the epidemiological process, part of one big self-organising, self-monitoring system. That means it is possible to predict not only numbers of cases and deaths in the future, but also societal and institutional responses – and to attach precise dates to those predictions. How well have your predictions been borne out in this first wave of infections? For London, we predicted that hospital admissions would peak on 5 April, deaths would peak five days later, and critical care unit occupancy would not exceed capacity – meaning the Nightingale hospitals would not be required. We also predicted that improvements would be seen in the capital by 8 May that might allow social distancing measures to be relaxed – which they were in the prime minister’s announcement on 10 May. To date our predictions have been accurate to within a day or two, so there is a predictive validity to our models that the conventional ones lack. What is your role with Independent Sage? I’m a member with special responsibility for modelling. When they first approached me I didn’t see the “Independent”… I’m joking, but only partly. I think of Independent Sage as the ultimate exercise in public engagement; what it would look like if you and I and everyone else were able to sit in on a real Sage meeting. I’ve heard defensive politicians say its very existence impugns the real Sage, but as a scientist I can’t subscribe to that. In my view there can never be anything wrong with transparent, informed discussion. The committee’s other, equally important, role is to present the UK government with alternative hypotheses – to give it more room for manoeuvre. What do your models say about the risk of a second wave? The models support the idea that what happens in the next few weeks is not going to have a great impact in terms of triggering a rebound – because the population is protected to some extent by immunity acquired during the first wave. The real worry is that a second wave could erupt some months down the line when that immunity wears off. We can test a range of hypotheses, based on a very short duration of immunity – as with a common cold – right through to immunity that lasts for decades. For each duration we can calculate the probability that a second wave will emerge, and when. It’s early days for this work, and I look forward with genuine excitement to new data on immunity becoming available, now that reliable antibody tests exist. But the important message is that we have a window of opportunity now, to get test-and-trace protocols in place ahead of that putative second wave. If these are implemented coherently, we could potentially defer that wave beyond a time horizon where treatments or a vaccine become available, in a way that we weren’t able to before the first one. Once the pandemic is over, will you be able to use your models to ask which country’s response was best? That is already happening, as part of our attempts to understand the latent causes of the data. We’ve been comparing the UK and Germany to try to explain the comparatively low fatality rates in Germany. The answers are sometimes counterintuitive. For example, it looks as if the low German fatality rate is not due to their superior testing capacity, but rather to the fact that the average German is less likely to get infected and die than the average Brit. Why? There are various possible explanations, but one that looks increasingly likely is that Germany has more immunological “dark matter” – people who are impervious to infection, perhaps because they are geographically isolated or have some kind of natural resistance. This is like dark matter in the universe: we can’t see it, but we know it must be there to account for what we can see. Knowing it exists is useful for our preparations for any second wave, because it suggests that targeted testing of those at high risk of exposure to Covid-19 might be a better approach than non-selective testing of the whole population. Are generative models the future of disease modelling? That’s a question for the epidemiologists – they’re the experts. But I would be very surprised if at least some part of the epidemiological community didn’t become more committed to this approach in future, given the impact that Feynman’s ideas have had in so many other disciplines. Finally, a Wired interview says you like to smoke, don’t speak to anyone before midday, do not own a mobile phone and deplore one-on-one meetings. Has any of that changed during lockdown? I’m afraid not. It’s true that this could be considered a one-on-one meeting, but my default mode is sharing ideas in a group – Independent Sage-style – and normal service will resume shortly. Just before I spoke to you I declined an invitation to speak on morning radio, and now I’m off for a cigarette."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2023/apr/03/australia-news-live-gun-control-solo-rower-michelle-lee-peter-dutton-aston-bylection-medicare-interest-rates-house-prices","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-03T08:47:20Z","webTitle":"Former NSW deputy Liberal leader says party has ‘moved too far to the right’ – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2023/apr/03/australia-news-live-gun-control-solo-rower-michelle-lee-peter-dutton-aston-bylection-medicare-interest-rates-house-prices","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2023/apr/03/australia-news-live-gun-control-solo-rower-michelle-lee-peter-dutton-aston-bylection-medicare-interest-rates-house-prices","fields":{"headline":"Former NSW deputy Liberal leader says party has ‘moved too far to the right’ – as it happened","bodyText":"Thanks for following along on the blog today. Here’s a wrap of the day’s biggest stories: Anthony Albanese led tributes for Yunupingu, the revered Yolŋu elder who has died in his homelands aged 74. The Coalition’s Julian Leeser questioned why the Albanese government would “risk the social and racial harmony of the country” with the voice referendum and confirmed the Liberal party room would decide its position on Wednesday. Malcolm Turnbull said the Liberal party “has gone backwards dramatically since I was overthrown”, while former NSW deputy Liberal leader Bruce Baird said the party has “moved too far to the right” as fallout from the Aston byelection loss continues. Nationals leader David Littleproud has called for One Nation leader Pauline Hanson to show leadership over Mark Latham’s now-deleted homophobic tweet. And the NSW premier Chris Minns announced the state will become the latest to ban mobile phones during school hours. A major coal mine that was the subject of a landmark court battle fought on climate change and human rights grounds has been denied an environmental licence, AAP reports. The Clive Palmer-backed Waratah mine in Queensland’s Galilee Basin had its environmental authority application rejected on Monday. The decision by the Queensland Department of Environment follows a land court recommendation in November to refuse both the environmental authority and mining lease applications The thermal coal project should be rejected because it “risks unacceptable climate change impacts” on the environment and on human rights, the court ruled. The land court’s president, Fleur Kingham, found that even though the mine was intended for exports, “wherever the coal is burnt the emissions will contribute to environmental harm, including in Queensland”. The hearing took place over seven weeks beginning in April last year, and included evidence taken on-country in the Torres Strait and Cairns. It was the first time a Queensland court has advised a coal mine should be refused due to its contribution to climate change, and the first time an Australian court has linked climate change to human rights. There are no review or appeal rights under Queensland’s Environmental Protection Act for the department’s decision, however a judicial review can be applied for via the supreme court. Former NSW Liberal says what has happened to Latham is ‘unusual’ Bruce Baird also gave his thoughts on what he would do in regards to Mark Latham if he was back on Macquarie Street: Refer him to the privileges committee, and I would expect sanctions on him and particularly issues such as chairing committees. For somebody who’s moved from being the leader of the centre-left party to now being in a far-right group … there is something basically unusual, what’s quite happening there. Greens: the Liberals had no polices and offered no solutions in Aston The deputy leader of the Greens, Mehreen Faruqi, also weighed in on the Aston byelection result while speaking on ABC Sydney Radio: I think what has happened here is that federally, the Liberals have no policies, they offer no alternatives and while they were running a campaign in Aston of blaming Labor for the cost of living prices, they actually offered no solutions. They have become obsessed with moving to far-right issues that only the Murdoch press really cares about and I think they’re completely out of touch with the community … Faruqi was also asked about One Nation’s Mark Latham’s refusal to apologise for a now-deleted homophobic tweet: At the federal level we finally have endorsed new codes of behaviour which prohibit discrimination in all its forms … and sanctions for breaching these codes are at the moment being finalised. But what the Jenkins report recommended was a range of things from apologies to dismissal from committees to withholding salary, as well as suspension, so I’m hoping that these recommendations will be adopted because I feel that these people who spout this hate won’t change unless there is some sort of enforcement mechanism to hold them really accountable. The former NSW deputy leader of Liberal party Bruce Baird is speaking on ABC Sydney radio this evening about the Aston byelection. As a self-described Liberal moderate, he said “the party has moved too far to the right” when reflecting on the election result. I saw Peta Credlin on the weekend say the problem is that [the Liberal party] needs to become more conservative… and I’m thinking to myself, how did that work out for Tony Abbott and Warringah when we had Liberals who wouldn’t even hand out on some of the booths. So I think that’s it, and we need real change in the party so that we’re more open to diversity, we are more open in terms of women in the party and their voice. Baird also said it’s worth looking at the overall leadership of the party: Peter Dutton himself on a personal level is a really nice guy … I won’t be that harsh, but I think it is time to look at the general question of leadership. A man and his pregnant wife have been found dead after their plane crashed during a heavy storm in central Queensland. Stockman Rhiley Kuhrt and his wife, Maree, were on their way to visit family when their Piper Cherokee crashed in the Mount Hector Range south of Proserpine on Sunday. Police and emergency services found the aircraft shortly after 10am on Monday – 16 hours after it was due to land at the Lakeside Airpark in the Clarke Ranges, near Bloomsbury. My colleague Antoun Issa has put together a great summary of today’s news so far: Latest electricity figures show prices are up Meanwhile, the federal government probably won’t be crowing too much about how its gas and coal price caps are affecting electricity prices. In recent weeks, falls in wholesale prices in the national electricity market since speculation about possible caps near the end of 2022 were cited by ministers and some government officials as proof they were having some impact. The latest weekly wholesale price figures for the national electricity market point to sizeable increases of late. Lots going on in the energy sector, including the closure by the end of this month of the remaining three units of AGL Energy’s Liddell power station. Watch this space, as they say. ACCC expects east coast gas supplies to be sufficient but winter might be tight The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has released its March 2023 interim gas inquiry report, finding that only another 3 petajoules of gas is needed to meet forecast demand this year. That’s an improvement from the 27PJ shortfall forecast by the competition watchdog only last January. No “material shortfall” is expected in 2023, Gina Cass-Gottlieb, the ACCC’s chair, said. Cass-Gottlieb added: If LNG producers commit an extra 3PJ of gas to the domestic market, in addition to amounts already contracted, a shortfall will likely be avoided, but we remain concerned about adequacy of gas supply in the winter months. Some of that browbeating of the industry – which exports about 70% of the gas it produces – seems to have worked. An increase in forecast gas production also helps, as might the easing of global demand after what turned out to be a relatively mild winter for Europe at least. Nations there have been struggling to find substitutes for Russian gas after that nation’s invasion of Ukraine. Still, a cold burst in south-eastern Australia in winter might still stretch supplies. The ACCC notes that southern states (especially Victoria and South Australia) still face a projected 26PJ shortfall that will require Queensland gas to be piped south. However, in the fourth quarter a surplus of 18PJ is expected across the east coast gas market, so some of those contracts might be tweaked. Cass-Gottlieb said: If gas supply is brought forward, for example through gas swaps, or if LNG producers commit further gas to the domestic market, supply should be sufficient to meet demand in the third quarter of 2023. We encourage producers to consider this information and amend their plans to ensure domestic demand will be met each quarter. Mind you, the problems aren’t only for this year, with shortfalls still projected from 2027 without expanded projection, the ACCC said. (Or, without diverting more of the gas earmarked for exports to the domestic market, which might be an alternative approach.) Aly and Joyce asked about Liberals’ Aston byelection loss Anne Aly and Barnaby Joyce are asked for their thoughts on the Liberal party’s loss at the Aston byelection. Aly speaks first: It’s up to [the Liberal party] to do a postmortem but I’ve been hearing a lot of talk about the Liberal party needing to take heed, to look at itself and to change, perhaps one of the ways they can do that is to recognise that their obstruction in parliament and unwillingness to work with the government on any issues is starting to really affect their brand and their vote. Joyce shares his thoughts: I will acknowledge two things. One is they want us to never challenge them in parliament and for them to have a carte blanche … they just want carte blanche on legislation when they should be more honest about the details. They don’t like Peter Dutton as leader because he is very effective and the vast majority of legislation that goes through the parliament is bipartisan, it’s just because it’s not colourful you don’t see it … Anne Aly claims Liberals ‘fearmongering’ on Indigenous voice Minister for early childhood education and youth, Anne Aly, is asked whether there is room for compromise on the wording of the voice proposal: I would hope the Liberals would come to this with open arms and open hearts but the fact is, Greg, the prime minister has had several meetings with Peter Dutton. He’s had ample opportunities to be constructive on this and he simply hasn’t and quite frankly, the questions they are asking and the kind of fearmongering that is going on is very disingenuous. The questions that they’ve been asking in parliament are not questions the Australian people are asking, these are questions devised by the tactics group in opposition in order to ask in question time and undermine the process. I hold hope for Liberal party and the Liberals that they are going to come to the table and hopefully learn the lessons from Aston and from other elections that they need to be constructive and to work with the government on this stop because this is an issue that precedes a Labour government. This is for the Australian people and I think if the Liberals really want to demonstrate that they are heeding the lessons from the Aston byelection and other elections, they will move forward constructively. Barnaby Joyce: Indigenous voice ‘goes against the tenor of how democracy works’ Shadow minister for veterans’ affairs Barnaby Joyce is also speaking on the voice referendum. When asked if the Nationals “jumped the gun” by opposing the voice – following news the Liberal party is meeting this week to decide their position – he replied: No more jumped the gun than the Greens who seemed to get to the position of yes without getting all the details. We’re still for solicitor general advice. This is the biggest change in my life I would say, well for almost a century. We’re [talking] about an unelected body defined on race having access to the executive of government … I think it is so massive and it goes against the tenor of how democracy works. With that much say in a position of power, you’ve got to be elected, not selected … I don’t see this as bringing the country together, I see it as dividing us up. David Coleman reflects on Liberal party’s Aston byelection loss Coleman was also asked about the Liberal party’s loss in the Aston byelection, and said the party will “reflect on that result and learn from it”. Obviously [it was] a very disappointing result, there is no point beating around the bush on that. The government obviously is still in a honeymoon period. We lost Alan Tudge who did have a strong personal vote in that election and to be frank, the issues in Victoria that we saw in the week or two before the election were clearly not helpful. So I think there is a range of things that have occurred there. Our task, as it always is, is to hold the government to account as we approach the next election to put forward an alternative set of policies for Australia but no beating around the bush, as I said, disappointing result and we will reflect on that result and learn from it. Liberal MP David Coleman says he doesn’t want to pre-empt discussion on the voice Shadow communications minister David Coleman, also appearing on Afternoon Briefing, is being asked about the Liberal party’s upcoming party room meeting on Wednesday to decide their position on the voice. Coleman said he doesn’t want to pre-empt the discussion or outcome: It is an incredibly important issue. We’ve only changed the constitution eight times in 122 years. We all want the very best for Indigenous Australians, we all acknowledge that there are many things in our past that were frankly terrible, as they relate to Indigenous Australians. We all want to do all that we can to improve the situation of Indigenous Australians. But it doesn’t necessarily follow that everybody has to agree exactly with everything that Anthony Albanese says on the issue. So we’ll talk it through on Wednesday. Malarndirri McCarthy urges Julian Leeser to back a bipartisan approach to the Indigenous voice to parliament Afternoon Briefing host Greg Jennett has asked Malarndirri McCarthy whether Yunupingu expressed confidence in the success of a voice referendum: I certainly got a sense there was a finality to a journey that he’s been fighting for so long Greg, that he saw in prime minister Anthony Albanese someone who he could believe in and trust in, when he came to Garma to say that we were going to a referendum in terms of the voice and following through on the Uluru statement from the heart. Jennett also asked McCarthy for her thoughts on Julian Leeser’s earlier comments at the National Press Club. Leeser questioned why the government would “risk the social and racial harmony” of the nation if success is not guaranteed in the voice referendum. McCarthy responded: On this day of deep reflection for us up here [in the Northern Territory], I would say to Julian Leeser, who I have worked with closely over the years, we even went to Antarctica together, I would say to Julian why would you risk the journey that you have travelled on with us and with First Nations people by saying no to supporting a bipartisan approach? Earlier today it was announced that the Liberal party will be meeting on Wednesday to decide their official stance on the voice. Malarndirri McCarthy pays tribute to Yunupingu: ‘He really led a movement of all our generation’ The assistant minister for Indigenous Australians, Malarndirri McCarthy, is paying tribute to and remembering Yunupingu while appearing on the ABC’s Afternoon Briefing: No doubt it was quite groundbreaking when the Northern Land Council and other councils came into being as a result of the 1976 Aboriginal Land Rights Act, and that came into being because of the work of Yunupingu and so many other First Nations leaders. That was a time of great change, but also optimism and hope for the future and yet an understanding of the deeper challenge facing systemic resistance against what many did not like to see, in terms of Aboriginal land rights going back to Aboriginal peoples, so he really led a movement of all our generation. … I was only a young girl at the time when he was chairman of the Northern Land Council, and I remember those occasions, and then meeting him when I was a journalist, doing stories and then obviously on a closer and more personal level, he assisted us in our fight as the first First Nations people to fight for country under the Aboriginal Land Rights act and that took us over nearly four decades. Albanese shares post-Aukus deal Adelaide trip photos The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has shared some photos on social media of his trip to Adelaide – his first visit to the city since the Aukus deal was announced. He toured a Collins-class submarine at Osborne with the South Australian premier, Peter Malinauskas, and met with local workers. Speaking earlier, Malinauskas spoke about the Aukus deal and what that means for South Australia: There can be no doubt about the fact that the Aukus opportunity of building nuclear submarines here in South Australia represents the greatest opportunity we’ve had in our state … Up to 5500 people employed directly, right here in Osborne, to build the most complex machines that have ever been built in human history. The size and the scale of this enterprise cannot possibly be overstated. South Australia is not just excited about that task, but we are already gearing up for it. Former prime minister Paul Keating shares tribute for Yunupingu Yunupingu always had natural leadership qualities about him. For just on half a century, he was a major spokesman for Indigenous interests and pursued those interests with rationality and consistency. Much recognition for the interests of Indigenous people happened over the course of his active lifetime including, of course, the High Court decision in Mabo and the practical implementation of what the decision meant under the Native Title Act - the first really significant acts restoring justice in land for Indigenous peoples. Few would have been more conscious of the contemptuous disregard of Indigenous history, the dismal place that the first peoples found themselves in, in their own country. He lived to see a lot of progress and will be sorely missed. Albanese says he’d go to China if invited While speaking in Adelaide, Albanese said he would accept an invitation to visit China were it to be given by president Xi Jinping. This was after he was asked for his thoughts on state premiers visiting China and whether it is a sign of “the relationship stabilising”. Albanese said dialogue is “always a good thing” and that “we will co-operate with China where we can [and] disagree where we must, and engage in our national interests”. He added: It is a positive thing that I met with president [Xi Jinping] at the G20 meeting. It is positive that my assistant trade minister Senator [Tim] Ayres met his counterpart in the last week at Yunnan at the forum that was held. I expect that my trade minister, Don Farrell … will visit China sometime in the coming weeks or months going forward … I was with premier McGowan yesterday, who is planning to visit. Albanese shares conversation with Yunupingu on wording of voice referendum Albanese has also shared a personal story of speaking with Yunupingu when the wording for the Voice referendum was announced. Albanese said: When I met with him at the Garma festival in July last year, when I committed the government to holding a referendum, he asked me at that point in time, ‘Are you serious?’ because he had been let down so many times in the past. And I regarded it as a great honour when his family reached out for me to have a conversation with him on the day that we announced the wording with the Referendum Working Group that will go forward in legislation now and after a committee, that’s the words that will be considered before the parliament, for a referendum at the end of this year. I had the opportunity and great honour of speaking to him that afternoon. He was surrounded by his loved ones and by his community and he said to me on that afternoon, and I will never forget it, he said to me, ‘you spoke truth’ and that was one of the most heartwarming things that anyone could possibly have ever said to me in my life. He was an extraordinary leader. We mourn with his people today and we pay tribute to a lifetime of advocating for the rights of Aboriginal people in this country … I think that today is a day that I certainly recommit myself to do everything we can to make sure that that referendum is carried at the end of this year. While speaking in Adelaide just before, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was asked about comments Julian Leeser made at the National Press Club earlier today about the voice referendum. During questioning, Leeser said: … why would you want to risk the social and racial harmony of the country, a reconciliation process, by putting [forward] a referendum whose success is not guaranteed? I think that is a reflection that the prime minister needs to seriously think about. Albanese responded: I say if not now, when? Indigenous people expect this to be advanced. …we know that when consultation occurs you get better outcomes. That is why we need to get this done and to not put it to the Australian people is to not advance, it is to, by definition - if you don’t run on the field you cannot win. You cannot succeed. We will give Australians that opportunity and I would urge people like Julian Leeser who has a history of genuine support for reconciliation and advancing the interests of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to not just vote yes, but campaign for yes in the referendum that will be held sometime between October and December. Thanks Natasha for guiding us through the morning! I’ll be here to see you through the rest of today’s news. Thanks for your attention this afternoon and apologies for all the legalese. Emily Wind will take your through the rest of today’s news! Our own Josh Butler asks: You’ve been a long-time supporter of the voice and involved in the processes that you have concerns about the current government’s plans or format. Would you rather see the referendum fail than passed in a format you don’t prefer? Leeser: The government needs to ask themselves whether there is enough support for the moment to put the referendum, that’s the question need to ask themselves. I compare this to the republic referendum where at this point in the cycle the republic was tracking at 70 or 80%. This is in the low 50s. When I go around my community and I ask people seriously what they think of the voice, the thing people most often say to me is “I love the TV program.” I don’t say that with any joy or sarcasm. That is the response I most often get. People don’t know what this is. The idea there is momentum that we have to do this now is the prime minister’s artificial timetable. My position on this has always been that we should take the time to get this right. Leeser is asked about the genuineness of the Liberal position when they were in power when Ken Wyatt brought the Voice to the Morrison cabinet three times and it did not progress. Leeser denies there wasn’t genuine commitment to progressing the voice: There has been a standardisation of what happened. I didn’t serve in the Morrison government but what did Ken Wyatt do? He brought for the Calma Langton report, the Calma Langton report said roll out the local and regional voices first. What did we do? We responded, we committed to rolling out the local and regional Voices and we committed the money to that process as well. ‘No monopoly on morality’ When Karen Barlow from the Canberra Times asks Leeser about whether the Liberal party accepts the political consequences of heading down towards the no side, he responds: You’re making an assumption about where we’re going to end up. The second thing to say is everybody who comes to this debate wants things to be better for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. There is no monopoly on morality here, no monopoly on a desire to achieve better outcomes. Both sides of politics have spent enormous amounts of money on Indigenous affairs with little to show for it. That’s why we all come to this debate. The question for all Australians is whether this is the right model to achieve that and this is a decision that parliament will face and ultimately the decision Australians will face. I got involved in this debate many years ago because they wanted to find a way that we could achieve this. I was attracted to the idea of the Voice because it wasn’t symbolic, because it was something that was structural. The question is, have we got the detail in that structure right? The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, declares of Aukus: This is a well thought out plan. (Always reassuring when a leader has to say that.) Albanese talks about the planned rotational visits to Australia by US and UK nuclear-powered submarines from 2027. He says the submarines will be present in Australia “for a considerably longer period of time” than they had done in the past. Albanese says that is also about how to skill up the workforce. Leeser warns of ‘sugar hit’ of referendum passing on an ineffective voice model Back to the questions Leeser is taking at the National Press Club. Clare Armstrong from News Corp asks the shadow attorney general about the moral consequences of pursuing the no campaign: You talked about the primary goal of the voice not being about the feeling everyone has on the night of the referendum, but with this proposal there is an element that is not about practicality. It has been lamented what kind of Australia we would wake up to the day after an unsuccessful referendum. In fact despite being critical of the wording last month Professor Greg Craven said, I’m going to quote: “I would vote for it because if I was forced to take a position as to the sort of advanced morality of doing justice to our Indigenous brothers and citizen, I could not vote against it.” I wonder, what do you think it would say about Australia and what message it would send to Indigenous Australians if the Voice vote failed and do you agree with Professor Craven that there is moral impetus here to support regardless of your legal reservations? Leeser responds that “the constitution is for keeps” and shouldn’t be sacrificed for the “sugar hit” that will come from the morning after the referendum: I think the first thing to say is that we shouldn’t put a referendum if it is in any danger of failure, that’s the first thing. The government should not be putting the country through this. Secondly, referendum is about changing the constitution and the constitution is for keeps. So we have to look carefully about the words being put into the constitution, we have to consider their legal ramifications, because the sugar hit that will get on the night of the referendum or the day after will soon dissipate if the body is not serving the interests of Indigenous Australians and is not working the way it is intended. I want to see a situation where only put a question if it is guaranteed a success. I do think we should put a question if there is a chance for failure and I think the prime minister needs to reflect on that. …I think is ultimately is not about what the parties do here in Canberra, ultimately what the Australian people do and I think Australians should be very circumspect in amending the constitution. Albanese spruiks Aukus submarine plan in South Australia The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has stepped up at the Osborne shipyard in Adelaide to laud Aukus as “a most exciting proposal”. There doesn’t seem to be a new announcement as such, but says he has spoken to the workforce. He says the long-term proposal will provide certainty to workers. Albanese says: Aukus is the biggest single investment in Australia’s defence capability in our history. Osborne will be at the epicentre of all that we do. Albanese argues the nuclear-powered submarine plans “will strengthen Australia’s national security and contribute to regional stability in response to the unprecedented regional challenges which we are facing”. (He doesn’t directly name what country or countries are responsible for those unprecedented regional challenges.) Albanese repeats one of his talking points that Australia is investing in its defence capability but is “also investing in our relationships in the region as well”. The South Australian premier, Peter Malinauskas, says South Australians appreciate the scale and size of the commitment the federal government has made. Liberals may not resolve voice stance entirely on Wednesday Leeser earlier confirmed that the Liberal party will meet on Wednesday to decide its position on the voice to parliament. However, he says that a “completely concluded position” may not be reached. I don’t think people should assume that we will have a completely concluded position on things on Wednesday when we have the committee process to go and there may be things that come out of the party room that help direct the work of the committee and members. Leeser says a vote will be unlikely: It is rare things come to a vote in the party room. Usually things are worked through, people have their say and a consensus is arrived at. Taking questions, Leeser is asked by Cameron Gooley from SBS and NITV: Is your party conducting a campaign to actively undermine this referendum and also, at this meeting on Wednesday, given what happened in Aston, do you believe that you and your colleagues need to change how you are going about conducting this debate? Leeser defends the party stance: We’ve come to this debate with an open mind, that was Peter Dutton’s position since he has been leader and he has asked for detail. When the words were first released, I welcome them and I also asked for detail. The detail has not been forthcoming. … In relation to the Aston byelection, let me say this. The people of Aston have been to the polls three times in the last 10 months. They had a retiring member and as we saw in the state election in New South Wales, the votes of retiring members don’t always transfer across to people. We’ve got a government that is still in this extended honeymoon phase, and while we have had a great candidate in Aston, a barrister, counsellor … multicultural background, she only had five weeks to get known in the community. I think we need to take a lesson from Aston, we need to listen to what the community is saying to us and we need to redouble our efforts to ensure that we as a party to meet the aspirations of Australians. Leeser concludes his address Ok thanks for staying with me on this very legalistic speech from self-professed constitutional “Nerdus Maximus” Leeser. We’ve gotten to the end and Leeser has given us a summary of what he wants us to take away: In conclusion, the constitutional amendment has now been presented to Parliament. There are three points of our compass that have been set. First, we support local and regional voices and call for the funding of them in the budget. Second, any national voice must be deeply connected to the local and regional voices across Australia and it would have been better had the national voice been settled by reaching a bipartisan legislative consensus before we went to a referendum. Third, the government should reconsider the wording of the alteration with a particular focus on the issues I’ve raised. He ends with these words: I wish the referendum was in a better place than it currently is. I wish it was heading to a 1967- style result, but it is not. I wish the government was finding common ground and trust in Australians with all the facts. They are not. They are mucking it up. My colleagues and I will keep working through the detail and try to get answers for the questions Australians are asking. …The next generation deserve their voice to be heard locally regionally and nationally. They deserve to be given as much opportunity as any other young Australians to thrive and prosper. This is the common ground we must find what all of us in public life must strive to deliver. Leeser says his second issue with the constitutional amendment is about the form of constitutional recognition, and something in legal terms which is known as a “chapeau” (which means “hat” in French): The third significant way that the government’s proposal recognises Indigenous Australians is through the preambular statement…. This is the set of words which reads in recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the first people of Australia and then the subsections sits underneath it. This type of provision is sometimes called a “chapeau”, it’s a symbolic statement that sets out an incontrovertible fact that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples are the first peoples of Australia. Of course, everyone agrees with the statement of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples are the first people of Australia. The issue with the chapeau is that it can frame the interpretation of the provision that sits underneath it or in this context, called in aid to the interpretation of other provisions of the constitution and that raises questions. For instance, the government proposes to confer constitutional function of making representations to the parliament and the executive. But by putting the provision under the chapeau, would we be implying representations can only be made if in some way they are in recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as first peoples of Australia. In other words, in simple terms, what rights, obligations and privileges are being recognised as first peoples and what does the term imply at all? Leeser goes on to explain his concern about the wording of the constitutional amendment, particularly the clause which mentions the voice will make presentations to the executive. We already heard much debate about the inclusion of executive government. As a matter of principle, I believe the voice of the local, regional and national level should be engaging with the decision-makers, it should be contributing to policy development, warning of problems emerging engaging and thoughtful debate. …But that’s not the issue here. Instead the question is - what are the implications of putting that clause in the constitution. The inclusion of that clause in the way to Stratford arrays three immediate issues. First, who can the voice talk to? Which agencies are in which are out it comes to being part of the executive government? Second, what can it talk about? What are matters relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians? Third, what does it mean to make representations? Does it imply or leave room for any reciprocal constitutional obligation on parliament or the executive? There are a few bold obsession to the contrary in the government’s explanatory materials but the issue has not been considered in any depth in any public forum. It is not enough to say these questions will be addressed in legislation afterwards, you can’t out-legislate the constitution. And I raise this issue is not only of a technical level but as a political one as well because this course will be the rallying point for the no campaign. Those who want the referendum to succeed, it puts the broader constitutional question at risk. ‘In the constitution every word and even capitals matter’ Leeser goes on to say as well as calling on the government to commit funding to the local and regional voices, the second area he wants to see get “back on track” is the wording of the proposed constitutional amendment: The second area where we must get the voice back on track is in relation to the wording of the proposed constitutional amendment. In the constitution every word and even capitals matter. There is nothing inconsequential in the constitution. The beauty and strength of our constitution is a mechanical sparse rulebook for our nation. Symbolic statements made with the best intent leave room for clever lawyers to egg on activist judges to imply all sorts of things that were never intended. This matters in the constitution because the high court is the arbiter, parliament cannot amend the judgement of the court, the courts interpretation is final. Shadow attorney general calls for establishment of local and regional voices Leeser says he wants to use this speech to discuss how to get the work on the voice “back on track and how we can give the idea of voice the best chance of success.” First, the government should recommit to local and regional voices and provide funding for them in the next month’s budget. Local and regional has to be part of any model put forward, it’s been forgotten by the government, ignored even in the voice design principles released last week. … I’m calling on the government to re-embrace the principles of the Calma Langton report, allocate funding in May’s budget to establish a local and regional voices, to start the policy and work on how to do this and we will back it in. …Ideally the local and regional voices would have been rolled out and retested before any national voices, which was always our plan. But we are where we are and I can’t undo the government passed my choices at this point. I want to be clear. To fail on local and regional voices is to deny voices to Indigenous Australians who live outside the major capitals and it will ultimately mean no change on the issues that matter. ‘Labor is messing this up’ Leeser goes on to criticise the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, for not having the “views of a person looking to reach consensus.” The approach has discarded one of the guiding principles Pat Dodson and I wrote about in our report, namely, and I quote, balancing the urgency of a Voice against the likelihood of referendum success. We have seen that. …What we witnessed in word, in deed, in action has been a repudiation of the collaborative spirit that is much the process since 2014. Good process builds consensus. It helps narrow the issues for the debate in the referendum, but Labor is messing this up. I’m so sad about that. I look at where we are compared to where we should be on this journey and I lamented, I truly do. In abandoning this approach of working to find common ground the government has been forsaking a vital ingredient that’s been instrumental in building public support and confidence as well as developing a model that has the best chance of moving the dial Indigenous health, education, housing, safety and economic advancement. Leeser laments ‘top-down’ approach of Labor government on voice Circling back to Leeser’s National Press Club address. The shadow attorney general says the process which he oversaw as part of the parliamentary select committee he co-chaired with Pat Dodson emphasised the importance of the regional bodies being implemented ahead of a national body. Leeser says the election of the Labor government with a plan to deliver the national body first has seen a “top down” approach implemented instead. In accordance with the timetable set by the Calma-Langton report, the Morrison government committed to the rollout of the local and regional bodies in December 2021 and budgeted a $32m commitment to get the process started. Our plan was to build from the ground up. The plan was for local and regional voices first as recommended by Calma Langton. Local and regional voices, then a national voice. Local and regional voices were the foundation. With the insight, life experience and moral authority moving up to Canberra rather than down from. That was the process in place at election day last year. Had we been elected in May last year those bodies would have been well on their way. … Unfortunately we lost the 2022 election and the way debate has been conducted has changed. I recognise that the prime minister made a referendum on the national voice a signature policy and he mentioned it at every campaign stop and election night. There was nothing hidden in what he wanted to do. But the deliberative process of the past decade engaging in debate, finding common ground, building coalitions, developing careful processes and working across the aisle has been abandoned. It is now top-down. A man and a woman have been found dead after a light plane crash in the Clarke Ranges in central Queensland. Police and emergency services located an aircraft shortly after 11am, believed to be the aircraft which was due to land at Lakeside. It comes after a frantic search for the passengers after a plane failed to arrive at an airpark west of Proserpine at 6.30pm on Sunday. The aircraft departed cattle station Natal Downs, south of Charters Towers on Sunday afternoon. Police said formal identification processes are still underway and no further information can be provided. Shadow Indigenous Australians minister Julian Leeser has now confirmed that the Liberal party will meet on Wednesday to decide its position on the voice to parliament. Speaking at the National Press Club, Leeser said the Liberals would meet to figure out their formal stance. On Wednesday, we are having a party room meeting to determine our position and determine our way forward. Leeser is emphasising there were different drafts to the voice conceived during the Abbott government: Anne Twomey was the principal draughts-person for the voice body we put to Tony Abbott in 2014. Anne’s drafting showed one way a voice in the constitution could be achieved. I signed up because the idea of the Pearson Twomey voice proposal was political influence, not judicial veto. In my mind, those words in 2014 were never meant to be inviolable. We put out an idea to show how it could be done. It was an idea that needed to be tested not just by lawyers, academics and activists but in the broader political debate among the Australian people. I saw it – not as the final word – but very much as Voice 1.0. Since that time, Anne Twomey has devised at least two other versions of provisions to enable a Voice in the constitution to help contribute to the discussion on debate. Voice 1.0 was not the only proposal. Warren Mundine and Tim Wilson were also developing an idea for local and regional voices. Their idea was an enhancement of the original idea. It was about empowering Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians in their communities right across the country. Making a difference on the ground. It was for that reason with proposals for a local and regional Voice and national body, the Uluru Statement from the heart speaks of voice but not voice to parliament. Leeser goes on: At the time we were developing this idea Noel Pearson was trying to work out a way to encourage constitutional conservatives to work with Indigenous leaders to advance constitutional recognition that both could support. We started to listen, to talk, to argue, to engage with each other, to try to find common ground. Noel’s proposal was for a national voice to advise on policies and laws affecting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. I support the idea of the voice. As a Liberal I believe in the dignity of the individual. I believe that the policy is made when the People directly affected by the policy are consulted on that policy. As a conservative I believe in the principle of subsidiarity. I believe through empowering people, building institutions and fitting responsibility and decision-making closer to people and local communities we are more likely to be successful in shifting the dial on Indigenous affairs. The result of that engagement was a package of reforms that we put to prime minister Abbott. The Declaration of Recognition, the rewording of the racist power in the constitution to become an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander power, the removal of the spent race-based provision in section 25 of the constitution, and the voice proposal which Noel had devised and workshop over several months with Greg Craven, Anne Twomey, Damien Freeman and myself. What piqued Leeser’s interest in constitutional recognition? While the framers of the constitution were not perfect they got a lot of things right. My interest in constitutional recognition was piqued in 2014 by the decision of the then prime minister Tony Abbott when he was elected to office to put constitutional recognition back on the agenda. I had concerns about his approach because I don’t believe the constitution is a place for symbolic and historic language. I believe there are legal risks in using such language and so my friend Damien Freeman and I began the work on an ideal which we could recognise the place of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders in our national life without the need for a constitutional amendment. The result was our idea of a non-constitutional Australian Declaration of Recognition. That document could be developed by Australians, affirmed at a national plebiscite, used in schools and parliaments across our civic, social and sporting life. It could say so much more because it was not tied down by the risks of judicial interpretation. Leeser speaks about his love for the constitution: As a non-Indigenous Australian I’ve been on a journey seeking to understand Indigenous perspectives on the issue of constitutional recognition. I came to the debate on constitutional recognition from a deep interest in constitutional history and constitutional law. In my maiden speech to parliament, I spoke to asking my parents for a copy of Australia’s constitution for my 10th birthday. Definitely earning me the moniker Nerdus Maximus. I have been involved in constitutional battles past, most notably the 1998 constitutional convention and as a member of the official “no” case committee during the republic referendum. We have a constitution that is the envy of the world. The constitution is the invisible pillar that holds our great national endeavour together. A document devoid of poetic or symbolic language, it is a practical, clear and concise enough document to fit in your pocket. And yet it was developed over a decade of negotiation and detailed debate and compromise. Our constitution has stood the test of time. Leeser is reflecting on the change he has seen regarding attitudes towards First Nations people in his lifetime. Like many Australians, I did not go up with Aboriginal people. I remember there being one or two Aboriginal people at school and some Aboriginal students at university but I did not get to know Aboriginal people or much about Aboriginal culture. As a child of the 1980s and 1990s, at school we were taught about hunter gatherer societies but the public consciousness was not then what it is today. When I go to schools and talk to people in my electorate, I know there is a hunger to know much more about the culture and traditions of Aboriginal people of our area, and that is a good thing. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and their culture is unique to our land. Their traditions, their stories are Australia’s edition and Australia’s stories and we should all do more to know or more of them. Julian Lesser begins National Press Club address with tribute to Yunupingu The shadow attorney general and shadow minister for Indigenous Australians, Julian Leeser, is addressing the National Press Club this lunchtime as the nation prepares for the referendum on the Indigenous voice to parliament later this year. Leeser begins paying homage to Yunupingu, who has died aged 74: We gather on a day for Australians which is particularly sad for all Australians but particularly Indigenous Australians. Yunupingu was one of the greatest indigenously modern Australia has produced, the leader of the Gumatj. He was a man of strength, conviction and determination, a true moral voice in our country who I have the privilege of meeting on two occasions. He spoke at this podium in 1977. He did what few could do, he fought and he built. He fought for rights, for freedoms and for respect. He worked in partnership to deliver land, education, jobs and opportunity. We remember Yunupingu today. We mourn Yunupingu today. His memory be a blessing. Committee reviewing security legislation A key federal parliamentary committee has launched a review of plans to overhaul Australia’s security clearance approvals. The government introduced legislation to parliament last week to ensure the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (Asio) would be responsible for issuing, maintaining and revoking Australia’s highest level of security clearance, known as “positive vetting”. The parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security announced today that it would review the legislation. The chair of the committee, the Labor MP Peter Khalil, issued a call for submissions from the public by 21 April. He said: Reviewing important national security legislation that, through the high-level access security clearances provide, will affect Australia’s national security architecture is a key part of the parliamentary oversight work of the PJCIS. The review will provide assurance that these changes provide a security framework that will last well into the future. For more on this issue see last week’s story: Shorten calls for action over robodebt revelations Speaking about the potential consequences for the former ministers involved in the Robodebt royal commission, Shorten says we’ll have to wait for the commission to report back any adverse findings - “but clearly something has to happen”. Shorten says the decision will be up to “fiercely independent” commissioner Catherine Holmes and the counsel assisting. However, he believes action is necessary: I think for some of the individuals, their behaviour was so egregiously negligent and disinterested, that you know, I think the evidence was damning already. Furthermore, all governments not just Liberal but Labor and any other government needs to just learn some of the lessons about making sure that whatever program you have, is it lawful, is it legal and if you’re getting complaints, are you listening to them? … We’ll find out soon enough the reports due on June the 30th. But I think it has been shocking the discovery of the lack of attention to detail, the the willingness for people to get into groupthink and just go along with a strategy which was unlawful and then for years – rather than dealing with the issue – discredit the messengers. Of the two ministers still in parliament, Stuart Robert and Scott Morrison, Shorten said: They can’t think that this royal commission has shone them in a in a great light to be honest, but we’ll let others make that decision. We’ll see what happens with the findings. The minister for government services, Bill Shorten, says the Liberal’s unexpected loss in the Aston byelection largely came down to the party leader Peter Dutton. Speaking to Sky News, Shorten isn’t shying away from criticising Dutton’s transition to opposition leader which he says hasn’t “cut the mustard”. I think image only goes skin deep. I think it’s a problem of substance. He still thinks he’s a Liberal cabinet minister in the Morrison government. There’s been no modesty or humility. They lost the last federal election. Yet Peter Dutton is pursuing every one of their policies. He hasn’t gotten the memo from the people of Australia that when you lose, you must look in the mirror and reevaluate your own policies. I mean, if you want someone to sit as opposition leader who can clench his jaw manfully, that’s Peter Dutton, but you need a bit more than one gear out of the bloke. I don’t know if he can make the transition to leading an opposition. And to do that, you’ve got to admit where your government’s got it wrong. He hasn’t even got up and said that the Robodebt royal commission is anything other than a witch hunt. The bloke has only got one gear, and that’s not good for Australian democracy. Child abuse is ‘disturbingly prevalent’ across nation, new study finds The Australian Human Rights Commission has called for urgent government action after a study showed child physical, emotional and sexual abuse is “disturbingly prevalent” across the nation, AAP reports. One in three Australian children experience physical abuse and one in four experience sexual abuse, according to a Queensland University of Technology survey of 8500 Australians published in the Medical Journal of Australia on Monday. The National Children’s Commissioner, Anne Hollonds, says the “confronting” findings show there’s an urgent need for a child wellbeing strategy. She said: We have no reporting on budget allocations for child wellbeing. We have no minister for children. We have no vision, and we have had no urgency for change. In a prosperous country like Australia, child wellbeing should be a bipartisan priority. Today we have a rare opportunity to build a national agreement to prioritise child wellbeing and create a roadmap for reform. The federal social services minister, Amanda Rishworth, and the attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, promised to look carefully at the findings when developing more targeted politics. The pair said: This is a wake-up call to all of us, across all levels of government, and the community. We must do better. This landmark study, the first high-quality, nationally representative study of the prevalence of all five forms of child maltreatment, must focus our minds on prevention and response to child maltreatment. Loans for homes extended falls in February as housing approvals edged higher A couple of housing related numbers from the ABS today that will feed into the Reserve Bank‘s consideration of whether to hike the key interest rate a record 11th consecutive time tomorrow. First up was dwelling approvals, with the total rising 4% in February, seasonally adjusted. Economists note this number can be very volatile, particularly for approvals of flats. In January, overall approvals fell 27%, as an example of the fluctuations. Houses in the private sector rose 11.3% in February but remain 13.6% lower than for February 2022, the ABS said. (January’s tally was at a 10-year low.) Daniel Rossi, ABS head of construction statistics, said: Private sector dwellings excluding house approvals fell a further 9.5% in February, following a 40.3% decline in January, and is at its lowest level recorded since July 2012. Total dwelling approvals have continued their downward trend since September 2022, following the conclusion of government stimulus and rising interest rates. Tasmania led the gain, with dwelling approvals more than doubling (122.1% higher) for some reason. Queensland when the other way, with approvals down the most, at 13.7%. As a hint of higher costs, the value of total building approvals rose 19.7%. The other set of numbers related to the value of new loans, with those for housing falling 0.9% to $22.6bn in February, seasonally adjusted, after a revised fall of 2.4% in January, the ABS said. Dane Mead, ABS’s head of finance and wealth, said new loans for owner-occupiers fell 1.2% to $15 bn in February 2023, while those for investors eased 0.5% to $7.6bn. He said: Housing finance continued to decline from the record highs in January 2022, with the total value of new loan commitments falling 33% since then. The RBA board will meet tomorrow morning. According to a Bloomberg survey, 16 economists reckon the central bank will leave its cash rate at 3.6%. Another 11 tip another 25 basis-point rise to 3.85%. My tip: a 15bp rise to 3.75% - time to get back to standard numbers! Kevin Rudd has recognised Yunupingu as “one of our greatest ever Australians” Former prime minister Kevin Rudd has remembered the Yolŋu elder, saying “there is no individual who did more than Yunupingu to illuminate the path of reconciliation for us all”: In the final decades of his momentous life, Yunupingu’s wisdom and experience led him to conclude that constitutional reform was the best way to ensure the security and wellbeing of everyone in our commonwealth. This was Yunupingu’s clear message when he presented me with a bark petition asking our government to commence a formal process for constitutional recognition, which we did. It is devastating that Yunupingu will not be with us in the days ahead, but his absence should steel our resolve to realise a future where Australians are truly reconciled. Tributes continue to flow for Yunupingu Senator Patrick Dodson said Yunupingu’s legacy is “immeasurable and will endure in the memory of all Australian people, especially for the Yolngu people, for generations”: He was a canny and forceful operator on those occasions when we stood together to take on governments intent on diminishing the powers of the land councils. He weathered tempestuous engagements with good humour, and was always prepared to defend customary law and the rights of traditional owners. Environment minister Tanya Plibersek said his legacy will “leave a mark for generations”: Indigenous Australians minister Linda Burney said: His gifts to us as a nation was a life of truth-telling and a passionate belief in his people and in Australia, and we as a nation can gift to him a successful referendum later this year. In his final months Yunupingu reminded us: “the future is our responsibility”, and that we all have a responsibility to show leadership on: reconciliation, recognition, and the referendum. Greens leader Adam Bandt said Yunupingu “embodied the strength and heart of his people”: Peter Dutton remembers Yunupingu as ‘one of our greatest Australians’ The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, has paid tribute to Yunupingu, paying homage to the revered Yolŋu elder’s life and role advancing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander land rights. Dutton also reflected on his recent visit to Yunupingu’s homelands, ending his tribute with these words: When I visited Arnhem Land in February, the influence of Yunupingu was omnipresent in the community. Testimony to Yunupingu’s achievements, he was named Australian of the Year in 1978, made a Member of the Order of Australia in 1985, and received an Honorary Doctor of Laws from the University of Melbourne in 2015. Yunupingu passed away on his land in Arnhem Land, among his people and with his family. Today we acknowledge the life and legacy of not just a great Indigenous Australian, but one of our greatest Australians. Albanese continues on relationship with China In the interview on 6PR Perth, Anthony Albanese also backed the role of state premiers in making trips to China to boost the trading relationship. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, attracted some criticism amid accusations about a lack of transparency over his trip to China last week. Other state leaders Mark McGowan (Western Australia) and Annastacia Palaszczuk (Queensland) are also planning visits. The prime minister said today that he was supportive of state premiers going to China, and noted that it was still Australia’s biggest trading partner: Absolutely I am because it is about jobs and it is about them looking after their states. Albanese reiterated his government’s overall approach to the relationship, including looking for “cooperation with China wherever we can”. He said Australia would continue to “stand up” for its policies wherever there were differences. The prime minister said it was “a good thing” that he met China’s president, Xi Jinping, on the sidelines of the G20 summit in November, and it was also positive that the assistant trade minister, Tim Ayres, visited the country last week. There is still no date locked in, but Albanese added: I look forward to my trade minister, Don Farrell, visiting China in coming weeks. Albanese said he, personally, had “no plans at this point in the time” to travel to China, but he reiterated his past comments that he would go if invited. Albanese said dialogue was “always a good thing”: That doesn’t mean we don’t have differences. We’re a great democracy. China is not a democracy. With that, comes differences. He pointed out that a lot of Australian jobs and economic activity were connected to China and other major trading partners. Asked about comments from the Chinese ambassador to Australia, Xiao Qian, that China may be interested in investing in events such as the 2032 Brisbane Olympics, Albanese said the Australian and Queensland governments were “not looking for any other governments to be engaged”. Albanese said: We’ll be running the Olympics. For more on the latest trade talks looming in Beijing this week, see this story: PM condemns Russia, calls for immediate end to war in Ukraine The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has been asked about Russia taking over the UN Security Council presidency (in the latest monthly rotation, a development Julian Borger covered for the Guardian last Friday). Albanese told 6PR Perth: Russia has shown contempt for the international rule of law so that is a very unfortunate circumstance. It is just a rotation but Russia, if they have any respect for rule of law, for the rights of nation states to exist within their borders, if they have any respect for national sovereignty, they should stop the illegal and immoral war against the people of Ukraine right now. Liberal MP James Stevens on ‘bitterly disappointing’ Aston result The Liberal MP James Stevens, who holds the South Australian seat of Sturt on just 0.5%, has commented on the “bitterly disappointing” byelection result in Aston. Stevens told ABC Radio it was a “very serious message to all of us, members of the federal Liberal party, myself in Sturt and the leadership team”. He recognised that “if replicated it would see us barely exist in major metropolitan cities across Australia”. The Liberals “can’t be a party of government” with such a result and Stevens would “absolutely” lose his seat if it occurred at a general election. Stevens said that the Albanese government is still “very much in a political honeymoon”, the Liberal party had “lost a popular local member in Alan Tudge, seeking to be replaced by an excellent candidate [Roshena Campbell] but one who didn’t live in the electorate”. He said: We need to reconnect with a lot of our supporters that have drifted away and have not drifted back ... [We have to accept] We didn’t lose the last election and that’s a one off that will never be repeated again. Stevens identified home ownership as “one of the huge opportunities to reconnect with younger voters seriously challenged getting into the housing market”. Asked about social issues like Liberal opposition to the Indigenous voice, Stevens rejected the view the Liberals were on the wrong side. Rather “we’re not giving them the positive economic security policy positions that used to be significant in their decision to support the Liberal party”. Stevens said that the voice is “a decision for all Australians” at the referendum suggesting it would not be the focus of the next election. Ken Wyatt calls for conscience vote ‘to move forward’ Ken Wyatt, the former Liberal minister for Indigenous Australians, has urged his party to give members a conscience vote on the voice to parliament - saying it would “allow this country to move forward”. As we reported earlier, it’s expected the Liberals will meet in Canberra this week to discuss the voice. Sky News reports the party is more likely to oppose the government’s preferred model, and potentially propose a model of their own. One Liberal MP, Jason Wood, has already said today that he would prefer a conscience vote. Wyatt, Indigenous Australians minister under the former Coalition government, told Sky he hoped to see the same. He said: I would hope that the leadership would give members a conscience vote. I’d just say to the leadership: allow a conscience vote to allow this country to move forward. Wyatt acknowledged that there were many in the current Liberal partyroom who strongly opposed the voice, but said a conscience vote would allow supporters to show their support. Wyatt, who brought the Langton-Calma co-design report to the Coalition cabinet several times, has criticised his party on numerous occasions for questioning the voice. Last month he told Guardian Australia that it would be a mistake “globally” for the Liberals to not offer bipartisan support to a referendum, adding to a perception the party was “racist”. Burney challenges shadow minister ahead of NPC address Further to the last post on the Liberals’ partyroom meeting on the voice this week, shadow Indigenous Australians minister Julian Leeser is speaking at the National Press Club this afternoon - so we’ll expect to hear more from that later today. Indigenous Australians minister Linda Burney just gave a press conference in Shellharbour, NSW. She said Leeser, a longtime and notable supporter of an Indigenous voice, needed to explain at the NPC why the Liberals could oppose the referendum. Burney said: Julian Leeser needs to explain to the Australian people why his party wants to deny a choice and a vote for the Australian people towards decency at the end of the year. Burney pointed to Indigenous wellbeing statistics that are worse than the general population, as a reason for supporting the voice. Why is it that Aunty Jodie and I have a life expectancy 10 years shorter than our non-Aboriginal sisters? Why is it that Aboriginal babies are not born at a healthy birth weight? Why is it that so many of our people are in jails and locked up in youth detention centres? Why is it that so many of our children are removed into statutory home care and why is it that we are the sickest, most incarcerated people on the planet? These are the reasons why the voice is so important. These are the reasons why Australia has a choice to make at the end of this year about recognition and consultation. The minister for Indigenous affairs, Linda Burney, has this morning paid tribute to revered Yolŋu elder Yunupingu who has died aged 74. Speaking in Wollongong, Burney dedicated the referendum later this year to Yunupingu who believed deeply in the need for the voice. A great sadness has settled on Australia today. With the passing of Dr Yunupingu in his beloved Arnhem Land. He was Australian of the Year way back in 1978 and was one of the most significant leaders for two decades of First Nations people across this country. He was the clan leader of the Gumatj clan. A Yolŋu man. Very responsible for the Bark petition that now hangs in Parliament House. He fought with a passion for his people, for land, for identity, and he loved this country. He said he was the fire. And he believed very deeply in a referendum to recognise Aboriginal people in the Australian Constitution. It is hard to put into words what this loss means for this country. It is hard to imagine the next Garma Festival without Mr Yunupingu. It is hard to imagine going forward for many people. But his legacy is, his inspiration, will live on. And I want to dedicate what will be a successful referendum at the end of the year to Dr Yunupingu. Australia’s resources and energy exports are near their peak - if not already past it. The federal government releases quarterly stats on the outlook for resource and energy exports, and the latest update suggests the boom years may be almost behind us. On the upside, the government forecasts those exports to hit a record $464bn this financial year, thanks in no small measure to Russia’s war on Ukraine sending many buyers scrambling to source commodities from anywhere but Russia. Brazil’s iron ore export troubles have also meant China has had to buy more of our red dirt, pandemic lockdowns notwithstanding. LNG earnings will hit $91bn in 2022–23, or triple the revenue of 2020–21. Thermal coal exports will also reach $65bn this financial year, up from around $16 billion in 2020–21. With climate conditions in the Pacific and Indian oceans favouring a retreat from the wetter-than-usual weather of the past three years, the government is also predicting less chance of disruptions for bulk commodity transport. (Drought and bushfires might have some influence, though, should a strong El Nino take hold in the Pacific.) Looking ahead, though, from 2023-24, earnings from LNG and thermal coal are likely to fall back towards pre-Covid levels, the report said. As the chart above shows, thermal coal in particular is forecast to retreat more than most other commodities. Still, the government reckons prices for the fossil fuel used in power stations will likely enjoy relatively high prices for a while because of “a lack of spending to bring on new supply matches the impact of diminishing world demand”. We’ll have to see if the Albanese government’s toughened safeguard mechanism actually works to reduce that future supply from Australia. If it doesn’t, it’s not much of a safeguard. Greenwich calls on Hanson to take action against Latham The independent MP for Sydney, Alex Greenwich, the target of NSW One Nation leader Mark Latham’s homophobic tweets, is calling on Pauline Hanson to take further action “to protect her own name”. Greenwich told Sky News this morning he hoped the Coalition would refuse to work with Latham, as the government has: Chris Minns, our new premier, has made a really strong stance saying that he won’t work with with Mr Latham and I looking forward to the Coalition hopefully saying the same thing. You know, there’s no place for this kind of narrative in modern-day politics. Greenwich said the premier was correct when he said comments such as Latham’s “unleash ghouls on those who already face discrimination”: My office has had repeated calls from people making offensive remarks. We’ve had to report a number of people to the police, police have arrested people. My social medias are flooded with really graphic homophobic attacks. So Mr Minns the new premier is absolutely right that Latham has unleashed the ghouls. But he’s been doing this to the LGBT community for quite a while. Greenwich said his office has also been contacted by One Nation voters: My office for the first time ever has been contacted by One Nation supporters and voters expressing their outrage at Mr Latham and expressing their support for me. Clearly, this you know, the party that Mr Latham represents in Parliament House is named after Pauline Hanson. Surely if she is so outraged and disgusted by his vile homophobic remarks, she’s going to need to take action to protect her own name. Liberals to debate voice stance Sky News is reporting that Liberal MPs will be summoned to Canberra on Wednesday for a special party-room meeting to discuss the Indigenous voice referendum. Sky’s political editor Andrew Clennell reports that “the expected position” of the Liberals would be to oppose the Labor government’s plan for a constitutionally enshrined voice, but that they would discuss an “alternative proposition” of a voice legislated through the parliament instead. A constitutionally enshrined voice was the option preferred by delegates at the Uluru dialogues that led to the statement from the heart; a legislated voice was seen as inferior as it could be abolished by a future parliament, like previous Indigenous bodies including Atsic. Several Liberal MPs said they weren’t yet aware of the meeting, when contacted this morning. We’ve reached out to the offices of Liberal leader Peter Dutton and shadow Indigenous Australians minister Julian Leeser for comment. It was earlier expected that the Liberals may not come to a position on the voice until next month or later, during the process of the parliamentary inquiry into the constitutional amendment, which was only set up last week. Liberal MP Jason Wood, appearing on Sky, said he would prefer a conscience vote on the issue - even though he said a survey from his office found that voters in his electorate were against the voice: I’d prefer we go to a conscience vote in the party room, allowing members to have their choice. He said he would like to do a wider survey of his electorate to gauge voter views. The president of the Royal College of GPs, Dr Nicole Higgins, says the news of the report showing GPs are undercharging rather than overcharging their patients comes as vindication for the profession. About 85% of GPs nationwide have saved Medicare more than $350m from undercharging patients in consultations, a study suggests. Of the 2,760 GPs canvassed in the study, nearly 85% undercharged Medicare for at least one consultation within a sample of 40 consultations. Researchers from the University of Sydney estimated the undercharging by GPs has resulted in savings of $351.7m to Medicare in 2021-22 during about 90,000 consultations. The study published in the Australian Journal of General Practice also found GPs undercharged about 12% of total consultations and only overcharged 1.6% overall. Lead author Dr Christopher Harrison said: Our study has shown that GPs are more likely to err towards undercharging, than to overcharging. This contrasts with previous research and reports alleging widespread fraud related to GP billing of Medicare. General practice is in crisis. Allegations of fraud have been damaging to a workforce that is struggling to attract medical graduates to general practice. Harrison said a major reason why GPs undercharge, even for long consultations, was the fear of being audited. The paper analysed data from the Bettering the Evaluation And Care of Health program, a national study of GP clinical activity in Australia that ran from 1998 to 2016, concentrating on 2013-16. Each year, a different group of 1,000 GPs recorded information on paper about their consultation sessions for 100 consecutive consenting patients. The data was used to calculate the cost differences between the Medicare benefits schedule items charged and the MBS items that could have been charged based on the length of the consultation. The results from the analysis were projected to the total number of MBS items claimed in 2021-22 using the July 2022 rebates. – AAP New Australian play Prime Facie has won big at the UK’s prestigious Olivier awards overnight, picking up best new play for playwright and former lawyer Suzie Miller (beating Aaron Sorkin’s adaptation of To Kill a Mockingbird, among others); and best actor for Jodie Comer of Killing Eve, who starred in the one-woman show on the West End. The courtroom drama is about a ruthless barrister, Tessa, who specialises in defending men who are accused of sexual assault – until she is assaulted herself. In a four-star review in the Guardian, Arifa Akbar wrote: Prima Facie’s final messages are urgent in highlighting who our laws fail to protect. If they are delivered in hammer blows, there is power in hearing them spoken on a West End stage, and Comer manages to infuse breath-taking emotional drama in every last word. The play opens on Broadway next week starring Comer in every role, with another production premiering in Adelaide on 28 April, directed by David Mealor and starring Underbelly’s Caroline Craig. David Littleproud is asked to weigh in on NSW One Nation Leader Mark Latham’s homophobic tweet about independent MP Alex Greenwich, given that members of his own party had in the past “cozied up” to him and One Nation members. Littleproud says he has drawn a line in the sand when it comes to Latham: Where is Pauline Hanson on this? Why is he even in a political party any more? … If he was in my party and made that sort of remark, and it shouldn’t ever be said again, what he what he actually put up on Twitter. But where is the leadership of Pauline Hanson? All she’s done is gone to ground saying he won’t call me back. Well, take control of your party, call him in and show that you have some leadership. In fact, when some of my colleagues in the last parliament were giving medical advice on vaccines, I called them out publicly and wasn’t afraid to do that as the deputy leader. We all have a responsibility. We have a privileged position as being politicians and, if someone oversteps the mark, then they need to be hauled in and they need to give an explanation. If their explanation isn’t good enough, then you have to have the courage and conviction to move them on. Labor conducted ‘character assassination’ of Dutton, Littleproud says David Littleproud also says the way in which Labor shaped the narrative around the Aston byelection was a “character assassination” of Liberal leader Peter Dutton. Littleproud was critical of how the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, as well as Labor campaign material, had framed Dutton. He believes federal politics should instead look to the example of the NSW state election: Chris Minns and Dominic Perrottet fought on ideas – not on personalities or character assassination. And I think we, as politicians, need to do better because that’s why the Australian people don’t like politicians. When you’re trying to bring down an individual on character assassination. That’s not we should be doing a notion of the prime minister of this country. That’s an exalted position in society. And I think the Labor party, while it might have achieved what it was looking for, I don’t think it’s advanced the narrative of federal politics any any further as a result … I think New South Wales election paved the way for a kinder, smarter way of politics being done where it is a contest of ideas, and that’s what it should be. Littleproud weighs in on Aston loss The leader of the Coalition’s junior partner, David Littleproud, is delivering his postmortem on the Liberal’s historic and unexpected loss in the Aston byelection at the weekend. Littleproud says the Liberal party lost credibility amid the fallout of state MP Moira Deeming attending a rally headlined by British anti-transgender activist Kellie-Jay Keen where neo-Nazis were photographed performing the Nazi salute. Deeming says she’s done nothing wrong after attending the rally that was “gatecrashed” by neo-Nazis. Littleproud this morning told Sky News: As the Nationals leader, I don’t want to give too much advice, but you don’t have to go too far past the cluster that was the Victorian Liberal party last week in dealing with Moira Deeming. It was untidy, and whatever the semblance of respect the brand had in Victoria was lost during that week. I think the fact also that the people of Aston were asked to vote three times in the last 10 months didn’t help. And effectively they had a candidate that that was parachuted in and no matter how good she was – and I think she was a very credible candidate – the electorate wants someone that’s local. A local champion that’s connected to community. Marking the battle to save the Franklin River, 40 years on As the environmental adage goes, “Conservation is temporary, destruction is permanent.” On that sombre note it’s worth remembering that four decades ago, the monumental battle to save Tasmania’s Franklin River was nearing its happy conclusion. From the time of the start of the blockade, in December 1982, right up until the high court’s ruling on 1 July 1983 in favour of the Hawke government’s bid to halt the “Gordon below Franklin” dam, the future of this spectacular region was in doubt. We look at some of the memories of those who have gone down the river lately (and at key anniversary periods in the past): The Tasmanian government, then run by the Liberals, planned at least one other dam on the river had the first one got up. (Tasmania’s Labor party at the time also backed the damming of the river.) Lots of questions remain, including whether a campaign to stop the dam would succeed today. On the one hand, social media would spread the cause far and wide. On the other, anti-protest laws in Tasmania and on mainland states would raise the costs significantly for those willing to risk arrest. Anyway, if readers are wondering whether to take the plunge (literally) and raft down the Franklin, your correspondent highly recommends it. Latham says he’s on leave Mark Latham has thanked supporters after being widely condemned for a homophobic tweet and told them he would be on leave until the New South Wales upper house results had been finalised. The state One Nation leader posted to Twitter late last night: Thanks everyone, I’m now on leave. Back when we finally get a LC result. At the weekend premier Chris Minns said his government would not work with Latham at all and would not support any claim by Latham to chair an upper house committee. Latham has refused to apologise for his homophobic and graphic tweet targeted at independent MP Alex Greenwich. It has been deleted. Punters at Melbourne’s Crown Casino will have to take a 15-minute break every three hours and won’t be able to gamble for more than 36 hours in a single week under changes to the venue’s code of conduct. The state’s gaming minister, Melissa Horne, this morning announced the changes to the casino’s responsible gambling code of conduct, which she says will minimise gambling-related harm. It includes new limits on the length of time a person may gamble at the casino, with Crown required to enforce 15-minute breaks if a person has been gambling for three continuous hours. Anyone who has gambled for 12 hours in any 24-hour period will be required to take a break for 24 hours, with no person able to gamble for more than 36 hours in a single week. Crown staff will have powers to exclude them from the casino floor. The changes act on recommendation 11 of the royal commission into Crown’s suitability to hold a casino licence, which was completed two years ago. Horne says of the 33 recommendations from the royal commission, 29 have been either fully implemented or legislated and awaiting commencement in the coming months. Horne has also gazetted another direction to gambling advertisers to replace the former “gamble responsibly” taglines on advertisements with new evidence-based warnings that better challenge people to think about their gambling activity and minimise harm. Some new taglines include: “Chances are, you’re about to lose,” and, “You win some. You lose more.” The taglines will also be accompanied by details of gambling support services to encourage people to seek help. Horne said: This direction reflects my expectations that Crown must aim to be a global leader in the reduction of gambling harm – or lose their license. Crown is on track to implement mandatory pre-commitment in all electronic gaming machines by the end of this year. When combined with the strengthened code of conduct, the harm reduction protections will be world leading for a casino of this size. She says Crown has six months to update its code and any breaches may lead to disciplinary action by the Victorian Gambling and Casino Control Commission. The maximum penalty for a breach is up to $100m. Albanese hails ‘targeted’ budget measures Circling back to the prime minister, Anthony Albanese’s, interview with ABC Radio. Before he addressed the breaking news of the death of Yunupingu, Albanese said the measures included the May budget would be “targeted”. If you target investment in the right way you can have a win win. Labor’s largest budget cost would be its childcare reform, which, along with other measures including fee-free Tafe places, would be a responsible investment which would not add to inflation, the PM said. Albanese did not give away whether the government was considering a higher petroleum resource rent tax, which the Australian Financial Review said was on the budget agenda on Friday. The publication claimed a source familiar with the discussions said the government was trying to find a way to bring the PRRT receipts forward. Albanese only said that the government would receive the review of the PRRT – which the Morrison government initiated – before the budget was delivered. ‘He touched so many people with his gracious leadership and kindness,’ Langton says Prof Marcia Langton, Indigenous academic and professor as well as a close friend of Yunupingu, is remembering him as a “magnificent person and a magnificent leader”: Langton told ABC Radio: Many know him as a ceremonial leader because of his towering presence, leading ceremonies at the Garma festival for so many years and, also most importantly, at events that he himself curated in order to present representations to prime ministers and ministers of Australian governments. Throughout his life, he has spoken and made representations to every prime minister of his adulthood. He was a great clan leader, a great family man, and very much loved by so many Australians to come into contact with him through his Garma festival, and so many other good works. He was a musician. He was one of the most important singers and north-east Arnhem Land … So many people will be in mourning for him. He touched so many people with his gracious leadership and kindness. Such a shame really he didn’t live to see better outcomes. The RN Breakfast host asks Langton about the fact that Yunupingu didn’t live to see the voice to parliament referendum he fought for: Indeed it was his idea. I was with him in Arnhem Land. And he said to me, I want to see Noel Pearson. They’d never met and he told me to find Noel and get him to come speak to him. Noel jumped on a plane immediately … [Yunupingu] put to him constitutional recognition as a matter of the highest importance because … he felt the existential threat towards his clan, and other Aboriginal people. ‘A man who stood tall in his beloved country, and worked to lift our entire continent’ The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has released an official statement on the death of Yunupingu: Yunupingu walked in two worlds with authority, power and grace, and he worked to make them whole – together. What he could see was not the reinvention of Australia, but the realisation of a greater one. With his passing, consider what we have lost. A leader. A statesman. A painter. A dancer. A singer and musician who always carried his father’s clapsticks and felt the power they carried within them. Australian of the Year in 1978. Member of the Order of Australia. National treasure. A remarkable member of a remarkable family. A great Yolngu man. A great Australian. A man who stood tall in his beloved country, and worked to lift our entire continent in the process. Yunupingu understood a fundamental truth: if you want to make your voice count, you have to make sure that it’s heard. He made sure with the sheer power of his advocacy for land rights. He made sure when he helped draft the Yirrkala Bark Petitions, which delivered such a powerful message that resounded within the walls of the nation’s Parliament. And he made sure when he took part in that masterclass of concise and – he hoped – unifying eloquence, the Uluru Statement from the Heart. Albanese says as Yunupingu put it: At Uluru we started a fire, a fire we hope burns bright for Australia. Albanese goes on: At Garma last year, after I announced the details of the referendum, he asked me, “Are you serious this time?” I replied: “Yes, we’re going to go for it.” When I spoke with him just over a week ago, I told him I was confident we would get there. This brought him some comfort, as did his totems of fire and baru, the saltwater crocodile, which watched over him in his final days. Now Yunupingu is gone, but the gurtha – the great tongue of flame and truth with which spoke to us – is still with us. As it burns away all that is superfluous and false, it lights the path ahead for us. Just as he saw what was going on around him with great clarity, he was crystalline when he turned his gaze within. In Yunupingu’s own words: My inner life is that of the Yolngu song cycles, the ceremonies, the knowledge, the law and the land. This is yothu yindi. Balance. Wholeness. Completeness. A world designed in perfection, founded on the beautiful simplicity of a mother and her newborn child; as vibrant and as dynamic as the estuary where the saltwaters meet the freshwaters, able to give you everything you need. Albanese writes: He belongs to all of that now. Our hearts go out especially to the Yolngu, the Gumatj clan, and the great Yunupingu family. To all who loved him, to all who were moved by him, to all there who have gazed out to where the Gulf of Carpentaria meets the sky. We will never again hear his voice anew, but his words – and his legacy – will keep speaking to us. Yunupingu now walks in another place, but he has left such great footsteps for us to follow here in this one. Prime minister pays tribute to Yunupingu Prime minister Anthony Albanese has paid tribute to the Yolŋu man Yunupingu, one of the most significant Indigenous figures in history and a former Australian of the year, as “an extraordinary leader”. When told of his death during an interview on Radio National, the PM said: He was one of the greatest of Australians. An extraordinary leader of his people, respected right across Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australia. Albanese said “he showed the way”. A towering figure in the campaign for Indigenous constitutional recognition, and a member of the advisory group on the voice to parliament, Yunupingu has been spoken of often by Albanese and Indigenous Australians minister Linda Burney in the scope of the referendum. Albanese has previously spoken of visiting the Garma festival last year and speaking to Yunupingu about the referendum. The PM mentioned this conversation in the RN interview, saying Yunupingu had asked him, “Are you serious?” about the push for a referendum. The PM said: I said to him that I was serious, that we would do it. Albanese said he would speak with Yunupingu’s family about the potential of holding a state funeral. Yunupingu’s daughter Binmila Yunupiŋu has issued the following statement behalf of the family: Today we mourn with deep love and great sadness the passing of our dearly loved father Yunupiŋu. The holder of our sacred fire, the leader of our clan and the path-maker to our future. The loss to our family and community is profound. We are hurting, but we honour him and remember with love everything he has done for us. We remember him for his fierce leadership, and total strength for Yolŋu and for Aboriginal people throughout Australia. He lived by our laws always. Yunupiŋu lived his entire life on his land, surrounded by the sound of bilma (clapsticks), yidaki (didgeridoo) and the manikay (sacred song) and dhulang (sacred designs) of our people. He was born on our land, he lived all his life on our land and he died on our land secure in the knowledge that his life’s work was secure. He had friendship and loyalty to so many people, at all levels, from all places. Our father was driven by a vision for the future of this nation, his people’s place in the nation and the rightful place for Aboriginal people everywhere. In leaving us, we know that Dad’s loss will be felt in many hearts and minds. We ask you to mourn his passing in your own way, but we as a family encourage you to rejoice in the gift of his life and leadership. There will never be another like him. In time we will announce the dates for bäpurru (ceremonies) that will see him returned to his land and to his fathers. These ceremonies will be held in North Eastern Arnhem Land. We ask the media to respect our grieving space over the coming weeks as we put together ceremonial arrangements to honour Dad. Instead of flowers, we invite those of you who were touched by Dad’s fire to share with us your personal recollections and memories of his life. This will lift our spirits. ‘My party needs to earn the trust of Melbourne again’ Keith Wolahan, one of two remaining federal Liberal MPs in Melbourne, has told ABC News this morning that the onus is on the party to earn the trust of the Victorian capital again. He said the Aston loss at the weekend “wasn’t an easy night for my party”: I think the first thing we need to do as a party is to keep our cool and reflect on the message. But clearly, my party needs to earn the trust of Melbourne again. I’m one of only two seats that are in Melbourne. I think people want us to focus on them and their problems. I think they see my party, particularly here in Victoria – we hear these labels of moderates and conservatives, but the Liberal party has values that I think speak to mainstream Australia. We need to talk about that more. Wolahan said the infighting in the state Liberal party was one of many reasons for the historic byelection loss. But he continued to back party leader Peter Dutton: Politics is about messaging, but also substance and character. Peter Dutton is a person of substance and character. I’ve got to know him well over the last 10 months. As I said live on air, I’ve seen good and bad leaders. Peter Dutton is a really good leader. I’m confident we can do that … Of course it’s not a good time. But I’ve been a member of the Liberal party since the late 90s. And I’ve seen the tide come and go. And it’s important that you pick yourself up and you properly analyse the messages and provide solutions. I don’t think – we’ve heard from commentators over the many decades that it’s the end of the Liberal party. And it never is, because we have a lot to offer this country and this state. But we have to communicate those solutions. NSW will become the latest state to ban mobile phones during school hours. Premier Chris Minns told ABC News Breakfast the statistics back the measure, which will be introduced in the state’s public high schools: The statistics are in. We know that kids who are in schools who have a mobile-phone ban in place are getting better test results, there’s more social interaction at school, there’s more physical interaction at school. We’re seeing the principal of Davidson high school saying he’s seen a massive turnaround in behaviour – less bullying within his school – since he implemented a mobile-phone ban. In Western Australia, South Australia, the Northern Territory and Victoria – all of those states have implemented a ban, and I don’t want to see New South Wales kids fall behind. I know a lot of adults find it difficult to concentrate when a mobile phone is in front of them, so I don’t know why we expect children to have that kind of discipline. Australia’s first legal officer is bringing together the nation’s police ministers to urgently progress the national firearms register, AAP reports. Attorney general Mark Dreyfus will convene the roundtable today as the federal government works to expedite the development of the register after high-profile shootings. National cabinet ordered police ministers to report back by the middle of the year after the shooting of two police officers and a third person in Wieambilla, Queensland, in December. Dreyfus said Australia already had some of the world’s strongest gun laws but there was room for improvement: The Albanese government is committed to working closely with jurisdictions on this initiative, which is vital to preserve the safety of the community and police. A national firearms register will ensure police across all Australian jurisdictions have timely and accurate information to assess any firearms risk posed and protect the community from harm. Prime minister Anthony Albanese said it was a necessary measure after state and territory leaders were briefed by Australia’s top spy about the rise of rightwing extremism and so-called “sovereign citizens”. Former MPs say Liberals must ‘do the hard policy training’ Staying on the fallout from Aston, two former Liberal MPs who lost their seats to teal candidates at last year’s federal election have penned a piece in the Australian Financial Review this morning echoing Malcolm Turnbull’s criticisms of the party’s direction. Tim Wilson and Jason Falinski write that “Aston lances the delusion the party can abandon urban electorates because electoral fortunes all reside in the outer suburbs”: Nostalgia about Aston as the perceived turnaround point of the Howard government also reflects why the Liberals lost. Liberals are still approaching politics like it is the early 2000s, when voters got their news from nightly TV broadcasts and demography was their friend, with dominant anglo Boomers whose worlds were relatively small. The world has moved on. Voters are younger and more worldly, and more are angry and feel the system is rigged against them. And the answer from the Liberals is to tell them they’ve “never had it so good” … Nostalgic for the Howard era, many commentators say the Liberal Party isn’t conservative enough and have misdiagnosed the party’s problems, keeping its supporters focused on the wrong battlefield. If politics is downstream from culture and is a contest of ideas, then for too long Liberals have turned up half an hour late to play a game at Marvel Stadium when the lights are on at the MCG. The battlefield isn’t about being more progressive or conservative. Politics is about power, and who is empowered. Labor wants to empower Canberra, corporates and industry super. The correct battlefield for the Liberal Party should be policies that deliver empowered citizens, community and competitive commerce, not how to empower Canberra differently. Liberals should have ridden a demographic wave and fought last year’s election on the importance of home ownership over super, but it chose not to until it was too late. Until Liberals turn up to the ground, do the hard policy training so they can frame the contest and accentuate their strengths, the electoral outcome will be predictable. Malcolm Turnbull is now speaking to ABC Radio about the Liberal party’s direction after the Aston byelection loss: [In Victoria] the party has gone backwards dramatically since I was overthrown as leader of the Liberal party. The problem is the party is now in a position where what had hitherto been the crown jewels, the safer seats, most of them are now in the hands of teals and now they’re losing mortgage-belt seats. Which is where we’re told by the rightwing press is where the Liberal party is going to be more valued if they swing to the right. Turnbull is sceptical of what one of the two Liberals left representing metropolitan Melbourne, Jason Wood, told the program. Wood believes the party just needs to sell its leader Peter Dutton better. The former PM highlights that Dutton is being marketed, but by Labor: The idea of putting Peter Dutton on posters everywhere … Peter is on posters everywhere, but they’re Labor posters. Turnbull says it’s clear the party has to move back to the centre “where the voters are.” However, he says he doesn’t know who an alternative Liberal leader could be. I’m just making the point that to move to the centre would be very difficult for Dutton… You’ve got Dutton out there again on Insiders, essentially rubbishing the move to renewable energy and then raising the furphy of nuclear power.. this is all effectively culture war stuff. Turnbull and Archer call for Liberals to return to centre Malcolm Turnbull and Bridget Archer are calling for the Liberals to return to centrist values after the weekend’s historic byelection loss. The Albanese government became the first to win an opposition seat in a byelection in more than a century. Turnbull has told my colleague Amy Remeikis the party’s future rested on its ability to change course – and leader: The problem is that they have to move back to the centre. It is hard to see how that can be done with a leader who is so indelibly associated with the right of the party and whose support base in the Murdoch media is calling for the Liberal party to move further to the right. Backbencher Archer, one of the party’s leading moderates, made similar calls for a return to the centre, telling the Sydney Morning Herald yesterday: I think the party needs to stop ideological dog whistling and return to centrist Liberal values. You’ve got ideological culture warriors who would rather we lose than make space for a diversity of views and that’s a problem ... the party is at a crossroads and needs to decide – it’s a choice between ideology and electability. Archer told the paper there was a strong case for fresh blood on the opposition frontbench because “we have to have a commitment to change and renewal”. Australian endurance rower Michelle Lee will arrive in Cairns this morning after 235 days at sea, AAP reports. The solo seafarer has traversed more than 14,000km on her journey to Queensland’s far north, rowing from the coast of Ensenada in Mexico. The months-long expedition has taken Lee through the paths of five hurricanes and four cyclones, including the devastating Cyclone Gabrielle. She said: My patience has been tried and tested, I’m ready to land. I’m just dreaming of stepping on land. I expect it will take me a week to become a socially acceptable human again. The mammoth feat is not the first for Lee, a 50-year-old massage therapist from Sydney’s north-west. In 2018 she became the first Australian woman to row across the Atlantic Ocean. The achievement led to her being named the 2019 National Geographic adventurer of the year. Throughout her journey, Lee has shared regular dispatches from her 7.7-metre carbon-fibre vessel, the Australian Maid. Updates detail the awe of rowing alongside schools of fish approaching the Great Barrier Reef, finding a handbag and wattle branch lost at sea, and a craving for a Devonshire tea with all the trimmings. Scones, fresh cream and a hot cup of tea are not far away for Lee, who is already planning her first few meals on land. She said: A stack of pancakes is going to be so amazing, as is a bunch of celery, some chopped capsicum and cucumber. The Australian Maid will carry Lee to the Cairns marina, where crowds are expected to welcome her home about 9am AEST. The attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, will meet state and territory police ministers today to discuss the creation of a national firearms register. National cabinet ordered police ministers to report back after the Wieambilla shooting that left two police officers and a civilian dead last December. This morning in Cairns, Australian endurance rower Michelle Lee will set foot on land for the first time after 235 days at sea. She hass traversed more than 14,000km on her solo journey from the coast of Ensenada in Mexico. Home prices nationally have gone up for the first time in 10 months, with high rents and migration helping turn values around. A report shows the rental crisis is only due to get worse because of a shortage in supply of new houses and units caused by costs and ongoing constraints in construction. The National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation said banks increasing their interest rates relative to the Reserve Bank of Australia guidance had reduced the supply of dwellings. The Liberals continue to face the fallout of their unexpected loss in the weekend’s byelection in Aston. Opposition leader Peter Dutton yesterday accepted responsibility for the loss but said he had no plans to step down.

It proposes a massive programme of state investment to rapidly decarbonise the economy, which it says would create hundreds of thousands of green jobs. The party says the programme would also transform the way people live – from upgrading the UK’s entire housing stock and revitalising public transport to boosting renewable wind and solar industries and decarbonising the country’s energy supply. Although the initial investment would be large, advocates say that would be dwarfed by the cost of not tackling the escalating climate crisis and point to wide-ranging economic benefits, which experts say would total at least £800bn by 2030. The green new deal aims to tie far-reaching environmental action to a worker-led “just transition”, where the rapid move from a carbon-based economy to a sustainable system is led by – and benefits – ordinary people. The party, which at its conference backed plans to hit zero emissions by 2030, has also said it would ban fracking and boost electric car infrastructure. Conservatives The Tories say they want to double science and research spending to £18bn in the next parliament, with an unspecified amount going to new green technology. The party says it also wants to increase the number of public electric vehicle charging points so that everyone in England and Wales is within 30 miles of a charging point, with an investment of £500m. The party, which has been criticised over its record on onshore wind and solar power, says it will build more offshore windfarms, increasing the UK’s target capacity from 30GW to 40GW by 2030. It has also announced plans to plant 30m trees a year by 2025. It would create “clusters” of carbon capture and storage expertise around the country for £800m in the next decade, and a cabinet-level committee will oversee the commitment to reach its target of net zero carbon by 2050. It has also announced a review of the HS2 high-speed rail project and a moratorium on fracking. Liberal Democrats The party says it will establish citizens’ assemblies to thrash out new policy measures to tackle the climate emergency. It wants to revive the green investment bank, sold off by George Osborne, and end the sale of petrol and diesel cars by 2030. It would support onshore and offshore wind and solar power, with a target of 80% of electricity from renewable sources by 2030, and says all new homes would be fitted with solar panels. It says it would declare a nature crisis and work towards an international Paris-style agreement on preserving the natural world and biodiversity. It has pledged to plant 60m trees a year and impose a moratorium on airport expansion, including Heathrow. The party would ban fracking and new coalmines and has set a net zero target of 2045. Green party The Greens say they would raise £100bn by borrowing every year for the next 10 years to pay for tackling the climate crisis through upgrading infrastructure, including shifting electricity generation to a low-carbon footing, insulating the UK’s draughty housing stock and expanding public transport. They aim to bring forward the UK’s target for net zero carbon from 2050 to 2030 and would scrap nuclear power and expand renewable energy. They are in favour of ending airport expansion, including Heathrow, scrapping HS2 and halting the current road-building plan, spending the money instead on local transport improvements. They would ban fracking and all fossil fuel expansion. SNP The SNP is aiming for a 75% reduction of all emissions by 2030, net-zero carbon by 2040 and net zero for all emissions by 2045. It is proposing to “phase out the need” for petrol and diesel cars and vans by 2032, investing in active and sustainable travel by doubling cash for walking and cycling to £80m a year. It is introducing a deposit return scheme for drink containers to increase recycling and reduce littering. And an expert panel is looking at what else can be done to reduce demand for single-use items. It has banned fracking and underground coal gasification and says it is “championing the principle” of climate justice."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2019/mar/08/the-children-review-lucy-kirkwood-taut-tale-of-human-and-atomic-meltdown","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2019-03-08T12:22:28Z","webTitle":"The Children review – Lucy Kirkwood's taut tale of human and atomic meltdown","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/mar/08/the-children-review-lucy-kirkwood-taut-tale-of-human-and-atomic-meltdown","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2019/mar/08/the-children-review-lucy-kirkwood-taut-tale-of-human-and-atomic-meltdown","fields":{"headline":"The Children review – Lucy Kirkwood's taut tale of human and atomic meltdown","bodyText":"With its slow release of a series of moral questions, Lucy Kirkwood’s engrossingly topical play becomes a controlled experiment. When three retired ex-colleagues reunite after 38 years, their emotional reactions to each other take them straight back to their shared past, when they worked as physicists developing the nearby nuclear power plant, which has since suffered a meltdown. It’s clear that age cannot guarantee maturity when sexual rivalry is in the mix. Hazel (Marie Mullen) is threatened by the sudden reappearance of the self-contained Rose (Ger Ryan), and her reaction is swift and violent. From that uneasy opening, nothing is stable and designer Sarah Bacon’s crumpled seaside cottage setting is not as it seems. Hazel and her raffish husband (Seán McGinley) had been attempting to maintain a semblance of normality after the power plant catastrophe contaminated the coast and land for miles. Whether this is the Irish coast is never specified in Oonagh Murphy’s subtle production, adding to the sense of “what if”, especially as a nuclear power station was once proposed for the Wexford coast, less than 100 miles south of Dublin, but never built. What begins as a study of ageing, marriage, parenthood and a buried love affair leaves familiar territory behind as Rose makes a proposal that raises the stakes. In these absorbing, sympathetic performances, the characters reveal themselves as complex and contradictory, as they question what they owe to the next generation. At what point do they stop thinking that the fulfilment of their own lives’ potential still lies in the future? And what is a good life? With schoolchildren currently demonstrating on the streets for action on climate change, Kirkwood’s challenges are all the more acute for avoiding generational stereotypes and blame. • At Gate, Dublin, until 23 March."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2017/aug/29/pond-review-bethnal-green-working-mens-club-london","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-29T12:27:31Z","webTitle":"Pond review – Perth psych-rockers turn up the nuclear power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/aug/29/pond-review-bethnal-green-working-mens-club-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/aug/29/pond-review-bethnal-green-working-mens-club-london","fields":{"headline":"Pond review – Perth psych-rockers turn up the nuclear power","bodyText":"It is Pond’s fate forever to be discussed in relation to Tame Impala, and it is hardly surprising. This band from Perth, Western Australia, began life as a spin-off from those more venerated psychedelic voyagers, and the two groups continue to swap members as if on a space-rock job-share scheme: at the latest count, all but one current member of Tame Impala have previously been in Pond. The difference is that where Tame Impala are essentially a vehicle for the musical dreams and vision of their band leader, Kevin Parker, Pond are a far looser and more democratic concern. This shifting collective chuck out albums whenever they feel like it, which is pretty much all the time: from 2009’s Psychedelic Mango to this year’s The Weather, they have released seven in nine years. Tama Impala have now graduated to the world’s arenas but it is still possible to see Pond spiel out their louche, vital psych-rock in sweaty shoebox venues such as this. Five hirsute men line up across its gaudily Phoenix Nights-style stage and fire straight into 30000 Megatons, a song about nuclear oblivion that opens adrift in a sky with diamonds before left-turning into a seismic wig-out. Singer Nick Allbrook has tonight come as a pouting, glam-pop elf prone to giggles and entertaining between-song non sequiturs. He looks like a young Beck fronting Super Furry Animals. Pond co-founder Jay Watson’s synths have come to the fore on the new album, and melodic recent single Sweep Me off My Feet could be a mutant strain of New Romanticism, like a lysergic Blancmange. Pond are less expansive and experimental than Tame Impala, but what they lack in profundity they make up for in pop smarts. New song Fire in the Water is clipped and notably radio-friendly. “You can buy it from the table at the back,” ventures Allbrook. “No, we are giving them [vinyl] away free with the gig ticket,” corrects Watson. “Oh, right!” says his singer. “Bonzer!” Paint Me Silver recalls the Flaming Lips when they were still all about cosmic wonder rather than circus tricks, while the episodic Edge of the World Parts 1 and 2 suggests a stoned mash-up of Ummagumma-era Pink Floyd and ELO.

Boris Johnson has been branded the “Comical Ali of the cost-of-living crisis” by Keir Starmer, who accused the government of burying its head in the sand and standing by while inflation spirals and taxes rise for many. No 10 has said Johnson was “uncomfortable” about the attempt by Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Commons Speaker, to summon David Dillon, editor of the Mail on Sunday, to a meeting to discuss his concerns about the paper’s much-criticised article about Angela Rayner. (See 2.34pm.) Dillon said last night he was refusing to attend. (See 9.27am.) Rayner has hit out at claims that she viewed “sexist slurs” made against her as a joke. Lowering food tariffs will not solve the cost-of-living crisis and it would be “misleading” to suggest as much to consumers, the president of the farmers’ union said after reports ministers were considering slashing import taxes. Rishi Sunak has been cleared of breaching the ministerial code over his wife’s tax affairs, in a report by the cabinet’s ethics adviser, Lord Geidt. A £25m “fraud squad” is to be launched after MPs criticised the government’s failure to crack down on criminals who stole billions of pounds of taxpayers’ cash through Covid support schemes. In the latest instalment of the end-of-session parliamentary ping pong, MPs have voted down changes to the elections bill favoured by the House of Lords. In two divisions, MPs have rejected an attempt by the Lords to remove a section of the bill giving ministers the power to issue directions to the Electoral Commission, the body that regulates elections, in the form of a “strategy and policy statement”. In a third division, MPs also rejected a Lords amendment that would have expanded the list of documentation accepted under the new rule in the bill requiring voters to have photo ID. The “strategy and policy statement” proposal has been strongly criticised by the Electoral Commission itself, the Commons public administration and constitutional affairs committee and the committee on standards in public life, which said it was “deeply troubled by the long-term risk to our democratic system that is inherent” in the plan. In the debate this afternoon Kemi Badenoch, the levelling-up minister, said these criticisms were misplaced. She said: It has been claimed by some parliamentarians that this duty to have regard to the strategy and policy statement will weaken the operational independence of the commission. That is not correct. This duty will not allow the government to direct the commission’s decision-making nor will it undermine the commission’s other statutory duties or displace the commission’s need to carry out those other duties. Lord Geidt, the independent adviser on ministers’ interests, has declared that Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, did not break the ministerial code in connection with his declarations of interest, his wife’s non-dom status, his US green card and government links with Infosys, the firm set up by his father-in-law. This is not particularly surprising. Sunak called for an investigation by Geidt himself, and at the time seemed confident he had followed the rules. Geidt also implies that there is no inherent conflict of interest in a government minister holding a US green card, which is likely to be a more controversial ruling because of the conditions attached to having a green card. Green cards give their holders the permanent right to work in the US, and are seen as one step away from citizenship. Geidt has set out his findings in a six-page letter. Here are the key points. Geidt says Sunak has been “assiduous” in fulfilling his obligations under the ministerial code and that he has not broken its rules. Interestingly, however, Geidt stresses that he has only looked at the narrow issue of whether Sunak followed the rules. “My role does not touch on any wider question of the merits of such interests or arrangements,” he says. The main problem with the non-dom story for Sunak has always been the political implications of the revelations about his green card and his wife’s non-dom status, rather than the issue of whether or not be broke the rules. Geidt says Sunak’s duties as a minister, including as chancellor, were not compromised by his having a US green card. He says: A US permanent resident card allows the holder to live and work permanently in the United States. It imposes a number of obligations on the holder, including a requirement to comply with US law and to file tax returns in the United States. The obligation to pay tax in other jurisdictions does not provide an inherent conflict with the duties of a minister of the Crown … Considering the card against the specific responsibilities of the chancellor’s ministerial offices subsequent to his first role, I do not consider that its possession would constitute an inherent conflict of interest. Being subject to the obligations imposed by the card in his personal life could not reasonably be said to be in tension with the faithful discharge of his duties as chief secretary to the Treasury or as chancellor of the exchequer. But Geidt says it is not for him to rule on whether Sunak was complying with his obligations to the US as a holder of the card. That is not relevant to the ministerial interests process he was looking at, he says. He says that the non-dom status of Akshata Murty, Sunak’s wife, did not create an “inherent conflict” of interest with Sunak’s role as chancellor. He says he looked at two cases where the Treasury considered non-dom status under Sunak. In the first, when it was looking at policy for incentivising inward investment, Sunak reminded the permanent secretary of his wife’s situation, offered to step aside from the decision-making process, but the proposal was dropped anyway. And in the second case, the Treasury minister John Glen decided a change to non-dom policy for a narrow group of people, and Murty was not affected. Geidt says that, although Sunak declared his wife’s non-dom status, it was not necessary to declare this publicly in the register of ministers’ interests “taking into account Ms Murty’s rights to privacy”. Geidt says although Infosys, the company set up by Murty’s father, in which she holds shares, has had meetings with the government, it has not contracted with the Treasury while Sunak has been a minister there, and so no conflict of interest has arisen. A reader has been in touch in the comments to say that, if you use the OECD definition of “paid employment”, Boris Johnson was right to say paid employment is up by 500,000 since before the pandemic. The OECD definition equates to payroll employment, and does not include the self-employed. However Johnson did not mention the OECD at PMQs (see 3.19pm) and, when he talked about more people being in paid employment now, people will have assumed that he was talking about the self-employed too. Hacked Off, the group set up representing the victims of phone hacking, which campaigns for higher press standards, says the Independent Press Standards Organisations has never upheld a complaint about sexism in its eight years of existence. Ipso was set up with the support of many national newspapers when the coalition government was in power, as an alternative to the more powerful regulator proposed by the Leveson inquiry. Hacked Off has consistently argued that Ipso is too weak. Commenting on the Mail on Sunday’s refusal to attend a meeting with the Speaker to discuss the Angela Rayner article, Emma Jones, a Hacked Off board member, said: Thousands of complaints have been made about the Mail on Sunday’s misogynistic article about Angela Rayner MP, but on the basis of Ipso’s track record, the likelihood of any of them being upheld is vanishingly small. The Mail on Sunday editor’s subsequent refusal to meet with the Speaker of the House of Commons illustrates the contempt in which editors hold any person or organisation who would seek to hold them to account. They think they are above accountability and, so long as Ipso remains in place, they are. Until the government act to complete the Leveson reforms, and compel all national newspapers to be members of an independent regulator, misogyny, racism and other forms of discrimination in the press will persist. According to ITV’s Anushka Asthana, the female Conservative MP who said at a meeting on Monday night that a member of the government had once been seen watching pornography on his phone in the Commons chamber declined to say who the person was when asked by Chris Heaton-Harris, the chief whip. Pippa Crerar from the Daily Mirror has more from the meeting. At PMQs Boris Johnson said that there were “500,000 more people in paid employment now than when the pandemic began”. Not only is this untrue, according to Full Fact, the fact checking website, Johnson has now stated this falsehold 10 times in parliament. According to ONS figures, there were 33,073,000 people in work between December 2019 and February 2020 - before the pandemic. The most recent figures, covering Decmber 2021 to February 2022, show 32,485,000 people in paid employment - almost 600,000 people than before the pandemic. Here is the last Full Fact article on this. At the liaison committee last month, when Johnson was asked about this error, he said that he accepted that it was only payroll employment that was up (the big fall has been in the number of self-employed workers) and he claimed he had corrected the record. That was also untrue; he hasn’t - at least not formally, to parliament. Commenting on the latest falsehood, Will Moy, the Full Fact CEO, said: The prime minister has made the same false claim in parliament 10 times now. And nothing has happened. We’ve fact checked this employment claim and written to Number 10 on multiple occasions. Boris Johnson has acknowledged his mistake and said he’ll correct the record, but we’ve seen no such thing. This is inexcusable and we deserve better. MPs must stop putting up with their peers misleading the House of Commons and in turn the public. The system is broken and in order to rebuild trust in our political system, change is needed. Moy does not accuse Johnson of lying in his statement (perhaps he is charitably assuming that Johnson keep forgetting what the truth actually is?), but Peter Stefanovic, the campaigner whose video about Johnson’s lies to parliament has been viewed 40m times, is more direct. UPDATE: A reader has been in touch in the comments to say that, if you use the OECD definition of “paid employment”, Boris Johnson was right to say paid employment is up by 500,000 since before the pandemic. The OECD definition equates to payroll employment, and does not include the self-employed. However Johnson did not mention the OECD at PMQs (see 3.19pm) and, when he talked about more people being in paid employment now than before Covid, people will have assumed that he was talking about the self-employed too. And here is a full summary of the lines from the post-PMQs lobby briefing. The PM’s spokesperson said Boris Johnson was “uncomfortable” with the idea of the Mail on Sunday editor being summoned to see the Commons Speaker over the Angela Rayner article. (See 2.34pm.) The PM’s press secretary rejected claims that the Conservative party had a problem with sexism. She said: You will have heard the PM address this explicitly in parliament today and over the last few days, saying there is absolutely no place for such behaviour and this cannot be tolerated in any workplace. Asked about the reports about a Tory frontbencher watching pornography on his phone in the Commons chamber, she replied: “Obviously, it is wholly unacceptable behaviour and it is being looked into.” Asked about the Sunday Times report that three cabinet ministers are among the 56 MPs who have been referred to the Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme (ICGS) over alleged sexual misconduct, the press secretary said she could not comment because an independent process was underway. The spokesperson did not rule out today’s high court judgement about the government’s hospital discharge policy at the start of the pandemic leading to compensation being paid to relatives of care home residents who died. Asked if this could happen, the spokesperson said: I’m not going to get into speculating on what further action people may or may not take. The Department of Health is considering the judgment carefully ... The court itself recognised the difficult and unique circumstances the government faced in the early part of the pandemic. The prime minister talked about the lack of evidence on asymptomatic transmission at the time, or certainly the uncertainty around it during that period, balanced against the need to act quickly. At the post-PMQs lobby briefing, the prime minister’s spokesperson effectively said that Boris Johnson was siding with the Mail on Sunday, not the Speaker, on the issue of the summons to discuss the Angela Rayner article. (See 9.27am.) Asked for a reaction to the decision by David Dillon, the paper’s editor, not to attend a meeting requested by the Speaker, the PM’s spokesperson said: The prime minister is uncomfortable at the idea of our free press being summoned by politicians. We have a free press in this country and reporters must be free to report what they are told as they see fit. The spokesman said Johnson would not want “any perception of politicians seeking to in any way curb or control what a free press seeks to report”. As a journalist, Johnson was himself often criticised for writing sexist or inaccurate material. It is not hard to see why he might not approve of such reporting being challenged by an authority figure. And here is the PA Media write-up of PMQs. Boris Johnson was branded an “ostrich” with his head in the sand as Keir Starmer raised cost-of-living concerns at prime minister’s questions. A tax rise in people’s latest payslips has the prime minister’s “fingerprints all over it”, Labour leader Starmer said before he labelled the Conservatives the “party of excess oil and gas profits” due to their rejection of a windfall tax to cut energy bills. But Johnson repeatedly claimed Labour has “no plan” and defended his government’s economic record, saying of Sir Keir: “This guy is doomed to be a permanent spectator.” At one stage during PMQs the Labour Party press office shared on Twitter a mocked-up image of Mr Johnson as the former Iraqi propaganda chief known as Comical Ali. In response to Johnson arguing global inflation was behind slower growth for the UK, Starmer told the Commons: “He sounds like the Comical Ali of the cost-of-living crisis. He pretends the economy is booming ... but in the real world our growth is set to be slower than every G20 country except one – Russia. And our inflation is going to be double the rest of the G7. Does he think that denying the facts staring him in the face makes things better or worse for working people?” Johnson replied: “The facts are, as the IMF has said, that the UK came out of Covid faster than anybody else, that’s why we had the fastest growth in the G7 last year. That would not have happened if we’d listened to captain hindsight. And if he studies their forecasts we will return to being the fastest by 2024 and the fastest in 2025. That’s what the IMF’s forecasts say ... this is the government, this is the party that supports working people.” But Starmer countered: “He’s an ostrich – perfectly happy keeping his head in the sand. Working people are worried about paying their bills, they’re spending less and cutting back – that’s bad for business and bad for growth. Working people are looking for help but this week millions will look at their payslip and see a tax rise with his fingerprints all over it. Does he think his 15th tax rise has made things better or worse for working people?” Johnson replied: “What we’re doing for working people is not only lifting the living wage by a record amount, helping people on universal credit with a £1,000 tax cut, but also cutting national insurance contributions, lifting the threshold so that on average people pay £330 less.” Last week Keir Starmer was reportedly criticised by a shadow cabinet colleague for focusing too much on Partygate, instead of on the cost of living. The charge was probably unfair, but the fact that it was said may have struck a chord. Today Starmer did not mention Partygate at all, and another story of particular interest to the Westminster (Raynergate) only got a cursory mention. Instead Starmer devoted all his questions to the economy and the cost of living. A week tomorrow people will be voting in the local elections, and as a result PMQs sounded, even more than usual, like shouty party political broadcasts being broadcast in tandem. Boris Johnson seemed reliant on a random and dog-eared list of CCHQ talking points, regurgitated without much reference to what he was being asked, and one of Starmer’s best moments came when he mocked his technique, referencing a line in the Mail on Sunday story about Angela Rayner. This must be the Oxford Union debating skills we’ve been hearing so much about. Failing to answer the question. Rambling incoherently. Throwing in garbled metaphors. Powerful stuff, Prime Minister. Starmer has always been good at detail and argument at PMQs, but more recently he has learned to do scorn and insult as well, and that was on display today as he delivered a solid drubbing. Johnson was the “Comical Ali of the cost-of-living crisis”, he said. The PM was like an ostrich, with his “head in the sand”, Starmer said. The cabinet’s MOT cost of living wheeze was like John Major’s cones hotline. This is how Starmer wound up, with his peroration. So they’re the party of excess oil and gas profits and we’re the party of working people. This government’s had its head in the sand throughout the cost of living crisis. First they let prices got out of control. Then they denied it was happening. They failed to do anything about it. And then they made it worse with higher taxes. Because of his choices, we are set to have the slowest growth and the highest inflation in the G7. A vote for Labour next week is a vote for a very different set of choices. We would ask oil and gas companies to pay their fair share of reduced energy costs. We would not hammer working people with the worst possible tax at the worst possible time. We would insulate homes to get bills down. And we’d close the tax avoidance schemes that have helped his chancellor - where is he? - reduce his family’s tax bill while putting everyone else’s up. That’s proper plan for the economy. So why doesn’t he get on with it and finally make choices that make things better not worse for working people. Johnson was prepared for the final question too. On the cost of living specifics, he was unpersuasive, but he resorted to last-ditch defence, the gist of which was that at least his government was doing something, unlike the “permanent spectator” Starmer who did not offer a proper alternative. Opposition leaders can always been accused of not actually doing much (a feature of not being in office), but in many areas Labour’s plans are vague or insubstantial, and Tory-inclined voters will probably feel that on this Johnson had a point. Johnson said: I can tell [Starmer], I’ve been listening to him for many weeks, for many years, this guy is doomed to be a permanent spectator. We have a plan to fix the NHS and fix social care. They have no plan. We have a plan to fix our borders with our deal with Rwanda. They have no plan. We have a plan to take our economy forward. They have no plan. Johnson ended up by summoning up the age-old Tory scare about Labour administrations ruining the economy. It is mostly nonsense (Johnson included a reference to a Labour council spending £27,000 on EU flags, suggesting the CCHQ list of Labour financial misfeasance is rather a short one), but the notion that “everywhere you look, a Labour administration is a bankrupt shambles” (as Johnson put it) is a smear that has has a powerful impact in British politics for most of the last century. And the fact that Labour has only just pulled level with the Tories in polling on managing the economy suggests it may still have some life in it yet. Chris Heaton-Harris, the Conservative chief whip, is investigating reports that a Tory frontbencher watched pornography on his phone in the Commons chamber, a statement from his office has said. My colleague Rowena Mason has the story here. This is from my colleague Patrick Wintour on the list of MPs being sanctioned by Russia. Mike Amesbury (Lab) says the PM was wrong to say that council taxes are higher under Labour than under Conservative councils. He reads out figures showing Tory councils have higher average council tax rates. (These figures are notoriously susceptible to interpretation on a party political basis. Because council tax is based on property values, and homes tend to be worth more in Tory council areas than in Labour ones, in general overall council tax rates tend to be higher in Tory areas, but average band D rates tend to be higher in Labour areas. For a more detailed analysis, see this blog from Full Fact.) Chris Bryant (Lab) says he is surprised he is not on the list. (He has been one of the most vocal critics of the Putin regime.) On a point of order Michael Fabricant (Con) asks about the Russian sanctions imposed on MPs. He says he and the Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, are both on the list. Hoyle says he has asked the government to keep him and the house informed on this issue. Daisy Cooper (Lib Dem) asks if the PM will apologise to the families of people who died in care homes, and to care worker staff, in the light of today’s court ruling. Johnson says he wants to renew his apologies, and sympathy, to people who lost relatives in care homes in the pandemic. He says the government did not know much about the disease at that point. It did not know how easy it was for the disease to spread asymptomatically. On the court judgment, he says the government will study it carefully. Ben Everitt (Con) says 287 MPs have been sanctioned by Russia. Will the government maintain its support for Ukraine. Johnson says those MPs sanctioned should regard it as “a badge of honour”. Jeff Smith (Lab) asks if the PM will apologise for how the Tories refused to take seriously a complaint from one of the victims of the Imran Ahmad Khan, the MP found guilty of assualt, and for having him on a panel advising the government on grooming. Johnson says the Home Office has put out a statement about this. Mel Stride (Con) asks if the PM wil meet with him to discuss proposals from the Ukraine parliament’s treasury committee (Stride chairs the UK version) as to how sanctions on Russia could be tightened. Johnson says the government will look at these ideas. Florence Eshalomi (Lab) says supermarkets are lowering prices to help consumers. What is the government doing? Johnson says he wants to thank businesses that are trying to protect consumers from price rises. Johnson critices the record of Lib Dem-run Eastleigh council. Jim Shannon (DUP) says the Northern Ireland protocol is affecting the availability of Covid tests in Northern Ireland. Johnson says there is an economic cost to the protocol, which is turning into a political problem. He says the government must rectify that before it undermines the Good Friday agreement. Vicky Foxcroft (Lab) asks about a drug that could help people shielding from Covid, Evusheld. Johnson says he will agree to set up a meeting for Foxcroft about this. Anthony Browne (Con) asks if the PM agrees that online platforms that profit from promoting fraud should pay the cost of that. Johnson says he would like to see that kind of proposal work. He will ensure Browne has a meeting with ministers about it. Caroline Lucas (Green) says 56 MPs are being investigated for sexual misconduct, incuding three ministers. Is sexual misconduct grounds for removal under the ministerial code? Johnson says of course sexual harrasment is grounds for dismissal. Ben Bradley (Con) asks how investment in areas like Mansfield can be speeded up. Johnson says the next round of levelling up funding will be announced in the autumn. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the DUP leader, says the cost of moving goods from Britain to Northern Ireland has gone up by 27% under the Northern Ireland protocol. Will it be removed? Johnson says the government wants to support the Good Friday agreement. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader, asks about the number of children dependent on food parcels. If the PM wants ideas to tackle the problem, he should look beyond his cabinet colleagues, who think he will not be there for long. Instead the PM should match the child payment administered by the Scottish government. Johnson says the government is taking steps to help families. Blackford says other measures that might help with the cost of living would be abandoning the national insurance hike, and increasing benefits. Johnson says the universal credit taper has been reduced, helping poorer families. And he says he would not bet on Blackford staying in his post longer than he stays in his. Starmer says a vote for Labour next week will be a vote to make things better not worse for working people. Johnson says Starmer is “doomed to be a permanent specator”. He says he has a plan for the NHS and social care, for immigration, for the economy. He says Labour does not have any of these things. He says Labour administrations lead to bankruptcy. He says the Labour council at Hammersmith spent £27,000 on EU flags. He criticises other Labour councils which he claims went bankrupt. And he claims the Labour party left the UK bankrupt in 2010. Starmer says Johnson’s plan for the cost of living crisis involves cutting MOT tests. “It makes the cones hotline [a much-mocked John Major initiative] sound visionary and inspirational,” he says. Johnson says the government is supporting people. He says he will build a nuclear power plant every year. Under Labour it was one a decade. Starmer says Johnson is like an ostrich, with his head in the sand. Johnson says he believes in jobs, unlike Labour. There are 500,000 more than at the start of the pandemic, he says. Starmer says this must be the Oxford University debating skills we have heard about (in the Mail on Sunday article) - ignoring the question, responding “incoherently”. He says the UK is the only country putting up taxes in the G7. Johnson talks about the increase in the national insurance threshold. And he says “the party of Bevan” should support more money for the NHS (ie, the national insurance rise.) Starmer says Johnson sounds like the “Comical Ali of the cost of living crisis”. Does denying the facts make things worse or better? Johnson says the UK had the fastest growth in the G7 last year. That would not have happened under Labour, he says. He says there are 500,000 more people in paid employment now than before the pandemic began. Under Labour youth unemployment rose. Keir Starmer says the PM will have told his backbenchers to scream and shout. But does he agree that there is no place for misogyny, or for looking down on people on the basis of where they come from. The UK is set for the slowest growth in the G7. Why is Johnson mismanaging the economy? On Angela Rayner, Johnson says MPs should treat each other with respect. He says he texted Rayner about the Mail on Sunday article. On the economy, he says all countries are having problems. Under Labour we would still be in lockdown, he claims. Sally-Ann Hart (Con) asks about coastal communities. Will the government have a targeted strategy to help them? Johnson says the levelling up white paper addresses this issue. Coastal communities wll get resources and attention, he says. Boris Johnson starts saying this will be the final PMQs of this session. More than 20 acts of parliament have been passed, he says, including the national insurance threshold increase - which is the largest single tax cut for a decade, he says. He forgets to mention that overall taxes are also rising to their highest level for decades. He is focusing on delivering the people’s priorities, he says. “And there is plenty more to come in the Queen’s speech on 10 May.” PMQs is about to start. It will almost certainly be the last of this session of parliament. Here is the list of MPs down to ask a question. Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, has been giving evidence to the Commons transport committee this morning. Here are the highlights. Shapps said that he would change the rules to allow new recruits in the aviation industry to start training before they have completed security checks. This would ease disruption at airports, he claimed. Currently flights are being cancelled, and passengers are facing delays, because of a shortage of staff at airports. Shapps told the committee: I have looked at the rules and found an area where we can assist with the bureaucracy, particularly with regard to new people coming into the industry, and their need to be security checked. We can begin the training, without exposing them to the parts of the training which are security-related, without having the security check complete, as long as it’s complete before they start the security-related stuff. I have a statutory instrument - I think it comes to the house today - to do exactly that. He hinted that he would consider merging the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) with the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA). Asked about processing delays at the DVLA, he said he would look at whether privatisation might help. And he went on: I’ll look at the different motoring organisations. We have DVLA and DVSA. It’s very confusing for most people. One does the licensing, the other one does the testing. People ask why there are two organisations. I’ll look at all of these things. No stone will be left unturned. Shapps said the backlog of driving licence applications has been cut from a peak of 1.2 million to 400,000 due to a series of measures. He also said that the delays “wouldn’t be there at all if it hadn’t been for an entirely unnecessary strike at DVLA”. He said ports would not be expected to physically enforce the requirement for ferry companies to pay the UK national minimum wage. This is from the BBC’s Simon Jones. The Scottish government should publish legal advice it received about a second independence referendum, the information commissioner has ruled. PA Media says: Daren Fitzhenry, the Scottish information commissioner, said disclosing some of the advice would “significantly enhance public debate on this issue”. He said ministers’ decision to release legal advice they received around the Alex Salmond case had already affected the convention that such advice to ministers remained private. It follows a freedom of information request from the Scotsman newspaper, which asked for any legal advice provided to ministers on the topic of a second independence referendum in 2020. The government refused, saying doing so would breach legal professional privilege. The case was appealed to the information commissioner in April 2021, who has now released his ruling. Fitzhenry’s decision states: “The ministers also argued that a claim to confidentiality in legal proceedings could be maintained because the withheld information was only shared between the Scottish government and its legal advisers. Therefore, the information remained confidential at the time they responded to the applicant’s request and requirement for review and this remained the case.” The newspaper argued, in recent months, the government had dispensed with the tradition of keeping legal advice private, releasing several pages of advice around the Alex Salmond harassment complaints scandal. Fitzhenry continued: “While the ministers have expressed concern that disclosure of legal advice in this case would have the effect of future legal advice being more circumspect or less effective, the commissioner acknowledges the point made by the applicant that the ministers’ own decision to disclose legal advice relating to the Alex Salmond case has already created such an environment.” Responding to the information commissioner’s decision, a spokesman for the government said: We have received the decision from the Scottish information commissioner and are considering its terms. However, we are clear the Scottish government has acted lawfully in its application of freedom of information legislation. There is a long-standing convention, observed by UK governments and Scottish governments, that government does not disclose legal advice, including whether law officers have, or have not, advised on any matter, except in exceptional circumstances. The Scottish government can appeal against the decision to the court of session. Here is my colleague Robert Booth’s story about the high court ruling on the government’s hospital discharge policy at the start of the pandemic. This is from Rachel Harrison, national officer for care at the GMB union, on today’s high court ruling on the government’s hospital discharge policy at the start of the pandemic. She said: Today’s judgment is a terrible reminder of callous disregard this government has shown for care home residents and workers. Transferring untested hospital outpatients into enclosed facilities where carers were denied access to proper PPE and even sick pay was always going to have tragic consequences. GMB members nursed much-loved residents as they died from this awful virus, while all the while worrying about their own safety and how they were going to pay the bills. If any good is to come out of this pandemic then it must include urgent reform of the sector. PA Media has filed more on the reasons given by the high court for ruling that the government’s hospital discharge policy at the start of the Covid pandemic was unlawful. (See 10.50am.) PA says: In a ruling on Wednesday, Lord Justice Bean and Mr Justice Garnham concluded that policies contained in documents released in March and early April 2020 were unlawful because they failed to take into account the risk to elderly and vulnerable residents from non-symptomatic transmission of the virus. They said that, despite there being “growing awareness” of the risk of asymptomatic transmission throughout March 2020, there was no evidence that then health secretary, Matt Hancock, addressed the issue of the risk to care home residents of such transmission. And in their ruling the judges said: In our judgment, this was not a binary question, a choice between on the one hand doing nothing at all, and on the other hand requiring all newly admitted residents to be quarantined. The document could, for example, have said that where an asymptomatic patient, other than one who has tested negative, is admitted to a care home, he or she should, so far as practicable, be kept apart from other residents for up to 14 days. Since there is no evidence that this question was considered by the secretary of state, or that he was asked to consider it, it is not an example of a political judgment on a finely balanced issue. Nor is it a point on which any of the expert committees had advised that no guidance was required. The drafters of the documents of March 17 and April 2 simply failed to take into account the highly relevant consideration of the risk to elderly and vulnerable residents from asymptomatic transmission. The judges said these issues were not addressed until a further document in mid-April 2020. They concluded: The common law claim succeeds against the secretary of state and Public Health England in respect of both the March 17 and April 2 2020 documents to this extent: the policy set out in each document was irrational in failing to advise that where an asymptomatic patient, other than one who had tested negative, was admitted to a care home, he or she should, so far as practicable, be kept apart from other residents for 14 days. In an interview with Sky News this morning Dominic Raab, the justice secretary and deputy PM, claimed that Labour’s proposed windfall tax on energy companies (its key proposal to address the cost of living crisis) would be “disastrous”. He said: If you look at Labour’s policy, you asked about it - of a windfall tax - that would damage investment in energy supplies we need and hike bills. It’s disastrous. It’s not serious. What this shows is they’re coming up with frankly ill-thought through policies, but we have got a plan, a concerted plan, and I think that’s what voters want to see. There will be two urgent questions in the Commons later after PMQs. First Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, will ask about backlogs at the Passport Office, and after that Lucy Powell, the shadow culture secretary, will ask about the plans to privatise Channel 4. The government’s policy of discharging patients from hospitals into care homes at the start of the Covid pandemic in 2020 was unlawful because it failed to take into account the risk to residents from coronavirus infection, the high court has ruled. Sky’s Tom Gillespie has more on the story here. In interviews this morning Dominic Raab, the justice secretary and deputy PM, said that the government had not ruled out privatisting the Passport Office as a means of ensuring it delivers a better service. Asked if that was an option, he said: I think the point the prime minister made, and he made it again last night, is that we’re neutral on the question of who does the provision; what we’re not neutral on - and what we want to see - is the service to the taxpayer and to the public being the very best value for money. Therefore, if we need to consider changing the controller of a particular service, that’s something that we’re willing to do. But I don’t think a decision has been taken either way on it. Yesterday it emerged that Johnson told cabinet he was prepared to “privatise the arse” off the Passport Office if necessary. When asked about this in an interview last night with Tom Newton Dunn on Talk TV, Johnson said: I don’t care whether an institution is in the private or the public sector, I just want it to deliver value. I want it to deliver value and a good service. I’m not, on your august show, going to rule anything out. What I want is for it to deliver value for money and help keep people’s cost down. As my colleague Rowena Mason reports, in his morning interview round Dominic Raab, the justice secretary and deputy PM, came under pressure when forced to explain why yesterday’s cabinet meeting on the cost of living crisis did not generate any firm policy initiatives. This is from the i’s Paul Waugh on Angela Rayner. And this is from my colleague Jessica Elgot. Angela Rayner has been tweeting this morning about the revelations in today’s Mail (see 9.27am) about her previous remarks about a meme comparing her at PMQs to Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct. She says the Mail has ignored her objections to this presentation. She also says she wants Boris Johnson to explain at PMQs what he will be doing about “vile sexism” in his party. MPs and peers are engaged in parliamentary “ping pong” this week on a clutch of bills that are very close to getting royal assent, but that cannot clear parliament until the two chambers resolve any outstanding differences. The process is called “ping pong” because at this point bills shuttle back and forth between the two houses - sometimes on the same day - until one side backs down. Last night peers were sitting until almost midnight dealing with outstanding bills. Normally the Lords eventually gives in to the elected house, and last night peers gave up their struggle to ditch a provision in the police, crime, sentencing and courts bill giving the police new powers to limit protests on the grounds of noise. This is from PA Media. Powers allowing a clampdown on noisy protests are set to become law after peers ended their stand-off at Westminster. The House of Lords voted by 180 to 113, majority 67, against a Labour move to again strip from legislation the controversial curbs relating to marches. The upper chamber also rejected an opposition bid to remove the noise trigger for demonstrations by 169 to 113, majority 56. It comes after the Commons supported restoring the restrictions to the police, crime, sentencing and courts bill for a third time. The legislation contains a wide-ranging raft of measures aimed at overhauling the criminal justice system. Peers also backed down on a remaining sticking point in the health and social care bill. PA reports: A planned £86,000 cap on care costs is set to be introduced after peers backed down over their demand for a government rethink, amid concerns it is unfair to poorer people. The House of Lords voted by 196 to 160, majority 36, against a renewed Labour move to amend the proposed reform aimed at sending it back to the Commons again for further consideration. A fresh bid in the upper chamber to improve workforce planning in health and social care in England also failed. Peers rejected by 204 votes to 169, majority 35, a move to force ministers to publish a report every three years on staffing needs, aimed at tackling shortages. Both issues had been key areas of contention during the passage of the health and care bill through the Lords. But the peers are still fighting over key aspects of the nationality and borders bill. PA says: Defiant peers have dug in their heels by inflicting further defeats against the government’s controversial asylum and immigration reforms. The House of Lords is maintaining its stand-off despite the Tory-dominated Commons rejecting previous changes made by the unelected chamber to the flagship nationality and borders bill. Peers again backed steps aimed at preventing asylum seekers being treated differently based on how they reached the UK, and renewed their demand that applicants be allowed to work if no decision had been taken on their claim after six months. The Lords also supported measures to ensure provisions on asylum in the bill comply with the UK’s international commitments to refugees. The latest government setbacks mean a continuation of the legislative tussle between the two houses over the bill, known as parliamentary ping pong, as the end of the parliamentary session looms. However, the Conservative frontbench did see off attempts to secure further significant changes to the bill, including a fresh bid to strip out a broad provision making it a criminal offence to knowingly arrive in the UK without permission and a move to impose strict conditions on offshoring asylum. Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Commons Speaker, has insisted his decision to invite the Mail on Sunday editor to a meeting to discuss the Angela Rayner article was not a threat to press freedom. In a statement last night, after David Dillon, the editor, said he would not be attending, Hoyle said: I am a staunch believer and protector of press freedom, which is why when an MP asked me to remove the pass of a sketch writer last week for something he had written, I said ‘no’. I firmly believe in the duty of reporters to cover parliament, but I would also make a plea - nothing more - for the feelings of all MPs and their families to be considered, and the impact on their safety, when articles are written. I would just ask that we are all a little kinder. Good morning. In his classic book about journalism, My Trade, Andrew Marr says of journalism that “outside organised crime, it is the most powerful and enjoyable of the anti-professions”. One characteristic of anti-professions is that they don’t like being bossed around by officialdom, and we have seen a good example of that this morning in the declaration from the Mail on Sunday editor, David Dillon, that he will not attend a meeting with the Commons Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, to discuss its article about Angela Rayner widely denounced as sexist. My colleague Tom Ambrose has written our story about the Mail on Sunday’s snub to the Speaker. The Daily Mail has reported it as its splash. It was not entirely clear what Hoyle was planning to say to Dillon at the meeting, which had originally been scheduled for today. At least one MP has called for Glen Owen, the Mail on Sunday political editor, to have his parliamentary pass removed, but Hoyle gave no indication that he planned to impose this sanction (which would have triggered widespread protests from other journalists). However, Hoyle’s statement on Monday implied that what he had in mind was not a cosy chat about journalistic standards, but something more akin to what is sometimes called in Whitehall an interview without coffee. In his statement in today’s Mail explaining his decision to refuse Hoyle’s invitation, Dillon presents this as a matter of press freedom. He says: Britain rightly prides itself on its free Press. That freedom will not last if journalists have to take instruction from officials of the House of Commons, however august they may be, on what they can report and not report. I am afraid I and Glen Owen must now decline your invitation. Dillon also offers two other reasons for staying away. He says Hoyle’s comment to MPs on Monday implied he had already taken a decision on the merits of the article, without having heard the paper’s side of the story. And he says new evidence has come to light to show that Rayner herself was the original source of the story, because she had been joking about the notion of using Basic Instinct tactics at PMQs in a conversation with Tory MPs on the Commons terrace. Dillon says: Following investigations by the Conservative party, three other MPs who were part of the group on the House of Commons terrace, one of them a woman, have come forward to corroborate the account of Angela Rayner’s remarks given to us by the MP who was the source of last Sunday’s story. The original story implied that Rayner herself had discussed the comparison with Tories (it quoted an unnamed Tory saying “[Rayner] admitted as much when enjoying drinks with us on the [Commons] terrace”) but it was not explicit about this. Today’s Mail also says that, when she was recording an interview in January with the comedian Matt Forde for his Political Party podcast, Rayner discussed a meme suggesting she used Basic Instinct tactics at PMQs. Rayner said in the interview she was “mortified” by the comparison - but she could clearly see the funny side too. (Quite what Rayner may have said to MPs on the Commons terrace remains unclear, but it seems probable that the story is a good example of how journalism goes wrong when a comment made in jest ends up being reported seriously.) While it was easy for MPs from all parties to condemn the sexism of the original article, today’s framing of the debate means they are now being invited to take sides, and choose between the Mail on Sunday or the Speaker, press freedom or responsible, respectful journalism. This issue is very likely to come up at PMQs. Dominic Raab, the justice secretary, was doing the morning interview round this morning, and he tried to avoid taking sides. But he would not criticise the Mail on Sunday for boycotting the meeting with the Speaker. Speaking about the original article, he said it was “terrible”. He said he had faced Rayner in the Commons in his capacity as deputy PM and she was “a formidable opponent”. Speaking about the story published on Sunday, he said: “I can’t stand this kind of thing.” Asked about the paper’s refusal to meet the Speaker, Raab said: Whether it’s the Speaker or the newspaper editors, we all believe in two things: one, the power and the importance of free speech, but, secondly, the importance of not allowing that to be abused and used to spread sexism in any shape or form ... I’m not going to second guess the decisions of editors ... I think it was a legitimate thing for Lindsay Hoyle do to invite to him [Dillon] and of course it’s the prerogative of any editor to decide how they treat that invitation. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Lord Blunkett, the former Labour education secretary, and Lord Willetts, the former Conservative universities minister, give evidence to the Commons education committee about post-16 qualifications. 9.30am: Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, gives evidence to the Commons transport committee. 9.45am: The supreme court rules on a claim that pilot voter ID schemes used in the May 2019 local elections were unlawful. 10am: Anne-Marie Trevelyan, the international trade secretary, gives evidence to the Commons international trade committee. 10.15am: Lord Keen of Elie, who resigned as advocate general of Scotland over the internal market bill in 2020, gives evidence to the Lords constitution committee about the role of government law officers. 12pm: Boris Johnson faces Keir Starmer at PMQs. 12.30pm: Lord Frost, the former Brexit minister, gives a speech on the Northern Ireland protocol. After 12.45pm: MPs debate Lords amendments to the elections bill. 2.15pm: Sir Tom Scholar, permanent secretary at the Treasury, and other officials give evidence to the Commons Treasury committee on combating fraud. Afternoon: Peers consider Commons amendments to the judicial review and courts bill, to the nationality and borders bill and to the elections bill. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include “Andrew” in it somewhere and I’m more likely to find it.

Ardern’s Labour coalition government has committed to making New Zealand carbon net-zero by 2050, with the PM likening the climate change battle to the previous generations’ struggle against the rise of nuclear power. If emissions are not adequately reduced, farmers could face additional taxes as early as 2022. There has been long-simmering hostility between the Labour government and farmers, especially in the dairy sector, with many saying the government’s sweeping plans to force them to be more environmentally sustainable are not economically viable and would cause some to walk off their properties. The climate emissions reform plan and cleaning up the waterways has caused stress for many, farmers say. But Ardern says she has listened to farmers and is willing to give them time to reform on a property-by-property basis. “For too long politicians have passed the buck and caused uncertainty for everyone while the need for climate action was clear,” Ardern said. “This plan provides the primary sector with certainty and puts us shoulder-to-shoulder on a path to reduce emissions, with ongoing support to help with the plan such as the $229m sustainable land use investment.” “This will reduce emissions by giving farmers the autonomy to plan to do so, and reward those who do,” she said. In the run-up to the 2017 general election, Ardern said farmers would be included in the emissions trading scheme (ETS) – a commitment she softened on Thursday, with critics accusing her of caving in to pressure from the powerful industry. The government has said if the primary sector takes enough proactive action to reduce emissions it would not be brought into the ETS. However there is a backstop. If the sector fails to innovate and manage emissions, it could be brought into the ETS as early as 2022. In a joint statement signed by the major industry leaders including DairyNZ, Federated Farmers and Beef and Lamb New Zealand, the sector welcomed the collaborative approach, and said it was “pleased” agriculture would not have its emissions taxed. “Achieving this programme of work will not be cheap, and it will not be easy … we welcome this pragmatic and sensible decision by the government to work in partnership with industry to achieve tangible on-farm change and hope that it might provide a blueprint for the way we work together to solve environmental challenges in the future.” The five-year action plan will include government incentives for early adopters, improved tools for estimating and benchmarking farm emissions, integrated farm plans that include a climate module, and recognition of on-farm climate mitigation efforts such as small plantings, riparian areas and natural cover. The opposition National party’s spokesman on climate change, Scott Simpson, said the ETS tax was hanging over farmers’ heads if they didn’t adapt quickly enough. Forcing farmers out of business would also raise global emissions, Simpson said, because New Zealand would be forced to import more food. “National has a clear criteria that would need to be met before we’re comfortable with agriculture entering the ETS or a similar pricing mechanism. There needs to be science-based mitigation options available for farmers that don’t lead to herd culling and decreased food production,” Simpson said. “New Zealand would have the only farmers in the world to be a part of an ETS. It’s important we are not put at a disadvantage to our international competitors or we risk losing our valuable market share to a less sustainable producer.” As well as government grants totalling more than NZ$200m, industry bodies said they would also commit at least NZ$25m a year to boost emissions-reduction efforts around the country."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2022/jan/17/china-economy-slows-credit-suisse-chairman-covid-stock-markets-ftse-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-01-17T18:27:38Z","webTitle":"India’s Modi calls for global approach to tackle crypto; FTSE 100 at two-year high – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2022/jan/17/china-economy-slows-credit-suisse-chairman-covid-stock-markets-ftse-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2022/jan/17/china-economy-slows-credit-suisse-chairman-covid-stock-markets-ftse-business-live","fields":{"headline":"India’s Modi calls for global approach to tackle crypto; FTSE 100 at two-year high – as it happened","bodyText":"Time to wrap up. China’s economy has posted its slowest growth in 18 months, prompting the People’s Bank of China to cut a key lending rate for the first time since the early months of the pandemic. GDP in China expanded by 4% year-on-year in the last quarter of 2021, taking the shine off 8.1% growth in the whole year. Economists said that the domestic economy was suffering from the ongoing pandemic, and the credit crunch in its property sector, with retail spending weakening in December. The World Economic Forum’s virtual Davos has begun, after the Annual Meeting was delayed due to the pandemic. China’s Xi Jinping warned that inflation was a growing risk, and expressed fears of economic pain if advanced economies hiked interest rates. If major economies slam on the brakes or take a U-turn in the monetary policies, there would be serious negative spillovers.” President Xi also warned of disastrous consequences from a Cold War mentality, at a time when tensions are rising with the West over Tiawan, and threats to national security. India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, called for global action on tackling cryptocurrency problems, along with supply chain issues, climate, and inflation. UN secretary-general António Guterres said that inequality over vaccine rollouts, and an unfair global financial system, was hurting the recovery. Anthony Fauci, chief medical advisor to President Biden, warned virtual Davos that disinformation spread through social media is undermining the battle against Covid-19. The online-only event also heard that Moderna hopes to rollout a combined vaccine for flu and Covid-19 by autumn 2023. Oxfam reported that the 10 richest men in the world have seen their global wealth double to $1.5tn (£1.01tn) since the start of the global pandemic following a surge in share and property prices that has widened the gap between rich and poor. In the City, the FTSE 100 closed at a two-year high.... .. but Unilever slumped by 7% after seeing its £50bn approach to buy GSK’s consumer healthcare operation rejected. The chairman of Credit Suisse, António Horta-Osório, has resigned after the Swiss bank found that he had broken Covid-19 quarantine laws, with attendance at the Wimbledon tennis tournament thought to be among the allegations. Here are the other main stories today: Goodnight. GW Back at virtual Davos, UN secretary-general António Guterres has challenged business leaders to: Drive equity and fairness Reform the global financial system Support real climate action In a special address, Guterres warns that: The world is emerging from depths of a paralysing economic crisis, but the recovery remains fragile and uneven, amid the lingering pandemic, persistent labour market challenges, ongoing supply chain disruption, rising inflation and looming debt traps, and the geopolitical divide. He warns that global vaccination rates are falling behind the UN’s targets (which will increase the risk of new variants), saying: Vaccination rates in high-income countries are, shamefully, seven times higher than in African countries. We need vaccine equity now. Guterres adds we must prepare for the next pandemic by improving early warning and rapid response plans, strengthening the World Health Organisation, and bolstering local primary healthcare. Guterres warns that the global financial system should be reformed to work for all countries. At this critical moment we are setting in stone a lopsided recovery. Eight out of 10 recovery dollars are being spend in advanced economies, he says, meaning developing countries are at a huge disadvantage, as they experience their slowest growth in a generation. Emerging economies are suffering higher interest rates and soaring energy and food bills, Guterres says, calling for urgent reforms on debt restructuring And on the climate emergency, Guterres warns that global emissions are set to soar over levels that would keep global warming within 1.5 degrees: The UK’s blue-chip share index has closed at its highest levels since January 2020, as China’s move to stimulate its slowing economy boosted markets. The FTSE 100 index ended the day 68 points higher at 7611 points, up 0.9% today, as it continues to recover from the shock of the pandemic. It has now gained 3% since the start of this year, after finally recovering its losses since the February 2020 crash. Housebuilder Taylor Wimpey ended the day as the top riser, up 4.2%, after reporting a strong order book for this year and confirming it plans a share buyback plan. GlaxoSmithKline closed 4% higher, after rejecting a £50bn offer for its consumer healthcare arm from Unilever -- which fell 7% after its failed bid raised questions over its strategy. Copper producer Antofagasta (+4.2%), commercial property developer Land Securities (+3.2%), pharmaceuticals group AstraZeneca (+2.6%), and consumer goods maker Reckitt Benckiser (+3.2%) were also in the risers. China’s move to ease monetary policy today, as growth slowed in the last quarter of 2021, gave markets a lift. David Madden, analyst at Equiti Capital, says: Stocks in Europe are up on the session as The People’s Bank of China cut the borrowing cost on 700-billion-yuan worth of one-year medium-term lending facility loans to 2.85%. The move by the Chinese central bank comes as it was confirmed the Chinese economy expanded by 4% in the last quarter of 2021, which was a drop off from the 4.9% growth registered in the preceding three months. It was the weakest quarterly growth reading in 18 months. Countries around the world are largely experiencing a cooling in their growth as the post pandemic boom is running out of steam, but it is worth noting that China was already moving down a gear before the pandemic struck. The latest retail sales data from China were disappointing too as the report came in at 1.7% - the lowest in 15 months – it speaks to dwindling consumer appetite. The FTSE 100 traded above 7600 for the first time in nearly two years. The London market is enjoying a broad rally as banks, construction, energy, pharma and tobacco stocks are up on the day. It is a similar situation in the eurozone as the DAX and the CAC are showing solid gains too. The New York Stock Exchange remains closed today as the US celebrates Martin Luther King Day. Volatility is low as many Americans are on holiday. The world’s 20 top performing hedge fund managers earned a record $65.4bn ($48bn) profit for their clients in 2021 after bets placed on rising stock markets paid off. The biggest winner was TCI, the fund run by British billionaire Sir Chris Hohn, which made a gain of $9.5bn last year, according to the annual rankings by LCH Investments. TCI, which manages about $44bn of assets and is known in the City and on Wall Street as one of the most aggressive activist investors, made a gain of 23.3% in 2021. TCI, which stands for the Children’s Investment fund, has made total gains of $36.5bn since it was set up in 2003. Hohn, a philanthropist and climate crisis activist, paid himself $152m last year, less than a third of the $475m he received the previous year. He has pumped more than £4bn into his personal children’s charity and in recent years has taken on a second cause: the climate crisis, promising to use TCI’s $44bn of investments to “force change on companies who refuse to take their environmental emissions seriously”. Hohn is the single biggest individual donor to Extinction Rebellion (XR), which has staged high-profile climate protests around the world. “Humanity is aggressively destroying the world with climate change and there is an urgent need for us all to wake up to this fact,” he said when he was revealed as XR’s main funder. India’s PM Narendra Modi went on to call for a collective global approach to issues facing the world - including supply chain disruption, inflation, and climate change. He also singles out cryptocurrency as another area where collective, synchronised action is needed, telling the Davos Agenda that: Given the sort of technology this is based on, decisions taken by any one country are not going to be enough to resolve challenges related to it. We need to adopt a uniform approach to it. Late last year, it emerged that India was preparing a bill to regulate cryptocurrencies, which could ban the use of cryptocurrencies as a method of payment in India, and also allow the country’s central bank to launch an official digital currency. Modi also calls on democratic nations to reform the world’s multinational organisations, so they are better suited to tackling today’s challenges. Given the global landscape today, the question that also arises, is whether multilateral organisations are able to address the new world order, and new challenges. When these institutions were created, the situation was quite different. Today, circumstances have changed, they are very different. India’s prime minister Narendra Modi says it is the best time to invest in India, and that the country has given the world a ‘bouquet of hope’. In a special address to the World Economic Forum, Modi says India wants to become a trusted partner to the world in global supply chains, and is in talks with many countries to agree free trade deals. Modi cites India’s commitment to deep economic reforms, and the $1.3trn it is investing in digital connectivity infrastructure. He also points to its pharmaceuticals industry which produced many vaccine doses to fight the pandemic, describing India as ‘pharmacy to the world’, and also its growth in start-ups. Moderna’s chief executive has predicted that a combined booster shot for Covid-19 and flu could be available, in some countries, by the autumn of 2023. Stéphane Bancel told the panel session at the World Economic Forum’s Davos Agenda that his company is aiming to create a single annual booster. Bancel explained that: “Our goal is to be able to have a single annual booster so that we don’t have compliance issues where people don’t want to get two to three shots a winter,” Instead, they would get one dose which included “a booster for corona, and a booster for flu and RSV (Respiratory syncytial virus) to make sure that people get their vaccines”, Bancel explained. Q: So how close are we to a vaccine that offers protection against Covid-19 and also flu? The ‘best case scenario’ is that this combined vaccine would be available in the “fall of ‘23”, Bancel replied. He cautions that it wouldn’t be available in all countries, but could be available in some countries. Germany wants to respect jointly agreed fiscal rules as this helps to control inflation, its new finance minister Christian Lindner said on Monday. Lindner added he expected the “real debate” about the European Union’s fiscal rules (which cover tax and spending) to start in June, Reuters reports: Speaking to reporters in Brussels before his first Eurogroup meeting with counterparts from other euro zone member states, Lindner said that the fiscal rules of the EU’s Stability and Growth Pact had proven its flexibility during the crisis. “But now it’s the time to build up fiscal buffers again, we need resilience not only in the private sector, but also in the public sector,” Lindner said. “That’s why I’m very much in favour of reducing sovereign debt.” Back in the markets, European equities are holding their early gains. The pan-European Stoxx 600, which has made a jittery start to 2022, is up 0.6% today. The UK’s FTSE 100 is still on track for a new two-year closing high, up 52 points at 7595 points - and has gained around 2.8% so far this year. GlaxoSmithKline has eased back in London, but is still leading the risers (+3.3%) after rebuffing Unileve’s £50bn approach to buy its consumer healthcare arm. Unilever is still sliding, down 7%, at the bottom of the FTSE 100 leaderboard. Today’s investor reaction demonstrates Unilever’s “lack of management credibility” says Chris Beckett, head of equity research at Quilter Cheviot. There are also concerns about the amount of debt the group could take on to finance an acquisition: “Should Unilever eventually succeed with an offer, an acquisition of this business would be consistent with its stated strategy - increasing exposure to high growth, higher margin health, beauty and hygiene products. GSK’s consumer business currently has strong positions in the toothpaste and vitamin markets so there is certainly a fit there for Unilever. “However, if the acquisition was financed with circa 80% debt and 20% equity it would be concerning as the company’s debt pile would begin to stack high. In the short term, the acquisition would be far less enhancing to the value of the business than a share buyback of a similar scale. Unilever could control this debt by following through with a subsequent sale of its remaining food businesses. This would be good strategically but materially dilutive. “Initial investor reaction demonstrates Unilever’s lack of management credibility. Unilever’s management have not demonstrated the ability to consistently grow both sales and margins and as such are now turning to large scale inorganic growth to do so. However, there is not much faith that they will be able to do this with a larger, more diverse range of products. Given vocal investor concern of late and Unilever’s share price reaction this morning, this could prevent a higher offer from materialising. “Unilever is not an expensive stock trading on 16.5x this year’s expected earnings - a substantial discount to the wider consumer staples category. However input cost pressure and lower disposable income in many markets will make 2022 a difficult year for the company, with GSK’s consumer business or not.” Unilever has pledged to grow its health, beauty and hygiene business and sell its slower-growing operations. CEO Alan Jope said this morning that GSK Consumer Healthcare would be “a very attractive option” for Unilever but added “it’s not the only option”. Here’s the full story: China has warned the US and Europe against a rapid rise in interest rates that would “slam on the brakes” of the global recovery from the pandemic. Central banks should maintain the monetary stimulus or risk “serious economic consequences” from the spillover effects with developing markets bearing the brunt. In a virtual speech to open the World Economic Forum’s Davos Agenda, the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, said that while global inflation risks were emerging, policymakers should strengthen economic policy coordination and develop policies to prevent the world economy from dipping again. “We must do everything necessary to clear the shadow of the pandemic and boost economic and social recovery and development,” he said. “If major economies slam on the brakes or make major U-turns in their monetary policies there will be serious negative spillovers. They would present challenges to global and economic financial stability and developing countries would bear the brunt.” Anthony Fauci, chief medical advisor to the President of United States, has warned virtual Davos that disinformation is undermining the battle against Covid-19. In a World Economic Forum session on the pandemic, Fauci explains that the entire world is facing this disinformation, including in “a very, very disconcerting way in the US”. It is accompanying a problem where everyone should be pulling together against a common enemy, namely the virus, Fauci explains. Fauci warned that: We have disinformation that is entirely destructive to a comprehensive public health endeavour. I’m not sure how we’re going to counter that, except by getting out as much correct information as we possibly can, and use the social media in a positive way, as opposed to in the somewhat destructive way that it is being used right now. Fauci also explains that it is too early to say when Covid-19 will become endemic. He says Covid-19 will not be eradicated - pointing out that smallpox is the only infectious disease to be eradicated in man. But Covid-19 could be controlled - meaning it is present at a level that does not disrupt society. Fauci also explains that the long-term goal is to develop vaccines that target a commonality among all the real and potential variants, rather than getting into a “whack-a-mole” approach of boosters to every future variant that emerges. Moderna’s CEO, Stéphane Bancel, explained that scientists are working out how the vaccine should be adjusted for the autumn of 2022: Annelies Wilder-Smith, professor of emerging infectious diseases at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, warned there is a ‘high probability’ that we will have another variant. Wilder-Smith says: The question is where, and when, and will it be more or less dangerous than the current variants of concern. High virus circulation drives the risk of new variants, she explains. But the hope is that future variants will not become more dangerous. It is likely that the virus will attenuate, so it has high transmissibility but causes less serious disease, Wilder-Smith added. The Scottish government is in line for a windfall of almost £700m after the largest ever auction of the country’s seabed plots attracted bids from big oil and renewable energy companies hoping to build next generation windfarms. Crown Estate Scotland will grant permission for oil companies including BP and Shell, renewable energy veterans Scottish Power and SSE, to lease the Scottish seabed to build enough windfarms to power the equivalent of 23m UK homes a year. The auction awarded seabed permits to 17 windfarm projects, out of more than 70 bidders, which will lay the foundation for companies to develop new wind power farms two-and-a-half times the size of the UK’s existing offshore wind fleet, and equal to Europe’s current combined capacity. Simon Hodge, the chief executive of Crown Estate Scotland, said the results were “a fantastic vote of confidence” in Scotland’s energy industry, which will deliver almost £700m “straight into the public finances and billions of pounds’ worth of supply chain commitments”. The Omicron variant knocked UK consumer confidence last month, as people grew less optimistic over the economic outlook. The latest consumer confidence report from YouGov and the Centre for Economics and Business Research (Cebr) found that: Headline consumer confidence declined by -0.5 points in December 2021 Business activity measures for past month and next 12 months both worsened Britons reported that their household finances improved over the past month, but grew more pessimistic about the year ahead Home value outlook rose to highest level since May 2017 Back in the UK, Amazon has halted its planned ban on UK-issued Visa credit cards. The web retailer has dropped plans to stop accepting UK-issued Visa credit cards this week, and says it is working with Visa to resolve a dispute over payment fees. The company said in an email to customers that: “The expected change regarding the use of Visa credit cards on Amazon.co.uk will no longer take place on January 19,” “We are working closely with Visa on a potential solution that will enable customers to continue using their Visa credit cards on Amazon.co.uk.” Analysts had suggested that a last-minute deal could be reached, and that the row could be a negotiating tactic by Amazon to get Visa to lower its fees. The outlook for jobs globally this year has worsened markedly since last spring as new variants of the Covid-19 virus have slowed growth and restricted hiring, according to a report from the International Labour Organisation. In its latest assessment of the state of the labour market, the Geneva-based ILO said unemployment would remain above 2019 levels until at least 2023 and the damage caused by the pandemic would take years to repair. The ILO said its latest estimates showed there would be the equivalent of 52m fewer jobs globally in 2022 than in the last quarter of 2019, the period immediately before the pandemic struck. That represents a doubling from the 26m in the organisation’s last labour market update in May 2021. According to the report, global unemployment will be 207m, a smaller drop from the 214m in 2021 than previously expected and well above the 186m reported in 2019. The ILO said the impact of the pandemic on employment was “significantly” greater than the raw figures suggested, because many people had left the labour force entirely. More here: President Xi insisted during his Davos speech that globalisation is the trend of our times, comparing it to a river that may face counter-currents, but can’t be stopped from reaching the sea. And he warned that a ‘cold war mentality’ must be discarded, saying: We need to discard cold war mentality and seek peaceful co-existence and win-win outcomes. The world today is far from tranquil, Xi adds, warning of ‘rhetoric that stokes hatred and prejudice’. He says acts of containment, suppression or confrontation arising from this cause harm to world peace and security, warning: History has proved time and again that confrontation does not solve problems, it only invites catastrophic consequences. Xi then adds that “protectionism and unilateralism” ultimately hurt both sides, and that “hegemony and bullying” run against the tides of history. Tensions between China and the West have been rising in recent months, with Australia, the UK and US creating a three-way strategic defence alliance called Aukus, and rising concerns that China could invade Taiwan. Xi also criticises “overstretching the concept of national security” to hold back economic and technological advances. [Both the UK and the US have been active on this. The US communications regulator has voted to revoke China Telecom’s licence in America last year, while the UK has been looking to create a new funding model for nuclear power stations to shut out Chinese companies.] President Xi also insists that China’s ‘overall momentum’ remains sound, after today’s GDP data showed that gross domestic product grew by around 8% year on year in 2021. We have every confidence in the future of China’s economy, Xi tells virtual Davos. He adds that it will continue with its economic reforms and the opening up of its economy. Xi also says China will let the market play a decisive role in allocating resources, and that all types of capital are welcome, if they comply with laws. Beijing has been cracking down on its technology sector, which prompted Yahoo to pull out of China last November. More clips from president Xi’s speech, in which he spoke about the need for equitable rollout of Covid-19 vaccines: Xi Jinping, President of the People’s Republic of China, has warned that global inflation risks are emerging, and urged countries to strengthen economic policy coordination to prevent the world economy from dipping again. In a virtual speech to open the World Economic Forum’s Davos Agenda, Xi warns that that emerging markets could suffer if central banks tighten monetary policy to tackle inflation. He also called for world leaders to continue to embrace cooperation to defeat the pandemic. Xi explains that the world is undergoing major changes, and that the global economy faces many constraints - such as ongoing supply chain disruption and a tight energy market. The global low inflation environment has changed, Xi says, with inflation risks emerging. And he warns that there could be serious spillovers if major economies apply the brakes to monetary policy (by raising interest rates and ending stimulus measures). That would create challenges to economic and financial stability, Xi warns, with developing markets bearing the brunt. Update: Xi says: If major economies slam on the brakes, or take a u-turn in their monetary policies, there will be serious negative spillovers. They would present challenges to global economic and financial stability, and developing countries would bear the brunt of it. Xi also says the international community has fought a courageous battle against the pandemic - comparing the response to one gigantic ship riding out a storm, where a collection of small boats would not have survived. He also says the pandemic continues to pose a serious threat to people’s safety and health - strong confidence and cooperation is the only way to respond, rather than holding each other back or assigning blame. Economists and researchers at the NIESR thinktank are to stage a two-week strike in a row over two years of below inflation pay offers, the Unite union has announced. The strike is set to begin this coming Friday, and run to Friday 4 February. NIESR employees held a strike ballot after being offered a basic pay deal worth 2% this year, after wages were frozen last year. That’s sharply below UK inflation, with the consumer prices index hitting 5.1% in November and RPI inflation running at 7.1%. NIESR’s staff were understandably unhappy about being offered a real terms pay cut, and have voted to walk out. As our economics correspondent Richard Partington reported out last month: Asking workers to stomach a below-inflation pay rise is never popular. Asking them to do so when their day job is forecasting the cost of living is really asking for trouble. The action means that there is a very real possibility that NIESR’s forthcoming forecasts for the UK and global economies, which have been published quarterly since the 1980s, will not go ahead, says Unite. Unite regional officer, Peter Storey says the walkout can be avoided, if NIESR’s management improve their offer. “Unite is committed to reaching an agreement with the NIESR but the Institute needs to improve its pay offer. Morale is at an all-time low, so it’s high time for management to recognise the contribution NIESR’s staff have made to the Institute’s success through difficult times. ”The strike will disrupt a number of research contracts and forecasts for the UK and the global economy. We urge management to join Unite in talks this week and avoid this dispute.” The chairman of Credit Suisse, António Horta-Osório, has resigned after the Swiss bank reportedly found that he had broken Covid-19 quarantine laws, including by attending the Wimbledon tennis tournament, my colleague Jasper Jolly writes. Horta-Osório, the former chief executive of Lloyds Banking Group, said in a statement that his “personal actions” had made it more difficult for him to represent the bank. He had also admitted breaking Swiss quarantine rules. It means that Horta-Osório managed less than a year in the job, after he was brought in to steady the bank after a series of expensive failures, including its involvement in the collapse of Archegos, an investment company, and Greensill Capital, a supply chain finance firm. Horta-Osório said in a statement issued by Credit Suisse on Monday. “I regret that a number of my personal actions have led to difficulties for the bank and compromised my ability to represent the bank internally and externally. “I therefore believe that my resignation is in the interest of the bank and its stakeholders at this crucial time.” The breach emerged in December, after Reuters reported it was discovered through a preliminary investigation by Credit Suisse’s legal team. The news came just weeks after Horta-Osório admitted that he breached Covid rules in Switzerland, having flown out of the country within three days of arriving on 28 November despite being required to quarantine for 10 days. Credit Suisse confirmed on Monday that Horta-Osório had resigned after an investigation commissioned by the board, but did not give any details of the findings. More here: Here’s Neil Wilson of Markets.com on Unilever’s rebuffed £50bn approach for GlaxoSmithKline’s Consumer Healthcare business: Unilever wants the attractive cash flow and growth of GSK’s joint venture with Pfizer (4-6% is the aim for the GSK unit, though many think this is a tad ambitious). Unilever CEO Alan Jope is under pressure to grow the business after a lacklustre few years - a megadeal highlights the difficulty is fixing the core business and/or a lack of ideas. Terry Smith – boss of Fundsmith, a top shareholder – says the company has ‘clearly lost the plot’ (in his annual letter to shareholders). GSK’s CEO Emma Walmsley is under pressure, too, not least from activist investors, to bolster the firm’s drugs pipeline; a particularly acute concern having missed out on a covid vaccine. Debt may prohibit Unilever from going much higher; the company leveraged itself up after the Kraft-Heinz bid to ward off leveraged buyers...ironic that this could stop it from doing a deal. Other suitors, including private equity, may move in for the kill. Does Unilever want it bad enough? I don’t think so. More pressing things to consider … like the purpose of mayonnaise. Feels like bolting together two rather slow growth consumer staples businesses, which leaves scale/synergies as the key to success … but then you still have all the debt to pay down. The number of households suffering from “fuel stress” – those spending at least 10% of their family budgets on energy bills – is set to treble to 6.3m overnight when the new energy price cap comes in on 1 April, according to a leading research group. Fuel stress will no longer be confined to the poorest households, according to a study by the Resolution Foundation. Low- and middle-income families will also find it hard to cope as they spend a far greater share of their family budget on these essentials than higher earners. The forecast will add to calls for the government to take action to avert a cost-of-living catastrophe after global energy market prices surged to record levels. The research shows 9% of English households are currently experiencing fuel stress, an indicator of finding energy bills unaffordable and also the definition of fuel poverty in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. That figure is expected to leap to 27% when the energy price cap rises to about £2,000 a year in April, an increase of more than 50%. The energy regulator, Ofgem, will announce the new price cap level on 7 February. More here: Back in China, new government data has shown its property market slump persisted in December -- helping to spur the People’s Bank of China into today’s interest rate cut. The downturn spanned developers’ sales, investments, land purchasing and financing activities, according to Bloomberg calculations based on full-year government figures released today. It suggests that weaker demand from homebuyers, and the intensifying credit crunch facing developers, is hitting the sector. Bloomberg explains: The woes in December were particularly acute in property investment, which shrank 17% from November and 14% from a year earlier. Such spending directly contributed 13% of gross domestic product last year. Home sales by value declined 19.6% from a year earlier, a sixth consecutive monthly drop, a signal that investors shouldn’t be cheered by figures released Saturday that showed a narrowing decline in new-home prices. More here: China’s Home Market Slump Persists on All Fronts, Hurting Growth The FTSE 100 has hit a new two-year high this morning, as it benefits from hopes of an economic recovery from the pandemic. The blue-chip index has risen by 53 points, or 0.7%, to 7596 points, levels last seen in late January 2020 just before Covid-19 struck. GSK are still the top riser, after Unilever said its consumer arm would be a ‘strong strategic fit’ after seeing a £50bn deal rejected (see earlier post). It’s followed by consumer goods company Reckitt Benckiser (+3%), mining company Antofagasta (2.6%), conference organiser Informa (+2.5%). Housebuilder Taylor Wimpey are also higher (+2.5%) after telling investors to expect a share buyback in the coming months after an “excellent” 2021. Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, says: “European markets have opened on a stronger footing with the healthcare sector outperforming amid M&amp;A speculation. The FTSE 100 is in an upbeat mood, extending gains after Friday’s positive close with the index close to breaking above the next major resistance hurdle at 7,600 as it inches towards the January 2020 pre-covid peak.” And a deal for GlaxoSmithKline’s consumer products vision is “very much still on the cards” despite GSK rejecting three offers including the latest £50 billion approach, she adds: Unilever will have to raise its bid to somewhere around £55 billion and move fast in order to avoid a bidding war from rival private equity buyers who are likely to be eyeing up counter offers. Large-cap UK stocks mostly missed out on the M&amp;A boom last year. However, this deal would be one of the biggest ever London-listed deals and the largest globally since the start of Covid-19. It would create some attractive synergies between GSK’s consumer health brands and Unilever’s Beauty and Personal Care business, which has suffered a slowdown in sales during the pandemic.” Shares in Credit Suisse have dropped 1.4% in early trading. Shares in healthcare company GSK have jumped 5.5% in early trading after it rebuffed a £50bn takeover offer from Unilever for its consumer healthcare venture. GSK is the top FTSE 100 riser, after it insisted Unilever’s proposals “fundamentally undervalued” the consumer business and its future prospects. But Unilever is bookending the other end of the FTSE, falling nearly 6%, as analysts predict it would have to make a higher offer to secure the prize - which Unilever insists this morning would be a good fit with its business. GSK’s consumer arm owns brands including Panadol painkillers, Sensodyne toothpaste, Tums digestive health products, Otrivin and Theraflu respiratory products and Nicorette nicotine replacement therapy Over the weekend GSK released new, higher organic sales growth forecasts for its consumer health division, which is a joint venture with Pfizer. It is planning to spin it off, and float on the stock market. GSK says: The Board of GSK therefore remains focused on executing its proposed demerger of the Consumer Healthcare business, to create a new independent global category-leading consumer company which, subject to approval from shareholders, is on track to be achieved in mid-2022. Unilever has confirmed that it approached GSK and Pfizer about a potential acquisition of the business, insisting that the deal would make sense, saying: GSK Consumer Healthcare is a leader in the attractive consumer health space and would be a strong strategic fit as Unilever continues to re-shape its portfolio. European stock markets have opened higher at the start of the week. The FTSE 100, Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC are all up around 0.4%, as investors digest China’s decision to cut a lending rate to stimulate its economy, as growth slows. Lee Hardman of MUFG Bank, Ltd explains: The main development overnight has been the decision from the PBoC to provide further stimulus to support growth in China. The PBoC decided to lower the one-year medium-term lending facility (MLF) rate by a larger than expected 0.10 point to 2.85%. It was the first cut since the initial negative COVID shock hit in April 2020. It follows last month’s decision to lower the one-year loan prime rate (LPR) by 0.05 point. According to Bloomberg, the decision to lower the MLF rate suggests that the PBoC wants banks to increase lending providing a credit boost to the economy. It appears that the PBoC is now providing more front-loaded policy support to prevent growth from falling significantly below 5.0% this year. The 10 richest men in the world have seen their global wealth double to $1.5tn (£1.01tn) since the start of the global pandemic following a surge in share and property prices that has widened the gap between rich and poor, according to a report from Oxfam. Urging governments to impose a one-off 99% wealth tax on Covid-19 windfall gains, the charity said World Bank figures showed 163 million more people had been driven below the poverty line while the super-rich were benefiting from the stimulus provided by governments around the world to mitigate the impact of the virus. Oxfam projects that by 2030, 3.3 billion people will be living on less than $5.50 per day. The charity said the incomes of 99% of the world’s population had reduced from March 2020 to October 2021, when Elon Musk, the founder of the electric car company Tesla, and the other nine richest billionaires had been collectively growing wealthier by $1.3bn a day. Here’s the full story: Credit Suisse is proving to be “something of a graveyard” for the reputations of once high-flying international financiers, says Peter Thal Larsen of Breakingviews. The Swiss bank announced on Monday that Chair António Horta-Osório had stepped down following a board investigation. It’s been less than a year since he arrived to stabilise the lender still reeling from the ousting of former chief executive Tidjane Thiam. New broom Axel Lehmann, a former UBS bigwig, has to hope his reputation is more durable. Credit Suisse appeared to have scored a bit of a coup last year when it recruited Horta-Osório, who had led the turnaround of Britain’s Lloyds Banking Group following the financial crisis. The Portuguese banker made an immediate impact following his arrival in Zurich, settling a Mozambican scandal, drawing a line under the spying saga that toppled Tidjane, and unveiling a new strategy to shift capital from investment banking to wealth management. Yet Horta-Osório’s personal conduct appears to have fallen short of the high standards he set for the bank. Early in December he admitted to “unintentionally” breaching Switzerland’s Covid-19 quarantine rules. An internal investigation subsequently found that he had also broken British rules when attending the Wimbledon tennis finals in July, Reuters reported last month. That was hard to square with his desire to improve Credit Suisse’s culture and focus on “personal responsibility and accountability”. More here: New Credit Suisse chair has grim streak to break Antonio Horta-Osório, who is well-known in the UK following his time running Lloyds Banking Group, says: “I have worked hard to return Credit Suisse to a successful course, and I am proud of what we have achieved together in my short time at the bank. Credit Suisse’s strategic realignment will provide for a clear focus on strengthening, simplifying and investing for growth. I am convinced that Credit Suisse is well positioned today and on the right track for the future. I regret that a number of my personal actions have led to difficulties for the bank and compromised my ability to represent the bank internally and externally. I therefore believe that my resignation is in the interest of the bank and its stakeholders at this crucial time. I wish my colleagues at Credit Suisse every success for the future.” Big news in the banking sector this morning: Credit Suisse chairman António Horta-Osório has quit following an internal probe into his personal conduct, following breaches of Covid-19 rules. Credit Suisse announced that Horta-Osório had resigned after a board investigation, after it emerged he had broken British quarantine rules to attend the Wimbledon tennis finals in London last July. The Portuguese banker had flown in from Switzerland, which had been on the UK government’s amber list of countries that required arrivals to isolate for 10 days. Horta-Osório had also admitted breaching Covid rules in Switzerland at the end of November, having flown out of the country within three days of arriving on 28 November, despite being required to quarantine for 10 days. It’s an embarrassing blow to the embattled lender, which had appointed Horta-Osório less than a year ago. Credit Suisse incurred heavy losses from the implosion of the Archegos investment fund last year, and also provided funding to the now-collapsed supply chain finance firm Greensill Capital. Credit Suisse has now appointed board member Axel Lehmann chair, as it tries to recover from this string of scandals. Severin Schwan, Vice-Chairman and Lead Independent Director of the Board of Credit Suisse, said: “We respect António’s decision and owe him considerable thanks for his leadership in defining the new strategy, which we will continue to implement over the coming months and years. Axel Lehmann as the new Chairman, with his extensive international and Swiss industry experience, is ideally suited to drive forward the strategic and cultural transformation of the bank. We wish Axel every success in his new role and António all the best for the future.” Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. China’s economy slowed at the end of last year as the Covid-19 pandemic and the crisis in its property sector hit growth-- prompting Beijing to cut a key interest rate. China’s GDP expanded by 4% year-on-year in October-December, data from the National Bureau of Statistics shows - which is the weakest expansion in 18 months. For 2021 as a whole, China’s economy expanded by 8.1% - the fastest in a decade - as it recovered from the slump in activity at the start of 2020. But there are clear signs of a slowdown at the end of the year, as China’s government introduced new restrictions to combat the latest wave of Covid-19. Retail sales growth slowing sharply to just 1.7% year-on-year in December, down from 3.9%. Spillovers from the crisis at indebted property developer Evergrande also weighed on China’s economy. And in response, China’s central bank has cut its key interest rate for the first time in almost two years to help bolster the economy. The People’s Bank of China has lowered the rate at which it provides one-year loans to banks by 10 basis points -- the first reduction since April 2020. Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics, says: “Consumption remains the weakest link in China’s growth story at the moment and that will by and large continue for much of this year,” said “We think Beijing has a bottom line of around 5%. As is the case at the moment, if growth is weaker than that, they’d feel strongly motivated to pursue more policy easing.” China’s president Xi Jinping will be speaking later today, as part of the Davos Agenda series organised by the World Economic Forum (as the usual Annual Meeting has been postponed again due to the pandemic).

The talks will reignite debate about China’s involvement in the UK nuclear power industry. Two years ago, the government paused approval for the £18bn Hinkley Point C project because of security concerns over China’s stake. China General Nuclear Power Group (CGN), a state-run corporation, is said to be interested in buying a major stake in eight power stations, including Sizewell in Suffolk and Dungeness in Kent. The power stations are operated by EDF Energy, a subsidiary of the French company EDF, but earlier this year, the British Gas owner, Centrica, put its 20% stake up for sale. The Sunday Times suggested CGN hoped to acquire a 49% stake, which indicates EDF could be looking to offload some of its shareholding. The proposed deal would be a headache for Theresa May, who is concerned about giving China greater access to critical infrastructure projects and has initiated a new national security test for foreign takeovers. CGN is becoming an increasingly important player in Britain’s atomic plans, and is working with EDF Energy on plans to develop a new nuclear power station at Bradwell-on-Sea in Essex. The sale could attract interest from pension and insurance funds, but analysts say the pool of bidders is small because the reactors have a limited shelf live. Paul Dorfman, a senior researcher at University College London’s Energy Institute, said Britain was an outlier in its openness to Chinese investment. “It’s entirely credible [that China would be allowed to buy the stake] in the context of what the British government is doing,” he said. “There is no other OECD country that would allow China to own any of its critical infrastructure, let alone its nuclear infrastructure.” Dorfman said EDF, with €33bn (£29bn) of debt, was eager to raise funds from asset sales. “EDF is in financial difficulties and has been for some time. It’s looking to sell off whatever it can sell off. It’s worried about debt, its credit rating … plus its waste and decommissioning liabilities,” he said. The eight nuclear power stations, which used to be grouped under British Energy, generate 8.9 gigawatts of electricity and supply about 20% of Britain’s electricity needs. They were bought by EDF for £12.5bn in 2008. The following year, Centrica took a 20% stake, which it values at £1.7bn."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2020/nov/08/one-touch-away-from-dust-burnt-leaves-and-ash-a-metaphor-for-our-catastrophic-times","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2020-11-07T19:00:20Z","webTitle":"'One touch away from dust': burnt leaves and ash a metaphor for our catastrophic times | Kirsty Tranter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/nov/08/one-touch-away-from-dust-burnt-leaves-and-ash-a-metaphor-for-our-catastrophic-times","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2020/nov/08/one-touch-away-from-dust-burnt-leaves-and-ash-a-metaphor-for-our-catastrophic-times","fields":{"headline":"'One touch away from dust': burnt leaves and ash a metaphor for our catastrophic times","bodyText":"December 2019: The Sydney Harbour Bridge disappears into a pall of smoke. The usual measurements for air quality seem almost absurdly useless for knowing how to act or how to make sense of this crisis: 10 times, 11 times hazardous levels. Beaches are darkened by ash in the water. Our house in the inner west smells of burning, even after being closed all day. The smoke alarm sounds periodically, piercing the night, waking the children. Fragments of burnt forest fall in the city, bringing to mind the black flowers imagined by Emma Craven, the murdered daughter in the 1985 nuclear noir BBC series Edge of Darkness. I watched Edge of Darkness as an anxious teenager on the verge of political awakening, worried about nuclear war. My scepticism was already formed, but it was given new contours, new imaginative extent, by this story – a political narrative underwritten by mythic force. Rewatching the show recently, much of it felt painfully relevant. It is a story about how humans are wrecking the world, and this alone explains why it returns to me so insistently. Edge of Darkness is a doomsday tale, but it is also, crucially, a narrative about grief. The death of the planet told as a story about personal mourning: this, I suspect, is what brings to mind images of the stricken face of Detective Ronald Craven, played by a grim Bob Peck; the dark, toxic caves; the crackle of the Geiger counter; the laugh of the cynical, mad American agent. At the beginning of the series, Craven’s daughter Emma is shot to death on their front doorstep. He uncovers a giant conspiracy as he doggedly investigates her death. Emma turns out to have been involved with an activist group trying to bring attention to the dangers of nuclear power. Her death was a political assassination. Emma appears as a chatty ghost from time to time. In one conversation with her father she explains that the Earth will protect itself against the threat that humans pose, and that the consequences for humans will be bad. She calls this philosophy “Gaia”, the name of the ancient Greek goddess of the Earth. The screenwriter, Troy Kennedy Martin, seems to have been influenced by the thinking of climate scientist James Lovelock, who proposed a similar theory of Earth as a single, interconnected organism. Once upon a time, Emma says, millions of years ago, life was threatened by a long ice age, and the planet brought forth black flowers to cover the surface of the world. These dark petals absorbed the sun’s warmth, allowing life to reemerge. “That is the power of Gaia,” she claims. Those black flowers will bloom again, Emma predicts, soaking up the increasing heat from the atmosphere, hastening the warming of the planet, melting the ice caps and devastating the human population. “If man is the enemy, it will destroy him,” she tells her father. At the end of the series, Craven stands alone on a cold hill. He does not turn into a tree, which Martin envisaged in his original version of the screenplay, but he is tree-like. Black flowers bloom against the snow, perfect round petals shivering in the wind. I think of these flowers when I read about the phenomenon of dark snow, where particles of pollution fall on the arctic tundra, reducing the landscape’s albedo, which is the ability of the snow to reflect light and heat back into the atmosphere. I think of them when I read about forms of toxic algae that thrive in warmer waters. And again when I learn about Gamba grass, an invasive species that burns hotter and faster than any native flora, and also grows far more quickly, upending the traditional cycles of fire and native regrowth in the landscape of Australia’s Northern Territory. And again when the massive blazes to the south generate thunderstorms over the dry Earth, storms of lightning that bring no rain, just more fire. *** One December afternoon in Sydney’s inner west the sun appears as a neon disc, electric orange-pink against the greyish-brown smoke that covers the sky. The haze flattens the sun’s rays so that we walk through an eerie false twilight, empty of shadows. “You can see the sun!” my four-year-old son exclaims. I quickly cover his eyes and explain that even though it doesn’t hurt to look at the sun like this, it still hurts your eyes on the inside, where you can’t feel it. Later, I stand in the front yard in the sinister evening light, trying not to look at the sun as it sets. A white flake drifts past, uncannily like snow. But it is not snow. It is the opposite of snow, snow’s horrifying evil twin. It is a piece of ash, I realise, in a long, awful moment of recognition. More of them spiral downwards, so light that gravity struggles to bring them to Earth. They have been blown here from the fires many miles away. Another association bothers the edges of memory. I remember standing on Second Avenue in New York’s East Village on 11 September, 2001, after watching the twin towers burn from my corner of First Street and First Avenue. The parade of shell-shocked people – men in their suits, women in their sensible office heels – making their way uptown from Ground Zero, all dusted with ghostly white. Their shambling gaits, their blank survivors’ faces. As the days passed in New York, we learned more about the composition of this white dust: toxic chemicals and concrete and paper and cremated people. Our apartment was right on the border of the area where you could request a free air purifier from the city administration. We didn’t ever apply for ours. The fragments of disaster that fell on New York ranged from microscopic particles to dust to snowflake-sized scraps to bits of paper, charred around the edges, the writing on documents still legible. Everything could be made into pieces, this event announced, dissolved into its constitutive elements one way or another. One of my friends emerged from the World Trade Center subway station that morning to find a section of aircraft fuselage partly blocking the exit. There was a piece of an aeroplane there, he said to me. But no one was looking at the piece of aeroplane; they were all looking up, he said, and when he looked up too he saw the metal on the sides of the towers melting, turning into liquid. *** Where is it from, I wonder, the ash falling on Marrickville? Which of the many fires that dot the map, shifting closer together every time I refresh the screen? The gravity-defying ash seems to have travelled not simply through space but also through time, challenging not only geographic scale but temporal scale, too. This ash is the remains of ancient rainforests that have never been burned: some version of this remark has become commonplace, repeated by friends. It is tinged with fantasy, I know, this idea of the untouched forest, the place of innocent nature defiled by human action. And yet it is hard to escape the feeling that the ash has come to us from some primordial era, from a forest and a time before human industry, before the Anthropocene itself. We existed before you, the ash seems to say. With these fires we will displace you. In the anguished performance of public mourning for the forests, for the koalas and marsupials and baby bats, the unimaginable number of a billion animals, I begin to sense the displacement of a vast inarticulate sorrow at what colonial settlement has wrought for these past 200 years and more. Grief for all those trees and forests cleared, that habitat destroyed, those animals hunted to extinction. The people murdered. The genocide. Climate scientists voice their concern that some forests have been devastated beyond recovery, leaving a destructive carbon deficit. How long can these fires go on, we all wonder? Soon there will be nothing left to burn, friends joke, half-joke. But there is so much left to burn. *** The morning after the first December ash fall, the courtyard is covered in fine fragments: white, grey and charcoal black. My son left a plastic toy knife on the ground and when I pick it up there is a dirty penumbra around its shape, a pixelated shadow of ash, like the chalk outline around a murdered body. Traces, cinders. I think of Jacques Derrida, who valued these figures above all others in his thinking about the problem of presence and absence, but Derrida is no help. A leaf rests in my hand, a pale grey ghost transformed by extreme heat, impossibly fragile. It is like an inverse fossil: organic matter turned to ash, one touch away from dust. Miraculously, it retained this form as it travelled. It seems to gather to itself metaphors, similes, measures of comparison that might help to contain the unthinkable enormity, the giant present and future catastrophe it represents. On the concrete there is another leaf, which has tightly rolled as it burned. A piece of bark coming apart into fibres, like some delicate woven textile on the verge of coming undone. A shiny blackened crisp of something, dotted with tiny bubbles. It breaks when I lift it, and the disintegration of these things, the perfect leaf, the unidentifiable charred piece of forest, makes the raw tide of grief rise. I feel a compulsion to gather these fragments, to keep them intact, a blind ritual of mourning. A collection of relics builds on our wooden sideboard. I want to document these objects, to photograph them, to craft an image from light and shadow that will preserve them. My husband pulls out his big camera with the good lens, able to capture the startling, distinct textures of the pieces. The piece of bright, glassy rounded bark, so shiny it almost looks wet with lacquer. Beside it, the dry matte-grey leaf. The depthless black of the fibrous bark, marred by a smear of white ash. What will we do with this reliquary of charred leaves and bark, I wonder, when we move in four weeks’ time, preparing to return to the United States? It is difficult to imagine transporting these things safely, these objects the wind has carried to us from such a distance. They encode survival and extinction all at once, death masks of the forest. They look so beautiful on the camera’s bright little screen, and I am ashamed of my impulse to make them into pictures. It seems to betray or belittle the tragedy they represent, the sheer brutal choking violence of it. What happens to that violence when their material form is made aesthetic? The anger, the injustice, the fury? What is the role of such mourning within the sphere of action that must be taken in order to make any impact on the climate catastrophe? I treat the fragments with tenderness, with caution, understanding that I am acting like a person in shock, performing mindless comforting actions. The habitus of grief. I hope there will be no more of them to collect. I understand that this hope is baseless. We wait for the southerly, for the cool change, but the wind is hot and carries the smell of burning. Smoke speeds across the face of the orange moon. I think of Emma Craven’s sad, enigmatic smile as she watches her father destroy himself in the course of his search for answers, his passionate sense of purpose in a world that is already dead for him without her. What makes Emma’s fatalism so morbidly appealing? I suspect it is almost the only form of hope left to me, a depressive soul at the best of times, disillusioned politically, agreeing in a dejected way with Frederic Jameson or whoever said that it is easier for most people to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism. And, yet I know that belief in the power of imagination is the closest thing I have to faith or hope. Recently a friend posted a link to an article about a list of novels in a genre affiliated with climate fiction described as “HopePunk”, a term that made me snort with scorn. What could be less punk? But then I listened again to the Sex Pistols’ punk anthem “God Save the Queen” and heard anew its stark brutal sense of possibility amid destruction. Now I think maybe Emma’s black flowers are its perfect floral emblem. Toxic, powerful, darkly incandescent as the rage that animates this grief. The song is famous for its statement that there is no future, but there’s more to it. The future is over for the fascist regime, but not everyone else. “We’re the flowers in the dustbin,” Johnny Rotten sings, “the poison” that will annihilate the machine. “We’re the future.” Poisonous garbage flowers of the future. That might be an image of hope I can get behind. Let the reliquary crumble, I tell myself. Lay down the blackened wreath. “Grief breaks the heart and yet the grief comes next,” wrote the poet Martin Johnston. It is relentless. Perhaps that drive is where the answer will be found to the question of what to do next, what force will shape the step away from the grave. “Some lemon morning in a wash of rain,” Johnston’s poem continues, “a brand-new horror comes to call again/ and write a footnote to expunge the text”. Months later, at the start of fire season in California, the early morning reeks of smoke. Fine white flecks of ash dust the railing and planks of the deck, the plastic swimming pool, the falling-apart wooden chairs in the yard. It’s just past dawn, so early I could almost try to convince myself that this is all a dream, a memory of Sydney. But the ash is different: fire-bleached and powder-fine, offering no after-image of whatever it was that burned. Fires surround us, yet more unprecedented fires. A wall of pale grey obstructs our view of San Francisco, across the water; the next day it is impossible to see farther than a few blocks in any direction through the haze and dirty yellowish light. We were here for the fires that shut down the Bay in 2018, and it is like that, but now we are in Covid-land, on day one hundred and forty-something of the official shelter-in-place order, and the libraries and indoor play gyms I visited back then with the bouncing small child are all closed. We unbox the air filter. The feeling of concrete settles in my lungs. I can’t tell any more if it is panic or ash sediment. I think of the electric tension between Emma’s message of doom and her father’s unstoppable determination, the craggy tree that faces down the black flowers. I want to know: what will take root on this scorched Earth? • This essay will be part of the anthology Fire, Flood and Plague, edited by Sophie Cunningham and published by Penguin Random House in December"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2019/aug/13/revealed-suicide-alarm-hinkley-point-c-construction-site","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2019-08-13T15:31:56Z","webTitle":"Revealed: mental health crisis at Hinkley Point C construction site","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/aug/13/revealed-suicide-alarm-hinkley-point-c-construction-site","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2019/aug/13/revealed-suicide-alarm-hinkley-point-c-construction-site","fields":{"headline":"Revealed: mental health crisis at Hinkley Point C construction site","bodyText":"Hinkley Point nuclear power station, Britain’s biggest construction project since the second world war, is grappling with a mental illness crisis, with several attempted suicides since work began in 2016, a Guardian investigation can reveal. More than 4,000 workers are on site delivering the vast decade-long building project, a central plank in Britain’s future energy strategy. But according to union officials, there has been a surge in suicide attempts this year, a rise in the number of people off sick with stress, anxiety and depression, and an increase in workers suffering from mental distress. Officials from the Unite union say they have been told of 10 suicide attempts in the first four months of 2019. The Guardian understands at least two workers connected to the project have taken their lives since construction started in earnest in 2016. “We were in utter shock when they told us the statistics around suicides and mental health,” said Malcolm Davies, a convenor at the Unite union at Hinkley Point C. “The scale of the mental health issues at Hinkley is something I have never seen before.” “We are in a phase now with mental health where we were with safety 50 years ago,” said Davies, a construction veteran who is a champion of mental health first aid at the site. “The same number of people are going off, only now they are not going off with injuries. They are going off with stress.” The main causes of the distress appear to be loneliness, relationship breakdown and the struggle of being sometimes hundreds of miles away from family. Électricité de France (EDF), which is in charge of building Britain’s first new nuclear power plant for more than 20 years, disputes the figures, acknowledging two suicides – one of those a former worker who had left the project. Executives say that a number of workers have said they are suicidal, but point to a wide range of measures to address the problem, including 200 mental health “buddies”, “time to talk” rooms, an on-site GP, and plans to recruit a chaplain. “I’m aware of people who have said they have felt like committing suicide,” said Angie Young, the site health and wellbeing manager. She said the figure of 10 was a “total exaggeration”. “We do have people say life is not worth living but we’re getting in there and helping.” The construction industry has long been blighted by poor mental health. Suicide rates are more than three times the national average for men. Contributing factors in an overwhelmingly male environment (more than 85% of construction workers are male) are bullying, homesickness, job insecurity, financial pressures and isolation, which are sometimes compounded by drink, drugs and gambling. The industry is atomised moreover into tiers of subcontractors scrambling to make tight margins. So even if a principal contractor has noble ambitions about protecting workers, that does not always ripple down the supply chain. At Hinkley, workers live on special campuses in nearby Bridgwater, or else in converted digs in the town. They work a variety of shift patterns and are shuttled to and from the site on scores of buses. Some contractors work as much as 11 days on with three days off, including an extra weekend day for travelling home. But the Guardian understands that most people can cope with the stress and pressure of the work. The problems start once they clock off. “We have the normal breakdown in relationships, men crying because their wives won’t take them back, things like that, but people are away from their family and friends and might not be able to cope as well as they would at home where they could have a beer with a friend and talk,” said one Hinkley Point worker. Socially there are reports of increases in drinking, gambling and prostitution in Bridgwater, which has been upended by the huge construction site on its doorstep. One source in a local betting shop told of some workers spending up to £3,000 a week and others “self-excluding” from the premises to stop developing a financially detrimental habit. Such is the concern among EDF management that, together with Unite, they have stepped up efforts to tackle the crisis, including bringing in the former boxer Frank Bruno to talk to contractors about his mental health condition. Bruno, who has spoken about being sectioned after a mental health crisis, hosted three sessions with more than 200 attending each. “People were talking about it for a while after. It energised people because they thought if someone like Frank Bruno can have mental problems, anyone can,” said Jonathan Davies, another union official. EDF is also implementing an impressive mental health programme on the site, with posters urging troubled contractors to open up and one in 20 workers now trained as a mental health first aider, or “buddy” as they are known. “We are seeing 12 people a month, mostly about relationships, some of them about gambling and being unable to cope with being away from family for a long time,” said Malcolm Davies, who has led the talks to get mental health top of the agenda with management. “Construction is a very macho industry. We have the highest amount of mental health issues of any sector. People can be very upset over something but they won’t tell you.” “Men are doing very physical work, with manual handling of heavy objects every day and if you’re the big bloke and you say you can’t cope or you are seen crying you get ridiculed,” he added. His ambition is to make Hinkley the pathfinder for new work practices in the construction industry nationwide. “You can’t fault EDF/NNB [Nuclear New Build, an EDF subsidiary]. They are taking it very seriously. We are in a place right now with mental health in construction where we were 50 years ago with physical health,” he said. The Unite assistant general secretary, Gail Cartmail, said: “The loss of life and the number of attempted suicides is highly disturbing. Every one of these deaths and attempted suicides is a terrible tragedy. “Hours are often long and workers often don’t have a healthy diet. The short-term nature of employment and the constant changing of employers is a factor in the suicide rate, as is the industry’s macho culture which means workers are unwilling or unable to discuss their feelings.” But she added that Unite had been involved in a wide range of initiatives to tackle mental health issues. “Unite has eight mental health first aiders who are clearly visible in the workplace and who have monthly meetings with EDF to discuss new initiatives. “EDF at Hinkley also provides a fully staffed medical centre with staff trained in mental health issues.” • In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.
