But nobody predicted that Germany's gross domestic product (GDP) would fall by 3.8% in a quarter, which marks not only the biggest decline since comparable records began in 1970, but year on year amounts to an even steeper drop of 6.7%. It is the worst result of any eurozone country, as summed up in another headline: \"Once the motor of Europe's economy, Germany is now its brake block.\" Today's news has left a Germany that was already feeling vulnerable even more exposed, with experts predicting an 6% slump for the whole year. This year should have been a year of celebrations: the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, the 60th anniversary of the founding of modern Germany. Instead, the country is stuck in its worst recession since the war. A pattern across almost all industries – from car manufacturers to metal production, the hospitality industry and producers of solar energy products – has seen factories cutting back on production and workers forced to reduce their hours. Companies have been cutting back on investment, reducing prices and ignoring an almost hallowed obligation in Germany by refusing to take on apprentices. The backbone of German manufacturing, the car industry, has cut production by about a third, with Mercedes experiencing a drop in sales of 25% and Porsche of 19%. As yet – unlike in Britain and the US – the recession has barely made itself felt on the high street. Credit in Germany is viewed by many ordinary people as something of a dirty word and many rent so the property market does not dominate the economy. In fact, a slight rise in private and state consumption over the past few months has ensured the GDP drop was not bigger. That, experts say, has to do with wage rises in recent years and the re-introduction of the Pendler Pauschal – a tax rebate for commuters. The impact of the rise in unemployment has also been softened by an increase in part-time jobs and the introduction of the Abwrackprämie – or old banger bonus. Under the scheme, consumers can trade in their old cars and receive a payment towards a new model. Though the Abwrackprämie has helped boost domestic demand for cars by about 19% and provided something of a feel-good factor, experts say it will bring little more than a short-term boost. The country, they say, is facing an even bigger shock next year. \"After the export recession there will be a recession in the domestic economy,\" said Johannes Müller, an analyst with the asset-management company DWS. The drop in exports will have an impact on unemployment, which is expected to rise from the current 3.6 million to beyond 4 million. Already the numbers of Germans out of work, along with the tax shortfalls and two stimulus packages worth €80bn (£71bn), have helped blow a €316bn hole in the budget for the next four years and led to heated debates five months before a general election about whether Germany's social market economy model – which seeks a balance between private enterprise and state intervention – has failed. Müller told Die Welt there was an illusion that things will go back to how they were before the crisis, when Germany in effect benefited from excessive US consumption. \"Even if those in politics and the economy currently peddle the philosophy that this is a temporary shock and will be followed by a return to normality, I fear it will not be as easy as that.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/blog/2009/jul/10/tesla-electricity-inventor-birthday-anniversary","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2009-07-10T11:09:57Z","webTitle":"Happy birthday, Nikola Tesla: thanks for the electricity","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2009/jul/10/tesla-electricity-inventor-birthday-anniversary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/blog/2009/jul/10/tesla-electricity-inventor-birthday-anniversary","fields":{"headline":"Happy birthday, Nikola Tesla: thanks for the electricity","bodyText":"Happy birthday, Nikola Tesla - although you aren't alive today, having died in poverty on 7 January 1943 (having been born on 10 July 1856). Perhaps you're spinning in your grave - which might be possible if some of the inventions inspired by your work on electromagnetism and forces are being used. Many children are familiar with the Tesla coil - used at science demonstrations and lectures to demonstrate what happens when you discharge a high voltage (but low current: it's current that kills, not voltage) over a small space. Films of Frankenstein often show, somewhat anachronistically, Tesla coils discharging lightning-like bolts like billy-o. Tesla, an ethnic Serb from Smiljan, then part of the Austro-Hungarian empire, started out his engineering life working for a telephone company in Budapest in 1881, aged 24. He'd already studied physics and maths; While there - while walking in a park, in fact - he had an inspiration and solved the equations relating to a revolving magnetic field. Which he then drew in the ground with a stick and explained to a friend. Quite a patient friend, one suspects. Not much to you, perhaps, but those equations govern the induction motor, which is now the most common form of electric motor: put three coils around an outside former, and put a rotating element inside. If you run a current through the outside coils, and get the timing just right, then you create a current (and hence magnetic force) in the coils in the inside. So the inside rotor turns, but it doesn't have to touch the outer part: less friction means less energy used. (Compare that method to the carbon brushes needed in standard DC motors, which wear away where they touch the inner rotor.) But it's in the development of mains electricity - the underpinning of our modern age - that Tesla really rules. When Americans tell the story of Thomas Edison, the famous inventor of the gramophone, and whose name is usually attached to the invention of the light bulb, Tesla's name is frequently left out. However Tesla, who became an American citizen in 1891, worked with Edison for years, improving many of the early inventions and turning them into something workable. (The two were introduced in 1884, when Tesla came to the US, by a letter from a mutual friend to Edison which read \"I know of two great men. One is you and the other is this young man.\") Yet it's thanks to Tesla, not Edison, that we have electricity coming out of plugs, and that we even have power stations able to generate serious amounts of energy. He won \"the war of the currents\" with Edison, who was convinced that direct current (DC) - the sort that comes out of an ordinary battery - was the way forward for power generation and distribution. Tesla was able to show that alternating current (AC) - which swaps its polarity at a regular rate, 50 times a second in UK mains electricity - was far more efficient (you don't lose anything like as much energy in transmitting it over long distances). Even though Edison took to electrocuting dogs in public displays to show just how dangerous AC was (no, really), Tesla won the day. Where DC could only be transmitted for a couple of miles before the resistance of the lines reduced it to nothing, AC can be transmitted at high voltages for many times that distance. (A side note: did you know that the distribution equipment - transformers, transmission lines - is 80% of the cost of running an electricity company? The power generation is only 20%. Which is why even if we had free electricity generation - say from nuclear fusion - the upkeep of the distribution network would still mean you'd get a bill every quarter. Quite probably it would still be for the house next door which isn't on the same provider, too.) And to quote his biography, Among his discoveries are the fluorescent light , laser beam, wireless communications, wireless transmission of electrical energy, remote control, robotics, Tesla's turbines and vertical take off aircraft. Tesla is the father of the radio and the modern electrical transmissions systems. He registered over 700 patents worldwide. His vision included exploration of solar energy and the power of the sea. He foresaw interplanetary communications and satellites. Then again, he also had ideas for the \"death ray\" - what we might now recognise as a directed energy weapon - and an ion-propelled aircraft (which was proven to be feasible). However his life ended sadly: he spent the last ten years of his life in the two-room suite 3327 of the New Yorker Hotel, having sold his patents and racked up substantial debts. After his death, the New York Supreme court ruled that he - rather than Marconi - invented the radio. Even Google has noticed - given that New York State some time ago proclaimed today as Tesla's birthday, and that the corner of 40th Street and 6th Avenue in Manhattan has a street sign saying \"Nikola Tesla corner\". If they were sensible, it would be a rotating sign, But you can't have everything."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"globalcleantech100/trailblazers-innovation","type":"article","sectionId":"globalcleantech100","sectionName":"Global Cleantech 100","webPublicationDate":"2009-09-08T23:01:00Z","webTitle":"Trailblazers in innovation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/globalcleantech100/trailblazers-innovation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/globalcleantech100/trailblazers-innovation","fields":{"headline":"Trailblazers in innovation","bodyText":"The industrial revolution began in the UK and the country has been justly proud of its inventive skills ever since. Now it is the turn of the green revolution and the British are again helping to change the way the world makes its manufactured goods and generates and uses electricity so we can all have a better, safer place for civilisation to thrive. While the US dominates the Global Cleantech 100 with 55 entries, the UK is second with 13 entries and Germany comes third with 10 entries. On this page we reflect the strengths of these three countries with a selection of companies from each. All have different ideas and products designed to transform our lives. Solar is the top technology on the following pages but the UK's contribution varies from intelligent chip technology engineered to improve energy efficiency to wave and tidal energy generation. US One of the world's leading suppliers of high-power lithium-ion batteries, A123 specialises in transport, electric grid and portable power manufacturing. It is working with Chrysler, for instance, on battery modules and battery packs for Chrysler's range-extended electric vehicle and battery-only electric vehicle production programmes. In China, it is providing the batteries to power a new hybrid car in Shanghai, the SAIC Hybrid electric vehicle due out next year. Bridgelux believes it is the first, new US-based LED (light-emitting diode) manufacturer of the past 20 years. It helps customers switch from traditional, less efficient lighting systems (such as incandescent, halogen and fluorescent lighting) to solid-state lighting solutions that are less wasteful because they generate less heat as a by-product. It provides higher performance and energy-efficient white light for indoor and exterior application areas. With its latest innovations, Bridgelux LED Arrays, the company believes it will drive down the high costs that have held back the spread of solid-state lighting. As well as addressing cost issues, the Array products are designed to optimise the quantity of light, energy efficiency, colour rendering and beam uniformity. BrightSource builds and runs solar energy plants around the world, aiming to provide reliable and low-cost energy for both industrial and utility use. Its tested and proven LPT 550 energy system uses thousands of small mirrors to reflect sunlight on to a boiler on the top of a tower to produce high-temperature steam. The steam is then piped to a conventional turbine, which generates electricity. To conserve water, the steam is air-cooled and piped back into the system. The company is running a demonstration tower scheme in the Negev Desert in Israel. The Tesla Roadster proves that electric cars have a future beyond short shopping trips or commuting. Weight is the enemy of efficiency in all cars, and especially those powered by electric but, thanks to its lightweight sportscar body, and the latest lithium-ion batteries, the Tesla Roadster accelerates to 60mph in 3.9 seconds, generates a third of the CO2 of hybrid cars, and has an impressive range of 240 miles at a cost of £3. The next challenge: a seven-seater saloon model launching in 2011. With sales of more than 1m two-way, intelligent communication devices for smart grid management for water, gas and electricity, Trilliant can claim to be one of the biggest players in a fast-emerging market. The company, established in 2004, supplies advanced metering products that let utilities deliver higher levels of customer service and information, reduce operational costs, and provide innovative new programs, thus allowing consumers to change their consumption behaviour to take advantage of lower market prices. UK New technologies such as Acal Energy's low-cost proton exchange membrane fuel cell systems are gradually replacing traditional combustion engines. The Runcorn-based company believes it is now the world leader in this market. It promises substantial cost savings and performance improvements to clients through this clean, quiet and efficient technology which was also a crucial feature of the Gemini space missions, the first manned US flights outside the earth's atmosphere. Acal's systems are powered by its proprietary platinum-free cathode technology (FlowCath). Other projects include modules and consumable chemicals for a range of uses, including stationary, residential and automotive applications requiring more than 1kw of power. CamSemi is a leader in intelligent power-management integrated circuits, helping the consumer electronics sector develop much more energy-efficient power supplies, lighting and other power conversion products at low cost. Products based around CamSemi chips have simple circuitry, offer high performance and exceed the demands of Energy Star, the European code of conduct and other energy-efficiency regulations. The company's C2160 products - launched this July - are designed to allow mobile phone and other manufacturers to introduce highly energy-efficient chargers - quickly and at low cost. CamSemi also has centres in Tapei, Taiwan and Shenzhen, China. How clever is your fridge? The problem with renewable energy, such as wind or solar power, is that it's difficult to plan supply and, if the sun stops shining or wind drops at times of high network usage, you'd have a melted ice cream problem. Among RLtec's smart grid solutions is Dynamic Demand, a system which allows appliances to monitor their own usage and work out if they can move to lower power states for a time to limit their demand. It displaces high-carbon emitting generation with lower-carbon alternatives as much as possible and helps to facilitate the integration of renewable energy into the grid. Germany Making solar cells that are lightweight, cost-effective and efficient yet able to be integrated into the aesthetics of buildings will result in a major growth of the sector. Odersun has proved that it can be done: it has already supplied \"sun roofs\" for buildings at Beijing's Olympic Park. It does this using thin-film solar modules in a glass-foil laminate, and an innovative copper tape wiring system, which allows a significantly higher amount of modules to be interconnected in one string. Although it produces less energy that standard solar cells, its unique ability to be integrated en masse into the fabric of the building is a huge asset. Silicon carbide and glycol are key materials in the process of making silicon wafers for solar panels but much is lost in the manufacturing process. Sic Processing's technologically advanced hydrocyclone recycling system can recover significant amounts of both materials from the slurry arising from silicon wafer production panels - this can then be reused by the manufacturer. As a result, the cost of this vital energy-harnessing product can be significantly reduced."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"environment/2009/apr/27/amazon-tribes-illegal-loggers","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-04-26T23:05:11Z","webTitle":"Contact with Amazon tribes inevitable, says Brazilian protection agency","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/apr/27/amazon-tribes-illegal-loggers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/apr/27/amazon-tribes-illegal-loggers","fields":{"headline":"Contact with Amazon tribes inevitable, says Brazilian protection agency","bodyText":"The last isolated indigenous tribes, located deep in the Amazon rainforest, may need to be contacted for the first time to protect them from illegal loggers, according to Brazil's agency, Fundação Nacional do Indio (Funai). The Funai official José Carlos Meirelles, who has been monitoring the groups along the border between Brazil and Peru for over 20 years, told the Guardian that he believes their survival is increasingly at risk. The decision to make contact with the tribes is not one to be taken lightly. The last time isolated groups were contacted in the Amazon was in 1996, but the Korubo in the Javari valley have since suffered epidemics of malaria and hepatitis, resulting in many deaths. Establishing contact, however, could be the only deterrent from the looming danger of loggers. If friendly contact were established, Funai would build a post inside their area to deter the loggers and offer healthcare, vaccinating tribe members against the many diseases that contact with the outside world inevitably brings. The risk comes not only from the loggers, but gold prospectors and coca planters who have also invaded the region, bringing disease and violence. Meirelles wants to see an international boycott of mahogany products: \"Americans should know that with each mahogany coffin they use to bury a dead person, they are also burying two indians,\" he warned. He said 80% of the world's mahogany comes from the region where the isolated indians live, logged illegally, but sold to consumers in Europe, Asia and the USA through legal companies. Meirelles, 60, spends most of his time almost as isolated as the tribes, living at a base deep in the forest, powered by solar energy, linked to Funai HQ in Brasilia by radio. He has acquired an intimate knowledge of the territory, trekking through the forest and travelling the rivers and inlets to record signs of their presence and map out the area they inhabit. This area is now officially recognised by the Brazilian government and designated as an indigenous area. Over the years he has caught many glimpses of the tribes. At first, he says, they were hostile, but now they seem to realise that he does not wish them harm, but they never go near him: \"They don't want contact.\" Meirelles said he has suffered over 30 bouts of malaria in the forest and last year survived a deep arrow wound when a tribesperson shot him, apparently mistaking him for a logger. Another threat to survival is the increasing presence of international oil companies like Anglo-French Perenco, Canada's Petrolifera and Brazil's Petrobras, eager to drill in a huge oilfield located in the Peruvian Amazon. The Peruvian government at first denied there were any uncontacted tribes in the area, but has now admitted their existence. Indigenous groups have already begun fleeing across the border, invading areas of isolated tribes on the Brazilian side, leading to conflicts and deaths. \"If this situation continues, contact will become inevitable, and it is better that it happens with us than with loggers or goldpanners,\" says Meirelles. Before any contact is made, Funai is organising meetings with anthropologists, NGOs, and especially with the accultured tribes living in the same Amazon area, to build up a consensus about how and what should be done. Meirelles estimates that there are approximately 600 indigenous people on the Brazilian side, divided among four groups, and an unknown number on the Peruvian side. Some groups are nomadic, hunting, fishing and collecting fruits and nuts from the forest. Others are sedentary, growing crops and living in settlements of straw-roofed huts, like the ones who were filmed last year firing arrows at a Funai helicopter which overflew their area. The Brazilian indigenous population is at least 500,000. Most are in the Amazon, speaking over 180 languages and dialects, at different stages of acculturation, but until contact is made, nobody knows the origin of these particular isolated groups."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2008/dec/01/live-earth-india-cancelled","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2008-12-01T13:01:20Z","webTitle":"Live Aid India cancelled after Mumbai attacks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/dec/01/live-earth-india-cancelled","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2008/dec/01/live-earth-india-cancelled","fields":{"headline":"Live Earth India cancelled after Mumbai attacks","bodyText":"The organisers of Live Earth India have cancelled the concert because of security fears after last week's attacks in Mumbai. Gunmen opened fire at hotels, a railway station and other sites across the city, killing more than 170 people. Although the authorities have brought the situation under control, Bon Jovi and other acts were quick to cancel travel plans - prompting organisers to call off the sold-out charity gig. Bollywood stars such as Aishwarya Rai and Hrithik Roshan had been scheduled to perform alongside western artists Will.I.Am and Roger Waters at the Andheri sports complex on December 7. The concert was designed to highlight environmental concerns and India's Light a Billion Lives solar energy programme. Organisers of Live Earth India said in a statement that they were \"shocked and saddened\" by the attacks. \"We always felt very welcomed and safe as we spent more time on the ground in Mumbai to finalise plans,\" they wrote. British artist Amar Dhanjan, who was booked to perform, agreed with the decision to cancel. \"It's just not important compared to what's happening there right now,\" she told BBC 6 Music.

The plan from industry body the GSM Association (GSMA) is just one of a raft of \"green\" announcements at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. Not only will it mean phone users no longer have to hunt for the right charger, but the specifications for the new device include a 50% reduction in standby energy consumption. All five of the UK's mobile phone companies have signed up to the universal charger, as have the major handset manufacturers, and phones which can use the new charger - which relies upon the micro-USB connection found in the new BlackBerry Storm - will start appearing later in the year. By 2012, the GSMA has pledged that the majority of phones shipped around the world will use the universal charger. The mobile phone industry has been attacked by environmental campaigners in the past for being one of the least green areas of technology, but mobile phones made from recycled materials or sporting solar panels have been one of the most interesting features in Barcelona so far. Samsung unveiled the Blue Earth touchscreen phone which has a solar panel on the back that can charge the phone. Available in the UK in the second half of the year, the handset is made from recycled plastic from water bottles and is also free from harmful substances such as brominated flame retardants, beryllium and phthalate. It also includes an in-built pedometer which tells the user how much CO2 they have saved by walking instead of using motorised transport. Samsung's SGH-F268 handset was last year named as the industry's greenest in a survey by Greenpeace. A range of solar-powered phones are also being created by Dutch company Intivation, in a joint venture with ZTE, China's largest mobile phone manufacturer, and mobile phone network Digicel, which has operations in such remote places as the South Pacific islands. And Sweden's Flexenclosure has showcased the latest in wind-powered mobile phone masts. LG pledged yesterday that it would remove brominated flame retardants, chlorinated flame retardants and polyvinyl chloride from the manufacturing process by next year. It also pledged to use green packaging across its entire line of 2009 mobile handset models. The company has used the trade fair to unveil a handset equipped with a solar panel battery cover as part of what it termed an \"aggressive green initiative\". \"Using renewable solar energy in a mobile handset is an example of our ongoing efforts to help create a safer, cleaner environment for our customers,\" said LG's chief executive, Skott Ahn. Exposing the phone to the sun for 10 minutes gives it enough power for a three-minute call. Left in natural light for long periods, the solar panel generates enough standby power to enable the phone to be used without any further charging."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/cif-green/2009/sep/06/carbon-footprint-aga-energy-saving","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2009-09-06T20:00:00Z","webTitle":"My battle to cut carbon: a baffling, frustrating path to a more honest life | Madeleine Bunting","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cif-green/2009/sep/06/carbon-footprint-aga-energy-saving","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/cif-green/2009/sep/06/carbon-footprint-aga-energy-saving","fields":{"headline":"My battle to cut carbon: a baffling, frustrating path to a more honest life","bodyText":"The thinker Amitai Etzioni comes up with a useful concept in the current edition of Prospect magazine when he talks of \"moral megalogues\" – mass dialogues over right and wrong. They \"involve millions of members of a society exchanging views with one another at workplaces, during family gatherings, in the media and at public events. They are often contentious and passionate and, while they have no clear beginning or end, over time they lead to changes in culture and people's behaviour\". The great megalogue of our age is over the environment, and it's been given a big boost by the debate over the 10:10 campaign (the pledge to cut your personal emissions by 10% in the next year), which the Guardian is backing. Over the last few days this commitment has been criticised as smug moralism, pointless and a middle-class luxury. The criticisms smack of self-justifying apathy – and having spent some time exercising these arguments in my head, I reckon they are all misplaced. It started a few months ago when this megalogue finally prodded me into belated action. This is not an edifying tale and brings me no credit, but it is probably not that unusual. In as much as I thought about the issue I presumed our family was vaguely environmental; we had had one holiday with flights in the last five years, we cycled and walked, we recycled, we composted, we didn't turn up the thermostat. Pale green, I guessed, except for one awful indulgence. It's the beast that made me fall in love with a draughty old house in Hackney, it's the beast that probably gets more caresses from me in winter than all my family put together … an Aga. George Monbiot probably won't speak to me ever again. But in June I braced myself. The Aga has prompted the same response from every energy expert and plumber who came to the house: a sharp intake of breath. It crashes all their carbon calculation software programs – the only guidance I can get is from Wikipedia, which maintains that an average gas cooker uses just 2.6% of the gas of a modest-sized Aga annually. Ouch. At least deciding to abandon the Aga was blindingly obvious. But from then on, I've been introduced to a world of baffling complexity. This is not 10:10 territory – we'd done our first easy 10% a while back – but probably 40:12 (the figures get mighty confusing). Imagine someone who has never heard of money and how it works – interest rates, pensions, mortgages and insurance – and you get a sense of how useless consumers like me (we never read small print, never remember to shop around for utilities) stumble over kilowatt per hour. So it irritates that almost all energy-saving initiatives promise it's easy. It's not. Take something basic like loft insulation. I saw the ads promising government grants, and thought here's a quick, easy win that pays its way. But the insulation expert took one look at my attic stuffed with boxes and grimaced; to increase insulation to the requisite 270mm and install loft boarding (so you can still use it for storage) is likely to require attic re-engineering. The truth is that reducing household carbon (by far my biggest source of carbon) is complicated and confusing. Even trying to establish your carbon footprint produces wildly varying estimates (our house produces either 12 or 22 tonnes of carbon a year, depending on the modelling used). There is now no shortage of information around – we got help from the Energy Saving Trust and the London-based Green Homes – but, like pensions, who knows best? Nor is it cheap. This is the horrifying bit. Our small budget was pathetically inadequate. Boiler upgrades, double glazing, solid wall insulation: these are expensive investments which may reduce energy bills but won't pay for themselves for decades. But the bottom line is that more affluent households have a far bigger carbon footprint and at least some resources to cut it, so they should get on with it. Finally, you bump into the frustration. Nine million homes in England and Wales have the potential for microgeneration (nearly half) and could generate 30% to 40% of household electricity. Germany cottoned on to this over a decade ago and introduced a feed-in tariff (paying people for the electricity they generate) in 2000 which has doubled the proportion of renewable energy and encouraged the growth of the biggest solar energy industry in the world. But in the UK, solar panels are a luxury for the middle classes, and even after the introduction of a feed-in tariff next year, will remain so. (There is also the dismal prospect that those without microgeneration will be subsidising those who do through rising electricity bills.) It seems baffling that government encouragement is so slow and inadequate. This may sound suspiciously like a moan but it's rather a plea for more honesty, more government commitment. Tell it like it is. Carbon cutting is not a one-off, it is a process we will spend the rest of our lives on – as will our children. There is going to be a sharp learning curve as the ignorance which saw us cheerfully spew carbon is shifted. In time, we will be as aware of our carbon output as we are currently of our bank balance or mortgage payments. The funny thing is that this learning curve generates unexpected consequences. It becomes energising along the lines of \"if I can do X then perhaps I could do Y\". It generates a renewed sense of agency, even a measure of hopefulness. And you begin to appreciate how we have been trapped in a debilitating apathy intimidated by the scale of the problem. Our lives are built on a web of denial about the impact our behaviours have on our environment. When you start to dismantle this, you are stumbling towards authenticity: a reconnection with the basic resources, such as fossil fuels and water, on which our wellbeing depends. Try it and see. That's why the language of \"personal sacrifice\" is so wide of the mark. Carbon cutting is about a more honest life, lived not on the wild, implausible delusions promoted by a consumer culture but about recognising the crucial truth about the constraints of the planet and how we need to live within them. As for smug, no aspect of our predicament affords anyone such satisfaction. So the myriad of tiny daily routines which need to change – such as turning taps off while you brush your teeth – are not pointless but about reconnection and awareness of what sustains your life. It is about living intelligently; AS Byatt quotes a Swedish entomologist in The Biographer's Tale who argues that \"we are an animal that needs to use its intelligence to mitigate the effects of its intelligence\". So to return to Etzioni's concept, I would argue that this megalogue is not about morality so much as looking for a life which is more honest and intelligent rather than one resting on a shaky edifice of dangerous illusions. I started out in hair-shirt mode, got buried in some of the finer details of loft insulation and emerged pondering what a (more) honest life might look like. It's been a very disconcerting experience. What's at stake in 10:10 and carbon cutting is not a harsh new morality to preach about and use to pass judgment on, but a proposition of how to live which is compelling. • You can sign up to 10:10 at www.1010uk.org"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2008/jul/09/solarpower.renewableenergy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2008-07-08T23:01:00Z","webTitle":"GM installs world's biggest rooftop solar panels","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/jul/09/solarpower.renewableenergy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2008/jul/09/solarpower.renewableenergy","fields":{"headline":"GM installs world's biggest rooftop solar panels","bodyText":"The largest rooftop solar power station in the world is being built in Spain. With a capacity of 12 megawatts of power, the station is made up of 85,000 lightweight panels covering an area of two million square feet. Manufactured in rolls, rather like carpet, the photovoltaic panels are to be installed on the roof of a General Motors car factory in Zaragoza, eastern Spain. General Motors, which plans to install solar panels at another 11 plants across Europe, unveiled the €50m (£39.73m) project yesterday. The power station should be producing energy by September. The panels will produce an expected annual output of 15.1m kilowatt hours (kWh) - enough to meet the needs of 4,600 households with an average consumption of 3,300kWh, or power a third of the GM factory. The solar energy produced should cut CO2 emissions by 6,700 tonnes a year. Energy Conversion Devices, the US company producing the panels, said it would be the largest rooftop solar array in the world. Energy Conversion will supply the equipment to two other companies, Veolia Environment and Clairvoyant Energy, which will lease the rooftop space from General Motors and operate the installation. The rooftop power station is also supported by the regional Aragón government. Carl-Peter Forster, GM European president, said: \"GM's Zaragoza plant will become home of the biggest rooftop solar power station worldwide. This has significant potential to reduce costs at the plant.\" Solar panels on houses usually produce a few kilowatts of power. On large commercial buildings, installations of one or two megawatts are now common. A one-megawatt installation could run about 1,000 air-conditioners while the sun is shining. The Solar Energy Industries Association, a trade group based in Washington, said the largest installation planned in the US was in Atlantic City, where a convention centre will produce 2.36mW of power. Another US solar panels company, Southern California Edison, is to install 250mW of rooftop solar arrays spread over 100 or more roofs. Blessed with almost year-round sunshine, Spain's socialist government is trying to capitalise on this natural resource. In an effort to encourage private individuals and companies to install solar power, Spain introduced subsidies of €0.42 per kilowatt per hour. But the Spanish government is considering reducing this subsidy in September, a move which is likely to face opposition from within the solar energy industry."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2009/apr/10/japan-recession-stimulus-green-economy","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2009-04-09T23:01:00Z","webTitle":"Japan goes green with £100bn economic recovery","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/apr/10/japan-recession-stimulus-green-economy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2009/apr/10/japan-recession-stimulus-green-economy","fields":{"headline":"Japan goes green with £100bn economic recovery","bodyText":"Japan today announced a ¥15tn (£102bn) stimulus package that focuses on boosting the green economy in an attempt to drag the country out of its worst recession since the second world war. The total is a substantial increase from the £68bn package announced by the prime minister, Taro Aso, on Monday, and is likely to top ¥56tn when other measures such as tax cuts and credit guarantees are included. Announcing the stimulus plan in a televised speech, Aso said: \"Japan's economy is worsening rapidly with exports and production tumbling. Job conditions are also deteriorating sharply. Japan's economy can be described as being in a crisis.\" In addition to pledging more loans for hard-pressed small businesses and cash for job creation, it will also encourage the start of mass production of electric cars in three years and boost solar power generation to 20 times the current level of 1.42m kilowatts. \"I want to show that Japan's future is not all that dark if we follow this vision,\" Aso said. \"If you just read the newspapers, it seems like tomorrow will be completely gloomy. But this is not the case. There is some light.\" The stimulus package also includes a car scrappage scheme similar to the \"cash for clunkers\" programme being debated in the US Congress. Motorists will be eligible for between ¥100,000 and ¥250,000 in subsidies if they trade in cars that are more than 13 years old for a hybrid or other environment-friendly vehicle. Though details have yet to be released, the measures could result in new car sales of between 450,000 to 1.51m, according to the Dai-ichi Life Research Institute. Together with the introduction of lower taxes on clean-energy cars, consumers replacing an old vehicle for, say, a new Toyota Prius hybrid could make savings of about US$4,000. The news prompted a stockmarket rally and sent the Nikkei index in Tokyo soaring by 3.7% to 8916.06. Shares in Toyota, maker of the Prius hybrid, rose 4.3%, while those of Sharp, the world's second-largest maker of solar cells, surged 10.7%. However, analysts said that if the latest stimulus works, the resulting boost in demand for carbon-fuelled electricity could negate any advances made by the wider use of green cars. The country is only just beginning to address its poor track record on green spending. While industry, the biggest polluter, has been left to aim for voluntary targets, the onus is now on individual householders and businesses to spearhead Japan's version of the Green New Deal. Until now Japan has set aside only 2.6% of total spending for climate change measures, compared with 12% in the US and 34% in China, an HSBC report said. Some analysts doubted that the envisaged shift to fuel-efficient cars would have much of an impact on Japan's attempts to meet its Kyoto protocol targets. The country's greenhouse gas emissions rose 2.3% last year, putting them at 16% above the target it has committed itself to achieving by 2013. \"I don't think the stimulus will make any notable contribution to Japan's emission cuts,\" said Itsuho Haruta of Natsource Japan, adding that the package would make only a tiny contribution to the fall in emissions expected as a result of plunging industrial output. The government also plans to revive the use of solar energy by expanding a scheme in which power companies - traditionally reluctant to boost their use of renewables - will buy more surplus energy generated by households equipped with solar panels. It will also set up solar power generators at 37,000 schools and introduce heat-insulating materials and other energy-saving measures in 3m buildings over the next three years. The measures - which are equivalent to 3% of the country's GDP - were approved by the ruling Liberal Democratic party's executive council. The government is expected to approve the proposals today. Officials have not said where they would find the extra money, though Aso recently said he would turn to issuing bonds if needed. Last month, Japan's parliament passed a record ¥88.5tn budget for the new fiscal year, which started on 1 April, including parts of Aso's two previous stimulus packages."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2008/sep/18/cleantech100solarpower.cleantechnology1002","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2008-09-17T23:01:00Z","webTitle":"CleanTech 100: Solar power: Concentrix Solar","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/18/cleantech100solarpower.cleantechnology1002","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2008/sep/18/cleantech100solarpower.cleantechnology1002","fields":{"headline":"Concentrix Solar","bodyText":"Profile With technology developed at the famous Fraunhofer Institute, Concentrix Solar is one of the pioneers in the relatively young concentrator photovoltaic technology (CPV).

The announcement comes only days after scientists issued stark new warnings that rising seas caused by climate change could engulf the Maldives and other low-lying nations this century. The president will formally announce the scheme - and make a plea for other countries to follow the Maldives' lead - this evening, following the world premiere of The Age of Stupid, a major new climate change film in which a man living alone in the devastated world of 2055 looks at old footage from 2008 and asks why people didn't stop climate change when they had the chance. Nasheed approached British climate change experts Chris Goodall and Mark Lynas to help develop the radical carbon-neutrality plan. The pair worked on a package of measures that could virtually eliminate fossil fuel use on the Maldive archipelago by 2020. The plan includes a new renewable electricity generation and transmission infrastructure with 155 large wind turbines, half a square kilometre of rooftop solar panels, and a biomass plant burning coconut husks. Battery banks would provide back-up storage for when neither wind nor solar energy is available. The clean electricity would power not only homes and businesses, but also vehicles. Cars and boats with petrol and diesel engines would be gradually replaced by electric versions. Goodall, author of Ten Technologies to Save the Planet, led the development of the clean-energy package. He said: \"The Maldives could just give up. Its people could declare themselves climate change refugees and ask for sanctuary elsewhere. But the new government is taking a stand and asked us to give them a plan for a near zero-carbon economy. \"We don't want to pretend that this plan is going to be easy to implement. There will be hiccups, and electricity supply will occasionally be disrupted. But we think that building a near-zero-carbon Maldives is a realistic challenge. Get it right and we will show the apathetic developed world that action is possible, and at reasonable cost.\" The Maldives is one of the world's lowest-lying countries, with 385,000 people living mainly on land less than two metres above sea level. The country would be rendered almost entirely uninhabitable by a rise in sea levels of one metre. Lynas said: \"The Maldives is in the front line of climate change. It is perhaps the most vulnerable country in the world. If nothing is done to cut global carbon emissions, the country will sink beneath rising seas this century. It is a poor country, but here we have a government that is throwing down the gauntlet to the rich, highly polluting countries.\" The Maldives plan is not the first national carbon-neutrality target. Norway is aiming to be zero-carbon by 2030. However, the Maldives scheme is more ambitious - not just in terms of its 10-year timetable, but also because it aims to totally decarbonise the local economy. By contrast, the Norwegian scheme allows a large slice of domestic emissions to be offset by investments in forestry schemes overseas. The cost for the package of low-carbon measures is estimated to be about $110m a year for 10 years. The scheme should pay for itself quite quickly, because the Maldives will no longer need to import oil products for electricity generation, transport and other functions. If the oil price were to rise to $100 per barrel, the payback period would be as short as 11 years. At current prices, it would take roughly twice as long to break even. Nasheed said: \"Climate change is a global emergency. The world is in danger of going into cardiac arrest, yet we behave as if we've caught a common cold. Today, the Maldives has announced plans to become the world's most eco-friendly country. I can only hope other nations follow suit.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/cif-green/2009/jul/06/tony-blair-climate-copenhagen","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-07-06T06:00:02Z","webTitle":"L'Aquila summit needs to capitalise on global goodwill on climate change | Tony Blair","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cif-green/2009/jul/06/tony-blair-climate-copenhagen","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/cif-green/2009/jul/06/tony-blair-climate-copenhagen","fields":{"headline":"L'Aquila summit needs to capitalise on global goodwill on climate change","bodyText":"On July 9, the leaders of the world's largest economies will meet in L'Aquila, Italy, at the Major Economies Forum (MEF) on Energy and Climate to discuss progress towards a new global climate agreement. In six months, a deal is supposed to be struck in Copenhagen, so the MEF meeting comes at a vital moment. When many of the same leaders met in April to address the economic crisis, they rightly pledged to do \"whatever is necessary.\" The same spirit needs to animate the L'Aquila meeting. There is enormous goodwill to do so. The new US administration is supporting strong American action. China is setting ambitious targets for reducing energy intensity and making massive investments in renewable energy. India has put forward its own action plan. Europe has set a goal of cutting emissions by 30% below 1990 levels by 2020 if there is an ambitious global agreement. Japan has published its proposals for major carbon reductions. Across the world, commitments are forthcoming. But practical challenges remain. What is being asked is that global emissions be less than half their 1990 levels by 2050, having peaked before 2020. Since emissions from the developing countries are on the whole lower than those of the developed world — and will need to continue to rise in the short-term as they maintain economic growth and address poverty — it has been proposed that developed countries cut emissions by at least 80% relative to 1990 by 2050, with major steps towards this goal over the next decade. Developing countries will also need to play their part, significantly slowing and peaking emissions growth in the coming decades. For the US, such commitments would mean cutting emissions to around one-tenth of today's per capita level, while for China it would mean creating a new low-carbon model of economic development. For all countries, this is a major challenge — a revolution that implies a huge shift in policy. The good news is that if we focus on clear, practical, and achievable goals, major reductions can be made in order to ensure that, whatever the precise interim target, the world will fashion a radical new approach within a manageable timeframe. A new report from the Breaking the Climate Deadlock project, a strategic partnership between my office and The Climate Group, shows how major reductions even by 2020 are achievable if we focus action on certain key technologies, deploy policies that have been proven to work, and invest now in developing those future technologies that will take time to mature. Perhaps the most interesting fact to emerge is that fully 70% of the reductions needed by 2020 can be achieved by investing in three areas: increasing energy efficiency, reducing deforestation, and use of lower-carbon energy sources, including nuclear and renewables. Implementing just seven proven policies – renewable energy standards (eg, feed-in tariffs or renewable portfolio standards); industry efficiency measures; building codes; vehicle efficiency standards; fuel carbon content standards; appliance standards, and policies for reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (Redd) — can deliver these reductions. All seven policies have already been successfully implemented in countries around the world, but they need scaling up. While cap-and-trade systems or other means of pricing carbon emissions can help provide incentives for businesses to invest in low-carbon solutions, in the short term at least, these seven policy measures — and direct action and investment by governments — are needed to achieve the targets. In the longer term, we also need technologies such as carbon capture and storage (CCS), expanded nuclear power, and new generations of solar energy, together with the development of technologies whose potential or even existence is still unknown. The important thing for Copenhagen is that decisions are taken now for investments that will yield benefits later. For example, the overwhelming majority of new power stations in China and India — necessary to drive the industrialisation that will lift hundreds of millions out of poverty — will be coal-fired. That is just a fact. So developing CCS or an alternative that allows coal to become clean energy is essential for meeting the 2050 goal. But we need to invest now, seriously and through global collaboration, so that by 2020 we are in a position to scale up CCS or be ready to deploy other alternatives. Renaissance of nuclear power will require a big expansion of qualified scientists and engineers. Electric vehicles will need large adjustments to infrastructure. Smart grid systems can enable big savings in emissions, but require a plan for putting them into effect. These measures will take time, but require investment now. Meanwhile, in the short term, low energy lighting and efficient industrial motors may sound obvious, but we are nowhere near using them as extensively as we could. So we know what we need to do, and we have tools available to achieve our goals. MEF leaders can therefore have confidence in adopting the interim and long-term targets recommended by the scientific community: keeping warming to below 2C; peaking emissions within the next decade; and at least halving global emissions by 2050 versus 1990. Developed countries will be able to commit to reducing their emissions by 80% versus 1990 by mid-century, as many have already done, and provide the necessary financial and technology support for developing countries' adaptation and mitigation efforts. With that support, developing countries in turn will need to design and implement Low-Carbon Growth Plans that significantly slow and eventually peak their emissions growth. By making these commitments, the MEF leaders, whose countries account for more than three-quarters of global emissions, would lay a firm foundation for success in Copenhagen. Between L'Aquila and Copenhagen, there will undoubtedly be difficult discussions over interim targets for developed countries. While such targets are important, what matters most is agreement on the measures that ultimately will set the world on a new path to a low-carbon future. For years, the emphasis has rightly been on persuading people that there must be sufficient \"will\" to tackle climate change. But leaders, struggling to cope with this challenge even amid economic crisis, need to know that there is also \"a way.\" Only by combining the two will we succeed. Fortunately, such a way — immensely challenging but nonetheless feasible — exists.

According to Britain's climate change secretary, Ed Miliband, who met senior officials in Beijing this week, China is ready to \"do business\" with developed countries to reach an agreement to replace the Kyoto treaty. Miliband said he was encouraged by the change in tone since late last year in the country that emits more greenhouse gases than any other. \"I think they're up for a deal. I get the strong impression that they want an agreement,\" he told the Guardian. \"They see the impact of climate change on China and they know the world is moving towards a low-carbon economy and see the business opportunities that will come with that.\" The shift in the Chinese position significantly improves the chances of an agreement being reached when world leaders meet in Copenhagen in December to negotiate a deal that scientists say is critical if dangerous warming is to be avoided. While Britain and the European Union – which have a large historical responsibility for greenhouse gas emissions – are pushing for ambitious reduction targets at home, no global climate deal will be possible in Copenhagen without the agreement of China and the US, which together are responsible for more than 40% of the world's annual carbon emissions. China's official negotiating position is unchanged, but the government is understood to be preparing a set of targets up to and beyond 2020 to lower the country's \"carbon intensity\". This translates to cutting the emissions needed to produce each unit of economic growth. Miliband said Barack Obama's pledge to reduce US emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 has unblocked the international negotiating process. \"China used to think the developed world is not serious. That's what they were saying [at UN talks] in December,\" he said. \"But now they know the US is on the pitch and ready to engage with them. It has made a real difference to what China is saying.\" His comments echoed the message from Chinese officials. Su Wei, a senior negotiator, told the Guardian last month that the US had made a \"substantive change\" under the Obama administration. \"The message we have got is that the current US administration takes climate change seriously, that it recognises its historical responsibility and that it has the capacity to help developing countries address climate change,\" Su said. But while the tone may have changed, there is still a long way to go before agreement can be reached on specifics. China wants developed nations to commit to more ambitious reduction targets, to share low-carbon technology and to set up a UN fund that would buy related intellectual property rights for use across the world. Beijing's position is complicated by the fact that it already owns a large share of the patents for wind and solar energy in developed nations. Europe and the US accept the Chinese economy should be allowed to grow further, improving the living standards of its millions of poor, before it makes overall emissions reductions. Instead, the western nations are pushing for strong measures to improve efficiency and establish caps for certain industries. One possibility being considered by Chinese officials is to set a carbon intensity goal up to 2040 that would include energy efficiency, renewable energy, transport and afforestation. \"It would be very welcome for China to set a commitment for carbon intensity,\" said Miliband. \"It would send a signal around the world.\" He was visiting Minqin county, a remote area in north-western China threatened by desertification and drought. Along with the melting of the Himalayan glaciers, the spread of deserts and the shortage of water have highlighted the destructive impact of unsustainable development and climate change. \"We're very concerned about climate change,\" said Xu Wenshan, the deputy mayor of Wuwei, at a welcome banquet. \"Living in such an ecologically fragile area, we will feel the impact directly if there is a further rise in the temperature.\" Jim Watson, of the UK's Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, said it had become the mainstream view in China that global warming was caused by human activity, which was not the view five years ago. \"We see significant policy shifts and encouraging developments in technology, for example phenomenal development of wind power and plug-in cars. That could be a sign of things to come,\" he said. \"My impression is that although the negotiators haven't moved ground officially, there are a hell of a lot of new ideas. They are very interested in low-carbon economy.\" Last month, the Tyndale centre published research showing that it was possible for China to begin reducing its total emissions from 2020. Government officials say that is unrealistic and China has so far resisted announcing a target for when emissions might peak. But the authorities tend towards the later end of the various academic forecasts of between 2020 and 2040. Watson noted that if emissions are measured on a historical per-capita basis, China is 78th in the world rather than first."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2009/may/25/africa-entrepreneurs-charity","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2009-05-25T15:31:27Z","webTitle":"Is trade, not aid, the answer for Africa?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/may/25/africa-entrepreneurs-charity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2009/may/25/africa-entrepreneurs-charity","fields":{"headline":"Is trade, not aid, the answer for Africa?","bodyText":"After years when billions have been spent on aid projects in Africa, donors are now picking up on a new trend to put money on the continent's entrepreneurs. Next month, a meeting of the World Economic Forum on Africa in Cape Town is set to reinforce the message that \"trade not aid'' represents salvation for a continent whose average 5% growth in the past five years is projected to fall to 1.5% this year amid the global economic downturn. Now entrepreneurship is being presented as a panacea. Earlier this month, the Africa Commission, an initiative by the Danish government, launched a \"guarantee facility\" worth $3bn to mobilize loans for small businesses. Until now, such entrepreneurs – typically street vendors wishing to own a shop but with needs exceeding the scope of micro-credit – have been ignored by local banks. Donald Kaberuka, a commission member and president of the African Development Bank, said the move was \"the most innovative initiative launched in Africa in decades, which will create millions of productive and decent jobs\". A bestselling book by the Zambian economist Dambisa Moyo called Dead Aid argues that western assistance has given rise to a dependency culture in developing countries. It has sparked a furious response from aid organisations angered by the attention given to the former Goldman Sachs strategist, named this month by Time Magazine as one of the top 100 most influential people in the world. But the question is: what should aid be replaced by? Aid experts, businesspeople and civil society groups warn that unless the new social entrepreneurs, as they are being called, must be helped not only to get on their bikes but to stay on them. The world financial crisis has increased protectionist tendencies among rich countries, worsening Africa's access to markets. The crisis has set back efforts such as Gordon Brown's Business Call to Action, which last year asked corporations to help to achieve the United Nations Millennium Development Goals by 2015. It is estimated that 60% of Africa's population is aged under 25. Only one in four children go into secondary education and, of those, only 5% enter vocational training courses. Business studies are mostly absent from curriculums and apprenticeships often mask child exploitation. African business people welcome the Africa Commission's move. But Sudanese-British entrepreneur Mo Ibrahim – who made his fortune in Africa through the Celtel mobile phone company – said supporting small business was only part of the solution. Ibrahim, 63, said: \"Africa has no venture capital industry – the kind that supported the Googles and Microsofts of this world. So the guarantee facility is helpful, but what we really need are local funds to become involved. We need local investors whose motivation is profit. The Africa Commission must not become another handout industry.\" He also welcomed the move to raise the glass ceiling of micro-credit, but said African governments must not be let off the hook. \"The World Bank should refuse to fund any project which is not regional. African governments must be pressed to regionalise their economies and stop being 53 little countries, each with their flag, jealously watching each other.\" Microsoft Africa chairman Cheick Diarra, 57, warned that encouraging entrepreneurs will build wealth only if bureaucratic obstacles are removed. \"Politicians are doing very little to dynamise their economies or empower their people. Governments should be dealing with infrastructure development, such as electrification.\" Diarra, from Mali, who made his name as an interplanetary navigator for Nasa, also believes \"bad aid\" is responsible for many of the continent's ills. \"In 2002, I ran the Virtual University in Nairobi, providing distance-learning by internet. But dealings with most of the donors were a frustration because they set rigid terms and would rarely adapt to the rapidly-changing conditions on the ground.\" African business development does not represent a threat to rich countries. The continent has 20% of the world's population but only a 2% share of its trade. Nevertheless, even before decolonisation in the 1960s, rich countries have behaved as though they wished to keep Africa poor. The one exception to the rule is Coca-Cola, which since 1928 has been fostering entrepreneurship on the continent. Critics of the Africa Commission say its focus on entrepreneurs implies that it will help urban businesses, but that 65% of Africa's people are rural. Danish development minister Ulla Tornaes said farmers need to become businesslike and added: \"We cannot dictate to African countries on agriculture.\" In African civil society – where western-funded lobby groups and welfare organizations have had sharp budget cuts as a result of the downturn – there are fears that the focus on entrepreneurship is a creeping privatisation of aid. Vuyiseka Dabula, spokesman for the South African Treatment Action Campaign, said: \"HIV is not in recession and we are not a business. About 80% of our funding comes from international donors and most of them have had 25% budget cuts.\" Oxfam's head of research, Duncan Green, said the move to promote entrepreneurship smacked of repackaging. \"Suddenly people are saying that social entrepreneurship is going to get millions of people on to solar energy and that kind of thing. It's interesting, but it must not be seen as the new magic bullet.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/blog/2009/jan/19/energy-climatechange","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-01-19T11:56:03Z","webTitle":"Terry Macalister takes the energy industry's temperature at the World Future Energy Summit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2009/jan/19/energy-climatechange","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/blog/2009/jan/19/energy-climatechange","fields":{"headline":"World leaders meet to discuss renewable energy","bodyText":"I'll get my excuses in first and then move on to Kaka later. I have increased my carbon footprint by flying to the low-carb World Future Energy Summit in Abu Dhabi concluding it was not realistic to meet 10,000-plus delegates and visitors via video-link from Blighty. A conference exploring alternative power and clean technology developments like this one is usually most valuable for what people say privately rather the public spiel from the platform. And it is a great chance to take the temperature of solar, wind and other industries that offer the best chance of tackling climate change and dwindling oil reserves. This Gulf get-together could not come at a better time, since the renewables sector is desperately hoping that the Barack Obama inauguration on Tuesday will kickstart a global green revolution hampered by George Bush. But the summit also comes at a time when the credit crunch and looming world recession has been clobbering green energy company shares and distracting the political establishment. Here in the Gulf is an unusual array of environment ministers, financiers, and entrepreneurs – but also the big oil companies who are keeping a close eye on those who would like to give the last rights to carbon. BP, Shell and Exxon are also here to trumpet their solutions to global warming. I will be wanting to know from Vivienne Cox, head of renewables at BP, how she justifies putting all her (meagre in group terms) cash into US wind instead of British turbine projects, for instance. I will want to find out from Ditlev Engel, chief executive of Vestas, the biggest turbine-maker, how the economic downturn is hitting his business while getting Kieran Drain, the president of Nanogram, to explain what he means by his \"new paradigm\" in solar energy. There's a whole load of others that deserve a question or two, what with Lord Stern (now representing HSBC bank rather than team GB), Andris Piebalgs, the EU's commissioner for energy, and plenty of American academics and Silicon Valley businessmen. The closing address is being done by Tony Blair, who will be worth a few questions, only some of which will centre on climate change, I imagine. You may be wondering why all this is happening in Abu Dhabi, of course. I don't totally understand that myself but it seems part of the answer is that the oil-rich nation wants to cut a new image that separates it from the bling Gulf state next door, Dubai, by coming on all cultural and high-minded modern. That image is possibly being slightly undermined by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, who is said to be willing to spend £100m to lure Kaka from Milan to Manchester City which the Arab businessman owns.

These parabolic troughs follow the arc of the sun as it moves across the sky, concentrating the sun's rays onto pipes filled with a synthetic oil that can be heated to 750 degrees Fahrenheit. That super-heated oil is used to boil water to power steam turbines, or to pump excess heat into vats of salts, turning them a molten, lava-like consistency. The salts are just fertilizers — a mix of sodium and potassium nitrate — but they represent a significant advance in the decades-old technology of solar thermal power production, which has traditionally used mirrors to heat water or oil to generate electricity-producing steam. Now, engineers can use the molten salts to store the heat from solar radiation many hours after the sun goes down and then release it at will to drive turbines. That means solar thermal power can be used to generate electricity nearly round-the-clock. The plant in southern Spain, known as Andasol 1, began operating last November and now provides 50 megawatts of power, enough electricity to supply 50,000 to 60,000 homes year-round. Andasol 2 will come online later this summer, with Andasol 3 already under construction. When the entire Andasol complex is completed in 2011, it is expected to generate enough electricity to power 150,000 households — about 600,000 people. In the face of mounting concern about climate change, developing alternatives to coal and natural gas combustion has taken on a new urgency, and the construction of utility-scale solar thermal power plants in deserts and arid areas is looking like an increasingly promising option. In the United States alone, solar thermal power projects are now being built near fast-growing centers of electricity consumption, such as Las Vegas, Los Angeles, and Phoenix. The first major solar thermal plant to be completed in decades, dubbed Nevada Solar One, started providing 64 megawatts of power to the neon lights of Las Vegas in 2007, although it lacks the latest molten-salt technology. Across the globe, utilities are currently building or planning solar thermal projects in North Africa, Spain, and Australia, among other regions. Some of the recent claims for solar thermal power have been stunning. Researchers at the German Aerospace Center have estimated that 16,000 square kilometers of solar thermal power plants in North Africa — paired with a new infrastructure of high-voltage, direct-current transmission lines — could provide enough electricity for all of Europe. And scientists have estimated that constructing solar thermal power plants on less than 1 percent of the world's deserts — an area roughly the size of Austria — could meet the entire world's energy needs. Of course, solar thermal has been here before, experiencing a boom in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Its progress then was stalled by collapsing fossil fuel prices, as well as a lack of government support. Today, some critics of the technology fault it for taking up acreage in fragile deserts. The case for solar thermal power hinges on economics. The sun bathes the Earth with an average of 6 kilowatt-hours of power per square meter over the course of a day, and a concentrated solar power plant like Andasol is In the face of mounting concern about climate change, developing alternatives to coal and natural gas combustion has taken on a new urgency, and the construction of utility-scale solar thermal power plants in the cheapest way to harvest a portion of that. Photovoltaics — semiconductor panels that convert sunlight to electricity — deliver power at roughly 40 cents per kilowatt-hour, while conventional solar thermal power plants can do so for around 13 cents per kilowatt hour, according to the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory. This is only marginally more expensive than the average U.S. price for coal-generated electricity in 2008 of 11 cents per kilowatt hour. The cutting-edge technology of using molten salts to store solar-generated heat is considerably more expensive, but experts expect that price to fall steadily as the technology improves and is mass-produced. Roughly 612,000 megawatt-hours of electricity from the sun were produced in 2007, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), and solar thermal collectors sufficient to cover more than 15 million square feet were shipped and ready for installation that year — more than double the amount in 1998. In the United States, some 3,100 megawatts of solar thermal power are planned by 2012, and capacity worldwide is expected to reach 6,400 megawatts within 3 years — roughly 14 times the current amount. Still, electricity from the sun contributes just 1 percent of the renewable energy generated in the U.S., and all renewables taken together only provide 7 percent of U.S. energy needs. Traditionally, solar thermal power plants have been built two ways — using trough-like mirrors to focus the sun's heat on water or oil in nearby pipes, or using mirrors to focus solar radiation on a central spot, such as a liquid-filled \"power tower.\" Since 1984, vast arrays of curved mirrors have concentrated the sun's rays on regimented lines of pipe filled with a synthetic oil at the Solar Energy Generating Systems (SEGS) power plant in the Mojave Desert of California. The SEGS plant was part of a brief boom in alternative energy projects in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when enthusiasm for the technology ran high in the wake of the first energy crisis. But the Reagan administration phased out research and development funding for solar thermal technology, as well as delaying tax credits that had driven the creation of projects like SEGS. Coupled with cheap fossil fuel prices in the late 1980s and 1990s, solar thermal power could not compete — although it still grew by roughly 4 percent a year from 1986 to 2000, according to the EIA. Given its long operation record, developers are now copying SEGS and its parabolic trough collectors. In the U.S. alone, nearly 1,800 megawatts of such power plants are scheduled to be completed — mainly in the desert Southwest — by 2011, according to investment research from Friedman, Billings, Ramsey &amp; Co. Palo Alto, Calif.-based Ausra will employ compact linear Fresnel reflectors — flat mirrors that deliver the same focus — to heat water at a planned 177-megawatt solar thermal plant named Carrizo Plains in central California by next year. Already, the company opened a 5-megawatt demonstration plant last October near Bakersfield, Calif. Nor is the technology confined to the southwestern U.S.: Florida Power &amp; Light will build a 75-megawatt solar thermal trough plant north of Miami. Hurricanes are not a major concern; Ausra's chief scientist and founder, David Mills, notes that in testing their mirrors have withstood winds of more than 91 miles per hour. But the most promising technology is one using molten salts, as it overcomes one of the chief traditional drawbacks of solar energy generation — that when the sun sets, the lights go out. The Andasol power plant uses more than 28,000 metric tons of sodium and potassium nitrates to store some of the sun's heat for use at night or on a rainy day. The molten salts are stored in enormous hot and cold vats, able to be employed on command to soak up extra heat or drive the generation of electricity. \"The turbine is running more hours every day because we have storage and we have the possibility to plan our electricity production,\" said Sven Moormann, a spokesman for Solar Millennium, the German company building Andasol. Abengoa Solar and Arizona Public Services are now using the molten salts technology in portions of the Solana — or \"sunny place\" — power plant, located 70 miles southwest of Phoenix on nearly 2,000 acres of land. The plant will ultimately produce enough electricity to power 70,000 Arizona homes. \"One of the great things about molten salt technology is that you can get more energy out of the same facility,\" says Barbara Lockwood, manager for renewable energy at Arizona Public Services. But molten salts don't have to be just used for storage, as they are at Andasol and will be at Solana. They can also be used directly as a fluid in solar thermal power plants that operate at a much higher temperature, replacing the synthetic oil or water used in power towers. In this variation of the solar thermal technology, large fields of mirrors concentrate the sun's heat on a central tower that glows with intense light. Such plants operate at more than 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit — closer to the temperatures employed at a coal-fired power plant — and therefore can use the salts directly as a heating medium. At night, when temperatures begin to drop, the cooling salts that have already transferred their heat to drive a turbine simply drain to the bottom of the tower, where they are stored in tanks, ready to be heated again the next sunny day. Cheaper power towers that do not employ the molten salts are also being built: an 11-megawatt power tower that employs steam directly — built by Abengoa — now operates outside Seville, Spain. Southern California Edison has contracted for 1,300 megawatts of such direct steam solar thermal power towers with developer BrightSource. Some utility-scale solar thermal projects have provoked opposition due to the large land area occupied by the arrays in Bakersfield, Los Angeles, San Diego, and elsewhere in California. But proponents of solar thermal power argue that the benefits of the carbon-free technology far outweigh any local impact. \"We're not going to solve the [climate change] problem without putting large-scale concentrated solar facilities in the American Southwest,\" SolarReserve's Murphy says. \"It doesn't take that big a footprint to make a pretty big impact.\" In addition, there is another way to use this technology for capturing the sun's heat — cleaning up existing fossil fuel-fired power plants or other operations that burn a lot of CO2-emitting fossil fuels. By employing the mirrors of a solar thermal array to pre-heat steam, the amount of natural gas, oil, or coal that must be burned can be reduced. In fact, Ausra's first installation boosted the efficiency of a coal-fired power plant in Australia by providing 9 megawatts of steam to the 2,000-megawatt Liddell Power Station. The company also hopes to work with some California oil producers that currently inject steam — generated by burning natural gas — into the old reservoirs to enable more oil to be pumped to the surface. Ausra argues that it can generate the same steam without any CO2 emissions by employing its solar thermal technology. The Electric Power Research Institute, a utility-funded consortium, will study the potential of the technology to reduce fossil fuel-burning at power plants in Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, and North Carolina. \"People need to look at this as a hedge against fossil fuel prices,\" says Murphy. \"You could start deploying a new type of power plant. We used to burn coal and natural gas — now we can use the sun to make steam.\" • From Yale Environment 360, part of Guardian Environment Network"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2008/dec/15/global-oil-supply-peak-2020-prediction","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2008-12-15T00:01:00Z","webTitle":"Global oil supply will peak in 2020, says energy agency","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/dec/15/global-oil-supply-peak-2020-prediction","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2008/dec/15/global-oil-supply-peak-2020-prediction","fields":{"headline":"Global oil supply will peak in 2020, says energy agency","bodyText":"Global oil production will peak much earlier than expected amid a collapse in petroleum investment due to the credit crunch, one of the world's foremost experts has revealed. Fatih Birol, chief economist to the International Energy Agency, told the Guardian that conventional crude output could plateau in 2020, a development that was \"not good news\" for a world still heavily dependent on petroleum. The prediction came as oil companies from Saudi Arabia to Canada cut their capital expenditure on new projects in response to a fall in oil prices, moves that will further reduce supply in future. Birol's comments will give more ammunition to those who warn that the British government is dangerously complacent in not trying to wean the country off oil as quickly as possible. Some observers believe that, because the global economy is underpinned by oil, the peaking of supply will cause severe economic, social and political disruption unless prepared for over many years. John Hemming, chairman of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Peak Oil and Gas, said Birol's \"conversion\" was significant. \"The penny has finally dropped - geological issues matter as well as political and economic. The IEA - unlike our government - appears to be leaving cloud cuckoo land finally,\" he added. The IEA has never before been specific about the point at which so-called conventional oil would peak. It said last month that total crude output could peak in 2030. Birol's comments follow other signs that the IEA is rapidly changing its view. In its 2007 World Energy Outlook, the IEA predicted a rate of decline from the world's existing oil fields at 3.7%, only to admit 12 months later that the speed of the fall was more likely 6.7%. Jeremy Leggett, chief executive of solar energy company Solarcentury, said Birol's views underplayed the scale of the problem. \"The IEA is very constrained in what it can say - by the demands of its constituent governments - so you have to read between the lines. We believe that peak oil will come about in 2013 at the latest but the real concern from the IEA is the adjustment of production figures,\" he said. The energy agency, which represents most western governments including the UK and US, has been backtracking rapidly on previous positions. Three years ago the Paris-based organisation still denied there was any fundamental threat to the world's petroleum economy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/ethicallivingblog/2008/oct/24/greenbuilding-flooding","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2008-10-24T16:19:02Z","webTitle":"Movable dwellings offer climate change solution","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ethicallivingblog/2008/oct/24/greenbuilding-flooding","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/ethicallivingblog/2008/oct/24/greenbuilding-flooding","fields":{"headline":"As temperatures rise, is there a future for movable homes?","bodyText":"Moving house can be stressful. But can a moving house take the stress out of modern life? Danish artist collective N55, which advocates a nomadic way of life, certainly thinks so. Their Walking House has been tramping the fields of Bourn near Cambridge this week using solar energy to power its hydraulic legs at a leisurely speed of 60 metres an hour. You can watch its maiden movements in car park in Denmark here. Its visit to Wysing Arts Centre this week didn't go smoothly as one of its legs didn't work yesterday. But artists Ion Sørvin, and Øivind Slaatto have had their modular dwelling up and moving, if not running, today. But behind the eccentricity of the project is a more serious message. The module is solar-powered, collects its own water, has a compost toilet and a wood-burning stove for carbon neutral heating comes as an optional extra. As a prototype for a real solution to overcrowding in cities, or anti-flood measures as sea levels rise, it has a long way to go — which at 60 metres an hour might take much longer. But the Danes are not the only ones giving serious thought to housing issues in a changing climate. The idea of floating homes that rise and fall with the sea level, or houses built on stilts, have been built in all sorts of climates for centuries. The Dutch have perfected their designs for floating homes. But the future for moveable dwellings looks limited at least for the moment. \"It's meant to be a suggestion of how people can live in a more mobile way.

After we've driven by several times, peering at builders still working on one house, we burst out laughing - our beach house is here and the sandy bit must be the \"landscaped\" garden promised on the website. Yikes - it's cold in here. Quick! Where's the thermostat? We run up and down wood stairs in our tall, narrow \"eco-home\" - partly to keep warm but mainly because there are central heating controls on different floors. \"It's like being in The Simpson's,\" says my bloke as he emerges from the integral garage into a ground-floor playroom. Open-plan living is on the first floor (retro pieces of furniture, portable TV, sound system), bathroom and twin bedroom on the second and on the top floor is a large en suite double bedroom economically furnished but filled with light. Suspiciously, we find heaters in cupboards with dials set to max; unforgivably, my bloke finds a less than spotless loo.

But John Langdon, a director at Austin-based solar energy firm HelioVolt, believes that is exactly what it is. Talking over the buzz of power tools and clanging of hammers, he believes this place is part of an energy revolution that will change the face of the American - and the world's - economy. 'The whole transformation is inevitable. We are in the same place in solar energy now as the car industry was in 1901,' he says, without a trace of doubt in his Texan drawl. Langdon's confidence is shared by many - and not just in solar energy. For HelioVolt is just one of hundreds of firms creating an industry called 'green tech' or 'clean tech'. The term refers to any sort of new technology that can be used commercially in an environmentally friendly way to produce energy or clean up pollution. It is spreading rapidly across America, grabbing headlines in a country now obsessed with spiking oil prices and rising costs of energy. It is also an industry undergoing a massive financial boom as investors pour billions of speculative dollars into its start-up firms, similar in many ways to the dotcom revolution of the 1990s that gave the world Microsoft, Google and the internet revolution. All over America green-tech firms are seeking to make a huge profit at the same time as solving the world's energy needs and environmental problems. The figures are huge and growing. Last year alone more than $3.6bn (£1.8bn) of investment cash poured into the industry in the US alone, on top of $2.9bn in 2006, in itself a 78 per cent jump from the previous year. 'The sector is growing at a very rapid pace,' said Jeff Holzschuh, chairman of an energy industry investment fund at Morgan Stanley. The variety of green-tech firms is dazzling. It ranges from well known alternative energy sources such as wind energy and geothermal to more bizarre forms, such as using microscopic bugs to make synthetic petrol substitutes. Other firms look at biofuels such as ethanol from corn or less controversial sources such as switchgrass or agricultural plant waste. Still more are exploring hydrogen fuel cells big enough to power a building or small enough to fuel a laptop. A recent book, Earth: The Sequel, by environmentalist Fred Krupp, begins with a statement about green tech's possibilities: 'A revolution is on the horizon. A wholescale transformation of the world economy and the way people live.' Just like the dotcom boom was led by Silicon Valley in California, so are hotspots of green tech appearing in America. The main area so far is probably Austin, the capital of Texas, the old heartland of America's oil industry. HelioVolt is just one of more than 50 green-tech firms now in the city at the cutting edge of a new wave of solar energy firms. It aims to produce building materials embedded with thin but powerful solar energy generators. Thus, instead of having to fit solar units to buildings, the buildings themselves will actually be made of solar power generators. They will not only provide their own power but sell excess energy into the power grid. The company has risen rapidly, attracting powerful investors, impressed by its technology and the Austin factory, which should be up and running by early next year. Last year HelioVolt easily raised $101m from venture capital firms and its chief executive, BJ Stanbery, is a familiar sight at energy conferences around the US. Sitting in a plush hotel room in Manhattan, fresh from another presentation, he says finding backers was easy: 'Raising money is not a problem for us.' There is also a widespread 'greening' of America's political system and its wider economy. Hillary Clinton put creating 'green collar' jobs at the heart of her presidential campaign, estimating that up to five million such jobs could be created as the US economy goes green. Even big firms such as Wal-Mart and Coca-Cola are announcing changes in their environmental practices. Though some of this has been condemned as mere 'green-washing', there is little doubt there has been a fundamental shift towards environmentalism. Last week San Francisco imposed a series of fees on local firms that emit carbon dioxide. The cause of the change is simple: there is money to be made in going green; that is the hard reality behind the revolution. The bankers and hedge fund managers flooding into the sector are not investing billions to save the planet, but to make a profit. 'It is a strictly for profit group,' said John Eber, managing director of Energy Investments at JP Morgan. Eber has put in a staggering $4.4bn of investment in 43 wind farms. But, just as the dotcom sector eventually crashed, some worry that green tech may also expand and collapse. 'There is an element of bubble to it,' Stanbery admits. 'But there always is. Some firms will always fail, but others will become huge.' Optimists also point out that green-tech companies differ greatly from dotcom firms. The nature of their research requires heavy investment and equipment and exhaustive testing, not just new software tricks. 'Three guys in a garage can't do what we do,' says Langdon. Yet there is no denying some similarities. HelioVolt has grown so quickly that its staff sometimes work two or three to a single office. Its break rooms have the requisite trendy ping-pong tables and piles of empty pizza boxes common to Silicon Valley start-ups. But Langdon thinks there is little chance the company will fail. Instead, he envisions a world of buildings constructed from materials that will generate their own power. Surveying HelioVolt's new factory he made a confident prediction: 'This will be the smallest factory we ever build. The next ones will be much bigger.'"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2008/nov/24/andalucia-spain-renewable-energy-technology","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2008-11-24T00:01:00Z","webTitle":"Power in the desert: solar towers will harness sunshine of southern Spain","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/nov/24/andalucia-spain-renewable-energy-technology","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2008/nov/24/andalucia-spain-renewable-energy-technology","fields":{"headline":"Power in the desert: solar towers will harness sunshine of southern Spain","bodyText":"In the desert of southern Spain, 20 miles outside Seville, more than 1,000 mirrors are being carefully positioned. Each is about half the size of a tennis court, so the adjustments will take time. But when they are complete in a few weeks, it will mark a major moment in the quest for renewable energy. The mirrors are part of the world's biggest solar tower plant, a technology that reflects sunlight to superheat water at a central tower. Once this €80m (£67m) plant is inaugurated in January, it will generate 20MW of electricity, enough to power 11,000 Spanish homes. Concentrated solar power (CSP) technology, as it is known, is seen by many as a simpler, cheaper and more efficient way to harness the sun's energy than other methods such as photovoltaic (PV) panels. But CSP only works in places with clear skies and strong sunshine. The Andalucian deserts are an ideal location, and Spain hopes the PS20 plant will enable it to take advantage of its huge solar resource and lead the field in CSP technology. \"The radiation hitting the earth is 10,000 times the consumption of energy,\" said José Domíngues Abascal, chief technology officer at Abengoa, the Spanish energy company behind the plant. \"There is great potential in solar energy.\" Abengoa has already built a smaller version of the tower technology to test that the idea works. The 11MW PS10 system has been generating electricity for almost two years. Its new design uses an area larger than 100 football pitches, with 1,255 mirrors, called heliostats, each with a collecting area of 120 sq m. These track the sun as it moves through the day and reflect the energy to the top of a 160-metre tower at the centre of the field. Here, the concentrated light is used to heat water to more than 260C, producing steam that can turn an electricity generating turbine. When switched on, the new plant will be the world's largest commercial CSP plant feeding electricity into a national grid. It will be also be a significant step for tower technology, seen as a candidate for the large-scale solar plants of the future. Spanish firms are charging ahead with CSP: more than 50 solar projects around Spain have been approved for construction by the government and, by 2015, the country will generate more than 2GW of power from CSP, comfortably exceeding current national targets. The companies are also exporting their technology to Morocco, Algeria and the US. \"CSP is at the very beginning of a big boom,\" said José Luis García, at Greenpeace in Spain. \"Spain is in a good position to develop and implement the technology. We have the sun so we are in the best position to lead in this field.\" The country's clean energy targets are in line with the EU's plan to source 20% of primary energy from renewables by 2020, which means that 30% of electricity would have to come from carbon-free sources. A new EU renewables directive would increase that electricity target to 40%, but García said Spain could easily reach for more, up to 50%. John Loughhead, executive director of the UK Energy Research Council, said that Abenoga's tower approach at the new plant was relatively efficient \"because what you're doing is concentrating a very large area of sunlight on top of a very small area so you can get very high temperatures\". He added that, given the right environment, solar towers were a credible way to make clean power. \"But can you make them cheap enough, will they be reliable enough, will they have the right lifetime?\" Another difficulty for potential developers is cost. In Spain, the generation costs of electricity from CSP are double those from more traditional methods. But Abascal said the price was falling as solar projects got bigger and it would match that of fossil fuel power within a decade. For now, CSP projects across Spain are built with the promise that the government will pay a premium, known as a feed-in tariff, for any CSP electricity sent into the grid. The PS20 is part of a €1.2bn series of solar power plants based on CSP technologies including tower plants and trough-style collectors - where water is passed in tubes directly in front of parabolic mirrors that collect sunlight - and a few PV panels planned by Abengoa. The solar farm will eventually generate up to 300MW of power, enough for the 700,000 people of Seville, by 2013. The 20MW solar tower is also a forerunner for an even more ambitious idea, one that Abascal hopes will become a standard for CSP plants in future - a 50MW version that could generate electricity around the clock. \"During the day, you'd use 50% of your electricity to produce electricity and 50% to heat molten salt. During the night you use the molten salt to produce electricity.\" Molten salt technology is in its early stages but Abengoa is testing the idea at a power plant in Granada. So far the company has demonstrated that it is possible to store up to eight hours of solar energy by heating tanks containing 28,000 tonnes of salt to more than 220C. \"This will make it possible to have almost constant production or at least it will be able to produce energy for most of the day,\" said Abascal. The European commission has identified CSP as part of its future clean energy technology plan. Earlier this year a representative from its joint research centre argued that CSP could even form a major part of a proposed EU supergrid that would transport electricity, generated in solar plants in southern Europe and northern Africa, across Europe. The supergrid has received political support from Gordon Brown and France's president, Nicolas Sarkozy, who has commissioned a feasibility study on the project. Graveyard generation The Spanish town of Santa Coloma de Gramenet has placed more than 450 solar panels on top of mausoleums at its cemetery to generate power, it emerged yesterday. The crowded, working-class town outside Barcelona decided that flat, open, sun-drenched land was so scarce that the graveyard was the only viable spot to site the panels, which provide enough electricity to power 60 homes. They rest on mausoleums holding five layers of coffins. The idea was a tough sell, said Antoni Fogue, a city council member. But town hall and cemetery officials waged a campaign to explain the project and the panels were erected at a low angle, to be as unobtrusive as possible.\"This installation is compatible with respect for the deceased and for the families of the deceased,\" Fogue said. • This article was amended on Thursday November 27 2008. We said that a plant in Spain would use reflected sunlight to heat water in a tower to more than 1,000C. The temperature will actually be 260C (but future plants will reach higher temperatures).

GE Money gave me loans for timeshares in 1991 and 1993. Both purchases - in Portugal and Scotland - were sold as \"in perpetuity\", but both have gone bust. I believe I have a claim against GE Money under the Consumer Credit Act. This says that a credit provider is equally liable where there is a breach of contract, as has happened in both cases. But GE Money refuses to pay out. Why? BR, Ayrshire Timeshare can be an expensive waste of time, as you now accept. GE Money turned down your £6,188 claim relating to Fontes Romanas in Portugal simply because it cannot find paperwork relating to a timeshare. But you maintain the loan was sold specifically for timeshare. It would be your word against theirs should it go to court, which would decide on the balance of probabilities (the financial ombudsman may also be interested). GE Money's defence against the £7,571 claim relating to a timeshare at Portsonachan in Scotland is more complex. It concedes this was a timeshare loan, and agrees you no longer have the use of the week you paid for - the resort is now a hotel, rather than a timeshare. Normally, that should allow you to ask for a refund. But it argues that you forfeited your investment because you failed to pay annual fees. However, this was an administrative error and your membership was reinstated, although the Portsonachan club was wound up in 2005 after a members' vote. GE Money claims you were bound by this vote, but how representative it was of the general membership is not clear. GE does not want to make refunds, as that could cost it millions across various timeshares. Early next year, it could face a legal action from owners of shares in a boat-based scheme which, a county court judge recently determined, is timeshare. Previously, cruisers and canal narrowboats were thought to be exempt from the Timeshare Act 1992. Advanced questions about solar investment I have been approached by solar panel company, Advanced Solar. It asks \"how many times will your future fuel costs outweigh your solar energy investment?\" and \"can you trust future fuel supplies from Russia and the Middle East?\" as part of its sales pitch. What are your answers? NH, London Solar energy cuts carbon footprints, reducing imported fuel, although over the life of a solar panel set-up there is no way of knowing what the geo-political or economic future will be. But any investment decision means knowing how much to pay for the panels. While it is impossible to give pricing guidance on an individual home, you should not pay more than about £5,000 for two panels on a roof, the new hot water tank, and associated plumbing and electrical work. Some try to charge more - often much more. Avoid these, even if they offer a so-called discount. Advanced Solar is a new company, based in Poole. It was incorporated in mid-October. Its sole director is Floyd Lewis, 32, who lives in Bournemouth. Lewis is also listed at Companies House as a director of Ultimate Energy. Ultimate Energy failed to submit accounts due at Companies House on April 8 - an offence under the Companies Act. It failed to send in annual returns on October 6, also an offence. Lewis, and June Lewis, 59, were previously directors of Solar Technik, which sold solar heating, often to elderly or vulnerable people, at prices up to £12,800. In April 2005, the Advertising Standards Authority upheld a complaint against Solar Technik from trading standards officers in Cornwall and Essex. In October 2006, trading standards officers said Solar Technik's claims contravened the law. In March 2007 Solar Technik collapsed with liabilities of £1.38m, including £265,000 owed to customers. T-Mobile reviews its approach to disabled Our son, who is 25, has learning difficulties and is under the care of a charity for young adults with special needs. In April he was coerced into buying a T-Mobile phone for a third party - someone \"befriended\" him and got him to get a contract. We found out about it and immediately contacted the T-Mobile disability team to cancel the contract. It demanded proof of his disability, which we supplied. It then agreed to cancel the contract, saying nothing would appear on his credit file. But T-Mobile has now changed its tune. It says if we don't pay £350 to cover the contract, it will put a black mark on his credit file, although it will not push for payment. Please help. AM, Manchester You spent many months on this problem but the phone firm showed little understanding of the issue. T-Mobile has a glossy brochure, \"Services for disabled customers,\" while all the major networks together have published a lengthy \"Mobile Industry Good Practice Guide for Service Delivery for Disabled and Elderly Customers in the UK\". Both are helpful, but neither has much recognition of non-physical disabilities. Happily, after Capital Letters intervened, the mobile firm readily agreed to remove T-Mobile-related defaults from your son's file. More importantly, it has initiated a review with its disability services team to consider how to manage similar situations better in the future. This should result in the automatic removal of any defaults on customers' credit files if they have a mental impairment which impacts their ability to understand the consequences of a contract. Paying the price for an old-style contract ... Since the early 90s I have had a personal pension plan with Skandia Life, and a decent \"pot\". I recently realised has been deducting units every month since 1999 as a \"penalty\" for increasing my payments for a few months in 1999 and then (due to redundancy) decreasing them. I was not informed about this \"penalty\" and neither can I find any information regarding such a method in my information pack. I've paid £2,000 in fees for a small one-off contribution increase totalling just several hundred pounds years ago. CK, Brighton Skandia claims the charges were in the (very) small print and, while there is some disagreement over what you paid and when, it seems you paid a lot in fees for a tiny uplift in payments. What you have is an old-style pension contract which was more loaded against consumers than up-to-date plans such as \"stakeholders\". Privately, Skandia accepts you have been harshly treated by this one-sided contract, but it refuses to move because it would then have to refund others who have also paid over the odds. Skandia does not offer a low-cost stakeholder plan, although it says that, including your other Skandia plans, the overall cost on your £135,000 pot is \"just over 1%\". Many stakeholders charge 0.5% on this amount. But the real charges problem comes on one segment of the Skandia plan where you were persuaded into a regular premium plan 15 years ago. This rewarded the seller rather than you. Consider moving your money away from Skandia - there is only a 3% penalty which, as you are in your 40s, will be more than outweighed by the annual cost savings. And complain to the financial ombudsman, as the original plan was unsuitable for your needs - you were tying yourself up for 30 years, even though your circumstances were bound to change. The IFA should also have alerted you when you lost your job. \"Recurring single premiums\" would have saved your money but earned the seller less.

The government has cut spending on renovations by 19% in the last eight years but no priorities have been set and nobody knows the extent of the estimated £32m backlog of maintenance needed for Buckingham, St James's and Kensington Palaces, Windsor Castle, and Hampton Court Mews, says the report. It reveals that when builders got round to renovating Diana's former home in Kensington Palace after it had been left empty for a decade, bills soared from an initial estimate of £250,000 to £524,000. Builders did not have access to all the rooms before they put in an estimate and the state of the boilers to heat the apartment were in such bad condition that the bill to repair them doubled. A similar problem was discovered when Charles wanted to replace the boilers at Clarence House. The original estimate was £140,000; the final bill was £306,000. The report says both Charles and Camilla found the home no longer had a reliable supply of hot water and the heating system was breaking down. One of the main reasons for the big increase in costs was that the prince insisted that the new boilers could run on solar energy and biofuels in the future. Temporary boilers also had to be installed in Clarence House when the royal couple changed their domestic arrangements. Another project to install heat exchangers to provide hot water in Buckingham Palace rose from £127,000 to £215,000. The report says: \"The backlog figure includes £26m of projects that … should already have been completed but have not been and are not included in the 10-year forward plan. \"There are in excess of £20m of projects which are not included in either its forward work plan or backlog … There is no allowance in the backlog figure for projects such as the redecoration of state rooms at Buckingham Palace or cleaning the facades of the quadrangle at Buckingham Palace.\" Edward Leigh, the chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, said: \"I am surprised that the Department of Culture, Media and Sport does not know what condition the royal palaces are in. There is actually no comprehensive record of the condition of the estate. \"Without this, how can the department hold the royal household to account? And why has the department set objectives if it has no way of measuring whether they are achieved? \"This committee recommended in 2001 that the Department for Culture, Media and Sport keep a close eye on whether a backlog of maintenance was developing. The royal household now says there is a £32m backlog but as yet there is no plan for managing this.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/blog/2009/jan/20/energy-oil-abudhabi","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-01-20T11:59:32Z","webTitle":"The Arab royal who's going off oil","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2009/jan/20/energy-oil-abudhabi","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/blog/2009/jan/20/energy-oil-abudhabi","fields":{"headline":"The Arab royal who's going off oil","bodyText":"Abu Dhabi announced at a summit of world leaders on renewable energy yesterday that it would become the first petro-driven economy to make a significant commitment to renewables – and it is partly thanks to Prince Charles. Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, crown prince of Abu Dhabi, has decreed that 7% of power will come from green energy sources by 2020. The Middle East nation holds around 8% of the world's oil reserves and derives the vast bulk of its national income from fossil fuels, but while other OPEC oil cartel members see renewables as a threat, it has taken a different view. Sultan Al Jaber, chief executive of the state-owned future energy company Masdar, which will oversee the green drive, said at the World Future Energy Summit in Abu Dhabi that it was natural tomove into this new sector. By doing so Masdar would \"provide a comprehensive solution to the world's energy challenges and maintain Abu Dhabi's position as a leading supplier of energy to the world.\" The Gulf state, a part of the United Arab Emirates, also wants to differentiate itself from neighbour Dubai, and diversify its economy, believing a \"green\" infrastructure will help its image as a new tourist destination. Abu Dhabi has already put itself forward as a possible location for the headquarters of a planned International Renewable Energy Agency being promoted by Germany. \"Many [Opec members] see renewables as a threat but the crown prince sees them as an opportunity,\" said a source close to the Abu Dhabi state. \"He knows that the oil will eventually run out and he wants to ensure there is something left for future generations,\" he added. Prince Charles, who has close links to the Gulf royals, has been actively encouraging the green initiative behind the scenes, the source added, explaining that the Masdar executives had been invited to Buckingham Palace last year. Prince Charles is already a patron of the Masdar City project which aims to build the world's first carbon-neutral city in Abu Dhabi. He made an appearance by holographic video link at the first World Future Energy Summit held in the Gulf state last year. Prince Andrew has also become involved and was present at the meeting in the throne room at Buckingham Palace. Masdar expects to mainly use solar energy to reach its 7% targets but is also looking at wind and even geothermal power, where heat from the ground is used as a power source. Masdar has already built links to Britain by investing with E.ON of Germany and DONG of Denmark in the London Array wind farm project of the coast of Kent which is tipped to be the biggest of its kind in the world. The Abu Dhabi state stepped in when Shell pulled out of the £1bn project. The Anglo-Dutch oil group said it was concentrating its wind investment in the US, a move followed by BP. Masdar has $15bn worth of state-funding and has already started to build up its solar power business through a joint venture with Germany, a leader in the photovoltaics field. A new company, Masdar PV, will build manufacturing plants in both Germany and Abu Dhabi that will serve the growing demand for solar power, which is beginning to compete on a cost basis with traditional energy sources, even without subsidies. Dutch solar firm Econcern claimed today at the summit that prices of solar panels would half in the next five to six years. It claimed the global industry had already met the International Energy Agency's target of 10GW of installed power by 2020."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2009/mar/22/la-muela-renewables-spain-corruption","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2009-03-22T00:01:00Z","webTitle":"Scandal sullies Spain's clean energy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/mar/22/la-muela-renewables-spain-corruption","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2009/mar/22/la-muela-renewables-spain-corruption","fields":{"headline":"Scandal sullies Spain's clean energy","bodyText":"Powerful wind turbines churned the air above La Muela last week but the stir in this small Aragonese town was caused by the arrest of the mayor and 18 other people on charges that reveal a new phenomenon in Spain: eco-corruption. Windswept La Muela, with its 500 giant windmills, has become one of Spain's richest towns on the back of what is the new gold for rural communities - renewable energy. Eight years ago, the wind energy companies that provide up to 40% of Spain's electricity on blustery days came looking to plant their turbines. These now line the hills outside the town and form neat patterns across the plain. Generating companies pay €1m (£940,000) a year to the town hall in rent and taxes. Private landowners, many of whose families worked the hard, unforgiving land for centuries, share a further €0.5m a year. Planting windmills has proved far more lucrative than cultivating crops. Each brings in about €3,000 a year to the landowner. The wind energy boom brought with it a frenzy of development, as the town's population increased threefold. With wind power pouring euros into the municipal coffers, colossal building schemes were pursued. The 5,000 residents now share three museums, a theatre, a bull-ring and a gleaming sports and swimming centre. The mayor, María Victoria Pinilla, who denies any wrongdoing, showered townsfolk with money. She subsidised holidays to Cancún, Mexico, to Brazil, and to the Caribbean beaches of Santo Domingo. She herself was among those to prosper. A plot of land she owns now contains three smart new houses for herself and her two sons, one of whom was also arrested last week. In a pattern repeated in several Spanish towns recently, Pinilla's arrest provoked indignation, directed not at her but at the courts and the police. \"She has done fine things for La Muela,\" one local told the television cameras. \"People are just envious.\" Others were not so supportive. \"She has been making fools of us for 22 years,\" said 42-year-old Asunción Gimeno. The magistrate investigating the case yesterday sent La Muela town councillor Juan Carlos Rodrigo to jail to await trial. The same judge was expected to interrogate Pinilla today and decide if she, too, should be held in custody. While it was the construction boom that accompanied the wind turbines which led to the arrest of Pinilla and other officials alleged to have demanded backhanders, the renewable energies explosion was already leaving a footprint of sleaze elsewhere in Spain. A judge in the Canary Islands last week accused a former industry department chief, Celso Perdomo, of making millions of euros by selling secret information on land about to be earmarked for the wind industry. Inspectors are also busy looking at a sudden boom in solar farms, where subsidies assuring a 12% annual return on investment over 25 years sent Spain's notoriously corrupt real estate developers into a frenzy. In many ways those subsidies were a spectacular success. In three years Spain built about 29,000 solar \"gardens\", to become the world's second-largest producer of solar power after Germany. In 2004 it took three months to install 2 megawatts; by 2008 the same amount was being installed every day. The sector grew ninefold over two years, as stretches of countryside disappeared under shiny black panels. \"Entire boatloads of panels from China were being auctioned before they even got to port,\" said one dealer. Banks eagerly handed out loans. \"It became an instrument for speculators,\" explained environmental expert Juanma Redondo. \"Solar gardens were being sold like pension funds. It was a risk-free investment.\" Licences to build solar gardens or connect to the grid became Spain's most sought-after pieces of paper, and backhanders and trafficking in licences soon started. Clean energy is believed to have attracted dirty money, as the notoriously corrupt construction business sought ways to launder illegal earnings. Information about plans to build connection points to dump solar power into the grid also became hugely valuable: land prices around these points multiplied up to 10 times overnight. \"Who got the licences? That is where the shadow of doubt appears. There have been no public tenders and no transparent decision-making,\" commented Luis Gómez, a journalist at El País. A dozen officials at the regional government of Castilla y León, in north-west Spain, were sacked last year after giving licences to relatives. Then José Joaquín Moya, the socialist mayor of Bigastro, eastern Spain, was arrested for allegedly selling licences. When Spain's National Commission for Energy decided to inspect 30 solar gardens, it found only 13 of them had been built properly and were actually dumping electricity into the network. After exceeding its solar energy target 10 times over, Spain has slashed subsidies for future projects. Despite the corruption brought by the boom, Spain is also reaping benefits. On sunny days solar panels provide up to 5% of the country's energy needs. Wind turbines like those at La Muela provide even more clean energy, allowing Spain to cover almost a third of electricity needs from renewable sources last month."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2009/feb/22/architecture-dubai-revolving-buildings","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2009-02-22T00:01:00Z","webTitle":"Architecture: Stephen Bayley discerns the shape of things to come","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/feb/22/architecture-dubai-revolving-buildings","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2009/feb/22/architecture-dubai-revolving-buildings","fields":{"headline":"Revolving buildings: the new shape of things","bodyText":"Darmstadt and Dubai present the extreme possibilities of contemporary living. In the first, a small town south of Frankfurt, you find the Passivhaus Institut. Since 1996, it has been experimenting with the ultimate in environmentally intelligent building design. Dubai has been doing the opposite: athletically raising the bar in competition for irresponsible, expensive and brainless architectural kitsch. So in Darmstadt you can find the ur-Passivhaus, while Dubai is offering a revolving building so your infinity pool on the 80th storey can follow the sun. In Darmstadt, the question is: can we make our existing homes ecologically intelligent? Probably not. Most houses are thermal atrocities which waste and leak energy at every stage of their construction, existence and demolition. Short of layering up in ski-suits, switching off the power and using candles, the best option is to start again. Thus, the commonsensical Passive House and its simple rules. Face south (if in Europe) to take full advantage of (free) solar energy. If at all possible, be partially buried: the ground is an efficient, and again entirely free, thermal moderator which helps keep temperatures stable. Use triple glazing and standards of insulation and sealing inspired by the disciplines of aerospace. Capture rainwater and recycle most of what is used. Integrate heating and ventilation into a single, very small, very efficient, very German electro-mechanical unit. So the Passive House is completely airtight. And with no temperature drops, body heat is usefully retained. In this thermal utopia, the only artificial heating is carried by the minimalist ventilation. The UK's first Passive House, designed by Bere Architects, is now being built in Camden, North London. It will, perhaps, be a little bit like living on the Northern Line: what fresh air there may be is pre-heated through subterranean channels. Other problems? Ecological perfection will demand a quality of detailing hitherto unknown to our native builders. And there will be no flinging open the windows to greet the new green dawn. That way you squander your patiently retained heat. In Dubai, the question is: how can we offer a market sated by excess a novelty to stimulate jaded palates? Dubai's natural hot-house atmosphere has already had an astonishing forcing effect on architectural imaginations, not all of it positive. Delirious money has driven stand-up comedy buildings high into the desert sky, creating a horizon of baffling vulgarity. But nothing yet built is so challenging as the revolving building proposed by the Dynamic Group. This tower is designed to turn in circles, so offering not just commodity, firmness and delight, but rpm too. Each prefabricated floor will be attached to a central service shaft, supported by a bearing whose design and specification will surely be technically demanding. Concentric with the shaft and layered between apartments are giant horizontal wind-driven fans. If I understand correctly, these power motors which turn each residential floor separately on its axis. Will residents have a gearbox to moderate the revolutionary speed of their apartment? While Darmstadt's Passive Houses look remarkably similar to a local bourgeois urban vernacular established in the early 19th century, artistically the Dubai revolver is part of the current fad for \"torqued towers\", buildings with an irrational expressive strain designed into them. Santiago Calatrava's Malmo, Zaha Hadid's Dancing Towers and Rem Koolhaas's Central Chinese TV HQ are examples. But all these architecture-sculptures are static. The Dynamic Group upstages them with a building that actually moves. The philosophical complexities and absurdities of modern life can have no more powerful symbol. There may be objections. Those big fans: how much noise and vibration will they cause? If sitting in a Passive House is like sitting on the Northern Line, the revolving tower may be like sitting in a food processor. And since Dubai's wind patterns are dominated by daytime sea-breezes, won't all the floors end up facing the same way? Then there is the prosaic matter of plumbing. Those vital flexible joints require an untried technology! Might centrifugally expressed kitchen or bathroom slops ruin the shock of the view? In both Darmstadt and Dubai, it all comes down to hot air and waste water, as does so much of life. Architecture, they used to say, is frozen music. In Darmstadt and Dubai, the extreme possibilities seem to be a solemn fugue or a drunken samba. Maybe the real future will have a different soundtrack."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"technology/2006/aug/17/energy.insideit","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2006-08-17T14:30:36Z","webTitle":"Inside IT: Solar energy is hot stuff","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2006/aug/17/energy.insideit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2006/aug/17/energy.insideit","fields":{"headline":"Solar energy is hot stuff","bodyText":"If you go down to Hyde Park today, you're sure of a big surprise. Cruising alongside the usual mix of bladers, nannies and tourists, there's an exotic new addition: a sleek,virtually silent, people-carrying boat that moves as if by magic. Designed by Christoph Behling, the solar-powered vessel - the Serpentine Solar Shuttle - is the latest evidence that solar is officially hot, among designers at least. Sharp, the world's number one solar cell producer, has just turned its hand to glass studded with LED lights and cells. Instead of generating enough electricity to run a home, it creates a psychedelic light show at night, powered entirely by the day's sun: it's more likely to feature in a photo shoot for Wallpaper* magazine than a Green Party newsletter. Tory leader David Cameron's cool halo owes much to the solar panels he's installing on his Notting Hill roof. And I can't walk down the street wearing my solar backpack without being stopped by fascinated strangers, an experience Graham Hill of the American eco-blog treehugger.com knows well. Gadgets like the backpack have certainly played a large part in solar's image revival. Our appetite for consumer electronics of all sorts has grown hugely over the past few years, with sales totalling a record $135.4bn (£71.4bn) in the US alone last year. With so many gizmos to power, solar suddenly has new uses. When Will Gould, a gadget lover and TV script editor, set off to travel the world for a year, his first purchase was a solar charger for iPods and phones. \"I didn't know when I'd be near a plug socket,\" he explains, \"and, yes, there's gadget lust: the Solio I bought has a beautiful flower-like, iPod white design\". Once a distant technology that sat on roofs and was hard to understand, solar power has become a tool that we can hold in our hands. As John Laumer, a Treehugger contributor, puts it, \"seeing is believing\". New gadgets increasingly have solar built-in. Recent outlandish additions include a solar-powered tent, scooter and LED house numbers, while mundane ones like bike lights, torches and radios have been around for years. \"Solar bags\" that charge anything smaller than a laptop have been particularly popular, and when the hip snow'n'surf brand O'Neill introduced one, it sold out. Even high street store Maplins now sells the Scotty, a relatively cheap (£35) solar charger. Like other elements of the green revolution - such as furniture and fashion - design has been key. Adam Thacker, from Better Energy Systems,the Solio's maker, says: \"When we first looked at making a renewable-powered charger, it fast became apparent that most stuff was sold by making people feel guilty about their environmental impact. Design is so important. The iPod's not the best MP3 player out there, but it's caught people's imagination because of the way it looks.\" Purchases inspired by design and hands-on experience have gone some way to demolishing ignorance about solar power. Contrary to popular myth, solar cells don't need direct sunlight to produce electricity, and Britain's actually quite well located for the sun. Sharp's research says that if every single building in the UK was roofed with solar panels, we'd generate more than the UK's present industrial and residential electricity consumption - there'd be no need for gas, nuclear, coal or even wind power. Clearly, some of us are waking up to the benefits of making our own electricity at home. Solarcentury, a company promoting solar in the UK, has seen sales to its residential installers - the teams that fit solar panels on homes - double between 2005 and 2006. Donnachadh McCarthy, who offers \"eco audits\" from his solar-powered south London home, thinks the Cameron effect shouldn't be ignored. \"He's definitely made solar sexy. Lately, I've had several rich, naturally Tory, clients who want solar, and their genuine motivation is to reduce carbon emissions,\" he says. \"But there are a host of other reasons. One family was concerned about its lighting going off in the case of an energy emergency or oil crisis.\" There's also a practical, very British reason for our interest in solar: money. With the average household's electricity bill above £900 (and set to rise again with British Gas's latest price rises), solar panels start to make sense at £4,000, after you've received a government grant available for installation. They can add value, too. When two new homes in Norfolk sold recently, the one with solar PV roof tiles by Solarcentury sold for 8.6% more than its neighbour. Energy efficiency ratings in next year's home information packs, grants of up to £3,000 and imminent improved planning laws should help further. Solar may suddenly be cool, but there are reasons for pause. The recent government energy review contained little concrete promotion of solar, and the scale of what's been achieved can be overstated. As McCarthy points out, \"only 100 solar PV installs have happened in London since 1999, so it's perhaps a bit early to say it's truly trendy.\" Plus the price of fitting solar on your home is unlikely to drop soon, since silicon - the raw material in solar cells - is currently in high demand. Sharp, however, is working to keep prices down by slicing the silicon used in cells even thinner than today's 180 microns. Still, the forecast looks bright for solar. Cameron's celebrity power shouldn't be underestimated, our growing gadget energy use - expected to double by 2010 - should ensure cheap green alternatives' success, and ethical living is in fashion. If you're making fairtrade, organic and green choices in other areas of your life, solar's the next obvious step. Besides, as the thronged parks and high streets of summer prove, we Brits love anything to do with the sun. · If you'd like to comment on any aspect of Technology Guardian, send your emails to tech@theguardian.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2008/oct/24/china-mobile-climate-group","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2008-10-23T23:01:00Z","webTitle":"Big Chinese companies join climate group","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/24/china-mobile-climate-group","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2008/oct/24/china-mobile-climate-group","fields":{"headline":"Big Chinese companies join climate group","bodyText":"One of China's biggest companies will today become the first state-controlled business in the country to join an international agreement to cut greenhouse gas emissions. The powerful Climate Group will announce three Chinese members, including the majority state-owned China Mobile, which has 420 million customers and is one of the country's 10 biggest companies. It is the world's biggest mobile phone operator. The other two companies are Suntech, the world's third largest solar energy supplier, which is listed on the New York stock exchange, and privately owned Broad Air Conditioning, the leading manufacturer of non-electric air conditioning units. The Chinese government and many businesses have set targets to reduce energy used and increase renewable energy. However the three Climate Group members are said to be the first to make more ambitious commitments to the organisation's aims, which include significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, publishing information on emissions, and supporting international climate change agreements. China Mobile has agreed, initially, to reduce energy intensity of its $47bn (about £29bn) annual business by 40%, double the national target. This could pave the way for these and other Chinese companies to publish plans to reduce absolute emissions, and to join voluntary carbon trading schemes. Other companies in China have already applied to join the London-based non-profit group, which is backed by some of the world's most powerful business figures, said Steve Howard, the Climate Group's chief executive. Of 100-150 world-leading companies they are targeting to set an example to businesses and policy makers, around 20 are in China, said Howard. Lenovo, a big Hong Kong-listed computer company, also joined this summer through its US head office. \"The fact that one of the companies [China Mobile] has significant state ownership shows that action on climate change is a priority for the government and the private sector,\" said Howard. The move was welcomed by the former British prime minister Tony Blair, who is working with the Climate Group. \"China is a vital ally in the fight against global warming,\" he said. The Climate Group's members already include global names such as BP, BSkyB and News Corporation, Duke Energy, HSBC, JP Morgan Chase, Nike and Tesco. Changhua Wu, the group's greater China director, said Chinese members joining was important in the run-up to a hoped-for international agreement in Copenhagen in 2009 to cut emissions."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2008/jul/23/solarpower.windpower","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2008-07-22T23:01:00Z","webTitle":"Solar power from Saharan sun could provide Europe's electricity, says EU","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/jul/23/solarpower.windpower","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2008/jul/23/solarpower.windpower","fields":{"headline":"Solar power from Saharan sun could provide Europe's electricity, says EU","bodyText":"A tiny rectangle superimposed on the vast expanse of the Sahara captures the seductive appeal of the audacious plan to cut Europe's carbon emissions by harnessing the fierce power of the desert sun. Dwarfed by any of the north African nations, it represents an area slightly smaller than Wales but scientists claimed yesterday it could one day generate enough solar energy to supply all of Europe with clean electricity. Speaking at the Euroscience Open Forum in Barcelona, Arnulf Jaeger-Waldau of the European commission's Institute for Energy, said it would require the capture of just 0.3% of the light falling on the Sahara and Middle East deserts to meet all of Europe's energy needs. The scientists are calling for the creation of a series of huge solar farms - producing electricity either through photovoltaic cells, or by concentrating the sun's heat to boil water and drive turbines - as part of a plan to share Europe's renewable energy resources across the continent. A new supergrid, transmitting electricity along high voltage direct current cables would allow countries such as the UK and Denmark ultimately to export wind energy at times of surplus supply, as well as import from other green sources such as geothermal power in Iceland. Energy losses on DC lines are far lower than on the traditional AC ones, which make transmission of energy over long distances uneconomic. The grid proposal, which has won political support from both Nicholas Sarkozy and Gordon Brown, answers the perennial criticism that renewable power will never be economic because the weather is not sufficiently predictable. Its supporters argue that even if the wind is not blowing hard enough in the North Sea, it will be blowing somewhere else in Europe, or the sun will be shining on a solar farm somewhere. Scientists argue that harnessing the Sahara would be particularly effective because the sunlight in this area is more intense: solar photovoltaic (PV) panels in northern Africa could generate up to three times the electricity compared with similar panels in northern Europe. Much of the cost would come in developing the public grid networks of connecting countries in the southern Mediterranean, which do not currently have the spare capacity to carry the electricity that the north African solar farms could generate. Even if high voltage cables between North Africa and Italy would be built or the existing cable between Morocco and Spain would be used, the infrastructure of the transfer countries such as Italy and Spain or Greece or Turkey also needs a major re-structuring, according to Jaeger-Waldau. Southern Mediterranean countries including Portugal and Spain have already invested heavily in solar energy and Algeria has begun work on a vast combined solar and natural gas plant which will begin producing energy in 2010. Algeria aims to export 6,000 megawatts of solar-generated power to Europe by 2020. Scientists working on the project admit that it would take many years and huge investment to generate enough solar energy from north Africa to power Europe but envisage that by 2050 it could produce 100 GW, more than the combined electricity output from all sources in the UK, with an investment of around €450bn. Doug Parr, Greenpeace UK's chief scientist, welcomed the proposals: \"Assuming it's cost-effective, a largescale renewable energy grid is just the kind of innovation we need if we're going to beat climate change.\" Jaeger-Waldau also believes that scaling up solar PV by having large solar farms could help bring its cost down for consumers. \"The biggest PV system at the moment is installed in Leipzig and the price of the installation is €3.25 per watt,\" he said. \"If we could realise that in the Mediterranean, for example in southern Italy, this would correspond to electricity prices in the range of 15 cents per kWh, something below what the average consumer is paying.\" The vision for the renewable energy grid comes as the commission's joint research centre (JRC) published its strategic energy technology plan, highlighting solar PV as one of eight technologies that need to be championed for the short- to medium-term future. \"It recognises something extraordinary - if we don't put together resources and findings across Europe and we let go the several sectors of energy, we will never reach these targets,\" said Giovanni de Santi, director of the JRC, also speaking in Barcelona. The JRC plan includes fuel cells and hydrogen, clean coal, second generation biofuels, nuclear fusion, wind, nuclear fission and smart grids. De Santi said it was designed to help Europe to meet its commitments to reduce overall energy consumption by 20% by 2020, while reducing CO² emissions by 20% in the same time and increasing to 20% the proportion of energy generated from renewable sources. Backstory High voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission lines are seen as the most efficient way to move electricity over long distances without incurring the losses experienced in alternating current (AC) power lines. HVDC cables can carry more power for the same thickness of cable compared with AC lines but are only suited to long distance transmission as they require expensive devices to convert the electricity, usually generated as AC, into DC. Modern HVDC cables can keep energy losses down to around 3% per 1,000km. HVDC can also be used to transfer electricity between different countries that might use AC at differing frequencies. HVDC cables can also be used to synchronise AC produced by renewable energy sources. · This article was amended on Thursday July 24 2008.

The world seems to be unaware of the universal corruption in Brazil under the present government (almost all the senior figures in the Workers' party who came to office with the current president have had to be replaced for various misdemeanours) and this extends into the area of environmental destruction - officials charged with preserving the rainforests are intimidated or worse. Also, the forces of law and order in that area are woefully under-equipped. An American missionary was murdered recently for working against exploitation of rainforest lands and those responsible for ordering the killing are still free. This case was publicised because the victim was American - smaller fry are murdered with equal impunity but less publicity. On September 7 we shall celebrate the country's national day, when the armed forces will parade in pomp rather than working to protect the country's wonderful natural resources against environmental looters.

The world's first solar billionaire sits at the intersection of two of the most important vectors of the 21st century - China's economic rise and the global imperative to cut carbon emissions. Since founding Suntech Power - China's largest photovoltaic manufacturer - in 2001, Shi has capitalised on a surge of environmentally driven demand in Germany, the US and elsewhere that has turned his company into a global powerhouse and made him, by some estimates, the richest man on the mainland. But that is just the start, according to the Australian-educated scientist, who predicts solar power will rival oil and coal before the end of the next decade. \"We believe that in 10 years, Suntech will be an energy giant like BP or Shell today,\" he says. \"Since we were founded, we have grown by more than 100% every year, but we still can't keep up with demand. We must grow faster.\" In an interview with the Guardian at his headquarters in an industrial estate in Wuxi, Jiangsu province, Shi cuts a confident, amiable figure. He can afford to be. The world is moving in Suntech's direction. Concerns about climate change have prodded many governments to subsidise solar energy, which is more expensive than almost any other form of power. The price gap is closing as carbon becomes more expensive and improved technology and increased capacity drives down the manufacturing cost of photovoltaic cells. Few companies are better placed to take advantage. Suntech has received generous support from the Wuxi government and it benefits from cheap labour, which accounts for 2% of the total manufacturing costs compared to 5% at the factories or rival firms overseas. Last year, Shi says Suntech overtook Sharp as the world's biggest producer of solar panels. Within three, he predicts it will also be the global leader in solar cells and solar modules. By 2010, the company's factories will churn out enough photovolataic cells per year to generate 2 gigawatts of electricity, equivalent to four new power plants. And that is before tapping the domestic market. Currently 98% of Suntech's output is exported, but Shi expects demand to grow rapidly in China once the price of solar energy falls to \"grid parity\" – effectively the cost of power generated by coal. Ambitiously, he wants to achieve this by 2012. He is advising the Chinese government on renewable energy policies. So far, they have focused on wind energy, but Shi informs the politicians change is just around the corner.\" Solar is not 10 or 20 years away, it is just five years away. I tell them: 'You have to hurry up. If you are not ready, we cannot employ solar on a massive scale.'\" More than most Chinese executives, Shi has to convince the public. Because solar is still considerably more expensive than other forms of energy, his business model relies on governments stumping up the difference. Germany, which has one of the world's most advanced policies to promote solar energy, is by far his biggest market. In China, sales are tiny, even though Suntech products will be highly visible next month during what Beijing calls \"the Green Olympics.\" The biggest constraint on the industry has traditionally been a shortage of refined silicon. But new technologies and economies of scale are changing that. Solar recently overtook the microchip industry as the main source of demand for silicon. This is pushing up prices and drawing more firms into the market. \"We believe there will be a solar boom in China very soon,\" he says. \"China is a country where once people realise, 'Gee, we have to use that,\", then things will leap forward.\" Last year, the National Development and Reform Commission, which is steering the economy, announced solar projects in 10 provinces. The ground is yet to be broken, but Shi hopes this is the start of the government involvement he has been waiting for. Technology is improving every year. Shi learned his trade in the University of New South Wales, one of the world's leading centres for photovolataic research. Costs will come down, Shi says, as solar panels convert energy from the sun more efficiently. Currently, Suntech products boasts a 17.2% efficiency rate. By 2010, Shi predicts this will rise to 20% . \"Why is this happening now. Because it is all market driven. Before, there was no demand so all the research was in the laboratory. But now there is a huge demand so the equipment has improved, the process has improved and the manufacturing efficiency has improved.\" Suntech is also working on less-efficient, but cheaper materials that can be used to coat windows and other building exteriors. It will be put into practice at the company's new headquarters - now under construction. Once completed, it is designed to be 85% self-sufficient in energy. For all his enthusiasm for solar, Shi does not expect China to shift away from its dependence on coal any time soon. Instead, he foresees a gradual rebalancing of the country's energy mix as people become more aware of the impact of global warming. Part of his mission, he says is to educate the public about climate change. \"I grew up in this part of China. When I was a kid, the temperature would fall under minus five degrees and we would have snow every year, but the last time I saw snow was in January 1988 until the freak storms this January,\" he says. \"Flights are not as tranquil as before. There is more turbulence. I think as the glaciers melt, water evaporates and there is more moisture in the air. This causes currents. Maybe one day, we won't be able to fly any more.\" The biggest obstacle to Shi's dream of creating a global energy giant is China's state-owned power companies – at least one of which is run by the son of a former Communist Party heavyweight. \"I have thought about that. It may be that we can only be a supply company. We'll see. What we hope for is a situation more like in the west, where there is fair competition. We are lobbying the government for that.\" Ultimately, though, Shi believes the elements are on his side. \"If you look at the outlook of the energy structure, there is nothing to stop us growing. There will be bumps and competition and price pressure, but sunshine is unlimited.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2009/may/27/dick-strawbridge-green-homes","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-05-27T11:25:00Z","webTitle":"Green home myths: you don't have to be wealthy or a tree hugger to make energy efficient changes to your home","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/may/27/dick-strawbridge-green-homes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/may/27/dick-strawbridge-green-homes","fields":{"headline":"Green home myths: you don't have to be wealthy or a tree hugger to make energy efficient changes to your home","bodyText":"1) Environmentally friendly installation is expensive All insulation is environmentally friendly. Some installation has better environmental credentials, but what matters is the energy it saves. There is something nice about insulating the loft with reused sheep fleece, or recycled bottles, but if the cost of the insulation is putting you off doing it don't think twice: buy the cheapest. Some stores have sold insulation as cheap as £1 a roll in the past. All insulation takes energy to make it, but that is not a reason not to invest in it. The savings, for both the planet and the bank account, can be impressive. Incidentally, you need about 270mm of insulation in your loft which is about a foot deep — anything less and you're wasting valuable heat. 2) The UK is not sunny enough for solar power For a nation that spends a lot of time talking about the weather, we don't seem to realise just how much sunshine we actually get. Maybe that's because we tend to concentrate on the negative aspects. Every square metre in the United Kingdom has on average about 1,000W of solar energy incident on it every day. That's an awful lot of free power. Without getting too technical, a 1,000-watt photovoltaic system can be expected to produce 1,200kWh a year, an average of nearly four hours working at maximum power a day. Obviously, it's much more productive in the summer, and there are lots of days when it is not frightfully impressive, however, let's not forget we do get some lovely sunny spring, autumn and winter days. Even in the winter, my home's solar thermal system (that uses the power of the sun to heat water) is capable of harnessing the weak winter sun to preheat the water in our hot water tank. 3) Wind turbines only function on hilltops I fully understand the physics and know that \"laminar\" airflow, or streamline, is what every wind turbine loves. In theory a wind turbine on a mast in the middle of a vast plain will give the best performance, but there are not too many locations that fit that bill. So we have to compromise. Most importantly, to get good performance from a wind turbine, it is necessary to have no obstacles near it that will disrupt the airflow. A built-up area with houses, hedges, and trees is a long way from the ideal location. However, if that is where you live and you want a wind turbine you don't have a lot of choice — and a turbine will still generate electricity in such a setting. 4) Most eco-renovation take decades to pay back the cost Every time we decide to make an investment in an eco-project, the subject of payback comes up. It is possible to do the sums, and before we spend any hard earned cash I like to make sure that it's a good investment. For example, loft insulation can pay for itself in two winters, and with the 2010 feed-in tariff I would expect solar PV to pay for itself in about seven or eight years, and a DIY solar thermal system to heat your hot water should have paid for itself in four or five years. But surely this is missing the point: when it comes to environmentally friendly projects we seem unable to accept the fact that it can be an investment and will add to the value of the house. What is the payback time for a new bathroom or kitchen? If you install solar photovoltaic panels you can reasonably expect them to easily last 25 to 30 years. Everyone knows a new kitchen makes a house more saleable, but in the current economic climate, how much more saleable is a house that will cost the new owners very little to run or may even generate an income? 5) DIY loft insulation is horrid and itchy It's a fair cop, installing fibreglass or rockwool insulation is not the most pleasant job in the world, but if you are installing your own loft insulation why choose fibreglass or rockwool? There are lots of alternative insulations that are very benign and easy to handle. You can now buy loft insulation that is made from high-tech composite material, recycled plastic bottles, hemp… the choice is almost limitless. Indeed, in our loft we have Thermafleece at one end (made from the fleeces of upland sheep that in the past has gone to landfill), and insulation made from recycled denim at the other. Lots of these materials are easy to lay and relatively pleasant to handle. However, we do have to face up to the fact that working in the loft is not the most pleasant of environments so, no matter what you sort of insulation you choose, you will end up being a bit sweaty and dusty! 6) It takes more energy to build a solar panel then it will ever create This particular misconception has been doing the rounds for several years. It is fair to say that it takes a lot of energy to make photovoltaic panels because it is a complex crystalline structure. Depending on the type of panel it can take between two and four years of use to recover the energy needed to make it. That said, the efficiency of the modern solar panel and modern manufacturing techniques are improving every day. There are no moving parts, so it is reasonable to expect the PV panels, which are usually guaranteed for 25 years, to last an awful lot longer (some of the older ones have been going for nearly 40 years). 7) Eco-gadgets are cons It would appear that the green revolution is a marketing man's dream. Everywhere we go there are eco-gadgets that claim to be saving the planet. Most eco-gadgets tend to be quite complicated. Wind-up and solar-powered radios, battery chargers and numerous small electronic devices, are usually marketed as being cool. It is fair to say that they are extremely useful if you do not have access to another power supply (which does not happen very often in today's world). So, if you find yourself in a situation where only an eco-gadget can save you they are definitely not a con. However, from an environmental standpoint, to justify the embodied energy it takes to produce them they have to be used a lot rather than being kept in a drawer full of other cool things. 8) You have to be an engineer to undertake your own eco home projects In the 21st century there is no excuse for not being able to get stuck into any eco-project. Information is readily available and all the materials you need can usually be sourced within 10 miles. Of course, I have to acknowledge that there is some sensible legislation that means you are not allowed to fiddle with mains electricity, or get involved with structural engineering, unless you're suitably qualified. That does not mean you can't do most of the work yourself, which is by far the cheapest way. There seems to be a certain reticence when it comes to starting a project and a lot of excuses rather than reasons out there. If you have running water and a desire to have a water wheel, all you need is to know that the angle of the bucket is 114°. With a little bit of common sense, anything is achievable."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/cifamerica/2009/mar/20/obama-organising-for-america","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2009-03-20T20:00:00Z","webTitle":"Anthony Painter: Organising for America sends Obama volunteers canvassing on behalf of his agenda","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2009/mar/20/obama-organising-for-america","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2009/mar/20/obama-organising-for-america","fields":{"headline":"The Obama army's new mission","bodyText":"In winning the English civil wars, Oliver Cromwell found himself confronting an unforeseen challenge. A number of troops in his New Model Army saw a politically more egalitarian future for the country. The Levellers, as they came to be known, insisted on a raft of political reforms and even went as far as demanding an expansion of suffrage. Cromwell responded by brutally and clinically suppressing the radicals. But the lesson was clear: arm men, give them a defining mission and you cannot completely control the consequences. Barack Obama's movement for change is a political New Model Army in our time. It's now under the auspices of the Democratic National Committee's Organising for America arm, but essentially it's the Obama '08 campaign. The 13 million or so reservists who make up the most valuable resource in US politics, the Organising for America email database, are awaiting a new mission. It's been four long months since they've seen action, and that is just too long for this battle-hungry horde. There's not yet much sign of mutiny – but still, the decision to call them into action in support of the president's budget comes not a moment too soon. There has been much debate about what to do with the millions of Americans who donated a few dollars, gave their time, submitted their contact details, held house parties, knocked on doors in their neighbourhoods and shovelled voters into polling places across the nation on 4 November 2008. Should they just be kept in deep storage until the next congressional or even presidential election? Could they form some new cadre of civic activists working to change their communities? Or should they be deployed to both communicate the president's agenda and persuade members of Congress to support it? It is this latter course that has now been taken. President Obama's budget proposals are highly controversial, as headlines proclaim an eye-watering budget deficit that comes in at 12.3% of GDP in 2009. It's because the administration is nothing if not ambitious: the major elements of Obama's plans include a 14% reduction in greenhouse gases on 2005 levels by 2020 through a cap and trade emissions system, and massive investments for wind and solar energy. Taxes will be reduced for the middle classes, and George Bush's tax cuts for the wealthy will expire. The administration also plans to build a reserve fund of $600bn or so to reform healthcare – and education is due some major investment as well. The sheer ambition and scale of the budget mean it is destined for a rocky political ride through Congress. It's not just the nay-saying Republicans – targets of a new ad from Americans United for Change – who will take issue with the scope and cost of these plans. Moderate and conservative Democrats, the so-called Blue Dogs who number 47 in the House of Representatives, will also raise some eyebrows. If they join House Republicans, the budget could fail. Democratic representative Allen Boyd Jr of Florida has already said he expects spending to be reduced overall by the time the budget passes through Congress. In the Senate, too, a unanimous vote of Democratic lawmakers is far from assured. It is because of this political context that the Obama team has turned once more to their movement. Organising for America has asked its members to go door to door this weekend to explain the budget's provisions and to get people to pledge their support for the measures. For sitting congressmen facing re-election in 2010, the message \"Your voters are behind this!\" will need to be delivered clearly, by large numbers of people, in order to be effective. After all, sitting congressmen are still made nervous remembering the 2006 primary defeat of Connecticut senator Joe Lieberman. Though he went on to win re-election that year, Lieberman had to run as an independent after being deposed by Ned Lamont, whose run was fuelled by anti-Iraq war activists. The administration's budget doesn't feel like an Iraq war-type issue. But who would want to risk facing a wave of opposition after being seen as an obstacle to the Obama presidency? There is a degree of posturing in all of this – and if Organising for America goes too far, it will seriously hamper White House-Congress relations. That would be a disaster, and would end up splitting the Democrats in Congress – an even greater disaster. Still, some popular energy could make many members of Congress more inclined to negotiate. The pollster Stanley Greenberg recently emphasised the \"transactional\" instincts of the White House chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, who will need as many members of Congress to be in a deal-making mood as possible to get the budget passed. That is where Organising for America comes in. So at last the Obama reservists have a new mission. That should avert a Cromwell-esque mutiny-suppression moment for the new president. But isn't there something to be said for a little mutiny? There is a civic energy pent up in 13 million people who have actively engaged in the political process in the last year. Imagine what they could do in 13 million micro ways in each of their communities across America. Now imagine how that could improve neighbourhoods and cities in individually small but, once added up, major ways. It is fine for Obama to use this reserve army to communicate and press for his agenda. The real gain, though, would come from challenging these active citizens to initiate the \"change\" Obama seeks. In other words, there is something to be said for being a Cromwell in reverse: support the Levellers, and the change will be more enduring."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/blog/2008/oct/09/greenwatch.environment","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2008-10-09T12:05:35Z","webTitle":"Greenwatch: Sochi venues relocated to minimize eco-impact of Russia's 2014 Olympics","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2008/oct/09/greenwatch.environment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/blog/2008/oct/09/greenwatch.environment","fields":{"headline":"Greenwatch: Sochi venues relocated to minimise impact of Russian Olympics","bodyText":"Some venues relocated to minimise eco-impact of Russia's 2014 Olympics Source: Grist Final venues have been approved for the 2014 Winter Olympic Games in Sochi, Russia.

You sir, over there, from the power company - look at this lovely tonne of freshly made, sulphur-rich carbon dioxide. Last summer it cost an eyewatering €31 to throw up your smokestack, but in our give-away global recession sale, that's been slashed to a crazy €8.20. Dump plans for the wind turbine! Compare our offer with costly solar energy! At this low, low price you can't afford not to burn coal!\" Set up to price pollution out of existence, carbon trading is pricing it back in. Europe's carbon markets are in collapse. Yet the hiss of escaping gas is almost inaudible. There's no big news headline, nothing sensational for TV viewers to watch; no queues outside banks or missing Texan showmen. You can't see or hear a market for a pollutant tumble. But at stake is what was supposed to be a central lever in the world's effort to turn back climate change. Intended to price fossil fuels out of the market, the system is instead turning them into the rational economic choice. That there exists something called carbon trading is about all that most people know. A few know, too, that Europe has created carbon exchanges, and traders who buy and sell. Few but the professionals, however, know that this market is now failing in its purpose: to edge up the cost of emitting CO2. The theory sounded fine in the boom years, back when Nicholas Stern described climate change as \"the biggest market failure in history\" - a market failure to which carbon trading was meant to be a market solution. Instead, it's bolstering the business case for fossil fuels. Understanding why is easy. A year ago European governments allocated a limited number of carbon emission permits to their big polluters. Businesses that reduce pollution are allowed to sell spare permits to ones that need more. As demand outstrips this capped supply, and the price of permits rises, an incentive grows to invest in green energy. Why buy costly permits to keep a coal plant running when you can put the cash into clean power instead? All this only works as the carbon price lifts. As with 1924 Château Lafite or Damian Hirst's diamond skulls, scarcity and speculation create the value. If permits are cheap, and everyone has lots, the green incentive crashes into reverse. As recession slashes output, companies pile up permits they don't need and sell them on. The price falls, and anyone who wants to pollute can afford to do so. The result is a system that does nothing at all for climate change but a lot for the bottom lines of mega-polluters such as the steelmaker Corus: industrial assistance in camouflage. \"I don't know why industrials would miss this opportunity,\" said one trader last week. \"They are using it to compensate for the tightening of credit and the slowdown, to pay for redundancies.\" A lot of the blame lies with governments that signed up to carbon trading as a neat idea, but then indulged polluters with luxurious quantities of permits. The excuse was that growth would soon see them bumping against the ceiling. Instead, exchanges are in meltdown: a tonne of carbon has dropped to about €8, down from last year's summer peak of €31 and far below the €30-€45 range at which renewables can compete with fossil fuels. The lesson of the carbon slump, like the credit crunch, is that markets can be a conduit, but not a substitute, for political will. They only work when properly primed and regulated. Europe hoped that the mere creation of a carbon market would drive everyone away from fossil fuels. It forgot that demand had to outstrip supply, and that if growth stops, demand drops too. There is not much time to rescue the system. Carbon trading remains at the heart of the international response to climate change. Obama backs what Americans call cap and trade. Australia wants to try the same thing. It should be at the heart of a deal at the Copenhagen summit this winter. But both are hesitating, given Europe's mess. The market must be unashamedly rigged to force supply below demand. The obvious way would be to cut the number of permits in circulation, but in a recession no government will be brave enough to do that. And private initiatives such as Sandbag, which encourages individuals to buy and lock away permits, can exert little pressure on price in a market awash with them. Europe can choke off tomorrow's supply, however, without hitting business today. First the EU must stop importing permits from countries such as Russia - a bonus for a paper transaction. No one really believes that 15m tonnes of imported permits will not still be emitted by a steelworks somewhere east of Novosibirsk. Second, it must publish plans to crack down on the surplus of permits when the recession is over.

In a programme tinged with environmentally friendly initiatives, the US president-elect has set a new target of creating or safeguarding 3m jobs, up from a previous aim of 2.5m, by unleashing an avalanche of government spending and offering widespread tax rebates. The Obama camp indicated that the package would be worth between $675bn and $775bn, easily eclipsing other packages unveiled in China, Japan and Britain. The cash will include programmes to transmit wind and solar energy across America and to put millions of medical records into digital format. Obama's vice-president elect, Joe Biden, yesterday said the stimulus was the \"single most important thing\" facing the new administration and warned that action was needed to prevent the economy from \"absolutely tanking\". \"The economy is in much worse shape than we thought it was in,\" Biden told ABC television. \"We've got to begin to stem this bleeding, stop the loss of jobs and create new jobs.\" Some 1.9m US jobs have been lost this year and Obama's aides have briefed him that as many as 4m could be at risk, which would take the unemployment rate to 9%. Quoting transition officials, the New York Times said Obama's team feared that the downturn could eclipse anything in the last 50 years. At a brainstorming session held in the basement of the Capitol building on Friday, Obama's economic team grappled with ways to address the subprime mortgage crisis, the credit crunch and a slump in consumer spending that has left shopping centres strikingly quiet this Christmas. Among the proposals is the creation of a smart power grid to broaden the transmission of wind and solar power. A limitation of green power generation is that wind farms and large-scale solar panels are easier to site in remote areas, leaving a challenge in taking energy to centres of population. Biden said such a project would create tens of thousands of jobs and would have long-term benefits. He said \"every major economist\", from left to right on the political spectrum, agreed that \"direct government spending now is the best way to infuse economic growth\". When pressed on the short-term risk of inflating America's trillion-dollar budget deficit, Biden said: \"There is no short run other than keeping the economy from absolutely tanking. That's the only short run.\" Other specific commitments include putting all US medical records online - which would involve a substantial investment but would create long-term savings estimated at $78bn annually. Economists agree that the immediate outlook is dismal. The US economy is expected to shrink by at least 4% in the final quarter of the year and figures out this week are likely to show a 0.7% drop in monthly high street spending, according to a survey by Bloomberg. Although it will include some $150bn in tax relief for people on low and middle incomes, the Obama administration's emphasis on spending marks a shift from the approach of George Bush, who tried to stimulate the economy over the summer simply by sending out millions of tax rebate cheques. Critics contend that Obama's proposals risk setting off an unseemly flood of political grasping for a share in the money.

The technique uses transparent dyes to capture, concentrate and redirect light along the surface of the glass to photovoltaic (PV) cells in the frame, which convert the light into electricity. The breakthrough means that there is a tenfold increase in power output compared to use of the PV cell alone. The team, from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), claims the technology could slash the cost of generating electricity from sunlight, making it more competitive with standard grid power. This is because the expensive PV cells only need to be installed at the sides of the panels, rather than across the whole surface. Sunlight is concentrated in existing solar power devices using large, mobile mirrors that track the sun as it moves across the sky. But these can be expensive to deploy and maintain. In the MIT device, called an \"organic solar concentrator\" and described in the latest issue of Science, the researchers painted a mixture of organic dyes onto the surface of a pane of glass. The dyes trap different wavelengths of sunlight and then guide the energy along the glass towards the PV cells at the edges. \"The point of all this is to get away with using far fewer solar cells,\" said Marc Baldo, an electrical engineer at MIT. \"The concentrator collects light over its whole front surface, but the solar cells need only cover the area of the edges.\" As the edges of a glass panel can often be 100 times smaller in area than the surface itself, he added, solar panels would need 100 times fewer PV cells to collect the same energy. \"So we can save money. Since industry can't produce enough solar cells to satisfy demand, this might also be a good way to stretch production.\" As well as windows, the technique can be applied to standard solar panels on roofs and walls to improve their efficiency. \"We think the technology should cost less than $1 per watt [to build]\", said Baldo. The MIT device is relatively simple to manufacture and researchers claim it could be commercially available within three years. Martyn Berry, senior research and development engineer at solar-energy company Solarcentury, said the biggest challenge for PV technology was to make it competitive with standard electricity.\"The notion that we could see a tenfold reduction on the cost of PV technologies through the use of organic solar concentrators is certainly exciting. Current concentrator technology is not generally suitable for the mass market.\" Baldo said any transparent material could be used as the concentrator. \"In the window application you'd probably design the window for 10% transmission [of light]. The remaining 90% is captured and used to generate electricity.\" A more immediate use of the concentrator technology would be to coat the conventional solar panels used on the roofs of buildings, to boost their light collecting ability. \"We saw approximately 30% higher performance in the combined system compared to a stand alone solar cell,\" said Baldo. \"We think that ultimately this approach will allow us to nearly double the performance of existing solar cells for minimal added cost.\" A similar method to concentrate solar energy was developed in the 1970s. But the system, which painted dyes onto plastic surfaces, was abandoned because it could not collect enough of the sunlight and much of the retransmitted light was absorbed and lost as it travelled through the material to the PV cells. To make their breakthrough, Baldo's team used advances originally developed to improve lasers and organic light-emitting diodes. By using the newer dyes in carefully chosen ratios and applying it only to the surface of a glass panel, the scientists were able to more accurately control how much light was absorbed and transported across it. \"We made it so the light can travel a much longer distance,\" said Jonathan Mapel of MIT, who also worked on the solar concentrator. Greenpeace's chief scientist, Doug Parr, said: \"Innovations like this show renewable technologies can take a quantum leap forward if given proper financial support from governments. Rather than betting the farm on outdated nuclear technology and hoping that coal will one day be 'clean', Gordon Brown should be creating green jobs and pushing at the real technological frontier of the 21st century - renewables.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2008/nov/20/us-economy-cars","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2008-11-20T00:01:00Z","webTitle":"Carmaker bosses cling to their jets but could lose their aid","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/nov/20/us-economy-cars","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2008/nov/20/us-economy-cars","fields":{"headline":"Carmaker bosses cling to their jets but could lose their aid","bodyText":"Shares in US carmakers tumbled yesterday as it looked like the industry would lose its attempt to secure a $25bn (£16.6bn) bail-out from Congress. GM's stock had fallen more than 15% by midday and Ford had dropped 25% as both companies joined the privately held Chrysler to plead for help averting bankruptcy. The battle over aid had been due to reach a Congressional vote yesterday, but insufficient political support appeared to be forcing a postponement Harry Reid, the Democratic Senate leader, pinned responsibility for the industry's fate on the Bush treasury department rather than Congress. \"Although I hope we can pass legislation to aid the auto industry this week, no one should be overly concerned if we are unable to reach agreement to do so,\" Reid said. If there is no rescue this week it could undermine shares in the Detroit carmakers even further, with uncertainty also gripping parts suppliers, dealers and other sectors reliant on the health of the three motor companies. US auto sales support nearly 250,000 jobs and about 4% of US gross domestic product. As the chief executives of GM, Ford, and Chrysler begged Congress for aid for the second successive day, Republicans pressed for the release of $25bn in already approved loans to Detroit - although that cash was intended to help the motor industry produce cleaner vehicles. Democrats are resisting that compromise as they believe it would weaken Detroit's ability to adapt to new fuel-efficiency standards. However, those from the mid-west states, where a carmaker collapse would hit the hardest, are calling for a quick cash injection with little concern for specifics. \"Are we going to permit a difference over the source of funds for these loans to destroy an opportunity to help an industry so essential to this economy?\" asked Carl Levin, a Democratic senator from Michigan. Some on Capitol Hill have suggested a compromise that would divert the $25bn to carmakers until Barack Obama takes office next year. The companies would then be required to refund those loans once they recover, even though the economic crisis could forestall that event indefinitely. The three carmakers' chief executives have faced heavy criticism for their performance at this week's congressional hearings, where they resisted accepting any blame for difficulties they attributed entirely to the evaporation of credit markets. The executives were also condemned in the press for flying private jets to Washington to ask for public money. When asked by Democratic congressman Brad Sherman to raise their hands if they would sell their company jets to prevent bankruptcy, none of the three did so. \"I don't know how I go back to my constituents and say, 'The auto industry has changed,'\" Sherman said. The companies have also faced calls to sell off overseas assets. But GM shrugged off a surprise approach for its German subsidiary, Opel. The solar energy company SolarWorld said it was prepared to offer €1bn (£840m) for Opel, which employs 25,000 workers in Germany, adding that it aimed to turn Opel into Europe's first green car company. SolarWorld said it wanted Opel to be separated completely from its US parent and would pay €250m in cash and another €750m in bank credit lines guaranteed by the German government. GM Europe was dismissive. \"This is pure speculation. Opel is not for sale,\" said a spokesman. Opel is seeking €1bn in possible aid from the German government because of the threat that it could be caught up in the fall-out from the US. Calls are also mounting for a broader plan to help the European automotive industry. The problems facing the industry will be discussed at a European summit next month."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2008/dec/01/aviation-environment-letters","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2008-12-01T00:01:00Z","webTitle":"Letters: Aviation claims on another planet","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/dec/01/aviation-environment-letters","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2008/dec/01/aviation-environment-letters","fields":{"headline":"Aviation claims on another planet","bodyText":"Even though the headline (Climate change watchdog backs expansion of Heathrow, November 27) is not borne out by the statement in the text that Lord Turner's words were \"not an endorsement of the plans\", it's still worrying that he seems to believe that the continued growth of aviation is consistent with ever-tightening climate change targets. It certainly isn't. Even before the Heathrow third runway, which would increase flight movements by 50%, the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research worked out what aviation growth of 6.4% a year - its average through the 1990s - would mean for greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. It concluded that the total CO2 discharges from UK air traffic would offset all the reductions in carbon emissions from all other UK sources. Even if all the latter were reduced to zero, Britain would still miss its climate change targets massively. Anyway, if the principle that the \"polluter pays\" is to apply, why should the super-polluter with the fastest-growing emissions be given exemption, or favourable treatment, if that means everyone else has to be doubly penalised in order to compensate? Moreover, aviation's nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions are even more serious. They already exceed the limits set by EU directives, and if a third runway is built at Heathrow it will be impossible for the airline industry to meet the NOx targets by January 2015, when the European commission can enforce compliance - if necessary by closing down the third runway. The idea that the industry, or the Climate Change Committee, can somehow slide round the inevitability of much tougher regulatory compliance is pure fantasy. Michael Meacher MP Former environment minister Adair Turner must be on another planet - one with some hitherto undiscovered continents - if he thinks agrofuels can enable aviation to expand and make 80% emission cuts. According to the Gallagher review, projected global land demand until 2020 for food/feed and surface transport agrofuel targets are 200-500 million hectares (Mha) and 73-276 Mha respectively. Boeing recently said it was planning a 30% agrofuel mix as a transition to an eventual 100% mix: using similar calculations, 30% agrofuels in aviation at current levels would require 42-140 Mha of land by 2020. Recent best estimates for available land are 250-390 Mha; a considerable amount of this land is already used and is essential to indigenous peoples and pastoralists. It is vital too for biodiversity. The demands above are not the total \"agro/bio-economy\" as they ignore other land-intensive policies for biogas and biomass energy, but they total 315-916 Mha and indicate that current policies are rapidly taking us to a land crunch. Something has to give, and it will be planet and people, as these massive land grabs would come with huge greenhouse gas emissions from indirect land use change, much greater than any \"savings\" from the agrofuels, and billions of people in the south will suffer from land eviction and food insecurity. Dr Andrew Boswell Norwich, Norfolk Chris Goodall (G2, November 27) claims it is a myth that climate change means we need more organic agriculture, but rests his case on two new myths. First that we have inexhaustible supplies of oil and gas to produce artificial nitrogen to fuel non-organic farming, and second that we can carry on farming without reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80%. It is no myth that we have to use solar energy instead of oil to grow food, so all farming and food will be organic in future. In most of the world organic produces as much or more food, and in rich countries we will have to eat less grain-fed meat, and more vegetables, fruit, grains and pulses. Goodall's suggestion that \"the richer half of the world's population\" can eat more meat flies in the face of all expert opinion. But he is right to support the use of biochar (stable carbon formed from burning plants and wood without air) to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and sequester additional carbon from the air into the soil. The use of biochar and compost in organic farming will help feed the world's poorest people and sequester carbon, but you need the healthy, biologically active soils of organic farming for these techniques to work well.

And I'm all in favour of cutting 10% off our carbon. And of domestic solar panels. Anything that slows our consumption is useful. But ultimately I don't really think the bottle bank is going to get us out of this. And being virtuous is not going to get us out of it either. Civilisation is going to need another energy source.\" McEwan's own view – having been persuaded by thinkers such as Stewart Brand, and despite his own long-held suspicions of the industry – is that nuclear energy is probably our best bet in the medium term. Michael Beard, Nobel prize-winning physicist, glutton and the protagonist of McEwan's latest novel, Solar, has an even more technologically complex solution. His work in the field of artificial photosynthesis as a way of harnessing the sun's power has made him rich and famous. Beard got his Nobel for \"modifying Einstein's photovoltaics\", and McEwan enthusiastically explains that the bleeding-edge science in the book is real, if some way from practical application. \"If you go to America the amount of ingenuity being deployed, and the private capital – until this present recession – being invested in nanotechnology and solar energy is astonishing.\" For McEwan science is the road not taken, and he talks slightly enviously about his geneticist son's work and training. At the age of 16 he \"agonised\" at school over the arts or science route. \"My maths was actually pretty mediocre, but I did love science and eventually even 'got' calculus, although I always felt if I so much as sneezed I would probably lose it again. But having a sense of awe that Leibniz could dream such things up, and other people could understand them, was very important to me. In the end I chose literature, but science has been a part of my life for just as long.\" It has become something of a commonplace to say that while McEwan's early novels exhibited a slight new-agey tinge that reflected the times, his more recent work is underpinned by a greater sense of rationalism in general and science in particular. But those closest to him see far more continuity. Timothy Garton Ash, a friend and confidant for 30 years, says \"the idea put about of the young Ian being open to mysticism and the like, as opposed to the hard-edged scientific rationalist of today, is just nonsense. He's always been supremely rational and both politically interested and engaged. As a novelist he has always been a matchless observer of the complexities of personal relationships, and also an intellectual and political writer. There is a play of ideas that runs through all the books.\" While McEwan's early work focused on strange sexual and psychological manoeuvrings, since the early 80s he has consciously engaged with both historical and contemporary events and has found himself being slowly co-opted into the position of our de facto national novelist, with all the praise and opprobrium that can bring. \"When I began I thought that literature was contained within a bubble that somehow floated above the world commented upon by newspapers. But I became more and more interested in trying to include some of that world within my work.\" His first attempt to break out of the \"rather claustrophobic fiction\" he had been writing in the 70s and early 80s was his 1985 screenplay, The Ploughman's Lunch, which featured a journalist writing about Suez at the time of the Falklands war. That led \"pretty directly\" to The Child in Time (1987) in which the story of a missing child is refracted through both science and domestic politics. Although he now says he thinks \"the least successful elements in that were its animadversions against Mrs Thatcher\", his path had been diverted and he began to deal with pressing political issues, such as the Iraq war and, now, climate change. \"It's good to get your hands dirty a bit and to test how you see things at a given point. And it's very pleasing after writing something like Atonement or On Chesil Beach, which are historical, to get involved in some plausible re-enactment of the here and now. Maybe duty is too heavy a word for it. But it certainly becomes very attractive to bring a novel into the present.\" A few work-in-progress readings and public hints over the past couple of years revealed that Solar was not only going to be \"about\" climate change, but would also be a comedy. \"I actually find novels that are determined to be funny at every turn quite oppressive,\" he explains. \"But comedy in a more general sense, yes. It lets you play round at the edges of realism. You can be a little more breezy, slightly push the boat out on plot, be slightly less sober in evaluations of the possible.\" The genesis of the book was McEwan's journey to the Arctic circle in 2005 with a mixed group of scientists and artists to witness climate change at first hand. \"I adored that trip,\" he says. \"While the sculptors and painters did their thing, I just hiked around with whoever would come with me.\" Walking the frozen fjords with Antony Gormley he discussed landscape and imagination. At dinner there was \"idealistic conversation about how we had to be different in our relations with government\". But just the other side of the door from the living quarters was a boot room. \"It was chaos. There was no malice, but people were careless and would inadvertently borrow each other's stuff. Clothes and equipment there to save our lives, which we should have been able to look after very easily, would go missing, and I thought, for all the fine words and good intentions, maybe there was a comic inadequacy in human nature in dealing with this problem.\" Copenhagen confirmed his fears. \"It was unprecedented for world leaders to be summoned by science. But it resulted in disarray and conflict with elements of Whitehall farce. So I thought that if I ever did get round to this project, I would want to write about a very flawed guy. Someone hopeless, or hopelessly self-interested.\" McEwan put the idea aside while he finished Saturday, wrote On Chesil Beach and completed the libretto to his and Michael Berkeley's opera, For You. But he was still thinking about the Arctic in 2007 when he was invited to a symposium of Nobel laureates discussing climate change in Potsdam. \"I got rather caught up in the grandeur of Nobel prizewinners. To have so many in one place was quite something. All formidably clever and grand, and legends in their own minds. My climate change man would have a Nobel prize.\" That McEwan should be addressing symposia of Nobel-winning scientists at all illustrates just how steep his career trajectory has been. In hindsight, winning the Booker prize for Amsterdam in 1998 was just a staging post. The global success of his next novel, Atonement, especially in America, saw him enter that rare territory of the literary novelist who finds himself troubling the end-of-year sales charts. Such success, and the fame that has come with it, has not always made for a comfortable life. Stories about him became front-page news. Family matters such as a distressingly messy custody battle with his first wife or the appearance of a brother he never knew he had were glibly characterised as being \"something from an Ian McEwan novel\". His visa problems entering the United States were reported in more than 400 newspapers. As with many successful writers, shaky plagiarism allegations have surfaced, resulting in the reclusive Thomas Pynchon breaking cover to defend him. Comments defending his old friend Martin Amis from charges of racism saw McEwan's own views on Islam put in the dock, and on the blogosphere he can attract a rancorously toxic claque. He has inflicted some of these experiences – \"a few of mine, some of Martin's, some things I've observed from afar\" – on Beard, who also finds himself at the eye of press storm. \"When you're in it, it feels like a gale is blowing through your house,\" he explains. \"But then suddenly it all moves on and you almost feel bereft. What do you do now? It's not funny at the time, but when it blows over it just seems absurd.\" Professor Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, a physicist and chief climate adviser to the German government, headed by Angela Merkel, herself also a physicist, was the man who invited McEwan to Potsdam. They first met at a joint artist/scientist seminar in Oxford in 2004. \"We had a very long chat about the climate problem. Back then I think he was cautious as to whether artists could play a role at all, but he was warming up to the subject. When I organised the Nobel Cause symposium I was delighted to have him there. He really wants to understand how physics works and gave a wonderful talk. And he does love to talk about equations and theories and so on, which is very unusual for a writer. They usually think it is cool to know nothing about science. Being a complete ignoramus somehow makes them feel dignified. But Ian is completely different.\" McEwan was born in Aldershot in 1948 into an army family. His childhood included spells living in Germany, the far east and Libya, which the Amis-Islam row led him to recall with \"only warm memories of a dignified, tolerant and hospitable Islamic culture\". At his boarding school he was absorbed by music – from blues and jazz to Bach – as well as science and literature. His tastes may have been conservative enough – Shelley, Keats and Wordsworth, then Graham Greene and Iris Murdoch – but it was enough to set up \"the classic alienation, which I made a bit of a mess of\". Both his parents had left school at 14 and, while they were \"kind and encouraging, they just weren't engaged in the things I was interested in, and so I ended up becoming moody about not being able to speak to anyone about Middlemarch at home. You don't want to be too hard on your younger self, but I probably was a bit intolerable and didn't realise until years later that there are lots of people who never read poems or novels or listen to Bach, who are just as compassionate and discerning beings as those who do. But aged 18 I had a problem about meeting people who hadn't read The Waste Land. What could I possibly say to them?\" In 1967 McEwan went to the University of Sussex to read English. There, an innovative course saw him exposed to a new road map of the modern European mind that led from Virgil and Dante through to Kafka and Bruno Schulz. \"By my second year, my nice orientation of the English literature canon had all gone and I became drawn into a much more tangled, chaotic and wilder set of books and imaginations. That was the point I wanted to join in.\" A \"terrible\" play soon emerged – \"sort of a religious allegory\" – the manuscript of which unexpectedly turned up a few months ago and which he swears will never see the light of day. There was also a long \"Yeatsian\" poem and some short stories that have not survived. Determined not to have a proper job after having seen the civil service pay scale chart from entry level to retirement age, he spotted a new MA course at the University of East Anglia that allowed for the substitution of one module with a piece of original fiction. He phoned and was put straight through to Malcolm Bradbury. \"I'd read a couple of his books and I was amazed that he was on the end of the line. But the world was emptier then. It seemed there was a limited amount of people on the planet, and you really could phone them all up.\" Despite having comparatively little contact with Bradbury, or his other supervisor, Angus Wilson, McEwan says he had \" a pretty amazing year\" in which he wrote 30 short stories. \"I just had the time and space to write some stories that would be read by someone, even though they would just say, 'That's great, carry on.' There was none of the stuff that happens now, where kids get their stuff read by other kids. That can be quite ruthless and I'm not sure I would have survived it.\" After completing the course, McEwan set out on the hippy trail overland to Afghanistan. \"Which was fantastic. But there came a point in the back of this bus, driving across desert tracks, with the sun beating down everywhere, when I began to dream of a tiny whitewashed room in Norwich where the skies were grey and there weren't flies and beggars.\" Recognition came soon after his return home, with the journal New American Review taking an early story – \"Homemade\", about teenage incest – and paying McEwan $400, \"which could keep you for months\". More significant than the money was his appearance on the cover of the magazine, alongside Philip Roth, Susan Sontag and Günter Grass. \"It is still the most exciting moment of my publishing life,\" he says. \"All the other good moments were just versions of it. Seeing my name alongside these legendary figures was like passing through a mirror.\" Jonathan Raban, a friend from the Norwich days, remembers what a coup it was for McEwan to sell his story. \"I'd never met anyone who seemed, at least on the surface, so confident of his own take on the world and what he was doing. I remember him once saying that he had just finished a short story so was going to take six weeks off. I'd never heard a freelance writer say that before. But he knew the rhythm of his writing life even then and didn't seem to be in the usual state of neurosis about his vocation.\" McEwan moved to London and began to make his way in a literary world subsidised, unexpectedly, by the Radio Times, which acted like \"an unofficial arts council. They paid extraordinarily well and employed lots of impecunious young writers to provide previews of costume dramas.\" He lived in a room in a \"rather wonderful house in Stockwell, which was quite a druggie scene. But I was still quite monkish in my habits. I loved marijuana, but never wrote on it. I'd hang out with friends and watch movies or listen to music, but not write. I was always very clear on that.\" The other two axes of his literary life were \"Martin and Julian\" at the New Statesman, and the Pillars of Hercules pub in Soho, home of Ian Hamilton's New Review. \"I sort of had my 60s in the 70s. I had some wild times with Martin. It was a very free and amusing time and nearly all the literary friends I have now I met then. I imagine there's a group of young people meeting in a similar way in Stoke Newington now. I hope so, anyway.\" Writing as a career was from the very beginning \"an ideal life. It was endlessly changing. Everything you wrote was a new beginning.\" His early story collections and novels, First Love, Last Rites (1975), Between the Sheets (1978), The Cement Garden (1978), were met with acclaim, and the epithet \"a new voice\" was for once accurate. McEwan says he saw himself in a tradition that included William Burroughs, Jean Genet, the brothel scenes from Ulysses and Lady Chatterley's Lover. \"There was plenty behind me to make me feel that what had to be really radical in literature was the content, not the style. What was named was more important to me than playing games. I did know about things like BS Johnson and those other novels published by Calder books, but I thought then, as now, that Finnegans Wake was a heroic charge up a cul-de-sac that saved everyone else the trouble. However brilliant it is, it showed that finally literature has to communicate in some sort of immediate way.\" Raban says McEwan's successful progression from the short story to novel was not a given. \"In his early novels, the first chapter, rather infamously, was just about perfect in that it was condensed like a brilliant short story. The novel afterwards then seemed to rework those threads. But he developed that long memory of the novelist, and the more recent books have overwhelmed me with their sense of architecture. He has become the best realist novelist alive. He's always been able to observe the world very closely and astutely, and the work is saturated with precise and particular detail. For me Ian will never be divorceable from that measured, wide-eye blink he takes at the world. He has a readiness to be surprised by anything that happens.\" While some of his early work had excited mild controversy, he got his first taste of a proper scandal when his 1979 television play, Solid Geometry, which featured a pickled penis in a jar, was banned. \"It was a bit embarrassing because I got a flood of invitations to speak about censorship and share a platform with eastern European dissidents. I never thought my case was even remotely like theirs. That was my first run-in with elements of the left who claimed we lived in a police state, which I didn't really buy.\" He categorised himself as part of the \"anti-totalitarian left and was always aware of the daftness of people who thought there was anything good to be said about the Soviet Union\". He visited eastern bloc countries with EP Thompson as part of the European Nuclear Disarmament movement. \"We were there to help Russian anti-nuclear dissidents who were critical of the Soviet military-industrial complex. But I had discussions there that really threw my politics. These wonderful, brave people would be telling me how marvellous Mrs Thatcher was for standing up to the Soviet Union. I was entrenched in my loathing of Mrs Thatcher, so it was unsettling. I suppose it's the sort of thing I should re-examine at some stage, as these things do become a habit. But while life did get easier in Britain in the 1980s, I still don't feel any great affection for her.\" McEwan says that although Solar may be about climate change, we shouldn't forget that it is a novel. \"The best way to tell people about climate change is through non-fiction. There's a vast literature of outstanding writing on the subject. But what I wanted to get across is a sense of how difficult this task is going to be. That said, and even after Copenhagen, I remain optimistic. The decline of oil production and its rising price, which will be very painful, will push us a bit. I also think people are much more adaptable and flexible than governments think. And then there's the new technology. Who knows, maybe mine and Michael Beard's lofty dreams of artificial photosynthesis, which is not impossible, might yet save us all.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2008/jul/10/news.culture1","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2008-07-10T09:20:26Z","webTitle":"World's first eco-club hits London","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/jul/10/news.culture1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2008/jul/10/news.culture1","fields":{"headline":"World's first eco-club hits London","bodyText":"Tonight in London, dancers may power a nightclub by dancing alone. And Jade Jagger will be there, bobbing her head along. It's all part of Surya, which claims to be \"the world's first ecological club\" - a King's Cross discotheque that sees green as the new black. Not only that, it's a club so environmentally sustainable that it will donate electricity to its neighbours. That, at least, is what Surya's owners are claiming. The whole thing will be put to the test as the \"eco-disco\" launches in Islington tonight. Jade Jagger, Dan Williams, Queens of Noize and Nathan Detroit are among the DJs who will appear, while a mysterious Dr Earth will present a 10-point environmental \"manifesto\" for the world's nightclubs. Coldcut have meanwhile promised an ecologically-themed AV set. \"Each week millions upon millions of exuberant human beings head out of their houses and into nightclubs to expend large amounts of energy on the dancefloor,\" Dr Earth said in a statement. \"[But] clubbing remains one of the few areas of society untouched by the green message.\" According to its statement, Surya is powered by sustainable energy - in particular, wind and sun power - and, in fact, generates enough electricity to pass on to its immediate neighbours. Besides solar-energy panels, a wind turbine, waterless urinals, low-flush toilets and eco-friendly air-conditioning units, Surya also boasts a high-tech alternative energy dancefloor. It will, the club says, use \"materials such as quartz crystals, ceramics, cutting-edge technology and the dancing motion of clubbers to generate part of the club's energy requirements\".

We'd certainly be happy if the answer to the world's environmental crisis is just a whole lot of boogieing down."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"society/2009/apr/08/interview-bill-thomas","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2009-04-07T23:01:00Z","webTitle":"Bill Thomas on his mission to transform care homes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2009/apr/08/interview-bill-thomas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2009/apr/08/interview-bill-thomas","fields":{"headline":"New age of enlightenment","bodyText":"The twinkling eyes, full-on fuzz of beard and good-humoured, impassioned conversation are reminiscent of Hollywood actor Robin Williams in full messianic mode. But Bill Thomas is no actor. He is a charismatic social entrepreneur and Harvard-educated authority on geriatric medicine and elder care. And his mission is to save us all from an old age blighted by the tedium, loneliness and over-medication that he says sums up much conventional \"care\". His Eden Alternative, a global not-for-profit organisation that teaches how to de-institutionalise care homes, was established in 1991. It has 15,000 affiliate trainers covering the UK, Europe, Australia and Japan, with close on 300 care homes having been given the Eden treatment. The organisation's motto is \"eliminating loneliness, helplessness and boredom\" - a message that couldn't be more timely, with a report out yesterday from the newly-merged older people's charity, Age Concern and Help the Aged, highlighting the isolation, poverty and lack of care and support facing millions of older people in the UK. Thomas, who qualified from Harvard as a medical doctor, has just visited the UK to share ideas with policymakers and the care industry, as a guest of the Anchor Trust, the largest not-for-profit provider of housing, support and care in England. But is it really possible to transform care, however well-intentioned, into some leafy gerontopia? There is a pause before Thomas responds passionately: \"It's not impossible. What's happening is the greatest ageing adventure in the history of humankind. The old are succeeding as they never have before. But here's the kicker: we have got to invent a new old age. The baby boomer generation aren't going to sit still and accept the sort of 19th-century elder care around now. In years to come, people will compare the way we care for the old to the way we look at the slave trade.\" But the size of the task is daunting. In the UK, for example, it is predicted that there will be 15 million over-65s by 2030 - outnumbering teenagers two to one. And as western society ages, more and more people will be diagnosed with dementia. So where do we start? The Thomas approach begins by changing the minds of care managers. He says: \"I don't deal with bad people, I deal with bad systems. You need to change the relationship between management and staff. Too often, management is focused on tasks that they feel need to be done, almost losing sight of the people and creating a culture characterised by pessimism, cynicism and stinginess.\" Moving decision-making closer to the people who live in these homes improves their quality of life, he adds. Laughter and light Four years ago, Thomas received a $10m (£6.75m) charitable donation to develop a network of 50 Green House elder care homes across the US, turning the \"medical model\" of nursing home care on its head. The homes are small-scale, for six to 10 residents, and instead of the sterile touch of wipe-clean furniture and the ominous rumble of the drug trolley, he says, there is \"laughter and light\", as well as gardening, animals and regular visits from children. Homes that have had an Eden makeover often report improved staff satisfaction and retention, and significant decreases in the use of medication and restraints. \"Most importantly, elders, supported by their care-givers, can once again direct their own daily lives,\" Thomas says. Eden Alternative UK and Ireland, based in Bradford-on-Avon, Wiltshire, has a network of regional trainers. The basic course for managers costs around £500, and it takes some 18 months for a home to be given a complete Eden turnaround. Change also makes business sense. \"Any upfront costs - for example, for staff education - are recovered through improved operations and better quality,\" Thomas says. And his homes save on the cost of medication. Recent analysis by the Institute for Public Health in the US showed that the bill for treating the side-effects of medication for elderly people was equal to the bill for the original medicine. So why do doctors turn older people into pill-popping patients? \"Because we think ageing is a disease. It's not; it's a normal part of human development.\" Thomas's trip to the UK involved visits to Anchor homes and meetings with Liberal Democrat MP Paul Burstow, co-chair of the parliamentary group on ageing and older people, Jeff Jerome, national director for social care transformation, and representatives of the social care industry and its regulators. He believes that the UK dementia strategy, with its promise of high street memory clinics and increased awareness, early intervention and support for carers, is a \"good first step\". Dementia, alongside loss of continence, is one of the main reasons why people are put in care homes, but Thomas insists that institutionalisation can also be defeated by extending schemes that allow older people and carers to hold budgets and choose their own services. For example, the Anchor Trust is helping people to stay at home longer - a theme that Eden is also developing. Thomas speaks passionately of the need to restore the social worth of older people. \"We lose a lot when the elderly are segregated,\" he says. \"These are people who can influence young people; they have experiences and terrific insights to share. There is a social obligation of the young to the old. It's not in the DNA, but it's part of the culture. If you don't transfer that obligation to every generation, it will be lost.\" He also approves of the \"mixing\" that already takes place in some forward-thinking UK care homes, such as Shaftesbury Lodge in the East End of London, where medical students live next door to older people - socialising with and learning from each other. Songs and tales from the Blitz are swapped with computer and iPod tutorials. Mixed communities So where are older people still cherished? \"The typical answer is in a tribal society, but I am not interested in living in a tribal society,\" Thomas replies. \"Of the modern industrial societies, Scandinavia does the best job. Its planners and architects build with mixed communities in mind.\" It could all have been so different for Thomas. On graduation, he was set for a high-flying career in emergency medicine. But a stop-gap job at a local nursing home changed the course of his life, and the lives of many others. \"I was called to see a woman with an arm rash,\" he recalls. \"I said that the rash was easy to treat, but there was something else on her mind. She pulled me close and said: 'I am so lonely.' \"It struck me that nothing in the medical texts could help, so I thought about creating a better place for humans to live, not just to die.\" Curriculum vitae Age 49.

But now he has paid off his investment and earns a regular income from the electrical company for the power he generates. \"I have had the last laugh,\" he grins. Mr Renn is part of a revolution in renewable energy that is sweeping Germany and bringing citizens of every kind into the fight against global warming. While a new report from the Centre for Alternative Technology says Britain could, with sufficient will and effort, go zero carbon in only 20 years, Germany's figures put the British government's claims to be leading the world on climate change into perspective. Germany has 200 times as much solar energy as Britain. It generates 12% of its electricity from various renewables, compared with 4.6% in Britain. It has created a quarter of a million jobs in renewables - a number that is growing fast. Britain has only 25,000, a number that represents the amount of jobs created in the industry in Germany in the past year alone. Freiburg, a town of 200,000 people in the Black Forest, has almost as much solar photovoltaic (PV) power as the whole of Britain. Dr Dieter Wörner, director of Freiburg's environmental protection agency, admits that such is the competition among German towns that Ulm has just overtaken Freiburg as solar capital of the world. \"But we are still expanding rapidly. It's a sporting contest,\" he says. Indeed, by the time Britain starts its first eco-town in 2016, Germany will have 50 or 60 eco-cities. Small wonder that the Labour government has quietly dropped the pledge it made six years ago to catch up with Germany by 2010. In Germany, too, the higher production has pushed prices down sharply. A typical 3kw PV system costs about £17,000 in Britain but less than £10,000 in Germany. Dr Wörner says prices have halved in the past seven years and will do so again in the next seven. The secret of German success is the \"feed-in tariff\" (FIT). Anyone generating electricity from solar PV, wind or hydro gets a guaranteed payment of four times the market rate - currently about 35p pence a unit - for 20 years. This reduces the payback time on such technologies to less than 10 years and offers a return on investment of 8-9%. The cost is spread by generating companies among all users and has added about one cent/kwh to the average bill, or an extra €1.50 (£1) a month. The Germans introduced the FIT in 1999 and tweaked it in 2004, since which time things have gone mad. FITs have now been adopted in 19 EU countries, and 47 worldwide, but not in Britain. German renewables firms are now world beaters and the German economy has been strengthened, not weakened, by a rush into renewables. Britain, by contrast, has a few installation companies mainly importing German equipment. At the recent Intersolar trade fair in Freiburg, the air was heady with talk of expansion, cutting-edge technologies and intense competition. And everyone says the reason is the FIT. Take Q-Cells. The company started making silicon PV cells in east Germany in 2000 with 19 staff. It now has 1,200 and expects by 2010 to have 5,000. It is one of the fastest-growing companies on the planet and is the world's second-largest maker of PV cells, after Sharp of Japan. It exports over half its product. \"The feed-in tariff changed everything - it is that simple,\" says Stefan Dietrich, Q-Cells spokesman. Demand is such that Bavarian farmers, with large barn roofs and fields, are the biggest customer group for PV in the world, he adds. Jürgen Kaiser-Gerwens, finance director at Schott AG, a maker of PV cells and of \"concentrated solar power\" - solar collectors that concentrate the sun's rays to heat a fluid and drive turbines - agrees. \"The FIT gives companies a good basis for planning but also makes them become more efficient and competitive. It is a win-win-win - for the industry, the government and individuals.\" FIT and proper Professor Eicke Weber, head of the Fraunhofer Solar Research Institute in Freiburg, which has successfully spun off 13 companies to exploit the new technologies it has developed, says the potential for renewables backed by an FIT is enormous. He expects the 2.5 gigawatts of solar PV installed in Germany (half of the world total) to skyrocket. \"Within five to 10 years I expect this to rise to 100-150 gigawatts. This market is growing 40% a year.\" He says renewables are sufficiently technically advanced to meet the world's demands for clean energy in the coming decades. \"The technology is there. We don't need any great breakthroughs.\" A massive shift to renewables in the coming decades could, he estimates, be achieved for say £250bn, roughly equivalent to what the US has spent on the Iraq war. \"And their economy has easily swallowed that,\" he says. In Britain, by contrast, going green is neither easy nor cheap. The government's stop-go attempts to stimulate renewables have made it difficult for anyone to make long-term decisions. Britain's renewables industry has struggled as grants for new technologies have been plagued by problems and were recently even slashed by the DTI, now renamed DBERR (Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform). The DBERR has also restricted the list of companies it permits to carry out renewable installations, keeping prices of new technologies higher than they need be. The government's main form of support is the \"renewable obligations\" system, which forces electrical generators to source a growing share of their power from renewables. Though it has had some success promoting offshore wind power, it has had little impact on microgeneration, solar power in particular. In an acknowledgement of this, the government is considering introducing banding for different technologies, but not until 2009. Experts say it is not delivering fast enough and a campaign for a feed-in tariff is growing, although the government dismisses FITs as too \"interventionist\". \"The renewables industry in this country exists in spite of the government, not because of it,\" says Alan Simpson, Labour MP for Nottingham South. He recently introduced a private member's bill that would bring in a feed-in tariff and is trying to get a ground-breaking zero-carbon project called \"O-zone\" off the ground in an area of central Nottingham, which would include renewable energy and the upgrading of houses to reduce their energy use and loss. But it will only fly if it wins lottery funding. Out of Merton Other towns, also frustrated at the lack of action by central government, have taken matters into their own hands. The London Borough of Merton introduced the now legendary \"Merton rule\" requiring any new developments to contain technology that generates at least 10% of their energy from renewables. Many councils have adopted it and some have raised the bar to 20%. One of the UK's greenest towns is Woking, Surrey. It began moving into renewables a decade ago and now has combined heat and power and fuel cell systems providing heat and electricity to many buildings in the town centre and 600kw of installed solar PV - about 5% of Britain's total. \"People give us a lot of credit but we need a reality check. In the grand scheme of things it is a bit pathetic,\" says Ray Morgan, Woking's chief executive. \"To develop a proper renewables infrastructure requires a lot of long-term investment but the economic models we have in this country are very short-term,\" he says, arguing for either an FIT or that the government let people write off renewable installations against tax. Dr Jeremy Leggett, head of Solarcentury, a leading supplier of PV systems, says: \"In terms of the delivery of a wide portfolio of different renewable energy technologies, feed-in tariffs are widely recognised as a more effective support mechanism than the UK's renewables obligation.\" Kurt Krannich, head of Krannich Solar, one of Germany's biggest solar energy distributors, says, though, that the future could be bright for Britain if only we introduce a FIT and let the Germans supply our solar energy. \"Then I think Britain could catch Germany up in just three years,\" he says. At a glance Pressure is growing on the government to adopt the feed-in tariff support system used in Germany and nearly 50 other countries, and now favoured by the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats. Under the German system anyone gener- ating electricity from solar PV, wind or hydro is guaranteed a payment of four times the market rate for 20 years. The system boosts take-up by consumers by reducing the payback times on such investments to less than 10 years - compared with 25 or 30 years in Britain - and gives industry the certainty of long-term demand to make it worthwhile investing in new factories. · The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Friday July 27 2007.

On the eve of the Russia-EU summit today in France, the energy package released by the European commission highlighted Europe's dependence on Russian exports and sought to devise strategies to wean Europe off the addiction. Of six energy projects pinpointed for development, commission officials said the two \"absolute\" priorities were to connect the three post-Soviet Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia to European power grids and to forge ahead with the so-called \"southern gas corridor\", which is supposed to transport gas from the Caspian basin to Europe while, for political reasons, bypassing the world's two biggest gas producers, Russia and Iran. Both projects are aimed at loosening Russia's grip. By next year Brussels also aims to have set up a consortium of European companies to buy gas from the Caspian basin, to be shipped to Europe in a new pipeline from Azerbaijan, via Turkey and the Balkans, to Austria from 2013. Gazprom currently controls all the pipelines sending gas to Europe from the east. \"The EU wants different sources of supply,\" said José Manuel Barroso, the commission president, who will negotiate on energy today with the Russian president, Dmitry Medvedev, at a summit in the south of France. \"We must not sleepwalk into Europe's energy dependence crisis.\" The Baltic states are isolated from the rest of the EU in their energy supplies and dependent on Russia, while another five EU countries in central Europe and Ireland also get all their gas from Russia. Germany is the EU's biggest Gazprom client. Europe currently gets 42% of its gas, a third of its oil and a quarter of its hard coal from Russia. The commission estimates that by 2030 Europe will be importing 84% of its gas needs, up from 61% at present. In a direct reference to the perceived threat from Russia, a commission document warned: \"Recent events in Georgia have shown that this is a critical time for energy security.\" The immediate focus on Russia was contained in a more grandiose long-term package calling for the integration of European power grids and energy markets; the incorporation of North Sea wind farms and Mediterranean solar energy hubs in a nascent European \"supergrid\"; the development of vast pan-European infrastructure projects; and an energy efficiency revolution. The entire scheme- aimed at making Europe's energy consumption \"secure, sustainable, and competitive\" - would cost almost €2 trillion (£1.5tn) by 2030 and is also factored into the campaign on global warming, ostensibly making Europe the world leader in the low-carbon economy contest. The commission proposals said current contingency planning on gas supplies \"might not provide an effective and timely response in crisis situations\" and called for common policy-making among the 27 member states to define \"an effective EU emergency plan\", to cope with possible disruptions of supplies. The EU has been struggling for two years to come up with coherent policies towards Russia, particularly on energy, while Russia and Gazprom have strengthened their grip by creating facts on the ground and cutting deals with individual countries. Relations between Moscow and the west, already poor, plumbed new depths in August when Russia invaded Georgia. Despite the tensions, EU governments decided on Monday to resume negotiations with Moscow that were called off in protest at the Caucasus conflict. Britain performed a volte-face, going from being a fierce critic of Moscow to supporting the resumption of talks on a strategic pact between Russia and Europe. \"The British signalled well in advance that they were giving up [opposition to the negotiations],\" said a senior European minister. The dependence on Russian energy played a crucial role, he added. With gas prices currently low, Gazprom has in recent weeks been offering long-term supply contracts to individual EU countries such as Germany and the Netherlands, sowing divisions within the EU.

Once the humvees and troops pulled out, yesterday's ephemera became today's garbage, and the city slowly started getting back to normal. Inevitably, there is a question hanging in the air: what was it all about? The pundits and columnists have rushed to answer by delivering analyses of Obama's inauguration speech and the scenes generated by the ceremony. It was a historic moment in America's journey towards equality and justice for all its citizens. It was an exemplary demonstration of the democratic process in action. It was a repudiation of the Bush years. But on that momentous day you could catch a lot of other things going on that connect with some of the less obvious, no less portentous, aspects of his wonderful oration. Obama's presidency commences with a sense of uniqueness not only because he is a black man, but because he is of the dot.com generation. He is at home with IT in a way that Tony Blair, for example, never was. Until the last minute before the inauguration weekend it was practically impossible to separate him from his BlackBerry. Presidents aren't supposed to make or take their own calls. Age is important for another reason. Obama was too young to register the events of the 1960s that shaped Clinton and George Bush, condemning them to refight sterile battles rooted in the conflicts of that decade. This gives Obama a chance to appeal across the partisan divide in a way that was denied his predecessors. He is capitalising on the disgrace and disarray of the right, but he is also proving adept at co-opting and disarming potential adversaries. How long he will manage to play this game remains to be seen because in his inauguration speech he signalled that his administration will be more radical than his centrist election campaign ever hinted at being. The contempt he feels for the abuse of human and civil rights in the name of security rippled off him. The way he disparaged the bullying foreign policy of the past eight years may have contributed to the hunched, defensive posture of ex-president George Bush. Behind the smiles, the gifts and the tributes to the hapless 43rd president there is a controlled anger that connects with the rage that caused people on the Mall to boo when Bush took his seat for the ceremony and to jeer at the sight of Dick Cheney in a wheelchair. When the presidential helicopter carrying George Bush into retirement lifted off from the capitol and flew over the crowds streaming home it was followed by joyous shouts of \"Bye Bye Bush\". Sadly, the crowd control prior to the event and in its aftermath was appallingly incompetent. The jams, crushes, and frustration threatened to turn a cheerful throng into a stampeding herd of selfish individuals. This was more than a little ironic coming so soon after the president's summons to enter \"a new era of responsibility\" and his repeated calls to duty, service, and sacrifice. No less ironic were the scenes that evening when the streets filled with stretch limos, shiny SUVs, and speeding taxis carrying guests to the inauguration balls. A lot of gas, canapes and alcohol were guzzled between six in the evening and one in the morning when Michelle and Barack, plainly exhausted, retired from the fray to their new quarters. Was this festival of bling the last gasp of an outgoing regime typified by greed, selfishness, and excess? People will be people and Obama is nothing if not a motivational leader. He was, after all, at one-time a community organiser. Now he has to weld together, enthuse, and lead in a new direction a community of 306 million people. So far he has been using oratory and example; in future he will deploy the instruments of democratic power. Crucially, he will be aided by the fact that America is demographically a young country. Over a quarter of the population is 20 years old or younger. If he can take this constituency with him he has a chance of truly achieving change. That is why the Republicans are so discomfited. For the moment Obama commands the affection and allegiance of every growing demographic in the country, while they are penned into a shrinking ghetto of ageing rich folks and poor whites. But these elements will fight and kick before they go quietly into the night. The rich will not easily surrender their tax breaks and it will be hard to make the gun-toting, truck-driving section of the population come to love hybrids, wind turbines and solar energy. The first 100 days of this new administration will indicate whether Obama is going to confront the opposition head-on, while it is weakened, or slice it up and neutralise it bit by bit, over time, as he has done previously. His invocation of Lincoln and Washington, and his avowed determination to make hard choices, suggest the former. Lincoln, after all, eventually confronted the vested interests in the south and fought a war to preserve the Union. Washington was a revolutionary. A property-owning, conservative revolutionary of a singularly American type, to be sure, but a leader who was unafraid of the bold move. In his speech Obama followed the evocation of Washington's desperate winter at Valley Forge when nothing survived but \"hope and virtue\" by calling on Americans to \"brave once more the icy currents\". Was this merely an accidental reference to the freezing waters of the Delaware river that Washington crossed in order to launch a devastating surprise attack on the British forces, defeating King George's Hessians at the Battle of Trenton?

Solar energy comes from the sun in the form of electromagnetic rays. Only a tiny fraction of the sun's rays reach the Earth, but those that do provide enough energy to warm the planet and make it hospitable for life. On a sunny day at noon, each square metre of the Earth's surface receives around 1kW of solar power. How do we use it? Solar energy can be used to generate heat or electricity. It is common for houses to have solar panels fitted to their roofs to provide warm water. The panels heat up in the sun and are used to warm water that it is pumped through them. Solar, or photovoltaic, cells are used to generate electricity from sunlight. When particles of light are absorbed by a solar cell, they dislodge electrons, which flow as an electrical current. Another way of making electricity from sunlight is to use a bank of mirrors and lenses to focus the sun's rays on to a pipe filled with water. When it is sunny enough, the water becomes hot enough to evaporate and can be used to drive an electric turbine. Pros Solar energy has enormous advantages over many other sources of energy. It is free, inexhaustible and clean. Cons Sunlight is a very diffuse source of energy, meaning it is not very concentrated like petrol or gas. To make good use of it, large areas of land need to be covered with solar panels or photovoltaic cells. Generating electricity from sunlight is not very efficient. Wind power Where does wind come from? Wind is caused by sunlight unevenly heating the surface of the Earth. During the day, air over the land heats up more quickly than air over the water, making it expand and rise. As it does so, cooler, more dense air rushes in beneath it, creating an air current. Some giant wind currents are driven by hot air at the equator and cool air at the poles. In Britain, we have enough wind to power the country several times over. How do we use it? The most common type of wind turbine is a bit like an old-fashioned windmill, with rotor blades that face into the wind. When the blades are spinning, they drive a shaft that is connected to an electrical generator by a gearbox. Most wind turbines produce electricity when the wind is blowing at 10-30mph. One 1.8MW wind turbine produces enough electricity for 1,000 households every year. Pros Wind is really a form of solar power, so it has similar benefits of being clean, abundant and free. Small wind turbines can be used in remote places to power homes that are too far away from the national grid. Some estimates suggest there is enough wind to generate one third of the world's electricity. Cons The major problem with wind power is that it is intermittent, so it can only be used to generate electricity when the wind is blowing strongly enough. Wind turbines have little impact on the environment, but some people think they look ugly and complain that they make a low-pitched humming noise. Good sites for wind turbines are often quite remote, either offshore or up on mountainsides, far from the cities where the energy is most needed. Wave and tidal power What is it? There is an enormous amount of energy locked up in the oceans. First, there are tides, which are caused by the gravitational pull of the moon and the sun, and the Earth's rotation. Then there are waves, which are caused by wind blowing over the ocean surface. Waves breaking around the world's coastlines are estimated to release around 3m MW of power. How does it work? Tide energy is harnessed by building barrages that allow large basins to fill up with water as the tides comes in, and then empty through turbines that generate electricity. There are also tide fences, which have built-in turbines that spin as water flows past them. Wave energy can be turned into electricity by using channels to steer waves directly on to turbines. Instead, the crashing waves can fill up a tank and, as with tidal power, drive turbines as the water runs back out. Pros As with many other renewables, tidal power is clean, free and abundant. Tidal power is also very predictable, because the time and height of tides are easy to work out. Some tide barriers can protect coastlines from storm damage by absorbing energy from surges of water. Cons Tidal power stations can only generate electricity when the tide is coming in or going out. To make electricity economically, the tide needs to rise and fall at least 3 metres. Only around 20 inlets in the world are thought to have good enough conditions for tide power. Hydroelectric power What is its source? Hydroelectric power uses the water cycle as a source of power. The sun's rays heat water on the Earth's surface, which evaporates and rises into the air. High up, the warm water vapour cools and condenses into clouds. The water then falls back down as rain or snow, and flows through rivers back into the oceans. How does it work? Hydroelectric plants often use dams that force river water to flow through large pipes containing turbines. As the water rushes past the turbines, they spin and generate electricity. Pros Hydropower is clean and abundant and, unlike wind, the water needed to drive turbines can be saved up for when it is most needed. Cons Hydroelectic power plants disrupt the environment by blocking up rivers. In some countries, dams used for hydropower have flooded large areas of land, forcing people to move elsewhere."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2009/feb/24/obama-environment-economic-rescue","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-02-24T00:01:00Z","webTitle":"Can the economic rescue plans also save planet?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/feb/24/obama-environment-economic-rescue","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/feb/24/obama-environment-economic-rescue","fields":{"headline":"Great clean-up - can economic rescue plans also save planet?","bodyText":"With governments around the world continuing to pump colossal sums of money into their plunging economies, a grand global experiment is under way: can the unprecedented spending provide not only a quick fix for the economic catastrophe but also the measures vital for dealing with global warming? Many hope so, and Barack Obama is foremost among them. He sees his presidency as a rare moment in history when crisis can be converted into opportunity, and his $787bn economic recovery plan is putting that theory to the ultimate test. His goal is to seize the opportunity to put in place the architecture of a low-carbon and sustainable economy. Calls for \"green new deals\" are coming from every part of the world and the US plan presents a case study on an epic scale, one that is being carefully monitored by other governments. Environment ministers at a United Nations meeting in Nairobi last week saw the US plan as a powerful signal to other governments to raise the green quotient in the next round of recovery plans. The G20 leading industrialised states will be grappling with those choices when it meets in London in April. \"It is very clear that a lot of countries are watching the green component of the Obama plan because they are very interested in quick wins,\" said Ed Barbier, a University of Wyoming economist and author of a United Nations Environment Programme report on a green recovery. So how does the US plan stack up? American environmentalists are delighted. \"We would never have been able to imagine legislation funding developments on this carte blanche scale,\" said Kert Davies, research director of Greenpeace. \"However, now you have an opportunity within this crisis, so let the experiment begin.\" Elsewhere, the verdict is mixed. The $100bn (£68bn) in green measures represents just under 13% of the total package, falling short of the benchmark set in a recent report led by economist Nick Stern, that green measures should account for 20% of global economic recovery plans. It also fails to meet the UN target of 1% of GDP. South Korea devoted two-thirds of its $36bn recovery package, or about 3% of its GDP, to green investment. China allocated about a third of its $580bn recovery plan to green measures, concentrating on energy efficiency. That is much higher than most European countries. The green portion of the EU recovery plan comes in a notch higher than the US plan at 14%. Germany's green investments account for 19% of its plan, but France is spending just 8%. There is no green component whatsoever to Poland's recovery plan, and Italy's efforts, in its $101bn package, are also negligible, according to a study by the climate change centre for excellence at HSBC. \"I suspect that one reason some governments, including European ones, are reluctant to adopt green stimulus initiatives is they are still stuck in the 'old school' thinking that we have to revive the economy first before thinking about long-term low-carbon strategies,\" said Barbier. However, Stern's colleague Dimitri Zenghelis, at the Grantham Institute, London, said that it was too early to draw up a definitive green ranking: \"We have yet to see the full amounts governments are going to spend to stimulate the economy.\" Seen in that context, the American plan comes off well, especially considering the political battle that was waged as the plan moved through Congress. The green recovery plan was incubated at a liberal thinktank, the Centre for American Progress. Its founder, John Podesta, was a former White House chief of staff for Bill Clinton and led Obama's transition team. The thinktank produced a plan late last year for a green new deal and many of those ideas survived in the 1,100-page package passed by Congress. The green elements include: • funding to insulate domestic and public buildings; • tax breaks and loans for solar and wind power firms; • investment in a new electric grid; • expansion of subways and inter-city trains. American environmentalists say it is not worth quibbling about a few percentage points, given the huge sweep of the package and its swift passage. \"The US a year ago was still in denial on issues of energy conservation,\" said Earl Blumenauer, a Congressman from Oregon and a champion of the environment. Nick Robins, who heads the climate change centre at HSBC, argues the plan more than makes up in breadth what it lacks in total spending levels: \"It gives a very, very comprehensive stimulus to the green economy across the key pillars: renewables, building efficiency, auto vehicle efficiency, mass transit and water.\" The American plan also meets Stern's other prescriptions for an effective green stimulus - a concentration on building efficiency and renewable energy. Efficiency measures, such as insulation, sealing, and double glazing, account for the largest share of the $100bn. It is also thought to score well on its most basic purpose: rapid job creation. It is projected to create 2m jobs over the next two years, half of the 4m total envisaged by the package. Congress, in giving shape to Obama's proposals, was adamant that programmes should be ready to go within the two-year deadline. But that meant that some of the most transformative measures - modernising the electrical grid and developing electric cars - were scaled back because the institutions involved could not handle such vast sums of money in a short timeframe. There are other gaps. Davies would have liked to have seen estimates of the emissions reductions promised by each measure in the package. In Washington, the plan is often described as a down payment on the new green economy. Ultimate success will depend on whether Congress manages to push through legislation expected this year in three areas: expanding public transport, developing wind and solar energy and moving to cap carbon dioxide emissions. \"You can't just flip a switch on the green economy,\" said David Foster, director of the Blue-Green Alliance, which combines trade unions and environmental groups. \"But if we do all three, in addition to the down payment, we will be well down the road to getting the green economy really roaring.\" As vast sums of money begin to flow into the US economy, and other governments prepare to commit even more, observers around the world will be watching closely to see whether saving the economy can, in fact, also save the planet."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2008/sep/26/solarpower.renewableenergy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2008-09-25T23:01:00Z","webTitle":"Solar panels are new hot property for thieves","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/26/solarpower.renewableenergy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2008/sep/26/solarpower.renewableenergy","fields":{"headline":"Solar panels are new hot property for thieves","bodyText":"Glenda Hoffman has an answer for the thieves, should they choose to return to her home in Desert Hot Springs, California. \"I have a shotgun right next to the bed and a .22 under my pillow.\" Hoffman was the victim of a theft that one industry professional has dubbed \"the crime of the future\". Another observer has come up with the term \"grand theft solar\" to describe the spate of recent burglaries in sunny California. In May Hoffman lost 16 solar panels from her roof in three separate burglaries, one while she slept below. Happily for Hoffman her insurers have agreed to pay the $95,000 (£48,000) cost of replacing the panels. But as energy prices soar, and solar power takes off - at least in California - so opportunistic thieves have turned to the lucrative, and complicated, business of dismantling solar panels. \"I wouldn't say it's pervasive, but it's going on,\" California Solar Energy Industries Association executive director Sue Kateley told the Valley Times. California is the leader for solar installations, with 33,000 across the state. Unsurprisingly, it is also the market leader for thefts of solar installations, although figures are hard to come by. \"The solar panel thing is pretty new,\" said Contra Costa county sheriff's office spokesman Jimmy Lee. \"We're seeing an increasing number of cases.\" One night in late August, 26 solar panels with a value of $20,000 were stolen from California's first certified organic farm, Star Route Farms in Bolinas, 20 miles up the coast from San Francisco. \"It's probably easier to steal a $20,000 car,\" Rob Erlichman, president of Sunlight Electric, which sold the panels to the farm in 2006, told the Point Reyes Light. \"To steal that many panels you need a truck and you need guys.\" A few miles inland, in Lafayette, a truck and some guys is just what the thieves had. A resident came home during the day to find three men on the roof of his house and five of his solar panels in the back of a rented truck. The men fled, leaving behind the truck and the panels. Ken Martin, who runs a real estate company in Santa Rosa, California, found one day this spring that thieves had removed 58 panels with a value of $75,000 from an office building he owns. His proposed solution is to paint his solar panels bright pink. \"At least if someone comes across them and they're painted, they'll know that's my colour,\" he said. Law enforcement and the solar industry suggest other approaches to crime prevention. Many companies now sell secure fastenings for solar panels, while some police departments are urging solar power users to inscribe their driving licence number on the panels. But some warn that the thieves are too sophisticated to be troubled by such primitive deterrents. Tom McCalmont, who runs Regrid Power in Campbell, close to California's Silicon Valley, said that the sophistication shown by thieves suggests that industry insiders are behind many of the thefts, a suspicion bolstered by supply difficulties with new solar panels. McCalmont has experience of solar panel thefts: his own company lost $30,000-worth of panels to burglars this summer. \"They knew which wires to cut, which not to cut,\" he said. \"This showed a level of expertise that indicated that whoever did it was from the solar industry.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2008/jun/14/animalbehaviour.australia","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2008-06-13T23:01:00Z","webTitle":"Biometric 'cowcam' sorts the cattle from the pests","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/jun/14/animalbehaviour.australia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2008/jun/14/animalbehaviour.australia","fields":{"headline":"Biometric 'cowcam' sorts the cattle from the pests","bodyText":"Facial recognition systems are already being used on humans and now it is the turn of animals to have their muzzles and snouts identified for security purposes. Australian scientists have launched technology that uses video cameras to differentiate between species. They say the \"cowcam\" will keep unwanted animals out of remote watering and feed points in the Australian outback and allow farmers to monitor their stock from home or office. \"We use the unique side profile that every animal has and a software program similar to facial recognition technology that allows us to identify animals to a species level,\" said Neal Finch, the joint inventor of the product and a researcher at the University of Queensland. \"The camera can tell the difference between sheep and cattle and feral pests such as goats, horses, pigs, kangaroos, camels and emus.\" When animals come to feed or drink they will be forced to pass through a lane where the camera has been installed. \"You could have a cattle station that has feral populations of horses or camels. The watering points are there for the cattle, so the camera would let the cattle through, but if a goat or a pig tried to get in the gate would shut against it,\" he said. The technology has been developed over the past four years and is on sale in Australia for A$10,000 (about £4,800). For that you get a lane that narrows the animals down to single file so they go through one at a time in front of the camera, the computing hardware, an electronic gate, weatherproof boxes and all the solar energy apparatus to run the system."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2007/nov/01/guardianweeklytechnologysection.research","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2007-11-01T10:47:00Z","webTitle":"Power from the final frontier","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2007/nov/01/guardianweeklytechnologysection.research","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2007/nov/01/guardianweeklytechnologysection.research","fields":{"headline":"Power from the final frontier","bodyText":"At some point before 2050, satellites collecting solar power and beaming it back to Earth will become a primary energy source, streaming terawatts of electricity continuously from space. That's if you believe a recent report from the Pentagon's National Security Space Office, which says confidently that we will see \"a basic proof-of-concept within 4-6 years and a substantial power demonstration as early as 2017-2020\". It's obvious in some ways: above the atmosphere, a solar cell receives about 40 times more energy per year than an equivalent site on the ground, due to the absence of atmospheric scattering and seasonal or nightly reductions in light. The NSSO suggests that an orbiting spacecraft with solar panel arrays would be comparable to current ground-based installations spanning hectares and, eventually, a few square kilometres. Then that energy can be sent to the ground - using, the Pentagon suggests, a giant laser or microwave beam. The report, Space Based Solar Power as an Opportunity for Strategic Security, suggests optimistically that one application will be the beaming of \"energy aid\" via satellite into conflict and disaster zones, minimising the human cost of resource wars and catastrophic events caused by global warming. \"The technology has been in development for a while,\" says Joseph Rouge, associate director of the space office. \"The truly hard and expensive part is going to be getting it into orbit. We'll need regular launches and on-orbit robotic assembly systems. It's a $10bn [£4.8bn] programme, but by 2050 it could deliver 10% of America's power needs.\" The space office sees energy supply as one of strategic importance as oil supplies dwindle; according to a report by Germany's Energy Watch Group published last week, \"peak oil\" output occurred last year, and will fall by 7% annually to half its present levels by 2030. The space office notes that all remaining oil resources are estimated to contain 250 terawatt-years of energy; but that a one-kilometre wide band in geosynchronous orbit receives about 212 TW-years of energy each year. Deadly weapon? The first units to go up will generate between 10MW and 25MW of continuous power, enough for a town of 25,000 people. If the energy is transmitted by microwave, a surface array one-tenth of a square kilometre in size will be needed to pick it up. Larger beams will require larger collector arrays. But wouldn't a microwave beam from space be equivalent to a deadly weapon? Unlike photovoltaic cells, these antenna arrays are practically transparent, so crops could be planted under them. \"If a 2.45Ghz beam drifted off its target and ended up over a town, the effect would be negligible,\" says Lt Col Damphousse of the space office. \"By the time the microwave reaches the surface it has spread out considerably. The power density is one-sixth that of the noonday sun.\" The US army could also use such a device to deliver electricity to its troops. Military units in forward areas pay $1 per kilowatt hour, six times the UK domestic price. They pay a lot more to bring in fuel. Lives could be saved by cutting long and vulnerable logistics chains - though it would require the large collectors. The beam is most powerful near its source, and although at 25,000 miles up it would not pose a risk to astronauts in the International Space Station, it could be turned against communication or observation satellites in geostationary orbit. \"Space Traffic Control would make sure the satellite is not tampered with before launch,\" says Damphousse. \"They would also ensure the spacecraft do not interfere with each other.\" Leopold Summerer, head of the Advanced Concepts Team at the European Space Agency, thinks laser beams will be better than microwaves due to their higher transmission frequencies and narrower apertures. His department has been coordinating exploratory discussions between the big European energy suppliers and aerospace companies. \"By the time space solar power is ready there will already be large-scale terrestrial solar in place,\" Summerer says. \"The same panels could be used to receive energy from a laser. You could save a lot of money on energy storage by beaming at night and throughout the year.\" The various platforms under consideration will not be competitive until the cost of space flight goes down. Nasa's budget has been shrunk and Japanese agency JAXA has suffered technical setbacks. The International Space Station barely manages to justify its running costs. As of today, none of the agencies is funding a space solar power launch. Rouge says: \"This is a commercial venture. The US government could be an initial customer, but they won't be the ones to build it.\" Solar power beaming could be much more profitable than space tourism. It has the potential to drive down launch costs, thereby making a number of other missions practicable. In a survey of the US space community's National Space Goals conducted last year, launching solar power satellites came top of the list. Over the past 40 years, microwave and laser power transmission systems have been tested successfully in Europe, the US and Japan. Unmanned aircraft and lunar rovers receiving power from a remote beam are proven applications. The Japanese have tested reactions in the ionosphere to microwaves at the frequencies used for space solar power, and the results were positive. The only remaining issue is to test a large-scale system. Test prototype Space Island Group is a Californian startup with an ambitious strategy. Gene Meyers, its chief executive, says the company has almost completed financing for a test prototype launch at a total cost of $200m. \"We expect to have the prototype in orbit within two years,\" he says. \"It will be a 10-25MW system in low Earth orbit, using a microwave beam to deliver the energy to ground stations, probably located in Europe.\" Their main competitors are Mitsubishi and an as-yet unnamed European consortium. \"Mitsubishi is more advanced in their satellite design, but are stymied by launch costs,\" Meyers says. Space Island will use Nasa fuel tanks and launch facilities built in the 1970s. \"They are designed to handle a launch every week, so the capacity is there to scale up to a larger system,\" he says. The plan is to have a 100 gigawatt service in operation by 2025. The Indian government has expressed interest in becoming a customer. Many rural areas are undergoing development but do not have access to the national grid. There are also a large number of island nations paying excessive amounts to distribute electricity. Leopold Summerer at the European Space Agency says: \"I think we'll use the technology sooner or later. If one nation develops this service, the others will take it seriously. They won't be able to resist.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2008/sep/18/cleantechnology100.news","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2008-09-17T23:01:00Z","webTitle":"Solutions to climate change have got to be attractive, argues Damian Carrington","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/18/cleantechnology100.news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2008/sep/18/cleantechnology100.news","fields":{"headline":"Make it sexy, make it enticing","bodyText":"When an army confronts a heavily defended enemy, it has two options: a full-frontal attack or a siege. In the battle against climate change and its cause - the deeply entrenched profligacy with which the world uses its fossil-fuel derived energy - there is a similar choice. The all-out attacks are mega-schemes to convert the Sahara into a giant solar energy farm, or supergrids connecting renewable energy plants across continents. These are dazzling, flashy proposals and gain much attention. Global geo-engineering plans are even more pulse-quickening, aimed as they are at changing the reflectivity of the entire planet. A million space mirrors? Glitzy. Yet such spectacular attacks are high risk, easily turning into crashing, expensive failures. Sieges, dull and monotonous, are the wise general's choice. And in the context of carbon dioxide emissions, the siege strategy equates to energy efficiency. That means switching stuff off, or building it to use less energy in the first place. I know, that is not dazzling; it's dreary. And yet this death-by-a-million-cuts approach is one of our greatest hopes of preventing catastrophic climate change. A 2007 McKinsey report found that even implementing only those energy efficiency measures that pay for themselves at sensible rates of return could reduce the energy needed in 2020 by about a quarter. That would be halfway towards the emissions cuts that give a decent chance of limiting global warming to under 2C. A more homely example: if everyone in the UK bought the most efficient fridges, freezers and washing machines, the carbon saving would equal taking around 1.4 million cars off the road. From a policy perspective, the remedy is clear: minimum energy efficiency standards. But witness the intense lobbying from the car industry in the face of modest European fuel efficiency standards, and how the idea of charging a lower rate of VAT on more fuel-efficient white goods got rapidly bogged down. You can see the problem. Protesters are not going to take to the streets to demand more efficient fridges, but corporates will lob large sums at protecting a profitable status quo. Even last week's £1bn home energy efficiency programme from the government was driven by political fear, not global warming. The official press release - from Defra - made not a single mention of carbon dioxide or climate change. There are glimmers of hope. Flagrantly wasteful incandescent bulbs are to become outlawed in some countries, with Australia leading the way. Japan's lack of domestic energy resources has forced it to tackle energy efficiency via impressive cultural change. Making it OK for salarymen to take off their jackets in the office means the air con can nudge up a couple of degrees. And there are a decent number of efficiency standards in place from the US to Europe to China. But overall they are simply far too undemanding. So how can energy efficiency come, as it must, to dominate every domestic and industrial setting? To put it simply, it's got to be sexy. Frugality must give a frisson. The CleanTech 100, with its electrochromic windows, magnetic fridges and plastic electronics, is a start. But what could be a more enticing challenge to the designers, technologists and other creatives out there? If you need any further inspiration, just think of that little red standby light as a tiny, burning planet.

The end of some iconic American investment banks (Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch); the end of cheap oil and gas; the end of cheap food; the end of cheap credit; and, with last week's collapse of XL Travel, one business leader commented that it meant the end of cheap travel. And of course Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England, noted that Britain had come to the end of the NICE decade - that is, non-inflationary consistent expansion. Presumably he's working on words to create an acronym for the NASTY decade. If all these eras are coming to an end, doesn't that imply that some other eras must be starting? Logically, yes, but the problem with such beginnings is that they're very hard to spot. When did credit become cheap? When did oil and gas become cheap? When did travel become cheap? When did Britain's expansion become non-inflationary? There's no particular date for any of those things. They crept up on us: oil prices didn't plummet, they just eased down. Same with credit and travel, and all the rest. It was the sudden hitting of the reset button in the past 12 months — with the perfect storm of the credit crunch, terrible harvests around the world and increase in oil demand worldwide - that stopped them all. You can never recognise the beginning of such an era, only its end. And often the makings of what is to come have been around for a long time; it's just that the pieces need assembly. So will this really be an era where food and credit and oil and travel aren't cheap? The world has faced similar problems before, with the oil shock of the 1970s, which sent inflation spiralling and created huge problems for economies that had relied on cheap energy and food supplies. That shock drove an era of invention, innovation and dramatic improvements in fuel efficiency in and exploitation of previously overlooked resources. It took some time for those benefits to become clear, but arguably we've been milking their benefits for the past couple of decades. Now, we starting again. Once again we're going to need innovation and invention and resourcefulness. Logically, there will be a premium on solutions that are non-capital intensive, don't rely on oil or gas and can be implemented near where they're needed. One where we use the resources, but not in a way that consumes them — because any ground-derived resource is, ultimately, finite, and its price will rise as the resource becomes harder to acquire. It's going to take time to adjust our lifestyles to a new way of acquiring and using energy. It won't be comfortable. The US in particular has for years been using oil-derived energy in defiance of its finite nature. But even Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Republican governor of California, has announced a plan to generate 3GW of energy from solar panels, called the California Solar Initiative. If even the Terminator can see that the time for solar energy has come, then we can also declare another era over: the era of political indifference to energy supply questions and the start of an era when it's seen as essential. It happened once before, with the oil shock of the 1970s. Now it's about time to start afresh. Will we call it the era of clean energy?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2007/dec/13/greenbusiness.alternativeenergy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2007-12-13T10:19:29Z","webTitle":"German solar power goes into eclipse as company sheds jobs and profits","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/dec/13/greenbusiness.alternativeenergy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2007/dec/13/greenbusiness.alternativeenergy","fields":{"headline":"German solar power goes into eclipse as company sheds jobs and profits","bodyText":"The German solar energy group Conergy dealt a severe blow to investor confidence in renewables yesterday by issuing a second profit warning within two months and slashing a fifth of its workforce. Shares in the Hamburg-based company, which claims to be Europe's largest solar power group, plunged as much as 20% after it admitted that pre-tax losses this year could be as much as €150-€200m (£107m-£143m) compared with earlier forecasts of €10m and that turnover would fall short of the expected €1bn. Germany, which has set ambitious targets of a 40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020, is the world's leading solar power producer, with 15 of the 20 biggest plants, many of them in the former communist east. Shares in solar groups have outperformed other sectors hugely this year, with Conergy hitting almost €70 in October. Its shares fell 30% on one day in October after it issued its first profit warning. The shares fell 15% on yesterday's news and closed 11% down. The sector, comprising 5,000 companies buoyed by laws forcing utilities to buy solar power at above market rates, employs more than 50,000 and likes to see itself as \"solar valley\". But an overstretched Conergy said it planned to axe 500 jobs among its 2,500 staff and sell off its biomass and solar thermal (house-heating) businesses. Dieter Hammer, the new chief executive, said: \"The new board has decided on a decisive break, which will swiftly restore Conergy to a successful path.\" The company, which earned €50m on sales of €750m last year, blamed problems with suppliers, a write-down of assets and restructuring costs for its poor performance. It is building its own solar panel plant in east Germany to reduce its reliance on outside suppliers. Analysts welcomed the rapid action by Hammer, who replaced the founder, Hans-Martin Rüter, as chief executive late last month, but one warned that the company \"stands on the edge of the abyss\". Another said: \"People over-estimated the substance of the company.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2011/jan/02/25-predictions-25-years","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2011-01-02T00:05:22Z","webTitle":"20 predictions for the next 25 years","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/jan/02/25-predictions-25-years","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2011/jan/02/25-predictions-25-years","fields":{"headline":"20 predictions for the next 25 years","bodyText":"1 Geopolitics: 'Rivals will take greater risks against the US' No balance of power lasts forever. Just a century ago, London was the centre of the world. Britain bestrode the world like a colossus and only those with strong nerves (or weak judgment) dared challenge the Pax Britannica. That, of course, is all history, but the Pax Americana that has taken shape since 1989 is just as vulnerable to historical change. In the 1910s, the rising power and wealth of Germany and America splintered the Pax Britannica; in the 2010s, east Asia will do the same to the Pax Americana. The 21st century will see technological change on an astonishing scale. It may even transform what it means to be human. But in the short term – the next 20 years – the world will still be dominated by the doings of nation-states and the central issue will be the rise of the east. By 2030, the world will be more complicated, divided between a broad American sphere of influence in Europe, the Middle East and south Asia, and a Chinese sphere in east Asia and Africa. Even within its own sphere, the US will face new challenges from former peripheries. The large, educated populations of Poland, Turkey, Brazil and their neighbours will come into their own and Russia will continue its revival. Nevertheless, America will probably remain the world's major power. The critics who wrote off the US during the depression of the 1930s and the stagflation of the 1970s lived to see it bounce back to defeat the Nazis in the 1940s and the Soviets in the 1980s. America's financial problems will surely deepen through the 2010s, but the 2020s could bring another Roosevelt or Reagan. A hundred years ago, as Britain's dominance eroded, rivals, particularly Germany, were emboldened to take ever-greater risks. The same will happen as American power erodes in the 2010s-20s. In 1999, for instance, Russia would never have dared attack a neighbour such as Georgia but in 2009 it took just such a chance. The danger of such an adventure sparking a great power war in the 2010s is probably low; in the 2020s, it will be much greater. The most serious threats will arise in the vortex of instability that stretches from Africa to central Asia. Most of the world's poorest people live here; climate change is wreaking its worst damage here; nuclear weapons are proliferating fastest here; and even in 2030, the great powers will still seek much of their energy here. Here, the risk of Sino-American conflict will be greatest and here the balance of power will be decided. Ian Morris, professor of history at Stanford University and the author of Why the West Rules – For Now (Profile Books) 2 The UK economy: 'The popular revolt against bankers will become impossible to resist' It will be a second financial crisis in the 2010s – probably sooner than later – that will prove to be the remaking of Britain. Confronted by a second trillion-pound bank bailout in less than 10 years, it will be impossible for the City and wider banking system to resist reform. The popular revolt against bankers, their current business model in which neglect of the real economy is embedded and the scale of their bonuses – all to be underwritten by bailouts from taxpayers – will become irresistible. The consequent rebalancing of the British economy, already underway, will intensify. Britain, in thrall to finance since 1945, will break free – spearheading a second Industrial Revolution. In 2035, there is thus a good prospect that Britain will be the most populous (our birth rate will be one the highest in Europe), dynamic and richest European country, the key state in a reconfigured EU. Our leading universities will become powerhouses of innovation, world centres in exploiting the approaching avalanche of scientific and technological breakthroughs. A reformed financial system will allow British entrepreneurs to get the committed financial backing they need, becoming the capitalist leaders in Europe. And, after a century of trying, Britain will at last build itself a system for developing apprentices and technicians that is no longer the Cinderella of the education system. It will not be plain sailing. Massive political turbulence in China and its conflict with the US will define part of the next 25 years – and there will be a period when the world trading and financial system retreats from openness. How far beggar-my-neighbour competitive devaluations and protection will develop is hard to predict, but protectionist trends are there for all to see. Commodity prices will go much higher and there will be shortages of key minerals, energy, water and some basic foodstuffs. The paradox is that this will be good news for Britain. It will force the state to re-engage with the economy and to build a matrix of institutions that will support innovation and investment, rather as it did between 1931 and 1950. New Labour began this process tremulously in its last year in office; the coalition government is following through. These will be lean years for the traditional Conservative right, but whether it will be a liberal One Nation Tory party, ongoing coalition governments or the Labour party that will be the political beneficiary is not yet sure. The key point is that those 20 years in the middle of the 20th century witnessed great industrial creativity and an unsung economic renaissance until the country fell progressively under the stultifying grip of the City of London. My guess is that the same, against a similarly turbulent global background, is about to happen again. My caveat is if the City remains strong, in which case economic decline and social division will escalate. Will Hutton, executive vice-chair of the Work Foundation and an Observer columnist 3 Global development: 'A vaccine will rid the world of Aids' Within 25 years, the world will achieve many major successes in tackling the diseases of the poor. Certainly, we will be polio-free and probably will have been for more than a decade. The fight to eradicate polio represents one of the greatest achievements in global health to date. It has mobilised millions of volunteers, staged mass immunisation campaigns and helped to strengthen the health systems of low-income countries. Today, we have eliminated 99% of the polio in the world and eradication is well within reach. Vaccines that prevent diseases such as measles and rotavirus, currently available in rich countries, will also become affordable and readily available in developing countries. Since it was founded 10 years ago, the Gavi Alliance, a global partnership that funds expanded immunisation in poor countries, has helped prevent more than 5 million deaths. It is easy to imagine that in 25 years this work will have been expanded to save millions more lives by making life-saving vaccines available all over the world. I also expect to see major strides in new areas. A rapid point-of-care diagnostic test – coupled with a faster-acting treatment regimen – will so fundamentally change the way we treat tuberculosis that we can begin planning an elimination campaign. We will eradicate malaria, I believe, to the point where there are no human cases reported globally in 2035. We will also have effective means for preventing Aids infection, including a vaccine. With the encouraging results of the RV144 Aids vaccine trial in Thailand, we now know that an Aids vaccine is possible. We must build on these and promising results on other means of preventing HIV infection to help rid the world of the threat of Aids. Tachi Yamada, president of the global health programme at the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation 4 Energy: 'Returning to a world that relies on muscle power is not an option' Providing sufficient food, water and energy to allow everyone to lead decent lives is an enormous challenge. Energy is a means, not an end, but a necessary means. With 6.7 billion people on the planet, more than 50% living in large conurbations, and these numbers expected to rise to more than 9 billion and 80% later in the century, returning to a world that relies on human and animal muscle power is not an option. The challenge is to provide sufficient energy while reducing reliance on fossil fuels, which today supply 80% of our energy (in decreasing order of importance, the rest comes from burning biomass and waste, hydro, nuclear and, finally, other renewables, which together contribute less than 1%). Reducing use of fossil fuels is necessary both to avoid serious climate change and in anticipation of a time when scarcity makes them prohibitively expensive. It will be extremely difficult. An International Energy Agency scenario that assumes the implementation of all agreed national policies and announced commitments to save energy and reduce the use of fossil fuels projects a 35% increase in energy consumption in the next 25 years, with fossil fuels up 24%. This is almost entirely due to consumption in developing countries where living standards are, happily, rising and the population is increasing rapidly. This scenario, which assumes major increases in nuclear, hydro and wind power, evidently does not go far enough and will break down if, as many expect, oil production (which is assumed to increase 15%) peaks in much less than 25 years. We need to go much further in reducing demand, through better design and changes in lifestyles, increasing efficiency and improving and deploying all viable alternative energy sources. It won't be cheap. And in the post-fossil-fuel era it won't be sufficient without major contributions from solar energy (necessitating cost reductions and improved energy storage and transmission) and/or nuclear fission (meaning fast breeder and/or thorium reactors when uranium eventually becomes scarce) and/or fusion (which is enormously attractive in principle but won't become a reliable source of energy until at least the middle of the century). Disappointingly, with the present rate of investment in developing and deploying new energy sources, the world will still be powered mainly by fossil fuels in 25 years and will not be prepared to do without them. Chris Llewellyn Smith is a former director general of Cern and chair of Iter, the world fusion project, he works on energy issues at Oxford University 5 Advertising: 'All sorts of things will just be sold in plain packages' If I'd been writing this five years ago, it would have been all about technology: the internet, the fragmentation of media, mobile phones, social tools allowing consumers to regain power at the expense of corporations, all that sort of stuff. And all these things are important and will change how advertising works. But it's becoming clear that what'll really change advertising will be how we relate to it and what we're prepared to let it do. After all, when you look at advertising from the past the basic techniques haven't changed; what seems startlingly alien are the attitudes it was acceptable to portray and the products you were allowed to advertise. In 25 years, I bet there'll be many products we'll be allowed to buy but not see advertised – the things the government will decide we shouldn't be consuming because of their impact on healthcare costs or the environment but that they can't muster the political will to ban outright. So, we'll end up with all sorts of products in plain packaging with the product name in a generic typeface – as the government is currently discussing for cigarettes. But it won't stop there. We'll also be nudged into renegotiating the relationship between society and advertising, because over the next few years we're going to be interrupted by advertising like never before. Video screens are getting so cheap and disposable that they'll be plastered everywhere we go. And they'll have enough intelligence and connectivity that they'll see our faces, do a quick search on Facebook to find out who we are and direct a message at us based on our purchasing history. At least, that'll be the idea. It probably won't work very well and when it does work it'll probably drive us mad. Marketing geniuses are working on this stuff right now, but not all of them recognise that being allowed to do this kind of thing depends on societal consent – push the intrusion too far and people will push back. Society once did a deal accepting advertising because it seemed occasionally useful and interesting and because it paid for lots of journalism and entertainment. It's not necessarily going to pay for those things for much longer so we might start questioning whether we want to live in a Blade Runner world brought to us by Cillit Bang. Russell Davies, head of planning at the advertising agency Ogilvy and Mather and a columnist for the magazines Campaign and Wired 6 Neuroscience: 'We'll be able to plug information streams directly into the cortex' By 2030, we are likely to have developed no-frills brain-machine interfaces, allowing the paralysed to dance in their thought-controlled exoskeleton suits. I sincerely hope we will not still be interfacing with computers via keyboards, one forlorn letter at a time. I'd like to imagine we'll have robots to do our bidding. But I predicted that 20 years ago, when I was a sanguine boy leaving Star Wars, and the smartest robot we have now is the Roomba vacuum cleaner. So I won't be surprised if I'm wrong in another 25 years. Artificial intelligence has proved itself an unexpectedly difficult problem. Maybe we will understand what's happening when we immerse our heads into the colourful night blender of dreams. We will have cracked the secret of human memory by realising that it was never about storing things, but about the relationships between things. Will we have reached the singularity – the point at which computers surpass human intelligence and perhaps give us our comeuppance? We'll probably be able to plug information streams directly into the cortex for those who want it badly enough to risk the surgery. There will be smart drugs to enhance learning and memory and a flourishing black market among ambitious students to obtain them. Having lain to rest the nature-nurture dichotomy at that point, we will have a molecular understanding of the way in which cultural narratives work their way into brain tissue and of individual susceptibility to those stories. Then there's the mystery of consciousness. Will we finally have a framework that allows us to translate the mechanical pieces and parts into private, subjective experience? As it stands now, we don't even know what such a framework could look like (\"carry the two here and that equals the experience of tasting cinnamon\"). That line of research will lead us to confront the question of whether we can reproduce consciousness by replicating the exact structure of the brain – say, with zeros and ones, or beer cans and tennis balls. If this theory of materialism turns out to be correct, then we will be well on our way to downloading our brains into computers, allowing us to live forever in The Matrix. But if materialism is incorrect, that would be equally interesting: perhaps brains are more like radios that receive an as-yet-undiscovered force. The one thing we can be sure of is this: no matter how wacky the predictions we make today, they will look tame in the strange light of the future. David Eagleman, neuroscientist and writer 7 Physics: 'Within a decade, we'll know what dark matter is' The next 25 years will see fundamental advances in our understanding of the underlying structure of matter and of the universe. At the moment, we have successful descriptions of both, but we have open questions. For example, why do particles of matter have mass and what is the dark matter that provides most of the matter in the universe? I am optimistic that the answer to the mass question will be found within a few years, whether or not it is the mythical Higgs boson, and believe that the answer to the dark matter question will be found within a decade. Key roles in answering these questions will be made by experiments at Cern's Large Hadron Collider, which started operations in earnest last year and is expected to run for most of the next 20 years; others will be played by astrophysical searches for dark matter and cosmological observations such as those from the European Space Agency's Planck satellite. Many theoretical proposals for answering these questions invoke new principles in physics, such as the existence of additional dimensions of space or a \"supersymmetry\" between the constituents of matter and the forces between them, and we will discover whether these ideas are useful for physics. Both these ideas play roles in string theory, the best guess we have for a complete theory of all the fundamental forces including gravity. Will string theory be pinned down within 20 years? My crystal ball is cloudy on this point, but I am sure that we physicists will have an exciting time trying to find out. John Ellis, theoretical physicist at Cern and King's College London 8 Food: 'Russia will become a global food superpower' When experts talk about the coming food security crisis, the date they fixate upon is 2030. By then, our numbers will be nudging 9 billion and we will need to be producing 50% more food than we are now. By the middle of that decade, therefore, we will either all be starving, and fighting wars over resources, or our global food supply will have changed radically. The bitter reality is that it will probably be a mixture of both. Developed countries such as the UK are likely, for the most part, to have attempted to pull up the drawbridge, increasing national production and reducing our reliance on imports. In response to increasing prices, some of us may well have reduced our consumption of meat, the raising of which is a notoriously inefficient use of grain. This will probably create a food underclass, surviving on a carb- and fat-heavy diet, while those with money scarf the protein. The developing world, meanwhile, will work to bridge the food gap by embracing the promise of biotechnology which the middle classes in the developed world will have assumed that they had the luxury to reject. In truth, any of the imported grain that we do consume will come from genetically modified crops. As climate change lays waste to the productive fields of southern Europe and north Africa, more water-efficient strains of corn, wheat and barley will be pressed into service; likewise, to the north, Russia will become a global food superpower as the same climate change opens up the once frozen and massive Siberian prairie to food production. The consensus now is that the planet does have the wherewithal to feed that huge number of people. It's just that some people in the west may find the methods used to do so unappetising. Jay Rayner, TV presenter and the Observer's food critic 9 Nanotechnology: 'Privacy will be a quaint obsession' Twenty years ago, Don Eigler, a scientist working for IBM in California, wrote out the logo of his employer in letters made of individual atoms. This feat was a graphic symbol of the potential of the new field of nanotechnology, which promises to rebuild matter atom by atom, molecule by molecule, and to give us unprecedented power over the material world. Some, like the futurist Ray Kurzweil, predict that nanotechnology will lead to a revolution, allowing us to make any kind of product for virtually nothing; to have computers so powerful that they will surpass human intelligence; and to lead to a new kind of medicine on a sub-cellular level that will allow us to abolish ageing and death. I don't think that Kurzweil's \"technological singularity\" – a dream of scientific transcendence that echoes older visions of religious apocalypse – will happen. Some stubborn physics stands between us and \"the rapture of the nerds\". But nanotechnology will lead to some genuinely transformative applications. New ways of making solar cells very cheaply on a very large scale offer us the best hope we have for providing low-carbon energy on a big enough scale to satisfy the needs of a growing world population aspiring to the prosperity we're used to in the developed world. We'll learn more about intervening in our biology at the sub-cellular level and this nano-medicine will give us new hope of overcoming really difficult and intractable diseases, such as Alzheimer's, that will increasingly afflict our population as it ages. The information technology that drives your mobile phone or laptop is already operating at the nanoscale. Another 25 years of development will lead us to a new world of cheap and ubiquitous computing, in which privacy will be a quaint obsession of our grandparents. Nanotechnology is a different type of science, respecting none of the conventional boundaries between disciplines and unashamedly focused on applications rather than fundamental understanding. Given the huge resources being directed towards nanotechnology in China and its neighbours, this may also be the first major technology of the modern era that is predominantly developed outside the US and Europe. Richard Jones, pro-vice-chancellor for research and innovation at the University of Sheffield 10 Gaming: 'We'll play games to solve problems' In the last decade, in the US and Europe but particularly in south-east Asia, we have witnessed a flight into virtual worlds, with people playing games such as Second Life. But over the course of the next 25 years, that flight will be successfully reversed, not because we're going to spend less time playing games, but because games and virtual worlds are going to become more closely connected to reality. There will be games where the action is influenced by what happens in reality; and there will be games that use sensors so that we can play them out in the real world – a game in which your avatar is your dog, which wears a game collar that measures how fast it's running and whether or not it's wagging its tail, for example, where you play with your dog to advance the narrative, as opposed to playing with a virtual character. I can imagine more physical activity games, too, and these might be used to harness energy – peripherals like a dance pad that actually captures energy from your dancing on top of it. Then there will be problem-solving games: there are already a lot of games in which scientists try to teach gamers real science – how to build proteins to cure cancer, for example. One surprising trend in gaming is that gamers today prefer, on average, three to one to play co-operative games rather than competitive games. Now, this is really interesting; if you think about the history of games, there really weren't co-operative games until this latest generation of video games. In every game you can think of – card games, chess, sport – everybody plays to win. But now we'll see increasing collaboration, people playing games together to solve problems while they're enjoying themselves. There are also studies on how games work on our minds and our cognitive capabilities, and a lot of science suggests you can use games to treat depression, anxiety and attention-deficit disorder. Making games that are both fun and serve a social purpose isn't easy – a lot of innovation will be required – but gaming will become increasingly integrated into society. Jane McGonigal, director of games research &amp; development at the Institute for the Future in California and author of Reality Is Broken: Why Games Make Us Happy and How They Can Help Us Change the World (Penguin) 11 Web/internet: 'Quantum computing is the future' The open web created by idealist geeks, hippies and academics, who believed in the free and generative flow of knowledge, is being overrun by a web that is safer, more controlled and commercial, created by problem-solving pragmatists. Henry Ford worked out how to make money by making products people wanted to own and buy for themselves. Mark Zuckerberg and Steve Jobs are working out how to make money from allowing people to share, on their terms. Facebook and Apple are spawning cloud capitalism, in which consumers allow companies to manage information, media, ideas, money, software, tools and preferences on their behalf, holding everything in vast, floating clouds of shared data. We will be invited to trade invasions into our privacy – companies knowing ever more about our lives – for a more personalised service. We will be able to share, but on their terms. Julian Assange and the movement that has been ignited by WikiLeaks is the most radical version of the alternative: a free, egalitarian, open and public web. The fate of this movement will be a sign of things to come. If it can command broad support, then the open web has a chance to remain a mainstream force. If, however, it becomes little more than a guerrilla campaign, then the open web could be pushed to the margins, along with national public radio. By 2035, the web, as a single space largely made up of webpages accessed on computers, will be long gone. As the web goes mobile, those who pay more will get faster access. We will be sharing videos, simulations, experiences and environments, on a multiplicity of devices to which we'll pay as much attention as a light switch. Yet, many of the big changes of the next 25 years will come from unknowns working in their bedrooms and garages. And by 2035 we will be talking about the coming of quantum computing, which will take us beyond the world of binary, digital computing, on and off, black and white, 0s and 1s. The small town of Waterloo, Ontario, which is home to the Perimeter Institute, funded by the founder of BlackBerry, currently houses the largest collection of theoretical physicists in the world. The bedrooms of Waterloo are where the next web may well be made. Charles Leadbeater, author and social entrepreneur 12 Fashion: 'Technology creates smarter clothes' Fashion is such an important part of the way in which we communicate our identity to others, and for a very long time it's meant dress: the textile garments on our body. But in the coming decades, I think there'll be much more emphasis on other manifestations of fashion and different ways of communicating with each other, different ways of creating a sense of belonging and of making us feel great about ourselves. We're already designing our identities online – manipulating imagery to tell a story about ourselves. Instead of meeting in the street or in a bar and having a conversation and looking at what each other is wearing, we're communicating in some depth through these new channels. With clothing, I think it's possible that we'll see a polarisation between items that are very practical and those that are very much about display – and maybe these are not things that you own but that you borrow or share. Technology is already being used to create clothing that fits better and is smarter; it is able to transmit a degree of information back to you. This is partly driven by customer demand and the desire to know where clothing comes from – so we'll see tags on garments that tell you where every part of it was made, and some of this, I suspect, will be legislation-driven, too, for similar reasons, particularly as resources become scarcer and it becomes increasingly important to recognise water and carbon footprints. However, it's not simply an issue of functionality. Fashion's gone through a big cycle in the last 25 years – from being something that was treasured and cherished to being something that felt disposable, because of a drop in prices. In fact, we've completely changed our relationship towards clothes and there's a real feeling among designers who I work with that they're trying to work back into their designs an element of emotional content. I think there's definitely a place for technology in creating a dialogue with you through your clothes. Dilys Williams, designer and the director for sustainable fashion at the London College of Fashion 13 Nature: 'We'll redefine the wild' We all want to live in a world where species such as tigers, the great whales, orchids and coral reefs can persist and thrive and I am sure that the commitment that people have to maintaining the spectacle and diversity of life will continue. Over the past 50 years or so, there has been growing support for nature conservation. When we understand the causes of species losses, good conservation actions can and do reverse the trends. But it is going to become much harder. The human population has roughly doubled since the 1960s and will increase by another third by 2030. Demands for food, water and energy will increase, inevitably in competition with other species. People already use up to 40% of the world's primary production (energy) and this must increase, with important consequences for nature. In the UK, some familiar species will become scarcer as our rare habitats (mires, bogs and moorlands) are lost. We will be seeing the effects from gradual warming that will allow more continental species to live here, and in our towns and cities we'll probably have more species that have become adapted to living alongside people. We can conserve species when we really try, so I'm confident that the charismatic mega fauna and flora will mostly still persist in 2035, but they will be increasingly restricted to highly managed and protected areas. The survivors will be those that cope well with people and those we care about enough to save. Increasingly, we won't be living as a part of nature but alongside it, and we'll have redefined what we mean by the wild and wilderness. Crucially, we are still rapidly losing overall biodiversity, including soil micro-organisms, plankton in the oceans, pollinators and the remaining tropical and temperate forests. These underpin productive soils, clean water, climate regulation and disease-resistance. We take these vital services from biodiversity and ecosystems for granted, treat them recklessly and don't include them in any kind of national accounting. Georgina Mace, professor of conservation science and director of the Natural Environment Research Council's Centre for Population Biology, Imperial College London 14 Architecture: What constitutes a 'city' will change In 2035, most of humanity will live in favelas. This will not be entirely wonderful, as many people will live in very poor housing, but it will have its good side. It will mean that cities will consist of series of small units organised, at best, by the people who know what is best for themselves and, at worst, by local crime bosses. Cities will be too big and complex for any single power to understand and manage them. They already are, in fact. The word \"city\" will lose some of its meaning: it will make less and less sense to describe agglomerations of tens of millions of people as if they were one place, with one identity. If current dreams of urban agriculture come true, the distinction between town and country will blur. Attempts at control won't be abandoned, however, meaning that strange bubbles of luxury will appear, like shopping malls and office parks. To be optimistic, the human genius for inventing social structures will mean that new forms of settlement we can't quite imagine will begin to emerge. All this assumes that environmental catastrophe doesn't drive us into caves. Nor does it describe what will happen in Britain, with a roughly stable population and a planning policy dedicated to preserving the status quo as much as possible. Britain in 25 years' time may look much as it does now, which is not hugely different from 25 years ago. Rowan Moore, Observer architecture correspondent 15 Sport: 'Broadcasts will use holograms' Globalisation in sport will continue: it's a trend we've seen by the choice of Rio for the 2016 Olympics and Qatar for the 2022 World Cup. This will mean changes to traditional sporting calendars in recognition of the demands of climate and time zones across the planet. Sport will have to respond to new technologies, the speed at which we process information and apparent reductions in attention span. Shorter formats, such as Twenty20 cricket and rugby sevens, could aid the development of traditional sports in new territories. The demands of TV will grow, as will technology's role in umpiring and consuming sport. Electronics companies are already planning broadcasts using live holograms. I don't think we'll see an acceptance of performance-enhancing drugs: the trend has been towards zero tolerance and long may it remain so. Mike Lee, chairman of Vero Communications and ex-director of communications for London's 2012 Olympic bid 16 Transport: 'There will be more automated cars' It's not difficult to predict how our transport infrastructure will look in 25 years' time – it can take decades to construct a high-speed rail line or a motorway, so we know now what's in store. But there will be radical changes in how we think about transport. The technology of information and communication networks is changing rapidly and internet and mobile developments are helping make our journeys more seamless. Queues at St Pancras station or Heathrow airport when the infrastructure can't cope for whatever reason should become a thing of the past, but these challenges, while they might appear trivial, are significant because it's not easy to organise large-scale information systems. The instinct to travel is innate within us, but we will have to do it in a more carbon-efficient way. It's hard to be precise, but I think we'll be cycling and walking more; in crowded urban areas we may see travelators – which we see in airports already – and more scooters. There will be more automated cars, like the ones Google has recently been testing. These driverless cars will be safer, but when accidents do happen, they may be on the scale of airline disasters. Personal jetpacks will, I think, remain a niche choice. Frank Kelly, professor of the mathematics of systems at Cambridge University, and former chief scientific adviser to the DfT 17 Health: 'We'll feel less healthy' Health systems are generally quite conservative. That's why the more radical forecasts of the recent past haven't quite materialised. Contrary to past predictions, we don't carry smart cards packed with health data; most treatments aren't genetically tailored; and health tourism to Bangalore remains low. But for all that, health is set to undergo a slow but steady revolution. Life expectancy is rising about three months each year, but we'll feel less healthy, partly because we'll be more aware of the many things that are, or could be, going wrong, and partly because more of us will be living with a long-term condition. We'll spend more on health but also want stronger action to influence health. The US Congressional Budget Office forecasts that US health spending will rise from 17% of the economy today to 25% in 2025 and 49% in 2082. Their forecasts may be designed to shock but they contain an important grain of truth. Spending on health and jobs in health is bound to grow. Some of that spending will go on the problems of prosperity – obesity, alcohol consumption and injuries from extreme sports. Currently fashionable ideas of \"nudge\" will have turned out to be far too weak to change behaviours. Instead, we'll be more in the realms of \"shove\" and \"push\", with cities trying to reshape whole environments to encourage people to walk and cycle. By 2030, mental health may at last be treated on a par with physical health. Medicine may have found smart drugs for some conditions but the biggest impact may be achieved from lower-tech actions, such as meditation in schools or brain gyms for pensioners. Healthcare will look more like education. Your GP will prescribe you a short course on managing your diabetes or heart condition, and when you get home there'll be an e-tutor to help you and a vast array of information about your condition. Almost every serious observer of health systems believes that the great general hospitals are already anachronistic, but because hospitals are where so much of the power lies, and so much of the public attachment, it would be a brave forecaster who suggested their imminent demise. Geoff Mulgan, chief executive of the Young Foundation 18 Religion: 'Secularists will flatter to deceive' Over the next two and a half decades, it is quite possible that those Brits who follow a religion will continue both to fall in number and also become more orthodox or fundamentalist. Similarly, organised religions will increasingly work together to counter what they see as greater threats to their interests – creeping agnosticism and secularity. Another 10 years of failure by the Anglican church to face down the African-led traditionalists over women bishops and gay clerics could open the question of disestablishment of the Church of England. The country's politicians, including an increasingly gay-friendly Tory party, may find it difficult to see how state institutions can continue to be associated with an image of sexism and homophobia. I predict an increase in debate around the tension between a secular agenda which says it is merely seeking to remove religious privilege, end discrimination and separate church and state, and organised orthodox religion which counterclaims that this would amount to driving religious voices from the public square. Despite two of the three party leaders being professed atheists, the secular tendency in this country still flatters to deceive. There is, at present, no organised, non-religious, rationalist movement. In contrast, the forces of organised religion are better resourced, more organised and more politically influential than ever before. Dr Evan Harris, author of a secularist manifesto 19 Theatre: 'Cuts could force a new political fringe' The theatre will weather the recent cuts. Some companies will close and the repertoire of others will be safe and cautious; the art form will emerge robust in a decade or so. The cuts may force more young people outside the existing structures back to an unsubsidised fringe and this may breed different types of work that will challenge the subsidised sector. Student marches will become more frequent and this mobilisation may breed a more politicised generation of theatre artists. We will see old forms from the 1960s re-emerge (like agit prop) and new forms will be generated to communicate ideology and politics. More women will emerge as directors, writers and producers. This change is already visible at the flagship subsidised house, the National Theatre, where the repertoire for bigger theatres like the Lyttelton already includes directors like Marianne Elliott and Josie Rourke, and soon the Cottesloe will start to embrace the younger generation – Polly Findlay and Lyndsey Turner.

It's just that with the multifarious delights of the internet, spending 20 hours in the company of one writer and one story needs motivation. It's worth doing, of course; like exercise, its benefits are many and its pleasures great. And yet everyone I know is doing it less. And I can't see that that trend will reverse. That's the bad news. Twenty-five years from now, we'll be reading fewer books for pleasure. But authors shouldn't fret too much; e-readers will make it easier to impulse-buy books at 4am even if we never read past the first 100 pages. And stories aren't becoming less popular – they're everywhere, from adverts to webcomics to fictional tweets – we're only beginning to explore the exciting possibilities of web-native literature, stories that really exploit the fractal, hypertextual way we use the internet. My guess is that, in 2035, stories will be ubiquitous. There'll be a tube-based soap opera to tune your iPod to during your commute, a tale (incorporating on-sale brands) to enjoy via augmented reality in the supermarket. Your employer will bribe you with stories to focus on your job. Most won't be great, but then most of everything isn't great – and eventually there'll be a Twitter-based classic.

The findings follow an extensive investigation into data taken from US and European satellites over 22 years. Experts hope the project, which has mapped levels of solar energy across the globe, will assist ongoing research into climate change, health and agriculture. The results have already been used to help businesses site solar panels in Morocco. \"In the developed world we have good surface solar measurements,\" said Richard Eckman, manager of the Nasa programme at Langley, Virginia. \"When you go elsewhere the data is much sparser - that's where the satellites can help. \"Our goal is to find more practical applications of Nasa-derived satellite operations across a whole range, such as energy or agricultural efficiency.\" The Nasa team found that the sun blazes down most fiercely on a patch of the Pacific on the equator, south of Hawaii and east of the island of Kiribati. An area of the Sahara near the ruined fort at Agadem, south-east Niger, was also found to soak up high levels of solar energy. \"For some reason there are fewer clouds just there than elsewhere,\" Paul Stackhouse, a senior scientist at Langley, told Reuters. The area of desert recorded an average of 6.78 kilowatt hours of solar energy per square metre per day from 1983-2005. The amount is roughly the amount of electricity used in one day by a typical American home to heat water. The patch in the Pacific received 6.92 kilowatt hours. Experts hope the groundbreaking research could help guide businesses, which are currently investing billions of pounds in solar energy. The research could assist in positioning wind farms, or allow farmers to grow more suitable crops depending on the amount of solar energy available. The hottest ever recorded temperature was in Al-Aziziyah, Libya, in 1922 at 57.7C (136F).

The preamble to the main event consisted of a full slate of workshops and DIY hackathons, which proved fun for attendees. Among the workshops that went down particularly well: a build-your-own online maps tutorial from Stamen; MIT's stitch-and-bitch on wearable computing, and Rob Faludi's session on building wireless, social objects. But there's no denying that the atmosphere so far has been quite low key - one regular attendee told me that he'd \"never seen it this quiet before. Perhaps it's the result of the recession, the decision to move things from San Diego to San Jose, or simply because the programme isn't in full swing yet. In any case, it can't particularly please Tim O'Reilly, the techno-publishing maven whose company puts on the event (and calls it their most important conference)… but tomorrow is another day. Still, to welcome everyone into the fold, O'Reilly (who, for the uninitiated, he unleashed the phrase \"web 2.0\" on the world) took the stage for a talk about why he thought ETech matters now. He begins by reiterating his argument that technologists need to start doing things that have genuine benefits – not just creating mindless Facebook apps (or \"throwing sheep\" as he puts it). \"There's a certain way that the technology industry, particularly in its focus on consumer electronics, was missing something,\" he says. \"It was focusing on consumption, on advertising, on selling people things that they don't really need.\" \"When I urged people in the technology world to think deeply about what matters. A lot of people thought I was saying to work on non-profits, or maybe social ventures. But I don't think we should relegate what's important to the world of non-profits. We need to reinvent our world so that we see working on stuff that matters as the heart of opportunity. The world's great challenges are also the world's great opportunities.\" He goes through to list a few examples of what he means by that: Shai Agassi's Better Place, which doesn't just want people to build electric cars – he wants them to be able to use them wherever they go. \"He may not succeed, but that's OK. He's tackling something that's really great, and going at it really strategically.\" Along the way he refers to 1366 Technologies – which wants to make solar energy cheaper than coal – and Makani Power, founded by his son-in-law Saul Griffith, which is working on high-altitude wind energy. \"One of the guys there, Jim McBride, worked on Wall Street as a quant, but came there because he said the math was harder,\" says O'Reilly. \"I love those stories of people picking something to do, not because they're going to get rich but because it's hard.\" He moves onto the story of Brewster Kahle, the curator of archive.org – the library of the web – and Carl Malamud, who has been running a campaign for the last decade to get public data online (sounds familiar). \"What seemed quixotic has now become part of the platform of the man who's become the next president of the United States. That man picks someone as his CIO somebody who's trying to pick out Carl's vision [meaning Vivek Kundra]\" \"Don't be afraid to dream big,\" he says. O'Reilly then points out that he's just spent the past couple of weeks in Washington, and wants to share some of that; to explain why they're running a new conference Government 2.0 in DC in the autumn. \"We have the idea of the government as this oppressive entity that we want to keep at a distant, but I was amazed by how committed those people in Washington are,\" he says. \"There are also these amazing problems of this antiquated machine.\" \"We need to give all of our support to the people who have the courage to fight the battle and cut that Gordian knots that have built up over hundreds of years in Washington.\" \"I think we have about two years to really make a difference. If we don't make progress in that time, people will start to run against him on those issues because they didn't work.\" He mentions that we should begin taking the long view; looking at multigenerational problems, and understanding \"You set things in motion, and then you go to meet up with them 20 or 30 years later. It helped me set up my company; setting things in motion for a future that I didn't quite understand yet. You don't know the future, but you can rise to meet it – even a very distant goal.\" \"We don't care about time,\" he adds. \"Many of our problems have crept up on us because we're living the present in a way we should not be. We should be taking the long view of where we are and what we're doing.\" O'Reilly goes on a little trip through the world of scenario planning: wondering whether our current models of the future are enough. \"What you're trying to develop are robust strategies that will help you through any of these scenarios. What are the things that will be good regardless?\" \"I urge you to think: what are the extremes that can happen to the things I care about – and what are the things I can do? It's really a game of choose your own adventure. Find a place where you can make a difference – and make it count.\" And here we come with the takeaway points: 1. Work on something that matters to you more than money. Be prepared to do something great, flame out and then move on, he says, then uses the analogy of a road trip: you need to keep an eye on the gas tank (your finances), but we're not going on a tour of gas stations. 2. Think about how to create more value than you capture There were people who knew that Ponzi-scheming Wall Street mogul Bernie Madoff was up to something, but they didn't voice their concerns because they wanted to capture the value anyway. This recession is due to the fact that the pressure of greed became systemic – a human pathology that went awry, an illness that we're all suffering from now. 3. Build a simple system – let it evolve. The first IBM PC was open, people continued to build on it. The early world wide web – Tim Berners Lee defined a few simple rules, and people came and built on that. We're seeing that today on Twitter, for example. 4. Be friendly to those who extend you. My whole career is taking what I've learned and saying look at this! I spend my time doing that in publishing, I spend my time doing that at conferences. Changing the world by spreading the knowledge of innovators. So. If you've made it to the bottom, well done. Tomorrow we're going to be blogging from some of the sessions: including former One Laptop Per Child guru Mary Lou Jepsen, Chumby Industries Bunnie Hwang and researchers from MIT, NYU and elsewhere."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2008/jul/22/solarpower.windpower","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2008-07-22T15:50:22Z","webTitle":"Saharan sun could power European supergrid","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/jul/22/solarpower.windpower","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2008/jul/22/solarpower.windpower","fields":{"headline":"Saharan sun to power European supergrid","bodyText":"Vast farms of solar panels in the Sahara desert could provide clean electricity for the whole of Europe, according to EU scientists working on a plan to pool the region's renewable energy. Harnessing the power of the desert sun is at the centre of ambitious scheme to build a €45bn (£35.7bn) European supergrid that would allow countries across the continent to share electricity from abundant green sources such as wind energy in the UK and Denmark and geothermal energy from Iceland and Italy. The idea is gaining growing political support in Europe with both Gordon Brown and Nicholas Sarkozy recently giving backing to the north African solar plan. Speaking today at the Euroscience Open Forum in Barcelona, Arnulf Jaeger-Walden of the European commission's Institute for Energy, said it would require the capture of just 0.3% of the light falling on the Sahara and Middle Eastern deserts to provide all of Europe's energy needs. In addition, because the sunlight in this area is more intense, solar photovoltaic (PV) panels in northern Africa could generate up to three times the electricity compared with similar panels in northern Europe. Jaeger-Walden explained how electricity produced in solar farms in Africa, each containing power plants generating around 50-200MW of power, could be fed thousands of miles across European countries by using high-voltage direct current transmission lines instead of the traditional alternating current lines. Energy losses on DC lines are far lower than AC ones where transmission of energy over long distances is uneconomic. \"If you look at solar radiation, then the Mediterranean region is a very favourable one,\" said Jaeger-Walden. He said that the proposed grid was a way to balance out the intermittencies of renewable energy: \"If you can connect the grid to hydro power, you've got that as a backup battery, and in addition there's wind. It's not a single source that's providing the energy but a combination of the different renewable energies.\" Conveniently the potential to generate solar energy, either from photovoltaic cells, or by using it to heat water, is at its highest exactly when there is peak demand. \"Between 11am and 1pm – there are a lot of cooking activities going on, people are going home, air conditioners are used,\" he said. The idea of developing solar farms in the Mediterranean region and north Africa was given a boost recently by French president Nicholas Sarkozy earlier this month when he highlighted solar farms in north Africa as a key part of the work of his newly-formed Mediterranean Union. Depending on the size of the grid, building the necessary high voltage lines across Europe could cost up to €1bn a year every year till 2050 but Jaeger-Walden pointed out that the figure was small when compared to a recent prediction by the International Energy Agency that the world needs to invest more than $45tr (£22.5tr) in energy systems over the next 30 years. Much of the cost would come in developing the public grid networks of connecting countries in the southern Mediterranean, which do not currently have the spare capacity to carry the electricity that the north African solar farms could generate. \"Even if high voltage cables between North Africa and Italy would be built or the existing cable between Morocco and Spain would be used, the infrastructure of the transfer countries such as Italy, Spain, Greece and Turkey also needs a major restructuring,\" said Jaeger-Walden. Scientists working on the project admit that it would take many years and huge investment to generate enough solar energy from north Africa to power Europe but envisage that by 2050 it could produce 100 GW, more than the the combined electricity output from all sources in the UK, with an investment of around €450bn. Doug Parr, Greenpeace UK's chief scientist, welcomed the proposals. \"Assuming it's cost-effective, a large scale renewable energy grid is just the kind of innovation we need if we're going to beat climate change. Europe needs to become a zero-carbon society as soon as possible, and that will only happen with bold new ideas like this one. Tinkering with 20th-century technologies like coal and nuclear simply isn't going to get us there.\" Jaeger-Walden also believes that scaling up solar PV by having large solar farms could help bring its cost down for consumers. \"The biggest PV system at the moment is installed in Leipzig and the price of the installation is €3.25 per watt. If we could realise that in the Mediterranean, for example in southern Italy, this would correspond to electricity prices in the range of 15 cents per KWh, something below what the average consumer is paying.\" The vision for the renewable energy grid comes as the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) published its strategic energy technology plan, highlighting solar PV as one of eight technologies that need to be championed for the short to medium term future. \"It recognises something extraordinary – if we don't put together resources and findings across Europe and we let go the several sectors of energy, we will never reach these targets. We need a coordination of research applied to different fields,\" said Giovanni de Santi, director of the JRC, also speaking in Barcelona. The JRC plan includes fuel cells and hydrogen, clean coal, second-generation biofuels, nuclear fusion, wind, nuclear fission and smart grids. De Santi said it was designed to help Europe to meet its commitments to reduce overall energy consumption by 20% by 2020 while reducing CO2 emissions by 20% in the same time and increasing to 20% the proportion of energy generated from renewable sources. High-voltage transmission lines First developed in the 1930s, High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) transmission lines are seen as the most efficient way to move electricity over long without incurring the losses experienced in normal AC power lines. HVDC cables can carry more power for the same thickness of cable compared with AC lines but are only suited to long-distance transmission because they require expensive devices called static inverters to convert the electricity, usually generated as AC, into DC. Modern HVDC cables can keep energy losses down to around 3% per 1,000km. Another advantage of HVDC is that it can be used as a link to transfer electricity between different countries that might use AC systems at differing frequencies. Alternatively, the HVDC cables could be used to synchronise the AC currents produced by renewable energy sources such as wind turbine farms."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2008/nov/27/climate-change-carbon-emissions-heathrow","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2008-11-27T00:01:00Z","webTitle":"Aviation can expand while meeting climate targets, says watchdog","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/nov/27/climate-change-carbon-emissions-heathrow","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2008/nov/27/climate-change-carbon-emissions-heathrow","fields":{"headline":"Aviation can expand while meeting climate targets, says watchdog","bodyText":"The UK could meet its ambitious pledge to slash greenhouse gas pollution even if ministers give the go-ahead to expanding Heathrow airport, the government's leading climate change adviser has signalled. This week the chairman of the government's Environment Agency, Lord Smith of Finsbury, joined critics who say that adding a third runway at Britain's biggest airport would destroy the government's promise to tackle climate change, and increase local air and noise pollution to intolerable levels. But when asked about the contentious Heathrow plan, Lord Turner, chairman of the independent Climate Change Committee, told the Guardian that it would be possible for aviation to be expanded while still meeting the target of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by the middle of this century, especially if airlines were able to use biofuels or other low-carbon power sources. \"It's possible for the world to cut greenhouse gases while still not cutting aviation by anything like as much, even increase aviation emissions,\" he said. While not an endorsement of the plans, the comments could pave the way for an announcement before Christmas that Heathrow's owner, BAA, can build a third runway and new terminal to cater for hundreds more flights every day. Turner was speaking days before the committee will publish its first report outlining how the government will meet its promise on cutting greenhouse gases. Monday's report will include interim targets for reductions which must be achieved up to 2022. He also warned that: • Major organisations must not use the recession as an excuse to duck ambitious plans to build a low-carbon economy. • Promises of new jobs in the green economy should not be overstated by supporters. He said the recession posed some threats, such as the loss of investment capital, but also opportunities, such as the potential for lower demand for steel and specialist engineering skills which should help reduce costs for renewable energy suppliers, especially wind-turbine manufacturers and operators. In the short term, emissions should also decline as output fell, but companies should not stop investing in efficiency and clean technology to cut emissions in the longer term. Turner said: \"It's very important to avoid misuse of the temporary downturn for lessening policies.\" He warned that supporters of a so-called \"green new deal\" should not exaggerate the number of jobs that would be created, but insisted that the changes should not hurt investment or employment. \"Everything we know about economic theory tells us there will be as many jobs in a low-carbon economy as a high-carbon economy,\" he said. The comments come amid concern that the economic downturn could signal an end to political and business commitments, including green taxes and regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Following lobbying by the car industry across Europe, the government yesterday watered down a recommended new car emissions target for 2012, saying it would phase in a target by 2020, though it added that it was also pushing for a lower limit. Shell and BP have been among companies that have pulled out of wind and solar energy projects in the UK, citing better returns in the US, and European plans for ambitious targets for renewable energy and emission cuts have been threatened by lobbying from businesses. The government's climate change target - formally passed into law last night when the Climate Change Act received royal assent - includes aviation and shipping, though it will not specifically set a target for Heathrow. This week Alistair Darling's pre-budget report included measures to stimulate green investment, such as extra money for home insulation, but he was criticised for delaying higher taxes on more polluting cars and bringing forward spending for motorway widening. Environment campaigners were also disappointed that the government did not adopt a more aggressive package of investment in renewable energy and low-carbon technology as a way of creating thousands of new jobs, along the lines of the plans being signalled by the US president-elect, Barack Obama. However, John Kerry, who will lead the US Senate delegation at the UN climate talks in Poland in December, warned yesterday that hopes the US could help lead a global green recovery by paying countries such as India and China to reduce their greenhouse gases might be constrained by the economic crisis. \"The bottom line is we are not going to be in the position we were in two years ago in the short term to do as much technology transfer or economic assistance in terms of transitional issues that might have led other countries to participate.\" · This article was amended on Thursday December 4 2008 after an editorial decision was taken that the previous headline \"Climate change watchdog backs expansion of Heathrow\" was misleading.

But only one has given itself a second moniker, a move that matches its bold environmental vision. Welcome to New Mexico, the Land of Enchantment – now also known as the Clean Energy State. Since giving his state its new nickname four years ago, governor Bill Richardson has helped create at least 37 incentive programmes promoting green power. From utility-bill discounts to a statewide renewable portfolio standard (RPS) for electricity, New Mexico's 2m residents are given every opportunity to weave clean energy into their daily lives. \"The RPS drives consumption of renewables within the state,\" Sarah Cottrell, Richardson's energy policy adviser, said. \"We have so much potential here for wind and solar that it far exceeds the demand.\" The state's journey to environmental leadership is even more notable because of the inaction that has persisted at the national level. Although 25 states have approved their own RPS, a national standard has stalled in the face of resistance from traditional coal-powered utilities and their allies in Congress. Wind and biomass are popular in New Mexico, but the desert sun that draws millions of tourists here also makes its solar power potential the second largest in America. So it is that the Clean Energy State's future just may lie in the south corner of Albuquerque, at the end of a dry road marked by a mile-long sculpture of a snake with jewelled eyes. The road ends at Mesa del Sol, a 13,000-acre development area that is poised to become a hotbed of the US solar industry. Aided by a $10m (£5m) investment from the state government, Advent Solar is already producing cutting-edge \"back contact\" cells at Mesa del Sol. Advent's design places electric contacts at the rear of the solar cell panel rather than the front-loaded style common in most panels, maximising the light energy that is trapped for household use. For now Advent focuses on exporting cells to the booming European solar market. \"It's good for the trade deficit and good for the environment,\" company spokeswoman Misty Benham said. That could change when Advent gets a new neighbour in Germany's Schott Solar. The world No 8 in cell production, Schott plans to invest $100m in its new Albuquerque plant. \"According to both industry analysts and our projections, the market for solar energy will double over the next five years,\" Schott chairman Udo Ungeheuer said as he announced the plant opening. The prospect of two New Mexico-based solar companies vying for a foothold in the growing US market is a compelling one. \"We're beating them to the punch,\" Benham, of Advent, said. Yet again it all comes down to Washington – and the dream may slip away if Congress does not extend the solar energy tax credit this year. Both the solar and wind credits are mired in political squabbling. Analysts warn that Schott and other companies could scale back their US investments without the certainty of a long-term tax benefit. Still, New Mexico is working hard to earn its new nickname. Richardson formed the Western Climate Initiative last year with four other governors to focus on sustainability goals because, as Cottrell put it, \"the feds aren't acting fast enough\". And just as Advent looks for a foothold over Schott in the New Mexico solar market, the state has found itself competing with nearby California over the pace of clean energy reforms. Richardson's aides have developed a \"pretty entertaining rivalry with Governor [Arnold] Schwarzenegger's people\", Cottrell said. \"We believe no one's done as much as fast as we have.\" Despite the array of energy incentives available to New Mexicans, the state's achievement may ultimately be measured in what leaves its borders. The American southwest contains more than 250,000 square miles of land ripe for solar power generation, but the bigger challenge lies in transmitting that energy to the grid. Barack Obama and John McCain are also working hard to win the southwest in November by emphasising renewable energy. The presidential rivals visited New Mexico within a week of each other last month, and Obama is heading to Las Vegas today for a town hall meeting to promote his clean-power plans. With that in mind, New Mexico is taking steps toward the export of clean power, becoming the first US state to form a renewable energy transmission authority (Reta) that provides financing for new high-voltage lines and towers. (Texas, Nevada, and California have similar transmission initiatives.) Transmission is not cheap - the average 345-kV power line costs $1.5m per mile to lay, according to the chief of New Mexico's Reta, former BP executive Lisa Szot. But it is one area where states can make progress. \"States need to be involved in transmission,\" Szot said. \"The federal government isn't involved in permitting and siting [of new power lines]. That even goes down to the county level.\" The process of building transmission infrastructure in New Mexico is a free-market conservative's dream: Szot fields ambitious proposals from clean energy firms and offers financing mechanisms, chiefly tax-exempt bonds, to those with the best project ideas. Making the leap from New Mexico's homegrown green movement to a thriving solar power export market may be as simple as electing a Democratic president in November. Obama has put renewables at the top of his agenda, and the companies such as Advent are comfortable putting down roots in the Clean Energy State. \"The fact that [New Mexico officials] stood up and fought for us\" convinced Advent to choose Mesa del Sol, Benham said. \"They're very aware of renewables here.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2008/sep/21/scienceofclimatechange.climatechange","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2008-09-20T23:01:00Z","webTitle":"Einstein fridge design can help global cooling","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/sep/21/scienceofclimatechange.climatechange","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2008/sep/21/scienceofclimatechange.climatechange","fields":{"headline":"Einstein fridge design can help global cooling","bodyText":"An early invention by Albert Einstein has been rebuilt by scientists at Oxford University who are trying to develop an environmentally friendly refrigerator that runs without electricity. Modern fridges are notoriously damaging to the environment. They work by compressing and expanding man-made greenhouse gases called freons - far more damaging that carbon dioxide - and are being manufactured in increasing numbers. Sales of fridges around the world are rising as demand increases in developing countries. Now Malcolm McCulloch, an electrical engineer at Oxford who works on green technologies, is leading a three-year project to develop more robust appliances that can be used in places without electricity. His team has completed a prototype of a type of fridge patented in 1930 by Einstein and his colleague, the Hungarian physicist Leo Szilard. It had no moving parts and used only pressurised gases to keep things cold. The design was partly used in the first domestic refrigerators, but the technology was abandoned when more efficient compressors became popular in the 1950s. That meant a switch to using freons. Einstein and Szilard's idea avoids the need for freons. It uses ammonia, butane and water and takes advantage of the fact that liquids boil at lower temperatures when the air pressure around them is lower. 'If you go to the top of Mount Everest, water boils at a much lower temperature than it does when you're at sea level and that's because the pressure is much lower up there,' said McCulloch. At one side is the evaporator, a flask that contains butane. 'If you introduce a new vapour above the butane, the liquid boiling temperature decreases and, as it boils off, it takes energy from the surroundings to do so,' says McCulloch. 'That's what makes it cold.' Pressurised gas fridges based around Einstein's design were replaced by freon-compressor fridges partly because Einstein and Szilard's design was not very efficient. But McCulloch thinks that by tweaking the design and replacing the types of gases used it will be possible to quadruple the efficiency. He also wants to take the idea further. The only energy input needed into the fridge is to heat a pump, and McCulloch has been working on powering this with solar energy. 'No moving parts is a real benefit because it can carry on going without maintenance. This could have real applications in rural areas,' he said. McCulloch's is not the only technology to improve the environmental credentials of fridges. Engineers working at a Cambridge-based start-up company, Camfridge, are using magnetic fields to cool things. 'Our fridge works, from a conceptual point of view, in a similar way [to gas compressor fridges] but instead of using a gas we use a magnetic field and a special metal alloy,' said managing director Neil Wilson. 'When the magnetic field is next to the alloy, it's like compressing the gas, and when the magnetic field leaves, it's like expanding the gas.' He added: 'This effect can be seen in rubber bands - when you stretch the band it gets hot, and when you let the band contract it gets cold.' Doug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace UK, said creating greener fridges was hugely important. 'If you look at developing countries, if they're aspiring to the lifestyles that we lead, they're going to require more cooling - whether that's air conditioning, food cooling or freezing. Putting in place the technologies that are both low greenhouse-gas refrigerants and low energy use is critical.' McCulloch's fridge is still in its early stages. 'It's very much a prototype; this is nowhere near commercialised,' he said. 'Give us another month and we'll have it working.'"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global/2008/aug/25/solar.plane","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2008-08-25T14:17:30Z","webTitle":"Record breaker: solar-powered plane in air for 82 hours","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2008/aug/25/solar.plane","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global/2008/aug/25/solar.plane","fields":{"headline":"Solar plane flies for 82 hours","bodyText":"A British-built solar-powered spy plane has set an unofficial world record for the longest continuous flight. The uncrewed Zephyr aircraft stayed aloft for 82 hours and 37 minutes by storing solar energy collected during the day in a rechargeable battery which powered the plane's two propellers at night. The flight, at the US army's Yuma ground in Arizona, was aimed at testing Zephyr's ability to relay ground communications, so the flight did not fulfill all the technical requirements of a world record attempt. But by operating over three day-night cycles, the aircraft's designers at the UK defence firm Qinetiq believe it could essentially operate indefinitely. \"We think the aircraft in future will be capable of weeks or months duration,\" said Paul Davey, Zephyr's business development director at Qinetiq. The flight – which was partly autonomous and partly controlled from satellite – took place between July 28 and 31. Davey said the technical challenge in creating Zephyr was to produce an aircraft that is exceptionally light, but strong enough to carry its payload up to a cruising height of around 60,000 feet – twice the altitude of a commercial airliner. Zephyr has a carbon fibre frame and is covered in super-light solar arrays that are thinner than paper. The rechargeable battery it uses is twice as efficient as any other in the world. To make take-off simpler, the 30kg aircraft with a wingspan of 18 metres is launched be three people holding it above their heads as they run forward. It flies relatively slowly at 70 miles per hour and because of its low mass and low drag in the thin air at high altitude it needs very little power – equivalent to three or four lightbulbs. Zephyr can carry a payload of around 2kg – too small to act as a bomber. It is designed to relay radio messages from troops on the ground, but also to give the military enhanced surveillance. Unlike satellites that get a snapshot of a particular spot just twice in a 24-hour period, Zephyr can circle slowly overhead giving a constant bird's eye view of a location on the ground, such as an enemy military facility. \"They can perform those dangerous jobs, or jobs where you just can't get a manned aircraft,\" said Davey. He said Zephyr also will have important scientific applications – for example, it could follow the path of a developing hurricane, flying above the storm and dropping small devices that record wind speed, temperature and air pressure. Its main limitation though is sun. The shortness of the winter day at high latitudes, means that it cannot fly in winter any further north or south than 40 degrees – the latitude of southern Europe. The UK Ministry of Defence has funded the £20m development of Zephyr to date. Ultimately, Qinetiq aims to produce the aircraft for around £500,000 per plane. The US military funded the test flight in Arizona. The current official world record for uncrewed flight stands at 30 hours and 24 minutes, was set by Global Hawk in 2001. That aircraft was the first autonomous vehicle to fly non-stop across the Pacific Ocean. Qinetiq is also involved in a project to develop the Vulture aircraft for the US military which is designed to fly non-stop for 5 years."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/ethicallivingblog/2008/oct/17/sport-football-plymouthargle-ethicalliving","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2008-10-17T12:28:48Z","webTitle":"Football needs a league of green champions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ethicallivingblog/2008/oct/17/sport-football-plymouthargle-ethicalliving","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/ethicallivingblog/2008/oct/17/sport-football-plymouthargle-ethicalliving","fields":{"headline":"Football needs a league of green champions","bodyText":"\"Come on you greens!\" No, this is not a new battle cry to rouse the eco-minded folk among us. It happens to be the closest I can get living in Cornwall to hearing either a Football League or Premier League chant. Yes, Plymouth Argyle are based in the neighbouring county of Devon (boo, hiss), but that doesn't stop the Penzance-to-Plymouth trains filling up with Cornish supporters wearing green shirts on the Saturdays when the Pilgrims are playing at home. The irony, of course, is that the Pilgrims are far from being green in the environmental sense. Due to being located deep in the West Country, they are probably the most travelled set of supporters in the entire Football League. Just think about what those poor Pilgrims will have to endure in two weeks time. The Championship fixture computer has dictated that on Tuesday, October 28, they play Sheffield Wednesday away in the league, then just four days later they return to the Steel City to play Sheffield United. Those two return journeys mean the Pilgrims will have to travel 948 miles in four days. And two weeks later it's Coventry City away. (Just think if they were playing in Europe, too. OK, now I'm getting carried away.) But if there were a league of environmental purity for football teams, who would be champions? It's a question being asked in the forthcoming edition of Ethical Consumer magazine. It largely sticks to assessing Premier League sides, but the results are interesting nonetheless. When looking at just the environmental credentials of the stadium alone, then Manchester City's Eastlands comes out top with its recycling initiatives, on-site electric vehicles, and experiments with rainwater toilets and solar energy. (Apparently, plans to install an 85-metre wind turbine to power the stadium are on hold due to fears about ice falling from the blades in winter!) \"Most significantly,\" says Ethical Consumer, \"Man City has also worked with the local council and public transport providers to co-ordinate buses and trains and to promote safe walking and cycling routes. According to Pete Bradshaw, head of corporate responsibility at the club, this has led to a 50% cut in the number of parking spaces needed, with over 70% of fans coming to matches on foot or by bus.\" (Non-league Dartford actually gets the top marks for its new \"eco stadium\" which collects 20,000 litres of rainwater a day to water its pitch.) But haven't Man City just been bought up by Abu Dhabi United Group, which is owned by the emirate's oil-rich family? How does that affect Man City's eco rating? Well, Ethical Consumer has also assessed the clubs in terms of the environmental and ethical credentials of their owners. Needless to say, most of the Premiership clubs fare pretty badly on this front with their rag-tag mix of super-rich owners, many of whom, according to the magazine, have their fingers in all manner of unethical pies. In fact, none of the Premier League teams achieve an \"ethiscore\" higher than 10 out of 20. Aston Villa, Bolton Wanderers, Hull City, Middlesbrough, Portsmouth, Stoke City, Sunderland, West Bromwich Albion and Wigan all achieve this \"winning\" score. However, it's not the Big Four that prop up the table (Arsenal, 9; Man Utd 8.5; Liverpool, 8; Chelsea, 8), but Blackburn Rovers who score just 6 out of 20. They are marked down for being \"majority controlled by a trust representing the Walker family, whose money came from enterprises including Flybe and steel manufacturing\". Ethical Consumer rounds off its analysis with a grading of the teams according to the ethics of their principal sponsors. Stoke City win big (13 out of 20) by having Britannia Building Society emblazoned across their players' chests, whereas Arsenal and Man Utd prop up the bottom of the table for once for having Emirates and AIG on their shirts – two companies that the magazine has roundly criticised in the past. Ranking teams by ethics rather than goals scored is an illuminating experiment, but it has one obvious flaw: as a rule (yes, we all know the exceptions), people don't shop around for the best football clubs like they do with, say, supermarkets or energy suppliers. We're lumbered with the clubs we grew up supporting. Football is a logic-free zone, and will remain so. Despite all the protests about the often whimsical and illogical decision-making by owners (see Newcastle's treatment of Kevin Keegan and Man City's treatment of Sven-Goran Eriksson in recent months), very few fans ever boycott or change their club."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/dec/10/barack-obama-energy-department","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2008-12-10T21:00:00Z","webTitle":"Brian Beutler: To tackle climate change, Obama must revitalise the US department of energy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/dec/10/barack-obama-energy-department","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/dec/10/barack-obama-energy-department","fields":{"headline":"President Environment","bodyText":"President-elect Barack Obama is expected to announce his energy team this week, and its members promise (unsurprisingly) to be major improvements over George Bush's appointees. A striking fact about the past eight years of Republican rule is how difficult it has become to find an executive agency that Bush shaped appropriately to the times. It's not that every single agency became a conduit for political corruption (like the department of justice) or a money-laundering front for well-connected businessmen (like the Pentagon) but that just about all of them failed to adequately address the challenges they faced. In that sense, what happened at the department of energy under Bush is less a problem of outright abuse than it is a case study in missed opportunities. To understand what that means, it's helpful to examine the possibility that bama will select Steven Chu to run the agency come January. It's true that Chu has little-to-no Washington experience, and Obama's picks thus far signal that he values such experience. But Chu does have a Nobel prize. He's also spent the last four years running the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, a DOE facility, managed by the University of California and situated above the Berkeley campus in the hills of the East Bay overlooking San Francisco. According to the New York Times, he has \"shifted the lab's work more heavily into research into advanced biofuels, artificial photosynthesis and other solar energy research. He has been a vocal proponent of vigorous steps to control greenhouse gas emissions.\" For all that, there's plenty of reason to believe that Chu would do more than restore the DOE to the role it played in its pre-Bush days when it boasted several programmes designed to develop clean energy technologies and deploy them into the market place. One can imagine him working in conjunction with other agencies – like the Environmental Protection Agency and the transportation and interior departments – to create energy and infrastructure regulations that do not sit at odds, but rather harmonise with, one another. \"If the people running the agency believe in the issue ... there's just a lot of stuff that can be done,\" says Joe Romm, a senior fellow at the Centre for American Progress who served as acting assistant secretary of the DOE in the 1990s. According to Romm: \"The DOE can weigh in on what happens at the state level. It can dangle out carrots, reward intelligent action. A lot of stuff . ... It can have a huge impact without a major budget increase.\" But, of course, we got Bushed. During his presidency, the agency horribly boggled – and ultimately canceled – a public-private partnership to develop carbon capture technology for coal-fired power plants, and embarked on a quixotic mission to create hydrogen technology for the transportation sector. Instead of doubling down on clean energy research, many of those programmes were gutted or shut down early on. Instead of recasting the department as a player in the fight against climate change, it was employed as the guardian of aging nuclear facilities and an agent of the fossil fuel industry – its scientists, like scientists throughout the government, told not to discuss climate science or the impacts of climate change. Instead of appointing an energy secretary who valued the department's role within the federal government and wanted to use it for good, Bush selected former Michigan senator Spencer Abraham, a federalist society member who, just two years earlier, had cosponsored legislation – along with John Kyl of Arizona and Sam Brownback of Kansas – to abolish the DOE altogether, transferring some of its functions to other agencies and eliminating others entirely. Under Abraham's leadership, the DOE withheld from environmental groups like the Natural Resources Defence Council many thousands of pages of documents pertaining to the White House's controversial energy task force, headed by vice-president Dick Cheney. In Bush's second term, Abraham gave way to the current secretary, Samuel Bodman, who'd served the administration in both the commerce and treasury departments, but who nonetheless constituted an improvement over his predecessor. That didn't mean the bad times were over, though. Just over two months ago, the president nominated a Cheney aide named F Chase Hutto to serve as assistant secretary of energy for international affairs and domestic policy. Hutto had worked for years under the cover of Cheney's expansive cloak to gut clean air and water regulations on behalf of the administration's friends in industry. Though unconfirmed, he's raised the ire of environmental activists and green-friendly politicians everywhere. In a letter to the president dated September 15, 2008, senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Robert Menendez of New Jersey objected to Hutto on the grounds that he'd \"acted as a voice for oil industry representatives (including those from the American Petroleum Institute and ExxonMobil) during internal White House deliberations in arguing against action following the Massachusetts v EPA decision.\" In that case, the US supreme court held that the EPA was obligated to regulate greenhouse gases as pollutants. Hutto will be gone before he can cause irreparable harm, but whoever Obama picks to succeed him will nonetheless have to turn the DOE into something entirely new. Like Chu, that person ought to have demonstrated a long-standing commitment to addressing the climate crisis. And like Chu, the next energy secretary ought to have experience running a bureaucracy Because even though the DOE hasn't been corrupted in the same way other agencies have been, it will have to be substantially rehabilitated. That process will probably feel thankless, but when it's done, we're going to want to have a person like Chu at the helm, guiding the agency out of the wreckage of the Bush years."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2008/jul/01/india.climatechange","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2008-07-01T15:55:25Z","webTitle":"India tackles climate change with renewable energy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/01/india.climatechange","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2008/jul/01/india.climatechange","fields":{"headline":"India tackles climate change with renewable energy","bodyText":"Solar power and other renewable energy sources will get priority under India's climate action plan (pdf) unveiled by prime minister Manmohan Singh in Delhi yesterday. The plan does not commit to a target for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, placing a greater emphasis on continued economic growth. However, it does seek to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and increase energy efficiency. \"Our vision is to make India's economic development energy-efficient,\" said Singh. \"Over a period of time, we must pioneer a graduated shift from economic activity based on fossil fuels to one based on non-fossil fuels.\" Eight \"national missions\" will be set up to form the core of the climate action plan. Besides solar energy and energy efficiency, there will also be initiatives that focus on water use, afforestation, agriculture, sustainability in urban environments, the Himalayan ecosystem and scientific research. India unveiled its climate action plan ahead of next week's G8 summit in Japan which is expected to include measures on how to combat climate change. Singh will be attending, as India is one of the four special invitees. A general election in India is expected early next year, but observers believe this should not derail the climate action plan. \"The missions have to define their work plan by December,\" said Dr Leena Srivastava, executive director of the Tata Energy Research Institute. \"This is adequate time, especially since there is already an elaborate technical report providing a basis.\" India is the fourth biggest contributor of greenhouse gases in the world, adding around 4% of the global total. But its annual per capita emissions remain low at 1.2 tonnes, compared with 20 tonnes in the US and the world average of 4 tonnes. It therefore argues that the developed world, which is responsible for the majority of emissions, should take the greater responsibility for cuts. \"For a country with over 50% of its population without access to electricity, 90% of its rural population dependent on biomass to meet cooking requirements, and over 70% of its required infrastructure yet to come in place, it is unreasonable to expect targets for emission control,\" said Srivastava. By setting up an initiative on the Himalayan ecosystem, India has for the first time also signalled its willingness to launch a joint effort to combat the impacts of climate change not just with its South Asian neighbours but also with China. It will bring together climatologists, glaciologists and other experts to develop measures for sustaining and safeguarding the Himalayan glaciers and ecosystems now under threat from global warming."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2008/sep/18/cleantechnology100","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2008-09-17T23:01:00Z","webTitle":"Professor Ian Fells: We need an expensive miracle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/18/cleantechnology100","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2008/sep/18/cleantechnology100","fields":{"headline":"We need an expensive miracle","bodyText":"Two imperatives point to the urgent development of renewable energy: security of supply and controlling climate change. Much the largest source of renewable energy is hydroelectric power, which provides 17% of world electricity (and 6% of world energy), about the same as nuclear power; both are CO2-free. All the other renewables - wind, wave, tidal, solar, biomass (which are either CO2-free or CO-neutral) - hardly feature in the statistics at the present time. In a desperate attempt to reduce dependence on the twin energy drugs of oil and gas, huge efforts are being made worldwide to develop renewable sources of energy, and the EU is committed to reaching a target of 20% renewable energy by 2020, which implies 35% to 40% renewable electricity. The UK is third from the bottom in the EU league table, just above Luxembourg and Malta, at 1.3% (the UK's 2020 target is 15%). Sweden gets a remarkable 40% of its energy from renewables. This form of energy is frequently invoked by the green lobby as being the only way ahead for electricity supply, providing all that we need. This must be a case of \"Omne ignotum pro magnifico est\" (\"That which is unknown is assumed to have great potential\", to quote Tacitus). But engineers do know a great deal about renewable energy: first and foremost, it is expensive, and is only being developed commercially because of the provision of subsidies of various kinds. This amounted to £1bn last year and will gross up to more than 20 times this figure by 2020, according to the UK's Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform. But this is currently seen as a necessary and acceptable cost for peace of mind in the fight to contain climate change, although the size of the subsidy is not always appreciated. A recent report by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors suggested that the payback time for solar panels is more than 100 years. Of course, as technologies mature and production gets under way, costs come down - but not always low enough to compete with hydro and nuclear. But they play a vital role in providing a source of CO2-free energy as part of the climate control portfolio of technologies. Solar energy is ubiquitous and gaining ground in niche markets but is also beginning to penetrate the bulk electricity market. High feed-in tariffs have allowed Germany to achieve its target of getting 100,000 roofs with solar panels generating 300 MW, a project that started in 1999 and finished in 2003. Wind power onshore has been successful because of marketing subsidies (the Renawables Obligation Certificates, which power generators pay to renewables operators); but even after 15 years it only provides the equivalent output of half a typical gas or nuclear station. The potential for more growth offshore is high; indeed, the government is relying on it, but someone will have to pay to hook the wind farms up to the grid. Wave and tidal stream systems are in their infancy but growing. The only large-scale supplier of renewable electricity would be the Severn Barrage, which is based on the proven technology demonstrated at the Rance barrage in Brittany, which has operated successfully for 40 years. It could provide 5% of UK electricity at a capital cost of £1.7m per installed MW - about half of the cost of offshore wind farms. If a low-cost technology for storing renewable electricity could be found, it would solve the problems of intermittent wind and lack of night-time solar. A great deal of ingenuity is being brought to bear to increase renewable energy production and it is being steadily successful. But if we are to get to 15% renewable energy by 2020 it will be an expensive miracle. Any notion that renewables can provide for all our requirements is a mischievous and reckless boast that will leave us in the dark. · Ian Fells is emeritus professor of energy conversion at Newcastle University and founding chairman of the New and Renewable Energy Centre (NaREC) at Blyth, Northumberland.

The site is far from promising. Miles from a polluted sea, a fierce sun raises temperatures to 50C (120F) in the summer, and there is no fresh water, no soil and no animals. But tens of billions of petro-dollars will be poured into these seven square kilometres of desert on the outskirts of Abu Dhabi. Called Masdar - \"the source\" in Arabic - the walled city is intended to house 50,000 people and 1,500 businesses. It will have no cars and be self-sufficient in renewable energy, the majority of which will be solar energy. The formal unveiling of the desert eco-city will be made today at a summit on future energy sources in Abu Dhabi, attended by the UK business secretary, John Hutton, and Prince Andrew. \"It's extremely ambitious,\" said Gerard Evenden, senior partner in Lord Foster's architecture practice in London, which has had a team working on the design for nine months. \"We were invited to design a zero-carbon city. In this harsh place we needed to look back at history and see how ancient settlements had adapted to their environments.\" The buildings will huddle together as in a casbah, and will be cooled by wind towers which will collect the desert's breezes and flush out hot air. No building will be more than five storeys high; the city is to be oriented north-east to south-west to give the optimum balance of sunlight and shade. It will feel closer to many cities built in the age of the cart and horse. Most roads will only be 3 metres (10ft) wide and just 70 metres long to develop a micro-climate and keep the air moving; roofs will allow in air and keep the sun out in the summer. No one will be more than 200 metres from public transport, and streets will give on to colonnaded squares and fountains. \"We are definitely not imposing a standard international architecture in Masdar. We are aiming to find a balance of light and heat,\" said Evenden. \"It's only really hot for three months of the year, but at other times it's humid.\" It is every architect's dream to build a new city and Foster's team say they started from scratch. The idea has been to reduce the amount of energy needed to build it and to live there, and then to let solar energy take over. \"We will start with a large solar power station which will provide the energy to construct the city. Some 80% of all the roof space will be used to generate solar power, and because we expect technology to improve as we are building it, we hope we will later be able to remove the power plant. We could 'borrow' energy from outside, but we are trying to prove it can all be generated in the confines of the site,\" said Evenden. The architects are also planning some hi-tech gadgetry. The 50,000 inhabitants, and everyone who works there, will move around on one of three levels. A light railway will whizz people to and from Masdar to Abu Dhabi's forest of glass and steel towers; a second level is reserved for pedestrians; and a third for \"personalised rapid transport pods,\" described by Evenden as \"little vehicles like driverless personal taxis which run on tracks or magnetic discs in the road. It's a tried technology. They are in production in Holland, and used to move containers around in Rotterdam port,\" he said. No clues have been given about the city's cost, how it will be socially organised and who will live there, but money is clearly no object. Abu Dhabi, the capital of the Emirates, is vying with neighbour Dubai to be the most dazzling Gulf city and the environment is seen as the new card in the deck. With at least $1trillion (£500bn) invested abroad and sitting on nearly 100bn barrels of oil, Abu Dhabi is the richest city in the world. Its 420,000 inhabitants are theoretically worth about $17m each, and they are responsible for more greenhouse gas emissions per capita than any other population in the world. This week Abu Dhabi is expected to announce a $500m deal to manufacture thin-film solar panels to make Masdar a centre of the global solar energy manufacturing industry. \"This will be the global capital of the renewable energy revolution. It's the first oil producing nation to have taken such a significant step towards sustainable living,\" said Jean-Paul Jeanrenaud, director of WWF's One Planet Living initiative, which aims to develop sustainable communities. But critics said Masdar is a fig leaf for the rest of the Gulf, heartland of the world's fossil fuel extraction. \"The numbers must be put into perspective. They are spending welcome billions of dollars on renewables but trillions are still going into climate-changing oil economies. The future is the sun and renewables but there is no time to wait for this revolution,\" said Tony Juniper, director of Friends of the Earth. How will it work?

From its very inception, the women's movement in Bangladesh has been geared not towards suffrage, but towards development. Both movements – the campaign to tackle poverty and the campaign for women's equality – have recognised the need for one another. Poverty inflicts particular violence on women's lives. If a family goes hungry, it is the women and girl children who starve; if there is little money for education, it is the girls who will be left out. As adults, women perform acts of heroism both mundane and dramatic – tricks to make the food last longer, skipping meals so that their children can eat. When Cyclone Sidr hit the coast of Bangladesh last November, more women died than men: many were out looking for their children when the storm hit. Recognising, as Hossain did, the ingenuity and mettle of poor women, is what characterises the success of development campaigns in Bangladesh. When Muhammad Yunus began giving small loans to the poorest of Bangladesh's poor in the 1970s, he may not have imagined the effects of his actions on women. In the four decades since Grameen Bank began its operations, the proportion of women lenders has grown, and is now somewhere between 96 and 99%. Putting cash into women's hands is at the heart of the bank's success, because women never spend their borrowed money on themselves – they sow it right back into the family. The collaboration between women's activism and development is so strong in Bangladesh that when the Jamaat-e-Islami suffered a rout in the 1996 parliamentary elections, it blamed the feminists and the aid workers in equal measure. But it is not enough to put a measure of economic power in the hands of women; there are still legal and structural challenges to equality. The Bangladesh constitution – otherwise a secular, progressive document – states that family law must be dictated by religion, so that women do not have equal rights to inheritance and child custody. There are also no legal safeguards against domestic violence; and now that women are entering the workforce, there is a need for new labor laws that guarantee better working conditions for women. These are the new battlegrounds that the women's movement has staked out. There is no doubt that Bangladesh is a difficult place to be a woman. But with forbearers like Hossain, who imagined a different world long before they were given the vote, and with development going into the hands of women, we may yet someday build our version of Ladyland."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2008/nov/05/cereal-crop-farming-wheat-prices","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2008-11-05T00:01:00Z","webTitle":"Agriculture: Time to go against the grain","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/nov/05/cereal-crop-farming-wheat-prices","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2008/nov/05/cereal-crop-farming-wheat-prices","fields":{"headline":"Time to go against the grain","bodyText":"As Gordon Brown's war cabinet struggles to keep the economy afloat, ministers will be relieved to see that food price inflation appears to be on its way down. On commodity markets, the price of wheat is barely half what it was a year ago. And as it falls, more food prices look set to tumble. But before cracking open the Bollinger, the Brown cabinet would do well to ponder the implications of having food prices so closely bound up with commodity movements. Our food supply is now more dependent on globally traded grains than at any time in our history. This makes it inherently unstable and vulnerable to the kind of catastrophic meltdown that threatened the banking industry. First, there's the danger of extreme weather events, worsening as a result of climate change. Grains are at risk both from heavy rainfall and from drought, and this year's rain-drenched harvest was saved only by a fine spell in September. Then there's the reliance of wheat farmers on oil. To grow the crop, they need diesel to power their giant machines, whose very manufacture requires barrels of the stuff. Then there's the oil contained in the chemical fertilisers and pesticides, without which their over-worked soils would scarcely grow a thing. Little wonder, then, that wheat price movements reflect almost exactly the rollercoaster fluctuations of the oil market. Finally, our grain-based food supply is largely controlled by commodity traders and brokers - speculators now dictate the price and availability of many foods on our supermarket shelves. In the early days of the second world war, prime minister Winston Churchill called on Britain's farmers to boost our supply of homegrown food. Today, they would be unable to respond even if they wanted to. First they would have to negotiate prices for fertilisers and pesticides, then await shipments of oil. Wartime farming was powered not by fossil fuels but by the sun, and at the heart of Britain's food production was grassland. Most of Britain's food animals were raised on it - cattle, sheep, poultry and pigs in a genuinely sustainable production model. Grasslands do not need chemical fertilisers or pesticides, particularly when they contain nitrogen-fixing clovers and deep-rooting herbs to tap soil mineral reserves. Supplemented by cereals and root crops, pastures produced most of our beef, lamb, pork, dairy, eggs and poultry for little more than the cost of the farmer's labour. Grasslands produced most of our grain crops, too. Cereals such as wheat and barley were grown in rotations which included two or three years of grass. Undergrazed pasture soil rapidly builds fertility as plants and soil fauna decay. When the grass is ploughed and sown with a cereal crop, the plants make use of the recycled nutrients. This kind of sustainable mixed farming was still common in the 1960s. Yields of individual crops were generally lower than today, but since farmers bought few inputs, they made more money out of what they grew. And taking the farm as a whole, the food output per acre from a well-run mixed farm was often higher than today's intensive chemical operation. Powering the whole system was grass. The pasture field acts as a vast solar panel, capturing solar energy in the chloroplasts of leaves and using it to build sugars from atmospheric carbon dioxide. Not only did grassland produce copious amounts of food, it removed carbon from the air into the soil and slowed climate change. Agribusiness interests - generously supported by western governments - all but destroyed this system. In place of pastures they have substituted internationally traded grains. For Britain, wheat has been the means of globalising production and taking away our food security. For more than three decades, governments - particularly those of the US and the EU - have used the subsidy system to maintain a near-permanent surplus of wheat on world markets, sweeping away pasture systems and making it more profitable for farmers to confine their animals to sheds and feedlots. The grain-based system wouldn't survive without public subsidies. Spending under the common agricultural policy still amounts to £40bn across EU member states. British farmers receive £2.7bn. The main beneficiaries are large-scale arable growers and commodity companies. Where I live in west Somerset, many country lanes run red during the deluges we experience ever more frequently. This is silt running from fields whose fertility and organic matter have been depleted by too many grain crops. Higher levels of organic matter would end the erosion and protect our towns against flash floods. What's more, efficient use of grasslands would go a long way to meeting the challenge of climate change. The Royal Society has estimated that better management of the world's farmlands could capture as much carbon as is accumulated in the atmosphere each year. A US group, Carbon Farmers of America estimates that returning the US prairies to the soil organic matter levels of the original prairie grassland would return global carbon dioxide counts to pre-industrial levels. As in wartime, the countryside could once again be at the heart of a national revival. It's time to bring our food supply back home. • Graham Harvey is author of The Carbon Fields, published last week by Grassroots, price £6.99. grassrootsfood.co.uk"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2008/dec/20/familyholidays-uk","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2008-12-20T00:01:00Z","webTitle":"A family holiday at Bluestone holiday park in Pembrokeshire","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2008/dec/20/familyholidays-uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2008/dec/20/familyholidays-uk","fields":{"headline":"Green means go","bodyText":"It's not easy having fun. One minute you're racing your eight-year-old down a snow tube run - I think I was even winning - the next you're face deep in exfoliatingly-hard snow ... and people are looking. \"Want to go again?\" grinned Joe, stifling giggles at the melting snow dripping from my ears. I nodded bravely and we trudged (me, gingerly) up the hill again. When it comes to wearing out children (and their less bouncy parents), Bluestone goes for broke. It opened this summer in 500 acres, much of it within the glorious Pembrokeshire Coast national park, and offers luxury accommodation set around a private \"new generation holiday village\". The impressive array of facilities includes a sports club, creche, spa and water park, as well as numerous activities including laser clay shooting, bushcraft classes, photography workshops and whale watching. Plus, as my face will verify, over Christmas you can zoom down real snow - albeit in a giant marquee. Visiting with extended family (my ex-pat sister and brood just-arrived from Aus), our wishlist read like a bratty letter to Santa. We wanted family fun, kids' activities, \"grown-up\" space, and to see some of Pembrokeshire - as well as time to catch up in comfort as a family. It was tipping down when we arrived at dusk. In the dim, grey light, Bluestone's newness smacked slightly of a top-end housing estate, albeit one for on-trend lumberjacks, if our Skomer Lodge was anything to go by. \"Wow, I wasn't expecting this,\" announced my sister. A spacious, double-height sitting room with comfy sofas and huge plasma TV opened on to the best-equipped kitchen/diner I've ever self-catered in. Clean, neutral decor, three swish bedrooms (two en suite), a family wet room, and a galleried chill-out zone with a second plasma screen which Joe and his cousin, Sam, instantly claimed. We awoke to a pristine winter's day and a flattering backdrop of ancient woodland, rolling fields and the Preseli Hills. It was criminal not to explore these stunning surroundings, but with two kids to please, our first point of call was a given: the Blue Lagoon water park. Bluestone is a car-free zone; you can hire bikes (beware, it's really hilly) or zip around in electric buggies. We tried both, although the latter got more use. The Blue Lagoon welcomes day visitors at times, but \"Bluestoners\" get exclusive sessions, and we were virtually alone. \"There are more lifeguards than swimmers,\" observed my husband, who hates queuing, as the boys dragged him off to the wait-free flumes. Floating along the outdoor lazy river, blue sky overhead, steam billowing, I didn't give a thought to the technology keeping us toasty, but it deserves a mention. Bluestone takes its environmental responsibilities seriously. Natural, sustainable materials, local produce and solar energy are all used where possible. Conservation and horticultural plans - more than 163,000 trees have been planted - will improve wildlife and flora diversity (and, admittedly, Bluestone's overall appearance). The resort has its own wastewater treatment plant and full-time environmental manager committed to further improvements. But its prize jewel is the carbon-neutral, biomass energy centre that uses locally sourced woodchip and energy crops grown by its operators, a local farmers' cooperative, to heat both the sports club and Blue Lagoon. My brother-in-law, an environmental engineer who knows his stuff, was seriously impressed. That afternoon we drove past Carew Castle, its reflection quivering in an icy millpond, to Stackpole Quay. From the coastal path, the sandstone cliffs looked like gilded millefeuille. Sustained by views alone, we adults could have walked for ever, but jet lag claimed Sam, and we ended up hunting ammonites in Stackpole's tiny harbour, rather than at our intended destination, Barafundle beach. Kids shattered, we left them with Bluestone babysitter Jamie-Lee and absconded for a \"night on the village\". Aside from several shops, including a baker's and local store, Bluestone has a pub, wine bar and three restaurants. We'd booked the posh one - Carreg Las - and arrived to find it empty, bar two lovely waiters. Undaunted, we tucked into local lobster, halibut, fig tarte tatin and too much wine for our own good. Prices weren't cheap - around £40 a head minus booze - but we still felt the kitchen's skills warranted more bums on seats. (Though since our visit Bluestone has ditched the fine dining for a less expensive, more inclusive bistro menu.) After a final morning of family snow and bike action, the lure of the Well Spa proved irresistible. Recharging our batteries in the tranquil saunas, steam rooms and outdoor hydrotherapy pool (while the boys continued to run down theirs with football, snooker, tennis and more in the Junior Rangers' kids' club) was bliss. As for treatments? My Terrake Magica massage and facial involved hot stones, warm oil and a therapist with healing hands - but that's all I remember. I drifted off after 10 minutes. Bluestone is not a budget getaway. Accommodation prices are roughly in line with its obvious rival, Center Parcs, and similarly cover only the roof over your head and unlimited use of the water park. Add on some activities, bike hire and a meal or two out, and you're looking at around a grand for a weekend for six. But for a special family occasion with fun on tap - we bumped into several large groups celebrating one thing or another - it could tick most, if not all, of your boxes. So were our demands met? I'll let the kids judge that. \"You know your story for the paper?\" asked Sam, as we chucked the last bag in the boot. \"Say this place is five star.\" \"Six star,\" argued Joe. It was going to be a long drive home, but spotting Bluestone's twinkling Santa's grotto on the way out, I reasoned that - even though we hadn't had time to visit - he must know that at least one of us had been good this year.

He's just had his picture taken wearing a suit – our photographer wants to show that he's not just a hands-on local farmer but also a new- era businessman – and now he's getting back into his work gear: muddy jeans, straw hat, and a farmhand's shirt that reads, in embroidered script, \"Roy\". \"Roy?\" I ask. Salatin follows my gaze to his chest and laughs. \"The cleaner sells unclaimed ones for 50 cents each,\" he explains. \"I might be Pedro one day, and Roy the next.\" Such is the unpredictable world of Joel Salatin, hero of the new local food movement, feted for his ingenious chemical-free farming methods and admired for his outspoken articulacy on the horrors of industrial food. We are at Polyface, the small farm his family has run since he was four years old (Salatin and his wife Teresa now have two grown-up children of their own, who also work there). The rambling white clapboard farmhouse – a gold plaque above the fireplace designates it a historic landmark, built in the 1750s – stands in an absurdly picturesque landscape in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley. On the January day we visit, 24 inches of snow have fallen in a few recent hours and turned the surrounding fields into rolling white patchworked dunes dotted with black cows. And as if its children's-book looks were not enough, the roads have names like Cattleman and Sugar Loaf and Buttermilk Spring. The farm is closed to visitors during these months, the coldest of the year; the purpose of this period, as Salatin writes on the Polyface website, is \"the rejuvenation of the Salatin family\". Needless to say, they are not just sitting around. Farmhands are cleaning out the hens' hoop houses out back; a new batch of live-in apprentices is building a temporary structure next to the tractor garage; Teresa is dealing with admin and taking down the Christmas tree. And Joel has dashed off another book over Christmas. His many self-published tomes, which offer first-hand guidance on how to repeat his successful experiment, have wonderful titles such as Everything I Want To Do Is Illegal and (the new one) The Sheer Ecstasy of Being a Lunatic Farmer. Salatin, who has been farming in this way for years, came to more widespread attention thanks to Michael Pollan's bestselling book The Omnivore's Dilemma – he refused to ship meat to Pollan outside of the meat's own bioregion, and became an important figure in the book. Now he provides the charismatic moral backbone of Food, Inc, a hard-hitting documentary featuring Pollan and co-produced by Eric Schlosser, the investigative reporter who wrote Fast Food Nation. Food, Inc suggests some shocking links between big government and big business in the food industry, along with some appalling statistics. For instance, in the 1970s, the top five beef packers controlled 25% of the market; now the top four control more than 80% – meaning that if ever meat is tainted by bacteria or chemicals it has the potential to reach vast numbers of people; in 1972, 50,000 food safety inspections were conducted by the US Food and Drug Administration, and three decades later that number had gone down to 9,164; 70% of all processed foods have some genetically modified ingredient; in 2007, E coli from food affected 73,000 Americans – something the film correlates directly with the increase in consumption of processed foods and the scale and cleanliness of the country's huge industrial slaughterhouses. But beyond the statistics, the sheer sight of carcasses being dunked in ammonia, endlessly and mechanically, would make any meat eater want to stop eating meat. The very banality of it – the fact that we could, the filmmakers suggest, change the world with every bite yet somehow refuse to – is horrifying. The first thing I ask Salatin when we sit down in his living room is whether he's ever considered becoming a vegetarian. It's not what I had planned to say, but we've been in the hoop houses with the nicely treated hens, all happily pecking and glossy-feathered, and I've held one in my arms. Suddenly it makes little sense that this animal, whose welfare has been of such great concern, will be killed in a matter of days. Naive, I know, and Salatin seems surprised. \"Never crossed my mind,\" he says. The problem that's leading the \"animals-are-people movement\", as he refers to it, is two-fold, in his view. First: \"The industrial food system is so cruel and so horrific in its treatment of animals. It never asks the question: 'Should a pig be allowed to express its pig-ness?' And the second thing of course is the urbanisation of the world, to the point where people are not now connected to their ecological umbilical, so that the only connection anyone has to an animal is a pet cat or a pet dog. And that really gives you a very jaundiced view of cycles of life – death, regeneration.\" It's true that America is particularly susceptible to this – even without knowing much of the information revealed by Pollan or Schlosser or Food, Inc director Robert Kenner, you sense it. The US is especially blind to it for the sake of convenience or affordability. But living in a city like New York, as I do, on the occasions when you allow your field of vision some leeway – into the future health of your children, into the vastness of the country – you see how integral the city's relationship to the origins of its food is to its profound ill health. The enormous quantities produced by the few monopolies in power, the distance food travels to get to your door, the bounteous look yet empty, aqueous taste of its fruit. I ask Salatin when he first realised his country was poisoning itself. \"Well, goodness,\" he says, and reaches back into the learned resources of his mind. \"Chemical agriculture really started with Justus von Liebig in 1837 [Liebig was the father of the fertiliser industry, and also the father of the Oxo cube], telling the world that: 'Oh, a plant is really only nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus.' I think it's important to understand that in the big historical context of things, there has been land degradation from civilisation since the beginning of history. I mean, the Rajputana desert in India is a manmade desert caused by overgrazing. Land degradation did not start with chemical agriculture. But chemical agriculture offered new tools for annihilation.\" But what, I press him, can we say about the moment we're in now? Are we in a state of crisis or a continuation? Salatin quotes Joel Arthur Barker on paradigms – every paradigm, he says, exceeds its point of efficiency. Agriculture is always the last sector to join the new economy, because farmers are very conservative. So only now has the industrial paradigm in agriculture come to the end of its workability, Salatin explains. \"What happens is all these things we're seeing – campylobacter, E coli, mad cow, listeria, salmonella, that weren't even in the lexicon 30 years ago – that is the industrial paradigm exceeding its efficiency. So these Latin squiggly words that we're learning to say – bovine spongiform encephalopathy – are nature's language screaming to us: ENOUGH! And the question then is: what will it take for us to listen? And my contention is that Wall Street is still wearing conquistador mentality and uniforms, and nobody is listening to the pleadings of nature saying: 'Enough.'\" Salatin says he thinks that in the clash between artisanal and industrial \"we're just beginning to see the tip of the iceberg\", and he doesn't like to predict who will win. Personally, he tries to be an optimist, but he adds ominously that \"time will tell. Who would have thought in 1925 that six million Jews would have been gassed in Germany? A lot of crazy things have happened in history\". Human arrogance is one thing Salatin strongly warns against. Of course, it's one way of explaining the large-scale upset to the natural order of things. But Salatin also thinks the way you treat animals is a reflection of the way you will go on to treat human beings. One of his more romantic and far-fetched-seeming statements in the documentary is to this effect, and it turns out to be one of the most centrally, shockingly true: the treatment of illegal workers by big food corporations. Films like Food, Inc, Salatin suggests, are finally \"exposing the kind of corruption and evil that is the shortcut. What happens when you don't ask: how do we make pigs happy? Well, you view the pig as just a pile of protoplasmic structure to be manipulated however cleverly human hubris can imagine to manipulate it. And when you view life from that kind of mechanistic, arrogant, disrespectful standpoint, you very soon beginto view all of life from a very disrespectful, arrogant, manipulative standpoint. And the fact is, we aren't machines.\" It's probably safe to say that not all farmers in Virginia speak like this. Salatin, the son of an economist who moved here and turned local chemical farming habits on their head, was born in Venezuela and worked as a reporter for the local newspaper in Staunton, Virginia before he came to work at the family farm. He met Teresa when they were in high school and married her almost 30 years ago. Salatin is a remarkably youthful 53-year-old: his skin is strangely unweatherbeaten, and his eyes, behind large square glasses, are full of life. He writes prolifically and commands several thousand dollars a pop for public speaking engagements on topics such as \"Dancing with Dinner\", \"Holy Cows and Hog Heaven\" and \"Forgiveness Farming\". He's funny, informed – he thinks nothing of dropping Louis Pasteur or Sir Albert Howard into the conversation – and rewardingly heated in his arguments. He also seems to have come into his own somewhat. When I ask him what he and his wife disagree about, given that they have worked together so closely for so long, he says he has to respect her need for privacy, while she has to put up with his exercising his own very particular gifts: \"I'm out here in my world of people and parties,\" he says, \"and she's being crushed. But she appreciates that this is where we are now. I need people – theatrics and schmoozing and storytelling are part of my talent.\" Now, perhaps we can all easily agree that eating Salatin's meat is better for us (and I can certainly vouch for its tastiness, having had Polyface chicken in a local restaurant in Staunton), but getting down to basics, I ask him if I were from Mars how he would explain why I should eat his meat. Salatin offers five reasons. \"The first thing is,\" he says, \"it's safer from a bio-security standpoint. If you eat our stuff, it's gonna be only sold real close right here. There's a short chain between field and fork, and the shorter that chain is – the fresher, the more transparent that system is – the less chance there is of anything from bio-terrorism to pathogenicity to spoilage. You wanna get diarrhoea? Eat industrial food. \"Number two is what I would call your own personal immune system.\" The more antibiotics are given to the animals we eat, he explains, the less responsive we become to antibiotics when we need them for medical reasons. \"You've been drugging yourself at dinner every day.\" Thirdly, he goes on, they've had their meats checked, and they are unequalled in their nutritional density and power, however you want to measure it – \"Omega 3, omega 6 ratios, riboflavin, polyunsaturated fats, vitamin A…\" Four: it tastes better. \"And the fifth reason,\" he concludes, \"is: it's better for the environment. It's a very landscape-therapeutic production model.\" So: we know why we should eat this. How many of us can? Salatin currently feeds between 7,000 and 9,000 locals. That's a tiny proportion of the American population; how sustainable is his system? \"Can I feed the world? That's a wonderful question, one of my favourites,\" Salatin smiles, having more or less asked the question himself. \"Not only can we feed the world, this is the only system that really can feed the world.\" And, I ask, what happens to the next 9,000 people, and the next and the next? \"Well, there are a couple of answers to that,\" Salatin replies, taking off into vivid detail about a small part of how he actually operates. \"Let's take cows, for example. With good, controlled grazing, where we're moving these cows every day to a new patch, on our farm we're averaging 400 cow days per acre – a cow day is what one cow will eat in a day. Our county average is 80. Because grass grows in an S-curve, so when you have cows in continuous grazing, they keep the grass short, in what I call its nappy phase. And what we want to do is get it in its juvenile adolescent growth curve. We don't want it to grow into what we call nursing-home grass. I say this not for humour – it is funny, but: everybody can understand that. People grow faster between 12 and 18 than at other ages. And so if we can maintain the forage in that fast juvenile-growth stage, then we are metabolising way more solar energy in the biomass than you are at any other time in the growth cycle of the plant. And to do that, you have to manage the meeting between cow and grass. You can't just turn the cows out and hope that it'll happen, because it won't. Cows always eat dessert first.\" So, I ask, you're saying this particular system of management and growth could be taken anywhere in the world and replicated? \"Absolutely.\" And why are people not doing that? \"Well, I don't know,\" Salatin says, stretching his shoulders into an exaggerated shrug. \"Why don't people like the truth? It's a big question. One answer is: it hasn't been done before. It's just not what Grandpa did. And remember, farmers are conservative. If the neighbour doesn't think it's a good idea, it's not a good idea. Whereas my position is: a good idea is what the neighbours think is a terrible idea!\" Just on principle, I laugh. Salatin is marvellously perverse. \"Exactly,\" he says. \"You know it won't work if the neighbours think it will.\" You must have terrible neighbours, I suggest. For a second, he pauses. \"No, we have wonderful neighbours! And the other thing is, if everybody started doing the kind of farming we do, it would completely invert and realign all of the food-system power economic structure in the world. We're looking at cultural revolution – that's what this is.\" Salatin is not entirely without critics – I don't mean big-brother big-business bad-guy critics; I mean people who are trying to do the same thing in a more purist way and regret that he is being hailed as the saviour. In Jonathan Safran Foer's new book Eating Animals, a poultry farmer named Frank Reese, who raises heritage breeds only, not birds whose genes are identical to the industrial birds, criticises Salatin in these terms. \"That farm is a joke,\" Reese says of Polyface. \"Joel Salatin is doing industrial birds. Call him up and ask him. So he puts them on pasture. It makes no difference. It's like putting a broken-down Honda on the autobahn and saying it's a Porsche.\" I put this to Salatin, and initially he denies it. \"That's just wrong,\" he says defensively, \"Just because it's in print doesn't mean it's true.\" Salatin doesn't know Frank Reese. He asks if Reese is in favour of using only heritage breeds, and I say that's my understanding of it, yes. \"OK,\" he concedes. \"You know what, that's fine if you want to do that. I'm not opposed to heritage breeds. We have some heritage breeds. Here's the problem though: marketability. When you say: 'Can we feed the world?', we're not going to turn around the system by feeding only 10% of the population. We gotta feed 90%.\" You don't think people will pay… \"Double?\" he says, finishing my question. \"No, they won't. And besides, it's all dark meat. No double breast. Hey, 40 years ago, every woman in the country – I'll be real sexist here – every woman in the country knew how to cut up a chicken. When we started doing these pastured chickens, it was a moot point. Nobody asked for breast – it didn't exist! I mean as a separate item. Now 60% of our customers don't even know that a chicken has bones! I'm serious. We have moved to an incredibly ignorant culinary connection.\" Salatin is hitting his stride now. \"We tried heritage chickens for three years and we couldn't sell 'em. I mean, we could sell a couple. But at the end of the day, altruism doesn't pay our taxes. And I'm willing to say: 'You know what? I don't have all the answers and I pick my battles and compromises.' If you want to get brutally honest, in my opinion we shouldn't even have egg sales in America! Every restaurant and every home should have two or three chickens. I mean, you got a parakeet, why not have two chickens? You get eggs instead of a parrot keeping you awake at night. In a perfect world, that's how it would be.\" This tirade from Salatin is quite a performance, and not without good, convincing intentions. But it's also peppered with apparent contempt, which makes one wonder: is he the spiritual, crusading zealot he appears to be? Who is he trying to save: us, the world, or farmers like himself? His answer to this question is that you can save all of those at once, if only people would \"take charge of their food system\". Let's hope he's right. Salatin looks at his watch. While we pack up, he attends to other things. We wait around to say goodbye, but he's on the phone, and it looks like it's going to be a long one. He's launched into his spiel again with gusto, and he gives us a smile and a wave, talking into the receiver all the time. We ask Teresa who's on the other end of the line. It's Oprah – naturally. Food, Inc opens on 12 February. We have two pairs of tickets to the premiere to give away, see www.observer.co.uk/foodinc for details Dishing the dirt – the author of Fast Food Nation and co-producer of Food, Inc, and the director of the film discuss the american food industry Eric Schlosser \"We showed the film to the head of the US Department of Agriculture and he seemed very sympathetic to it, but his argument was: 'Make us do it.' There is so much resistance to change that you really need a movement. Of all the sorts of reforms, the one that will be easiest to do in the US is food safety, because there's not a big popular lobby for 'shit in the meat' – Republicans, Democrats, if you ask them: 'Do you want faecal material in your hamburger?', most people say no. The regulatory changes to food safety are very simple – Kevin's Law [named after a child who died after eating E coli-contaminated meat] would mandate that meat is tested as it leaves the plant. This isn't about a socialist revolution. This is about: if there's deadly pathogens in the meat, you're not allowed to sell it. If we find it, we're allowed to take it off the shelf. I'm optimistic about the possibility of that change. The industry line is: just cook it. It's a way of shifting responsibility away from selling a tainted, faulty product, and onto the consumer. The ultimate message is: if your food's poisoned, it's your fault. If you're obese, it's your fault.\" Robert Kenner \"It was amazing making this film. I had no idea food was such a litigious subject. Kevin's mother is asked how his death changed her eating habits, but she can't answer on film because she fears she could be sued by the food industry. I was dumbfounded. She mentioned Oprah [who was sued by Texas beef producers for saying on her show that she would never eat another burger after a segment on BSE in 1996] and I knew about that, but when you connect the dots it becomes a lot more insidious – and in context it made me really scared! We were certainly attacked on a regular basis – several websites were set up to attack the film. We had every word verified three times. We had to negotiate everything. I spent more on legal fees on Food, Inc than I did on my past 15 films, times three. \"One of the big arguments in the US is that it's your responsibility to eat better, but there is a massive amount of effort going into working out how to sell us more calories, to feed our addiction – billions of dollars to figure out how to get you to want their food and to continue the myth that our food comes from a farm with a picket fence and a red barn, when in reality there are a few companies that own products under a lot of different names. We've been so removed that we think chicken is grown in little strips. We subsidise food in the United States that makes you sick. The fact is, we love cheap food, and I'm no different. \"But the job of the film is to say that this food is much more expensive than it looks. We need to start taxing things that make us sick, in the same way we dealt with nicotine. Food, Inc has become an Inconvenient Truth-type of film – the debate is very new in the US. There is a growing food movement, but Food, Inc helped explode it – Michael Pollan had bestselling books before, but now he's being outlawed on college campuses. The food corporations are funding these universities and they say: 'You'll lose your funding if he goes on stage without someone else to counteract what he's saying.' But their market surveys are saying: 'You'd better start listening.' So I'm getting invited to conferences to speak to people from food corporations who'd probably like to shoot me. \" Rebecca Seal The US food industry response to the film can be found here: www.safefoodinc.com In response to Food, Inc, the US food industry launched www.safefoodinc.com, which says ,\"US meat and poultry is among the safest, most abundant and most affordable in the world… We have achieved success through research, technology and plain hard work.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"books/booksblog/2008/mar/20/catchofthedaythepredictio","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2008-03-20T15:45:18Z","webTitle":"Catch of the day: Arthur C Clarke's predictions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2008/mar/20/catchofthedaythepredictio","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/booksblog/2008/mar/20/catchofthedaythepredictio","fields":{"headline":"Catch of the day: Arthur C Clarke's predictions","bodyText":"With the sad but not entirely unexpected death of Arthur C Clarke, it's worth revisiting the series of predictions for the 21st century that the self-styled visionary unveiled in December 2001.

We have begun to glimpse the green holy grail: reliable renewable electricity. Studies by people as diverse as the German government and the Centre for Alternative Technology have shown how, by diversifying the sources of green energy, by managing demand and using some cunning methods of storage, renewables could supply 80% or even 100% of our electricity without any loss in the continuity of power supplies. But while this work has been causing ripples among scientists and green campaigners, the government has appeared stuck in the fossil century. As recently as October last year, the business secretary, John Hutton, was secretly lobbying to abandon Britain's target for renewable power supplies. I have not yet been allowed to see the consultation paper, but the details obtained by the Guardian suggest that the government has at last begun to take renewables seriously. Some of its proposals appear to be radical, innovative and bold. It shows how its target of producing 35% of electricity from green power by 2020 might be met by greatly boosting wind, biomass and solar energy. The document will propose a synergy between large-scale renewables and electric cars, which can be charged at night when wind power might otherwise be wasted. Most radically, and controversially, it suggests forcing people to insulate their homes and to fit renewable devices when they build extensions. The paper suggests that oil-fired central heating might eventually be banned. The brief summary I have seen raises as many questions as it answers. Is the government really proposing the mass installation of micro-wind turbines? If so, it will be wasting our money. While solar thermal panels (producing hot water), wood pellet boilers and heat pumps offer good value, micro-electricity doesn't. Why is the government proposing to use biomass for generating power, when it would be much better deployed producing heat? Does it support the German government's proposal to build a European supergrid, using high-voltage direct current lines? I hope so: our renewable resources could then be used as part of a much bolder scheme for balancing supply and demand. But by far the most important question is this: we now have an idea of what the government will be commissioning, but what will it be decommissioning? Cutting carbon pollution is as much about what you don't do, as what you do. The paper proposes that the flights we take will keep growing: by 2020, it says, they will account for 11% of the country's energy use. If so, then airport expansion, because of the other greenhouse gases flying produces, will cancel all the savings the government proposes, twice over. Will the government drop its plans to build new coal-fired power stations? It would be profoundly ironic if it bans oil-fired central heating in people's homes while approving new coal plants tens of thousands of times bigger. And will it produce a supply-side policy for tackling climate change? At the moment it proposes to maximise the extraction of fossil fuels and minimise their use: these positions are plainly incompatible. Gordon Brown will appear in Jeddah tomorrow to demand that the Saudis raise oil production, just as the consultation paper demands that we reduce consumption. The government cannot pursue both policies and claim to be meeting its commitments on climate change.

So perhaps you're even reading this online. Now, I know it's unusual for you to find political advice in the Technology section, but this matters both to you and to us. The bit that matters to you is getting re-elected, or at least raising your popularity rating above the level where a doctor declares it dead. The bit that matters to us is knowing we'll be able to afford to heat and light our homes in the future. Everyone's been carping about your leadership, which is a bit unfair since you've put in place ministers who are far more turned on to the internet generation than Tony Blair ever did: Tom Watson, Michael Wills, Jim Knight and Baroness Vadera are all making a difference. But when there's a dismal byelection defeat and all ministers say is that they'll \"listen and learn\", people feel there's no leadership going on. What we actually want is some idea that Britain knows where it's going. And the one area where that really, really matters is energy. The airwaves are full of another warning that energy prices are going to rise again, and that perhaps Britain's wholesale market for energy is broken. This matters to people. Which is where you come in with the \"leadership\" bit. Look, good leaders don't do \"listen and learn\". They lead. They provide a vision, and they can pull an entire country along with them. Now, here's the wrong way to do \"leading\" over energy. When oil prices leapt up earlier this year, you said you would tell the Gulf states to pump some more oil. Where's the leadership in that? Real leadership would be to stand up and say: \"The price of oil now is above $100 per barrel. At some time in the future it will rise to $200, and then $400 per barrel. This is simple economics: it is a finite resource for which there is increasing demand. \"The 2006 energy review consultation said that by 2020 we will import three-quarters of our primary energy. And Deloitte said in February 2006 that by 2020 we'll need more than 50 gigawatts of energy generating capacity - about two-thirds of current capacity: that's 30 nuclear power stations, or 40,000 offshore wind turbines. \"So Britain faces a challenge: how to secure our energy supplies. North Sea oil is running dry. We cannot just import gas and oil. If we carry on there will come a point when we cannot afford to heat and light our homes and offices. \"The challenge for us, the British people, is to make ourselves as energy-independent as possible. Just as the US space programme challenged the ingenuity of that country in the 1960s, this will challenge us. To encourage use of solar energy, we will adopt the German model by which owners of solar cells profit from selling surplus energy to the national grid. Offshore wind turbines and tidal energy systems will get tax breaks, funded by money from petrol taxes and a windfall tax on oil company profits. We'll insulate more homes than ever before. We are not going to be reliant on other people for our electricity. \"It's going to take sacrifice and it's going to cost money, but that will be saved against the spiralling prices we would have to pay in the future. The time to start is not when oil reaches $200 or $300 or $400 per barrel; it is now, when it is relatively cheap. Energy independence is the key to an affordable future for us and our children. So we start today.\" See? I think I've even got the style. You can set the timescale. Ten years would be a start. And I'd move quickly.

Ultimately, we were hoping for readers to propose real and workable solutions to some of the difficulties experienced by aid agencies in Africa. In the four months since launch, the project has generated a huge amount of interest, with offers of help ranging from schools aiming to raise funds for the project, through to doctors wishing to fly to Katine to offer practical assistance. One exceptional offer of help came from Nick Sireau, director of the charity SolarAid, an NGO that aims to deliver clean, renewable power to the world's poorest people. Having spotted our coverage of the project in the Guardian and the Observer, Sireau contacted us with news of what his organisation was doing. He asked if there was any way he could work with Amref in Katine to deliver solar power to the region. \"The majority of the rural population in Africa has no access to electricity and is forced to rely on expensive and polluting kerosene for lighting and diesel for generators,\" Sireau says. \"Solar power, however, is more reliable, safer and affordable.\" The offer was immediately interesting because there is no constant supply of power in Katine. Moreover, Amref already has experience of installing solar power in Africa (in health centres and schools) so it was potentially easy to integrate into its existing plan. \"The problem was that the budget had already been allocated so we didn't have the resources needed to make the SolarAid proposal work,\" says Amref UK's Claudia Codsi. \"I asked Nick if there was any way he could try to raise the funds needed for solar installation in Katine, with the view that Amref could look at using SolarAid in our other projects in the future.\" Sireau went to the Global Cool Foundation, seeking a £10,000-£20,000 pot of funding to carry out the work. Global Cool eventually came up with £10,000 for Katine, with the donation coming from the band Maroon 5, who donated part of the income from their recent tour. Amref decided the solar energy should be installed at its newly-opened field office in Katine sub-county, which has a community room where the community can come and discuss the project, look at the Katine website and one day contribute their own stories, images and video. The project team had been relying on generators, but they are noisy, costly to maintain, and require expensive fuel. As the availability and cost of fuel is often based on economic and geo-political factors (for example, the recent turbulence in Kenya), it meant Amref's costs have risen by 40 per cent. Also, an intermittent power supply has not allowed it to take full advantage of the new satellite internet connection Amref has at its new office; and power surges due to power cuts have damaged electronic equipment and caused the loss of valuable documentation, in turn causing delays to project-related work being communicated externally. Clearly, solar power at the Katine office would be extraordinarily helpful. The problem was that Amref's budget also wouldn't have stretched to paying for the engineers needed to design the system. Sireau solved that too. He approached Solarcentury, which had helped set-up SolarAid in 2006 with a donation of 5 per cent of its operating profits. Solarcentury agreed to design the system for Katine using engineers who are currently working pro bono. It will contract a local Ugandan company to fit the system. Sireau says the Katine project will demonstrate how solar energy can be used for sustainable development, something Codsi echoes. \"Given the increasing cost of fuel and intermittent power supply, solar power is a cost-effective, environmentally-friendly and sustainable solution,\" she says. \"The donation of solar power is really fantastic and will make an enormous impact on the work we can achieve in Katine. \"What is especially exciting is how, through the media partnership with the Guardian, we have been able to reach out to readers who have helped us to come up with innovative solutions to resolve an existing challenge. Solar power will definitely make a lasting difference to the work of the project officers and the community at large in Katine sub-county.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2007/jun/04/catholicism.religion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2007-06-04T09:38:40Z","webTitle":"Vatican decides its power must come from sun","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jun/04/catholicism.religion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2007/jun/04/catholicism.religion","fields":{"headline":"Vatican decides its power must come from sun","bodyText":"You are a leader who wants to move with the times and establish some green credentials; but your scope for installing wind turbines or rubbish-burning power stations is distinctly limited by your country being scarcely bigger than Pooh Bear's 100-acre wood and made up largely of untouchable gardens and buildings of priceless historic worth. What to do? Pope Benedict XVI - or rather, his advisers - seem to have found an answer. The Vatican City State is to get a solar energy installation, craftily sited on the roof of one its few large modern buildings. The Vatican's experts have been fretting over the roof of the Paul VI hall, the vast building where popes traditionally hold weekly public audiences in winter or whenever bad weather rules out St Peter's Square. Built by the Italian architect Pier Luigi Nervi and opened in 1971, the hall can accommodate 10,000 pilgrims. The sweep of Nervi's undulating roof looks contemporary but its concrete tiles have proved less resistant to the years than its design, and Livio De Santoli, a professor at Rome's La Sapienza university, suggested replacing them with photovoltaic panels. The daily paper La Repubblica yesterday said the Pope had approved the project. The Vatican's chief engineer, Pier Carlo Cuscianna, believed the €2.5m (£1.7m) scheme would \"put the Holy See in the forefront of solar energy technology\". Professor De Santoli said the building's apearance would not alter; each of the 4,800 tiles would be replaced by a solar panel of identical size, shape and colour. It is estimated that the panels, due to be commissioned in the first half of next year, will supply the hall's energy needs and produce a surplus.

Scientists for Global Responsibility has recently made a submission to the House of Lords economic affairs committee inquiry into the economics of renewable energy, highlighting the potential synergy between the renewables in which the UK is well endowed, particularly onshore and offshore wind, and electric vehicles and \"plug-in hybrids\" (PIHs) - vehicles that can be charged at times when there is a surplus available on the grid - making it easier to integrate variable energy sources such as wind or tidal energy. Such a combination could enhance our energy security as well as enabling us to meet our CO2 reduction targets. Martin Quick Scientists for Global Responsibility If BAE Systems can make submarines and fighters then they can make wind turbines (Revealed: UK's blueprint for a green revolution, June 21). If we are serious we could set up new factories, retrain workers in new technologies and, once we are in production, we can export. Hard decisions need to be made over planning applications but environmentalists can't have it all. Alan Quinn Manchester Perhaps in 25 years, when we are spending billions to rid our crowded isle of a rusting forest of derelict wind turbines, we will look back on the folly of backing this pointless, discredited technology. When there are green technologies that could make a serious difference, especially solar and tidal, it is sad to see Greenpeace backing this environmental vandalism. Robert Barlow Cambridge I am concerned by Gordon Brown's comment that \"the world is going to have to build 1,000 nuclear power stations\". I worry that this approach is merely swapping one unpriced form of pollution for another. To fully consider nuclear power against renewable options it is necessary to establish a price for this pollution. Only then will we have fulfilled our responsibility to stop shifting the cost of today on to tomorrow. Mathew Peel London I am perplexed by this proposal to spend £5,000 per household on solar energy when the UK still throws away waste heat from power stations. Does the government see energy companies as too tough to take on? We could also supply towns with solar heat from large central plants - Marstal and Copenhagen in Denmark already do this. The cost of large collector fields is a fifth of the cost of generating solar heat from lots of small collectors. David Olivier Leominster, Herefordshire We live in a grade II listed cottage and a few years ago, as we could afford it, we fitted double-glazed sash windows to the original traditional design. The windows were spotted by a listed buildings officer and we were given one year to install new single-glazed windows. We were, in fact, forced to decrease the energy efficiency of our home.

From late summer the building is due to swap to green power sources such as water, wind and solar energy, replacing the conventional power that it has largely relied upon until now. Its extensive refurbishment in the late 1990s, including the glass cupola designed by the British architect Sir Norman Foster, had already won it plaudits. Ecologists praised the building's energy efficiency, which has led to a 94% cut in its carbon emissions. Its roof makes passive use of solar power and natural light and its thick, well-insulated 19th-century walls help retain warmth in winter and reduce the need for air conditioning in summer. At the moment biofuel generators in the basement produce 40% of the building's energy, for lighting, heating, the flow of air conditioning and water, while the rest comes mainly from coal and nuclear supplies. But in future the Reichstag, which has been the home of Germany's parliament for nine years, will go a step further, entirely abandoning conventional sources in favour of renewables, which will be provided by an outside supplier. A parliamentary subcommittee agreed last week to seek bids from renewable energy producers to replace that conventional power use, and expects to choose a supplier by late summer. Currently, it costs approximately €3m (£2.3m) a year to provide the energy that keeps the building's lights on, air conditioning flowing and water running. Parliamentarians hope that the switch to clean energy will boost Germany's reputation as one of the greenest countries in the world and help the renewable energy sector. Germany has one of the most globally successful and innovative clean energy industries. Boosted by a subsidy system, around 13% of its electricity comes from renewable power - mostly wind - a figure that is set to rise to 27% over the next 12 years. The greening of the Reichstag fits in with a growing trend in zero-emission homes in Germany, with some homes so energy-efficient that they even produce power.

Sanyo, which has struggled in recent years and was bailed out by investors in 2006, admitted that it miscalculated earnings from dozens of subsidiary companies to the tune of 493.6bn yen (£2.2bn) over six years to March 2006. The effect of these miscalculations has widened Sanyo's loss over the period by ¥6bn and means that the company has paid out ¥28bn too much in dividends. Japan's Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission warned that the company could be ejected from the Tokyo stock exchange and urged its senior regulator - the Financial Services Agency - to fine Sanyo ¥8.3m. It is not the first time that Sanyo has been embroiled in an accounting scandal. This year the company admitted it had miscalculated results in 2003, reporting a profit instead of a loss. Sanyo yesterday apologised to investors, saying it will strengthen its management team, but added that it had found no evidence that officials had deliberately mis-stated the figures. Sanyo will slash the salaries of senior executives such as its president, Seiichiro Sano, who failed to spot the errors, and cancel any pension payouts due to board members who have since retired. About 60 present and former executives are expected to have their pay or pensions reduced as a result of the scandal. If Sanyo were to lose its place on the stock exchange it would be the first company to suffer such an ignominious fate since June 2005, when the consumer goods business Kanebo was ejected. Analysts fretted yesterday that Sanyo's problems could jeopardise recently announced plans to invest ¥350bn in its rechargeable batteries and solar energy divisions. Sanyo's rechargeable batteries are to be found in 40% of mobile phones worldwide and last month it announced plans to focus on this part of its business and its solar energy operations, setting a target of growing sales of rechargeable batteries and solar cells by 50% to ¥600bn in the next three years. Sanyo, which started life making bicycle lights after the second world war, has suffered intense competition from rivals operating in lower-cost markets such as China. Its shares have been the second-worst performer on the Nikkei 225 stock average in the past five years. Sanyo has slashed thousands of jobs and sold off non-core businesses, including its flat-panel display operation and a Thai refrigerator company. It is also looking to sell its mobile phone handset business, which supplies major Japanese players such as NTT DoCoMo and KDDI, to its Japanese rival Kyocera. Plans to sell its computer chip manufacturing operation, Sanyo Semiconductor, to a private equity group collapsed in October. Last year Sanyo launched a debt-for-equity rescue package in which Goldman Sachs, Daiwa Securities and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group purchased ¥300bn of Sanyo preferred stock and gained control of the company. The company had been controlled since its foundation 60 years ago by the Iue family.

Algae could provide a significant part of the answer and represents a multibillion-pound opportunity.\" Transport accounts for one-quarter of the UK's carbon emissions and is the fastest growing sector. Finding carbon-neutral fuels will be crucial to the government meeting its target to reduce overall emissions by 80% by 2050. A recent review by the chairman of the Renewable Fuels Agency, Ed Gallagher, identified algae as a potential way to generate sustainable biofuels. Biofuels made from food crops have been blamed for rising food prices. Algae produce a range of chemicals depending on their species and the environmental conditions in which they grow. View how the process works here. Scientists hope to find strains that can produce oils that could be used to make fuel for cars, as a replacement for petrol and diesel. Once identified, these algae could be grown in large amounts and processed to extract the useful oils. John Loughhead, executive director of the UK Energy Research Council, said: \"Algae are potentially attractive means to harvest solar energy: they reproduce themselves, so there's no manufacturing cost for the solar converter, they can live in areas not useful for food or similar productive use, they don't need clean or even fresh water so don't add to global water stress, and can give oils, biomass, or even hydrogen as a product. Perhaps they'll be the stem cells of the energy world.\" The Carbon Trust forecasts that algae-based biofuels could replace more than 70 billion litres of fossil fuels used every year around the world in road transport and aviation by 2030, equivalent to 12% of annual global jet fuel consumption or 6% of road transport diesel. In carbon terms, this equates to an annual saving of more than 160m tonnes of CO2 globally with a market value of more than £15bn. For the first stage of the project, the Carbon Trust will spend up to £6m in a range of British companies involved in promising algae research. \"You can make algae with a very high oil content and you can make algae that grows very quickly and, at the moment, no one can do both,\" said Robert Trezona, R&amp;D director at the Carbon Trust. Other problems include the best design of mass-culture systems. John Benneman, a consultant on algae who has worked with the US Department of Energy and the International Energy Agency, said that it would take a multitude of approaches to fully realise the potential of algae. \"There are many more different algae species than there are higher plant species so each algae will require specific effort. Each one will have its own peculiar requirements to figure out how to make them productive, how to get the right strains, how to harvest and process them. We cannot just depend on one or two companies.\" The second phase of the project will start in around a year and involves scaling up the algae-growing operation. The Carbon Trust will build multi-hectare open ponds to act as laboratories for the most promising algae technologies identified in the early stages of the challenge. Due to the UK's gloomy weather, these will most likely be built abroad. \"If you I've got 12 months a year of warmth and sunshine, your algae farm just produces much more biomass. In a world where costs will be important, UK algae farms would have a real problem,\" said Trezona. This phase of the project could see the Carbon Trust, and interested partners from industry, investing up to £20m. Loughhead welcomed the Carbon Trust project. \"The critical aspect is that algae convert the energy of sunlight and the efficiency with which they do that determines the economic viability of the whole approach as sunlight is unhelpfully low in energy density. Hopefully this Carbon Trust scheme will help gather information on how well that can be done now, and start the scientific development to improve it for the future.\" There have been major efforts in the past to develop biofuels from algae. Multimillion-dollar programmes funded by the US government in the 1980s found that high biomass yields were possible but research ended when no one found a way to make it commercially competitive with the low oil prices of that era. Work in Japan also faltered when researchers were unable to scale up the growth of algae in photobioreactors, closed vessels that provide plenty of light and conditions that could intensively grow the microorganisms. To date, no one has designed a system that has made it to market. But the Carbon Trust believes that interest in algae has been renewed, thanks to the recent increases in oil prices and public awareness of climate change. Transport minister Andrew Adonis said: \"This project demonstrates our commitment to ensuring that second generation biofuels are truly sustainable — and will further our understanding of the potential for microalgae to be refined for use in renewable transport fuel development, to help reduce carbon dioxide emissions.\" Several companies around the world are already involved in making fuels from algae, with one of the most prominent the San Diego-based company Sapphire Energy. Sapphire plans to use genetically modified algae to produce a chemical mixture from which it is possible to extract what it calls \"green crude\". Their idea is to refine this mixture into fuel for cars and airplanes. Investors include the UK's Wellcome Trust and the company has so far raised $100m to develop its ideas. Loughhead added that another potential benefit of algae is its ability to remove CO2 from the air. \"Although here they will re-emit it when used as fuels, there is the possibility that they could ultimately be used as a means of cleaning the atmosphere — if we can find a way of converting the algae to a safely storable form after they've grown.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2007/sep/15/leadersandreply.mainsection","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2007-09-15T22:51:46Z","webTitle":"Corrections and clarifications","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/sep/15/leadersandreply.mainsection","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2007/sep/15/leadersandreply.mainsection","fields":{"headline":"Corrections and clarifications","bodyText":"Global Solar Energy Inc of Tucson, Arizona, has asked us to make clear that it has no connection with Global Solar Energy Limited of Bournemouth, Dorset - the UK company we wrote about in an article about solar panels - or with David Charles Mead and Robert Graham Rice, former directors of Global Solar Energy Limited (Solar panels - the new double-glazing, page 5, Money, August 25).

In the Middle East, for instance, Israelis and Palestinians – as well as many others around the world – are beginning to believe that the negotiations to determine the long-term status of Palestine are going nowhere. The situation may be more promising than it appears, but one cannot deny that hope for real changes on the ground has faded since talks were relaunched two years ago. This loss of faith is, sadly, establishing a dynamic that will itself inhibit the concessions that are needed if a permanent agreement is to be found. Because an impasse beckons, it is vitally important to work on those areas in which intensive negotiations have the potential to produce quick results. Fresh water is one such area. Across the Middle East, water is a security issue. Indeed, people are now recognising two important facts. First, nations faced with conflicting claims to water have historically found ways to collaborate rather than to fight. Even during the 60 years of conflict in the Jordan Valley, water has more often been a source of cooperation than of conflict. Second, water scarcity is seldom absolute, and even less often an explanation of poverty. To quote the United Nations Human Development Report for 2006: \"There is more than enough water in the world for domestic purposes, for agriculture and for industry …Scarcity is manufactured through political processes and institutions that disadvantage the poor.\" But almost every nation in the Middle East is using more water than arrives on a renewable basis. There simply is not enough water for everything these nations want to use it for, and the situation will only worsen. Yet, even in Palestine, the crucial water issue is not thirst, but arrested economic development. In the short term, Palestine needs more water to provide employment and income from farming; in the longer term, educational, cultural, and political changes are needed in order to develop a capacity to adapt. The region's climate and geography mean that water resources are unavoidably shared. But only if water is shared in a rational manner that respects the region's fragile ecology will human life be sustainable. Clearly, no final agreement on water will be possible until there are agreed-upon borders between the state of Israel and the state of Palestine (assuming a two-state solution), and some resolution of the Israeli settlements in the West Bank. But any interim resolution of water issues does not need to wait for final resolution of the major questions of territory. Finding rational ways to share and co-manage water may be easier than solving the \"big\" issues. In fact, water could help to create a climate of success that aids political progress in other areas. The good news is that the quantity of water that is needed for drinking, cooking, other household chores and sanitation is small. Most water is used to grow food, so, if a nation's economy is healthy, there is scope for saving water by importing a greater share of food, although every nation will want to maintain some assured food supply for security reasons. The bad news is that water, unlike land, cannot simply be divided. Water flows on the surface and underground. As it moves, it changes in quantity and quality, and it supports different ecosystems. Moreover, demand for water changes over time. Only a few percentage points of the Israeli GNP come from agriculture today; as a result, its economy requires less water than it once did. Exactly the same transition is likely to occur in Palestine, but it has not happened yet. Few Israelis deny that Palestinians need more water. Similarly, there is wide agreement that some water currently used by Israelis will have to be allocated to Palestinian use. The current negotiations will inevitably deal with rights to water, which do not seem to be very contentious any more, and the talks can suggest various mechanisms for transfer of management in some cases and for shared management in others. These are eminently negotiable issues. A flexible and sustainable formula can certainly be found, almost surely including a transitional period that allows both sides to adjust to and account for their different water management systems, as well as for changing conditions and institutions in the future. The principle of a just division of water resources to meet the Palestinians' urgent needs for additional water should be taken as a starting point. Everything else can be worked out. Shared water calls for flexible, continuous, cooperative water management, based on agreed-upon rights and responsibilities, as well as continuing monitoring and dispute resolution mechanisms. One important point should be added: extensive public participation and transparency, in terms of both process and outcomes, will be key to successful management. We believe that progress in the peace process and in finding solutions for water issues between Israel and Palestine would also help to unblock progress in the broader region, between the parties on the Jordan, the Orontes, the Tigris, and the Euphrates rivers. Water can be a catalyst for regional cooperation, opening the way to a future comprehensive community of water and energy to enhance the human environment. In such a forum, water and solar energy in tandem could help to move the Middle East from conflict to collaboration. The cost of inaction or merely pretending to act is likely to be high for everyone in the Middle East. Future water policy should no longer be seen as an extension of current policy, but rather as a new opportunity. Water is the essence of life. People in Palestine and in Israel need it; people in the region need it. Cooperating to secure it is the only way forward.

The study increases the possibility that there are significant deposits of water trapped in rocks at the moon's poles, which would be invaluable for astronauts setting up a future permanent base. Finding water was a surprise because scientists believe the moon formed when a Mars-sized planet collided with the infant Earth. The impact threw up huge amounts of molten rock that formed the moon, but in the process volatile substances such as water would have been lost into space. \"Most people believed that the moon was dry,\" said Alberto Saal at Brown University in Rhode Island, who was part of the team that did the research. \"People had tried to measure for 40 years and couldn't see any evidence for water ... they were not convinced we were doing something worthwhile.\" He and his colleagues used a new and extremely sensitive technique to analyse rocks collected during the Apollo 15 mission in 1971 and the last visit by people to the moon, Apollo 17 in 1972. Since being brought back to Earth the rocks have been kept in nitrogen gas at the Johnson Space Centre in Houston, Texas. Saal's analysis involved polishing tiny grains of volcanic glass in the rocks to get to the chemical composition inside. Any chemicals on the outside could have been deposited after the minerals cooled in eruptions on the moon around 2bn years ago. Crucially, the concentration of water was highest in the centre of the samples and became progressively lower towards the outside, proving that the water was in the original rocks and not deposited later by contamination from asteroids or during the samples' return to Earth. The research is published in today's issue of the journal Nature. The finding will give new impetus to two Nasa missions seeking water deposits on the moon. The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, due to launch later this year, is hunting for water at the poles, while the Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite's primary objective is to look for water ice. It is due to launch next year. Finding water is crucial to Nasa's plans for moon exploration. \"This could be really important if you want to put a base [on the moon],\" said Saal. The extracted water could be used for thirsty astronauts and to create hydrogen to use as fuel. Professor John Zarnecki, a space scientist at the Open University, said the analysis would also provide crucial evidence about the formation of the early solar system. \"It's like a sort of detective story in which the crime happened 4.5bn years ago. On Earth all the evidence has gone, but on the moon there is evidence of what went on,\" he said. \"Because the moon has been relatively inert and not much has happened we can actually use it as an indicator of what happened in the early history of the solar system, and of course that means what happened to us.\" The action of tectonic plates on Earth means that rocks from Earth's early history have mostly been drawn down into the mantle at geological faults. Zarnecki also said the research was an example of the impressive ongoing scientific legacy of the Apollo missions. \"Most people would imagine that you bring the stuff back, do the analysis over a couple of years then that's it,\" he said, \"[but] we are still getting great science from stuff collected 35 years ago.\" What did Apollo do for us? Many people believe that non-stick frying pans were one of the Apollo programme's technological spin-offs. That is an urban myth, but Nasa claims that plenty of other technologies used on Apollo have made their way into our everyday lives. The cordless drill Apollo astronauts used a self-contained drill to extract rock samples on the moon. Refinement has led to cordless drills and vacuum cleaners. Time keeping Electronically-stimulated quartz crystals kept the Apollo astronauts on time. They are now used in millions of quartz clocks. Water purification The Apollo mission used a new purification technology based on silver ions, rather than chlorine or bromine. It is now used to keep pools and spas bacteria-free. Solar energy Technology developed to power the Apollo craft using the sun's energy directly is now used on Earth."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2008/jun/22/travelandtransport.carbonemissions","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2008-06-21T23:01:00Z","webTitle":"Electric cars given official green light to boost climate change goals","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/jun/22/travelandtransport.carbonemissions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2008/jun/22/travelandtransport.carbonemissions","fields":{"headline":"Electric cars given official green light to boost climate change goals","bodyText":"Electric cars could play a major role in the shift to environmentally friendly transport, the government will reveal this week. As part of its long-awaited renewable energy strategy, to be published on Thursday, it will argue that there is massive potential in the UK for plug-in hybrids, for car batteries charged on grid electricity and for vehicles powered by hydrogen fuel cells. The proposal is part of a £100bn scheme to reinvigorate Britain's flagging plans for cutting emissions of carbon dioxide. Developing cars to run on electricity is important because their energy can be derived from renewable energy sources, the strategy points out. In Israel, which is developing a flourishing electric car industry, there are plans for solar energy to provide the power for charging batteries to run electric vehicles. In the UK, wind or wave generators would be used. 'Fossil fuels are going to run out; we're going to have to be driving electric vehicles,' said Robert Evans, chief executive of Cenex, a government-backed organisation that aims to introduce low-carbon vehicle technology. 'This is such an innovative idea it has caught a high level of imagination across the sector. If the motor industry invests in it, it has a real potential to move quicker than market forces might otherwise dictate.' Cars currently generate about 20 per cent of the planet's output of carbon dioxide. Cutting that figure would have a big effect on climate change. Electric cars can also use energy to charge batteries at night when demand on the national grid is low. Local councils, including Westminster, Camden and Islington in London, have already set up a small number of charging points for private electric cars. Evans said interest was growing owing to a combination of incentives, such as free parking, exemption from the congestion charge in London and the recent rises in the price of petrol. Another trial, run by Mercedes, has distributed all-electric, two-seater Smart cars. The first were delivered to Coventry City Council last December with a view to testing them in urban situations for four years. They can be plugged into the mains and run for 70 miles at up to 60mph on a full charge. 'The aim is to get the data from various trials then make a decision about a production version,' said a spokesman for Mercedes. 'We want to see how the battery performs in real-life situations and what sort of usage patterns these cars have.' Another scheme is Project Better Place, which is backed by Silicon Valley entrepreneur Shia Agassi. His company has raised £100m so far to set up a network of charging and battery-exchange stations in Israel by 2010. The cars, being developed by Renault-Nissan, are expected to have a range of 140 miles on a full charge with a top speed of 68mph. The first few thousand cars should be operating within the system by next year and the aim is to put a further 10,000 into the scheme each month in 2010. The cars can be charged or flat batteries can be replaced with a charged one. However, Geoff Callow, managing director of Turquoise Engineering Consulting, which designs low-carbon technologies for cars, said electric cars will have a future for short journeys within cities, but are not fit for general purposes: 'You certainly can't tow your caravan on holiday for a fortnight.' Current ideas · The first electric carriage was invented by Scottish businessman Robert Anderson in the 1830s. · Electric cars were made by Edison, Studebaker and others in the early 20th century and successfully sold as town cars to upper-class customers and as vehicles suitable for women drivers due to their clean, quiet and easy operation. · General Motors introduced a range of battery-powered cars, including the Electrovair in 1966 and the Electrovette. · In 1985 Clive Sinclair's C5 one-seater electric tricycle is ridiculed in the press and fails to entice buyers. · Since the late 1980s, electric vehicles have been promoted in the US, through the use of tax credits, as zero emission vehicles (ZEVs)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2008/sep/02/alternativeenergy.solarpower","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2008-09-02T14:50:32Z","webTitle":"Seawater greenhouse project could turn deserts into fertile land for food and water","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/02/alternativeenergy.solarpower","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2008/sep/02/alternativeenergy.solarpower","fields":{"headline":"Seawater greenhouses to bring life to the desert","bodyText":"Vast greenhouses that use seawater to grow crops could be combined with solar power plants to provide food, fresh water and clean energy in deserts, under an ambitious proposal from a team of architects and engineers. The Sahara Forest project would marry huge greenhouses with concentrated solar power (CSP), which uses mirrors to focus the sun's rays and generate heat and electricity. The installations would turn deserts into lush patches of vegetation, according to its designers, and without the need to dig wells for fresh water, which has depleted acquifers in many parts of the world. The team includes one of the lead architects behind Cornwall's Eden project and demonstration plants are already running in Tenerife, Oman and the United Arab Emirates. Plants cannot grow in deserts because of the extreme temperatures and lack of nutrients and water. Charlie Paton, one of the Sahara Forest team and the inventor of the seawater greenhouse concept, said his technology was a proven way to transform arid environments. \"Plants need light for growth but they don't like heat beyond a certain point,\" said Paton. Above a particular temperature, the amount of water lost through the holes in its leaves, called stomata, gets so large that a plant will shut down photosynthesis and cannot grow. The greenhouses work by using the solar farm to power seawater evaporators and then pump the damp, cool air through the greenhouse. This reduces the temperature by about 15C compared to that outside. At the other end of the greenhouse from the evaporators, the water vapour is condensed. Some of this fresh water is used to water the crops, while the rest can be used for the essential task of cleaning the solar mirrors. \"So we've got conditions in the greenhouse of high humidity and lower temperature,\" said Paton. \"The crops sitting in this slightly steamy, humid condition can grow fantastically well.\" The designers said that virtually any vegetables could be grown in the greenhouses, depending on the conditions at which it is maintained. The demonstration plants already produce lettuces, peppers, cucumbers and tomatoes. The nutrients to grow the plants could come from local seaweed or even be extracted from the seawater itself. Michael Pawlyn of Exploration Architecture, who worked on the Eden Project for seven years and is now part of the Sahara Forest team, said the seawater greenhouse and CSP provided substantial synergies for each other. \"Both technologies work extremely well in hot, dry desert locations – CSP produces a lot of waste heat and we'd be able to use that to evaporate more seawater from the greenhouse,\" he said. \"And CSP needs a supply of clean, demineralised water in order for the [electricity generating] turbines to function and to keep the mirrors at peak output. It just so happens the seawater greenhouse produces large quantities of this.\" Paton said that the greenhouse produces more than five times the fresh water needed to water the plants inside so, in addition to producing water to clean the CSP mirrors, some of it can be released into the local environment. This can create a local microclimate just outside the greenhouses for hardier plants such as jatropha, an energy crop that can be turned into biofuel. The ability to create similar microclimates has already been proven in the demonstration greenhouses Paton has built. The cost of the Sahara Forest project could be relatively low since both CSP and seawater greenhouses are proven technologies – the designers estimate that building 20 hectares of greenhouses combined with a 10MW CSP scheme would cost around €80m (£65m). Paton said groups in countries across the Middle East, including UAE, Oman, Bahrain, Qatar and Kuwait, have expressed interest in the possibility of funding demonstration projects. He added that using seawater greenhouses could reverse the environmental damage done by the greenhouses already built in places such as Almeria in southern Spain. More than 40,000 hectares of greenhouses have been built in this desert region during the past 20 years to grow salad vegetables. \"They take water out of the ground something like five times faster than it comes in, so the water table drops and becomes more saline. The whole of Spain is being sucked dry. If one were to convert them all to the seawater greenhouse concept, it would turn an unsustainable solution into a more sustainable one.\" \"In places like Oman, they've effectively sterilised large areas of land by using groundwater that's become increasingly saline,\" said Pawlyn. \"The beauty of the Sahara Forest scheme is that you can reverse that process and turn barren land into biologically-productive land.\" Neil Crumpton, an energy specialist at Friends of the Earth, said the potential of desert technologies was huge. \"Concentrated solar power mirror arrays covering just one per cent of the Earth's deserts could supply a fifth of all current global energy consumption. And one million tonnes of sea water could be evaporated every day from just 20,000 hectares of greenhouses.\" He added: \"Governments around the world should invest serious money in these solar energy and water technologies and not be distracted by lobbyists promoting dangerous nuclear power or nuclear-powered desalination schemes.\" Harnessing the desert sun's rays is already at the heart of an ambitious European scheme to build a €45bn (£35.7bn) supergrid that could allow countries across the continent to share renewable electricity from solar power in north Africa, wind energy in the UK and Denmark, and geothermal energy from Iceland and Italy. The north Africa solar plan has already gained political support in Europe from Gordon Brown and Nicolas Sarkozy. Though expensive, it is in line with International Energy Agency estimates that the world needs to invest more than $45tn (£22.5tn) in new energy systems over the next 30 years."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2008/mar/24/climatechange.fossilfuels","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2008-03-24T09:54:55Z","webTitle":"Scientists warn of soot effect on climate","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/mar/24/climatechange.fossilfuels","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2008/mar/24/climatechange.fossilfuels","fields":{"headline":"Scientists warn of soot effect on climate","bodyText":"Soot produced by burning coal, diesel, wood and dung causes significantly more damage to the environment than previously thought, according to research published today. So-called \"black carbon\" could cause up to 60% of the current warming effect of carbon dioxide, according to the US researchers, making it an important target for efforts to slow global warming. Around 400,000 people are estimated to die each year due to inhaling soot particles, particularly because of indoor cooking on wood and dung stoves in developing countries. These deaths are mainly among women and children. Professor Greg Carmichael, of the University of Iowa, one of the authors of the study, published in Nature Geoscience, said: \"Trying to develop strategies that really go after black carbon is really a very good short-term strategy and a win-win strategy for both climate and air pollution perspectives.\" Carmichael and Professor V Ramanathan, at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego, put together data from satellites, aircraft and surface instruments on the warming effect from black carbon. They conclude that its effect in the atmosphere is around 0.9 watts per square metre, considerably higher than the estimate of between 0.2 and 0.4 watts in last year's report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Most particulates in the atmosphere reduce the warming effect from greenhouse gases by bouncing radiation back into space - so-called global dimming. But black carbon has the opposite effect and Ramanathan and Carmichael argue that its contribution to global warming has been underestimated. \"The aerosols in aggregate are either acting to, you could say, cool the atmosphere or mask the effect of CO2,\" said Carmichael, \"[Black carbon] is the only component of this aerosol mix that in and of itself is a heating element.\" Previous estimates had not taken into account the fact that it has a larger impact at high altitude in the atmosphere and that it interacts with other particulates in the atmosphere. Scientists do not fully understand these interactions, but observations suggest that they result in more warming. The researchers said that programmes to replace wood-burning stoves with clean technology such as solar energy in developing countries such as India should be pursued to reduce the number of deaths caused by inhaling the smoke. The authors stressed that these measures were not a magic bullet. \"It is important to emphasise that black carbon reduction can only help delay and not prevent unprecedented climate changes due to CO2 emissions,\" they wrote."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2009/may/02/google-univeristy-ray-kurzweil-artificial-intelligence","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2009-05-01T23:01:00Z","webTitle":"Ed Pilkington meets Ray Kurzweil, the man who predicts future","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/may/02/google-univeristy-ray-kurzweil-artificial-intelligence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2009/may/02/google-univeristy-ray-kurzweil-artificial-intelligence","fields":{"headline":"'The future is going to be very exciting'","bodyText":"Ray Kurzweil has a surrealist's eye for disorientation.

The Tom Swift books, he adds, were his favourite reading when he was seven. It's all getting a little too weird, and the interview hasn't even begun yet. Let's begin with the uncontested facts. Ray Kurzweil is an inventor of considerable repute, an expert on the information technology revolution and the future of artificial intelligence. As a young man he put together some of the earliest electronic keyboards and created a machine that can scan and read printed literature to blind people - the first customer was Stevie Wonder, who has become a lifelong friend. He boasts countless awards, is in the US inventors hall of fame, has written several New York Times bestsellers, and sits on the board of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He is the subject of a documentary, Transcendent Man, that will be released this year and is completing his own film, The Singularity is Near. And lest any doubt about his standing remains, Bill Gates regards him as the \"best person I know at predicting the future of artificial intelligence\". To cap all that, a new university opening next month will be named after one of his key theories. Sponsored by Google, the Singularity University will be housed on the Silicon Valley campus of Nasa. It will bring together some of the biggest names in frontier disciplines such as bio- and nano-technology, neuroscience and artificial intelligence. The university will open its doors in July to 40 students paying $25,000 (£17,000) each for a nine-week course. Their challenge will be to come up with new ideas addressing some of the world's most pressing problems. On the agenda: climate change, world poverty and hunger. Were the story of Ray Kurzweil to end at this point, we would be left with an impressive though not wildly out of the ordinary technology pioneer. But Kurzweil is anything but ordinary. Take what he tells me about the prospects for medical intervention. With the completion of the human genome, he says, health and medicine have become a branch of information technology. \"We have now the software of life - the code that underlines it. We have tools now to change the software. How often do you go without updating the software on your cellphone? Probably not more than a couple of weeks as it updates automatically. When was the last time you updated the software running in your body? It is out of date.\" In the land of Kurzweil, the possibility of reprogramming the body is not a dry academic theory, it is a blueprint for how to lead your life. That's why he has a cabinet covered in vitamin boxes, including those anti-ageing packs. He has turned himself into a living medical experiment with the hope - more than that, the expectation - that it will allow him to live far into the distant future and perhaps forever. Every day he takes about 150 supplements with the aim of reprogramming his biochemistry. Once a week he spends a day at a health clinic having particular compounds fed into him intravenously. What on earth does he do that for? The answer is that though he turned 61 on Thursday, he believes that physically he is preserving himself to be much younger. \"How old am I really? I've stayed around 40. I was 38 biologically when I was 40, and I'm 40 or 41 today. There is a biological ageing test and that's what it registers for me.\" White rabbits, Grateful Dead, 61-year-olds with the biology of someone two decades their junior. Is now the time to terminate the interview and run screaming out of the office? He calmly insists that his pursuit of youth is quite logical. \"People ask me whether I think taking all these supplements will allow me to live hundreds of years. No. The point is only to stay in good shape another 15 years or so before we have developed the ability to reprogram our biology through nanotechnology using nanobots - blood-cell sized devices in our bloodstream that will keep us healthy.\" Does he really want to live forever? Wouldn't the thrill of life start to fade after a few thousand years or so? \"If the future remained the same and no new ideas or experiences happened then ultimately we'd grow weary. But that is not the case. The future is going to be a very exciting place, and that's why I'd like to stick around to see it.\" The burning sense of the future's potential has been with him since a very early age. He decided to be an inventor when he was five, he says. \"My parents provided me with all these erector sets and construction toys, and I had the idea that if you put these parts together you could create transcendent effects. I didn't have that vocabulary, but I did have the feeling that you could do magical things and solve problems.\" From the age of seven he began reading those Tom Swift books, devouring one after another. Each book, with titles like Tom Swift and His Airship and Tom Swift and His Wireless Message, has an identical plot: the world is faced with an existential crisis; Tom goes into the basement of his house and tinkers with some gadgets; Tom emerges with an invention that will save the day. For Tom Swift read Ray Kurzweil. By the age of 13 he was designing software. While still a teenager he was setting up companies to exploit his ideas, and selling them for large sums. His urge to invent was insatiable, and it led him to an obsession with futurology. It began mundanely. To maximise the profit from his inventions he started to study technology trends in an attempt to divine the best moment to launch any new product. In the process, he made what he considers an extraordinary discovery: that the trajectory of new technologies was astonishingly predictable. More importantly, the graph they followed was not linear, as most people thought, but exponential. \"Most people's expectation of the future is that the current pace will continue, despite the fact that the power of technology is doubling every year.\" This was his eureka moment, and in his view it revolutionises everything. He uses the example of a person walking a certain distance. If the person takes 30 linear steps - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 - they travel 30 units. But if those steps are exponential - 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 - they reach 1 billion. So it is with technology. \"When I was an undergraduate at MIT we shared one computer that took up a whole building. The cellphone in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times more powerful. That's a billion times the sales performance - and we'll do it again in the next 25 years.\" This identification of the exponential growth in technological firepower, coupled with a fervent belief that there is no problem that cannot be solved through its application, is the key to Kurzweil. It unlocked his predictions of the coming of the internet, the fall of the Soviet Union partly as a result of the spread of communications, and the defeat of the world chess champion by a computer (he was a year out - in the 1980s he predicted 1998; Garry Kasparov lost to Deep Blue in 1997). Exponential growth also lies at the heart of his aspirations for the new Singularity University. Through it he wants to pursue solar energy as a solution to climate change. \"Right now about half a percent of the world's energy needs are from solar, so people say 'Oh, that's not a big deal'. But solar has doubled every two years - and it's only eight doublings away from 100%. In 20 years it could meet all the world's energy needs.\" Similarly, Kurzweil detects in the explosion of cellphone use across Africa the opportunity to combat illness and hunger. He wants to design software that could be downloaded on to all African cellphones that would easily diagnose and provide remedial directions for leading local diseases. Listening to Kurzweil's high-velocity monologue, it's almost shocking how optimistic he is. After the 20th century's disasters with centralised planning, and this century's disasters involving terrorism and the black hole of the financial system, it's not fashionable to talk about the inevitable march of progress. But Kurzweil is unwavering. \"People very often don't realise how far we've come. Think of the improvements that we've seen: human life expectancy was 37 in 1800, 48 in 1900 ...\" And in 2035? His prediction in that regard is that by 2029 computers will be able to pass the Turing test - that is, pass themselves off as human in conversation. Soon after that the \"singularity\" will have been reached, the point at which artificial intelligence will so far exceed the human brain that ordinary mortals will no longer be able to keep up. By 2035 the human brain and computers will begin to merge - literally. Those nanobots will be used to vastly extend the reach of human intelligence. They will allow us to control all our senses by computer and enter a full virtual reality in which we could become other people. (Ray tells me that since the age of eight his fantasy has been to become a female rock singer called Ramona.) Kurzweil predicts looming human protests against the granting of legal rights to human-computer mergers, which explains the \"NO RIGHTS FOR BOTS!\" placard in his office: it was a prop used in his forthcoming film. The problem with the more outlandish side of his thinking is that it has earned him a reputation for crankiness that in turn casts a shadow over his genuinely important work. As one critic put it: \"It's as if you took a lot of very good food and some dog excrement and blended it all up so that you can't possibly figure out what's good or bad.\" Surely he resents such comments, and the damage to his overall standing? \"I'm not uncomfortable with the controversy,\" he replies. \"It's part of the process new ideas have to go through.\" I leave Kurzweil's cluttered office carrying enough food for thought to last me, oh, at least a couple of hundred years. Is it time to start popping those pills? On the plane back to New York I open one of his books and read the inscription he has written inside. \"To Ed, to a (very) long and healthy life. Ray.\" The eureka moments 1963 Aged 15, Kurzweil wrote his first computer program to help alleviate boredom. It was picked up by IBM 1965 Developed a program that wrote music in the style of famous composers 1974-6 Designed the first computer program that could understand letter shapes in any font, wrote a program that converted scanned text into synthesised speech, and then combined the two inventions to create the Kurzweil reading machine. This \"read\" printed text aloud through a voice synthesiser, for the use of blind people. First customer: Stevie Wonder. The machine was as big as a table; now it fits in the pocket 1984 Perfected the electronic keyboard. Used sampling of the sounds of instruments to produce rich authentic reproductions of the entire orchestra.

The graph shows the nation's total electricity demand during the first round 2006 World Cup match between England and Sweden. Demand steadily falls throughout the first half, followed by a sudden spike at half-time, followed by another steady fall, then another spike and a plateau at the end of the match. Fenn is pointing to the lowest point of demand, right at the end of the game's first half. He asks: \"What do you think we were looking for?\" I look blank. \"We were looking to see if there was going to be any extra time played,\" he explains patiently. For the controllers who staff the National Grid's control room 24 hours a day, extra time in a national football match means something very significant. They are waiting for hundreds of thousands of kettles to be boiled at half-time, countless fridge doors to be opened and a multitude of kitchen lights to be flicked on. At half-time in 2006, electricity demand soared by almost two gigawatts in a matter of minutes – equivalent to suddenly needing the combined output of nearly two Dungeness B nuclear power plants. Twenty minutes later, as everyone sat back down in front of the TV, the demand had disappeared. To anticipate this sort of spike in demand, the grid engineers quickly need to bring extra power plants online. Extra time played in the game could mean they bring the power on too early, risking tripping fuses on the grid. Bring it online too late, however, and blackouts could result. It's a fine balancing act, and also highly expensive and polluting. A key component of being able to match these sudden spikes in demand is what is known as 'spinning reserve' – essentially keeping a power station running but only using a part of its output, ready to ramp up to full power at a moment's notice. Because this kind of use is unsuited to nuclear power plants, which take days to come on- or offline, and can potentially damage the more modern and sensitive natural gas plants, it tends to be the workhorse coal power stations that fulfil this 'balancing' role. One estimate suggests that more than 2.1 million tonnes of CO2 are produced every year simply keeping these power stations 'ticking over', waiting for us to flip the kettle on. It's not just football matches that generate these spikes in demand, however. In fact, every winter's day our demand for electricity soars from a night-time low of around 35 to almost 60 gigawatts during the evening rush hour. In the summer, that profile is different still – flatter, but with different peaks when air conditioning equipment is switched on in the heat of the day. Fenn can point to little spikes in our electricity demand during the middle of the night when night storage heaters suddenly trip into life. \"We're students of collective public behaviour,\" he admits. A cool innovation Endearing as it may be, however, our electrical behaviour is becoming increasingly problematic. The current reliance on coal power plants to balance out demand will come to end as a result of the 2007 Large Combustion Plant Directive – legislation that regulates the non-CO2 emissions from coal and oil plants, and which will force several to close by 2015. And on the flip-side, as more wind energy is brought online the variability of the grid will increase. Although wind energy is not 'unpredictable' as some critics suggest – it can be accurately forecast hours in advance – it does prove a problem for the current grid setup, where supply has to be matched to demand at all costs. Wind may blow strongly in the middle of the night, when the demand is low, but slacken off during the evening rush hour. What's clearly needed is some way of matching not only supply to demand, but also demand to supply – some sort of what the industry likes to call 'demand management'. \"Don't say demand management!\" hisses David Hirst when we first meet. \"Say demand. Only the electricity companies would be so arrogant as to talk about \"managing\" their customers.\" A former IT expert and the inventor of a technology that might help even out the variability on the grid, Hirst has developed a small, cheap piece of electronics that could be built into all new home fridges and freezers. Currently being marketed by British company RLtec, the device would constantly 'listen' to the frequency of the grid – a direct indication of whether the grid is over- or underpowered. If the grid frequency drops then the fridge would know that lots of consumers had suddenly increased their electricity demand – perhaps for the half-time cuppa – and that operators in the grid control room would be about to open the throttle on a series of coal-fired power plants. In response, the fridge could switch its cooling unit off until the grid frequency had returned to a normal level – in effect reducing 'non-essential' demand until the grid operators had managed to balance the system again, hopefully without resorting to too much coal. \"The fridges would only remain off for between 15 and 30 minutes,\" Hirst says. \"Any longer than half an hour, and the fridges would say to themselves, \"stuff this for a laugh\", and start working again. Food preservation is paramount.\" Some good scientific modelling work has been done on this, which suggests that if each of the three million domestic fridges sold in the UK every year were fitted with this technology (known as 'dynamic demand'), then the equivalent electrical response of all these units would be 35 megawatts – the size of a small wind farm. If, however, all of the UK's 40 million fridges were eventually replaced with dynamic demand units, then the response level would rise to between 728 and 1,174 megawatts – a level that RLtec claims would make an entire spinning reserve power plant obsolete. It's an attractive idea, and one that National Grid welcomes. \"Evening-out demand would make things very much simpler for us,\" Fenn says. \"There's a great opportunity for technology here.\" There is, however, also a great shrugging of shoulders when it comes to deciding who will pay for installing the dynamic demand equipment in the fridges. In theory, the rapid-response service provided by the fridges is worth a fair amount of money to National Grid – between £4.40 and £34.10 per fridge, in fact, according to Government commissioned research. This is because it offsets expensive charges made by coal power plant operators for their usual balancing services. National Grid, though, is reluctant to commit to funding the fridges without knowing exactly how effective they will be in aggregate. There is also talk of using money from the Carbon Emissions Reduction Target (CERT) energy eficiency levy on the power companies – the tax that explains why your utility is throwing energy-saving light bulbs at you and offering to lag your loft. As yet, everyone is waiting for the result of a larger smart fridge trial, due to report back in 2010. Fridges are only the tip of dynamic demand iceberg, however. For a start, Hirst says, they essentially only allow the grid to 'borrow' power for half an hour – after that, they all need cooling back down again. Where things get more exciting, though, is when you look at the possibility of shifting the 'on' times of other appliances, such as dishwashers. Hirst calculates that if the UK's 10 million dishwasher owners were to load up the machines with crockery and then, rather than switch them on immediately after dinner, set the machines simply to have the load washed between 11pm and 7am, then the grid would effectively have 10 gigawatt hours (Gwh) of flexible storage. This vast amount is equivalent to the capacity of the Dinorwig pumped storage plant in Wales, which pumps water up into a huge reservoir when electricity is cheap and then lets it roar through turbines when demand surges in the evening. It could also save a considerable amount of CO2 often produced during the evening peak by gas power stations. As electric-car ownership increases, so will electricity demand. It makes sense to charge cars at night when demand is low, but linked into smart meters, cars could charge whenever electricity is cheap – when the wind is strong, for example. They could also feed power back to the grid at times of high demand, like a giant battery. The list goes on. Immersion heaters in our hot water tanks are, like fridges, currently a law unto themselves, tripping on when their thermostats tell them to. As long as water is hot for morning showers or evening baths, however, the exact time at which these devices run is not especially important to us – but very important in terms of running a low-carbon electricity system. Similarly, certain spaceheating systems, such as storage heaters or underfloor heating could become more flexible. What's needed is a way of bringing these appliances together so that they know when is the most eficient time to power up. Enter the smart meter – the only part of the much-vaunted 'smart grid' that the householder will ever see. A smart meter is essentially a meter that allows two-way communication: the electricity company can read the meter remotely and the householder can see both how much power they are using, and how much it costs. Unfortunately, that's about where consensus on smart meters stops. Some would like the meters simply to give customers information on energy usage; others see the display part of the meters – sited in the house – as a tool to discourage householders from using energy at peak times; still others would like to see the meter communicate remotely with appliances in the house, allowing them to operate at the most efficient times of day. Joe Short, an expert in the field and founder of the charity Dynamic Demand, warns that a mistake with smart meters at this early stage could spell disaster for developing truly energy efficient ways of running our homes. \"We need to be very careful that the smart meter agenda is not driven by the agenda of the large energy suppliers,\" he says. \"The big players are interested in smart metering because of the automatic meter-reading element, but we need a signal to get into the house – either a carbon or price signal. We need not to miss the opportunity of all these smart meters.\" David Hirst is worried about the influence of the energy companies on smart metering for a different reason. \"Do you really want someone to be able to control the appliances in your house? Least of all the electricity companies?\" he asks, voicing a concern already raised by consumer groups. Hirst has a different model for smart meters, one that explains why he insists on referring to demand 'participation' rather than 'management'. He wants to see smart meters tune into future price broadcasts from the electricity companies, sent out every few minutes. A high electricity price would indicate high demand on the grid (and hence, high CO2 emissions), while a low price would indicate either low demand or an abundance of wind or solar energy. Appliances – laundry machines, dishwashers and even electric cars – would calculate when would be cheapest to run and plan to wait until the best time to switch themselves on. \"It would mean you, and your appliances, would have a choice,\" Hirst says. \"Occasionally, you may simply say, 'I need it urgently – I'll pay the extra'. That's participation.\" The future of smart meters – and smart appliances – is yet to be written. A recent trial in the District of Columbia, US, saw 1,400 customers fitted with smart meters coupled to their air conditioning units. With the householder's day-to-day permission, the electricity company was able to deactivate the home's air conditioning system at times of peak electricity demand, and give customers a rebate on their bill as a result. The UK's own trials, conducted by Ofgem, have been disappointing, dogged by equipment problems. But elsewhere in Europe – notably in Italy, where almost 30 million meters have been installed – the response has been positive. 'Smart' appliances and demand-responsive fridges are, of course, only bits of kit. If householders and tenants fail to engage with the new devices – and in one of the UK trials a quarter of those using energy monitors didn't even bother to replace the batteries when they ran out – then no amount of technical wizardry will help. The purpose of all these devices is simple: in the words of Jessica Strömbäck of the VaasaETT Global Energy Think Tank at a 'demand response' conference in January: \"It is important in the long run that customers change their view of electricity from a natural human right to the costly resource that it is\". • Mark Anslow is the Ecologist's news editor • This article was shared by The Ecologist, part of the Guardian Environment Network"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2007/aug/25/moneysupplement.ethicalliving","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2007-08-25T16:44:00Z","webTitle":"Solar panels - the new double-glazing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2007/aug/25/moneysupplement.ethicalliving","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2007/aug/25/moneysupplement.ethicalliving","fields":{"headline":"Solar panels - the new double-glazing","bodyText":"Saving the planet, or saving on power bills - either way there is powerful motivation for harnessing solar energy to heat your home, even after this dismal summer. But it is all too easy for persuasive sales people to hijack the green energy message and leave customers, often elderly or vulnerable, with a system that can cost them a year's pension or more. It might only prove worthwhile for their grandchildren or great-grandchildren. Purchasers could end up paying substantially over the odds - up to twice as much as a competitive quote in some cases. And they are often left confused by double-glazing-style sales methods such as \"drop closes\" - offering a big reduction on an inflated price but only if you sign up there and then. When Cambridge resident Sarah Baker's 90-year-old mother, Joan, received a flyer through her Huntingdonshire door in March this year it: · warned her of further energy price rises (which did not happen); · told her the answer was \"free solar energy\" (but only if she paid many thousands); · informed her she could qualify for a \"subsidised water heating system\" (there are grants of up to £400); · promised \"tax free returns\" (you pay no tax on energy bill reductions). Impressed, she filled in the reply form and asked for a \"free, no obligation\" survey and quotation. However, what the flyer from SolarSol UK - based in Braintree, Essex - did not say, was that the solar installation costs so much it might take half a century or more to make economic sense - and that's ignoring maintenance costs, the cost of loans, or interest lost on savings. \"The salesman convinced my mother on the first visit. She signed up for solar heating. She was told the retail price was £7,896 but, if she allowed her home to be used in publicity, and taking into account the value of a government grant, she could have the panels, pump, control unit and new tank fitted for £4,950 if she signed up that day,\" says Ms Baker. \"She paid a £1,650, one-third deposit, by debit card.\" SolarSol UK's quotation says: \"The lower price cannot be left with you for consideration as the showsite subsidies in the UK will be allocated on a first-come first-serve basis from our local addvertising (sic) budget.\" \"My mother realised the next morning she had made a mistake and, two days later, we tried to cancel.\" But because Joan had returned the inquiry form, she had \"invited\" SolarSol UK. This meant she lost the \"cooling off\" rights she would have had if the salesman had arrived unannounced. The government promised to extend it to those who \"invite\" salespeople, but this has not yet happened. SolarSol UK did, however, promise in its contract that it would allow cancellations with a 10% deduction. On April 2, SolarSol said it it would refund £1,650, less £100 for the salesman's expense. But more than four months later, Ms Baker contacted Guardian Money as the refund cheque had failed to materialise. SolarSol UK says it is \"part of the fastest growing solar company in Europe\" although the name of that company is not stated. It was set up on November 30, 2006, and has two directors, David Charles Mead, 48, and Robert Graham Rice, 59. Both have a mixed company ownership history. Mr Meade was previously a director for 13 months at Global Solar Energy, which never filed accounts at Companies House. He was also a director until 2000 of Essence of Nature Aromatherapie, which was dissolved. Mr Rice, too, was a director at Global Solar Energy. Both men were also directors of Simplee Solar East, which last filed accounts in December 2004. Simplee Solar East was the east of England sales company for Bournemouth company Simplee Solar which was fined £40,000 and ordered to pay £27,000 in costs at Bournemouth County Court last October for making false claims of how much customers could save if they bought its solar heating panel systems - it promised up to 70% from energy bills which it could not justify. The court heard a local pensioner had paid £8,500 for panels, an installation worth around half that. After the trial, Ivan Hancock of Dorset Trading Standards said: \"Hopefully this will be a lesson to this company and others. It is very important the public can rely on claims about goods.\" Simplee Solar was also reprimanded by the Advertising Standards Authority for saying customers could \"qualify for a significant subsidy\" under an EnergyWatch scheme. The ASA said the company was \"unable to demonstrate the promised subsidy was genuine\". But the story of Ms Baker's mother has a happy ending. When Guardian Money contacted SolarSol UK, David Mead said a full £1,650 refund cheque had just been posted. He said: \"We have done the honourable thing ... we are a completely ethical, 100% reputable company and within the law. But it has taken a long time to send her the money as our cash flow is a bit tight. We terminated our relationship with Simplee Solar but we honoured our commitment to customers even though we could have walked away. \"Our consultants are instructed to walk away from selling to vulnerable people. We are going out of our way to do things correctly - there are a number of companies with a bad reputation out there.\" Council does the low-cost job I have just had solar water heating panels installed - and paid just £500 for the work, writes Tony Levene. That's around 12% of the £4,000 it would have cost me otherwise. But I was one of very few to qualify for the low-cost job which should provide much of my summer hot water and some in the winter. The huge reduction came courtesy of my local council - Harrow in north-west London - which last year set up the Heating Harrow Greener Scheme to promote solar energy. The advert did not say how many homes could apply. \"We were inundated with inquiries,\" says Gemma Moore, Harrow's affordable warmth and home energy conservation officer. \"We knew there would only be cash for 50 homes in the first wave, so after the first 425 inquiries, we closed the list. They are on a waiting list in number order - we would expect to fit a further 50 homes next April and more in 2009,\" she adds. The money comes from the council's own coffers - around £200,000 a year. There is no guarantee that other councils will offer anything. In London, some do nothing and some have schemes. And at the present 50-a-year rate, it will take about 1,600 years to fit out all of Harrow's near 80,000 suitable homes with panels. The council contracted Scottish &amp; Southern's energy efficiency unit to oversee the work. It subcontracted the installation to Darsetway, a Woolwich-based company, whose surveyor assessed the suitability of my south-facing roof last year. The installation, earlier this month, went smoothly. It took two days to fit the two panels and replace my old water tank and another half day to ensure the electricals worked, followed by a final inspection. The house only lacked hot water for a few hours. Now my panels are on the roof, how much will I save? It's hard to tell yet but it could be as much as £100 a year, as well as giving me a solar glow that turns the neighbours green with envy. · The following clarification was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Saturday September 15 2007.

Green collars have joined the employment wardrobe of blue collars, white collars and pink collars (so-called \"female\" jobs, such as care assistants or florists, and not white collars that were put in the wash with a rogue sock) and refer to manual-labour jobs in the new ecological economy, from mending bicycles to cladding buildings in solar panels.

They waved and clapped and shook the hand of a white-haired man who used to hold the most powerful office on the planet and who has just failed to help his wife secure it in her turn. Yet the people of Rema had no idea who William Jefferson Clinton was or what he was doing in their village. One man knew the name, though his wife looked blank. \"Clinton,\" said Awke Tiruneh, whose hut the president had been due to visit but didn't, because of the tight schedule powerful men run to. \"He is from Germany.\" It is the only foreign country Tiruneh has heard of, because a German NGO is based on Rema's doorstep, but he has not a clue where either Germany or America are. The outside world is the village on top of the next hill, a long, rocky walk down one mountain and up another. Yet Clinton came to put Rema on the map, hailing it as a model for the developing world and a place that could teach the US a thing or two. Rema, in the northern highlands, is now the first solar-powered village in Ethiopia - a cluster of 1,100 homes that shine in the dark evenings like white beads on a string. Every home has electric light from an energy-efficient LED bulb hanging from the straw ceiling. Children can do schoolwork after 6pm while women weave the gabi - a white cotton head-to-toe wrap that is worn in church and in the evenings to keep out the cold (now Clinton has one too). Night classes have started in the school for adults who want to learn to read, there is a solar-powered fridge at the health centre that cannot run out of fuel, and women no longer have to walk a mile to the well, thanks to a solar-powered pump. High-quality equipment has been installed that will last for 25 or 30 years. Villagers pay around 80p a month to cover the cost of maintenance and new batteries. Rema has become a model for the future energy needs of developing countries, Clinton believes. Solar power could be a revolution for Africa. \"It's the energy equivalent of the cellphone movement,\" he says. Bill is not the only Clinton whose imagination has been caught by this project. His 28-year-old daughter Chelsea is there too, as are Clinton's brother Roger and 14-year-old nephew Tyler. Chelsea took indefinite unpaid leave from her management consultancy job to help her mother's unsuccessful bid for the Democratic nomination. \"She wasn't back at a new task yet so she wanted to come with me, and I love it,\" her father tells me later in the presidential suite at the Addis Ababa Sheraton, whose marbled elegance and air conditioning would make a Rema villager's eyes pop. \"We like to travel together.\" The shade of Hillary's momentous campaign travels with them. Clinton speaks of it with a sort of warm afterglow, in spite of the panning he personally received. \"I'm immensely proud of Hillary,\" he says. \"Her performance in March, April and May, to June 3, was literally miraculous. If you'd told me, given the facts that existed on March 1, that she'd come back, win more popular votes, do as well as she did, I would never have believed it ... I thought she learned, she grew and I think by the end she was running like a house on fire. \"I'm very grateful actually, personally, that I had a chance to get out and see so much of America, because her only option after she lost all those caucuses in February and knew she was going to be outspent was to raise this incredible grassroots campaign. And Chelsea made 450 appearances for her mother. In the last three months alone I went to 350 different communities. I got to see parts of America I never saw when I was running or serving, and it was one of the most rewarding experiences of my life.\" Now, however, he is on a whistle-stop tour of his charitable foundation's projects in Africa: today Ethiopia, tomorrow Rwanda, the next day in and out of Liberia and on to Senegal. Much of it is to do with health - Clinton's influence, his ability to flatter, charm and persuade, has had great success in negotiating down drug prices for Aids and malaria for the developing world. He is pushing to increase dramatically the numbers of women with HIV given drugs in pregnancy to stop their babies becoming infected. But here in the northern highlands of Ethiopia, we are looking at ways to mitigate the effects of climate change. \"My whole theory about climate change is that the biggest problem in aggregate is the fact that India and China are about to pass the US in emissions and no country is going to agree to remain poor in order to avert climate change. We have to be able to show that there are economically viable options. \"I think it is really important that the vast mass of countries that are developing find ways to skip the carbon stage of economic development - ways that accelerate rather than undermine their wellbeing.\" Shouldn't the US take steps to reduce its own emissions before it starts visiting its ideas on Africa? \"I think that the United States does need to pass climate change legislation, we need to put a price on carbon, we need to set up a capping trade system and one that can't be cheated on: I agree with all that. But when people say that most loudly, they are usually looking for an excuse to do nothing, and if we burn up the planet then no one will give you laurels for having come up with the best available excuse to do nothing. Your grandchildren won't be proud of you. And we may have an irreversible situation,\" he says. \"Secondly, because all these developing countries have to be worried about the problems at hand, feeding the people that are there, educating them, providing basic healthcare, having some near-term economic strategy, I think that people like me who care about this stuff have to find economically attractive options for them.\" Environmentally friendly energy policies can go hand in hand with economic growth, he says. It's happened in the UK and Denmark, he says, two of only six countries - excluding \"some former communist countries that, prior to 1990, were running very, very dirty carbon-based inefficient industrial economies\" - that have been on course to meet their Kyoto target. \"The biggest problem with Kyoto was the United States bugged out on it, so it gave everybody an excuse to take a bath,\" he says. \"I'm not a government and I don't have access to vast amounts of money, and I'm frustrated that even when the Democrats are in, we still haven't given a tax credit, for example, for wind energy that goes more than three years. Nonetheless, somebody needs to go out there and help people figure out how to do this stuff. That's what I do. \"I just try to figure it out and I try to get other smart people around who figure out how to do this, because I was so struck by all these countries that won't meet their Kyoto targets. Most of them were not led by people who were dishonest when they signed Kyoto. They aren't lazy, they aren't stupid and they aren't corrupt. They're well-meaning, hard-working people who are, like all political leaders, facing all kinds of competing pressures in an economy that is not organised for tomorrow's energy - it's organised for yesterday's. \"One reason I went to that little village today is that that little village is now organised for tomorrow. I'll go home now and I'll be able to tell people that I went to the highlands of Ethiopia and saw a classroom with two LED lights - nobody will believe that - and that it works economically for them.\" The man who brought light to Rema was neither a former president nor a technology geek. Harald Schützeichel studied music and theology, he tells me. He started the Solar Energy Foundation because he wanted to help development. If there are environmental benefits, so much the better. He was completely astonished when he got an email saying Clinton wanted to visit. He is still not quite sure why, but he knows that the boss of Good Energies, the company that has donated 80% of his funding, is a friend of the former president. What Schützeichel does not realise is that Marcel Brenninkmeijer, founder and CEO of Good Energies, who also jumps out of the Clinton helicopter, is shelling out cash - it took £240,000 to equip Rema - because he is part of the Clinton Global Initiative (CGI). It is a kind of networking with good deeds attached. Clinton brings together wealthy businessmen and government leaders for an annual jamboree and they promise action on global problems, not just talk. If they fail to carry out their promises, they don't get invited again. Schützeichel, though, is innocent of the politics of global philanthropy. Clinton invites him to give a presentation to the next meeting in September. Afterwards, Schützeichel confesses he has no idea what the CGI is. He wants help to expand his solar-powered villages across Ethiopia by setting up a microfinance bank that will allow villagers to borrow money for solar power installation and pay it off at a rate they can afford. \"I need €10m [£7.8m],\" he says, barely appreciating that he has just been handed his best-ever opportunity of getting it. Rema had its installation for free, to show what could be done. Down the hill from the village, Schützeichel has built an International Solar Energy School, which has trained 24 technicians from all over Ethiopia. The plan is for them to return to their regions and set up their own businesses, equipping more villages, which will borrow the necessary funds from Schützeichel's microfinance bank. We're thousands of miles away from the US, but not from its politics. Some of the foundation staff worked for Hillary's nomination and they talk of it as something momentous, with a sort of awe-struck sadness that they were part of it and she lost. \"I just want very much the country to change course,\" says Clinton. \"I want us to be on a different economic course, a different social policy course, a different course in the world. And we're going to do what we can to be helpful.\" What about criticisms of his role in Hillary's campaign? \"It's all part of the deal,\" he says, laughing. \"Look, what we were doing was working, so you had to assume there was going to be some blow-back. It's a contact sport, politics ... I would never have gotten back into politics if it hadn't been for Hillary, but I felt so strongly that she should be elected and she needed all of us - she needed Chelsea and she needed me. Our bodies made up for the financial disparity a little bit. And so we threw ourselves into the fray and did our best and you just get up and go on. \"And I'm immensely proud of her, but I think she's the political leader of our family now - I'm not in politics. And I'm going to do exactly what she says we should do and agree with her decision. I think she's been big and positive and that's what we should all be.\" And so he and Chelsea are in Africa to change the world in other ways. Rema's name will be spoken of in high circles, as a byword for environmentally friendly development. More visitors may descend from the skies. A solar-powered cinema is mooted, where films on development will be shown, so that Rema's people will understand what they can aspire to. Awke Tiruneh and his wife Emaye Beyene are not the only couple who are faintly bemused. They are pleased with their two lightbulbs, one in the main room and a second in the kitchen annexe of their pristine mud hut, and with the radio that everybody in Rema tunes to get music, not news. But they say they don't want anything else. \"When they have more money, they don't know what to do with it in Rema,\" says Samson Tsegaye, country director of the Solar Power Foundation. \"They are happy. They don't need a Mercedes or a television. When they have money, the men are always going to the bar. The solar cinema is to show them what money can do - how opportunity can come to their lives. They have three meals a day but they don't know what is going on in the world.\" Are Bill and Hillary Clinton, who have been at the centre of what is going on in the world, happier than the villagers of Rema? It's an interesting question."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2008/feb/26/renewedenergy","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2008-02-26T09:00:00Z","webTitle":"Renewed energy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/feb/26/renewedenergy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2008/feb/26/renewedenergy","fields":{"headline":"Renewed energy","bodyText":"One of the loudest arguments of those who profess that traditional energy is needed even if renewables markets grow large is that modern nations cannot be powered properly without it. In particular, they say, renewables cannot meet baseload demand. Late last year, a German economics ministry experiment showed that distributed power can indeed produce reliable baseload in a secure and reliable manner. Thirty-six decentralised renewable plants - a mix of biogas, wind, solar (photovoltaics, or PV) and hydropower - were linked by three companies and a university in a nationwide network controlled by a central computer. Schmack Biogas AG, Enercon GmbH, SolarWorld AG and the Institute for Solar Energy Supply Systems (ISET) at the University of Kassel conceived and ran the experiment with 13 other partners, aiming to show in miniature via a \"combined power plant\" what could be done, if the will can be summoned on a national scale, to replace both fossil fuels and nuclear power. The experimental network, capable of producing about 50 megawatt hours of electricity a year - 61% from wind (12.6MW of peak power), 25% from biogas (4MW peak), and 14% for PV (5.5MW peak) - was scaled to meet 1/10,000th of the electricity demand in Germany. It was equivalent to a small town with around 12,000 households. The system met both continuous baseload and peakloads round the clock and regardless of weather conditions. During the day of the press conference to announce the results, there was no wind at all in Germany and the country was covered by cloud. Such intermittency of solar and wind, of course, means that bioenergy has to play an important role. Four biogas plants were used along with three wind parks and 20 PV installations. The current cost of generating electricity from the combined power plant is currently 13 eurocents per kWh, twice as expensive as conventional electricity. But then the price of conventional polluting electricity is rising fast in Germany, as everywhere else. If peak oil hits us in a few years, and if rising concern about climate change forces governments to avoid a dash for coal-to-liquids and coal use without carbon capture, the question then becomes how quickly renewables can rise from their current low level of global electricity production - alongside maximal energy efficiency - to meet the challenge. There, sadly, the news is not good. We have been held back for too long after all the years of the great addiction. We can grow far faster than nuclear, but there would still be a sizeable gap, otherwise known as the third energy crisis."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2008/feb/24/greenbusiness.renewableenergy","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2008-02-24T00:02:30Z","webTitle":"Folding green: the investment boom","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/feb/24/greenbusiness.renewableenergy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2008/feb/24/greenbusiness.renewableenergy","fields":{"headline":"Folding green: the investment boom","bodyText":"Money is pouring into the clean energy sector, which includes renewable forms of electricity generation such as wind, biomass and solar as well as companies involved in energy efficiency and waste treatment. According to research firm New Energy Finance, investment in the sector increased globally by 41 per cent last year to $117bn (£59bn), just over half of which went on new projects. Fund managers say the green investment boom began about 18 months ago. Al Gore's eco-documentary film An Inconvenient Truth and increasing scientific evidence of man-made global warming convinced investors that anything that could combat climate change would make a lot of money. Such was the clamour that people started talking about a green investment bubble. HSBC's climate change benchmark index, which tracks the stock market performance of about 300 companies in the clean technology sector, doubled in two years, peaking in November and easily outperforming the general market. Of the new projects invested in last year, about half - $24.8bn - was spent on wind farms, according to New Energy Finance. Much of the remaining $29.7bn went on biofuel projects ($14.5bn), biomass and waste treatment ($7.1bn) and solar ($5.9bn). Investment in solar companies was almost double that spent in 2006. But despite the oil price touching $100 a barrel recently and greater political will to tackle climate change, the clean energy sector has suffered particularly badly from the credit crunch. It is almost down by a fifth since its November peak, according to the HSBC index, as investors seek to put their money into safer places rather than riskier companies pioneering new or unproven technologies. Farley Thomas, global head of wholesale investments at HSBC, says: 'There has been a lot of hot money flowing into the energy production part of the clean technology sector. It's fair to say that this year there has been a bit of a slowdown after a strong run.' The solar industry has fared worst, with shares of companies down by about 40 per cent this year. Bruce Jenkyn-Jones, director of investment at environmental fund manager Impax, says: 'In the second half of last year, a mini solar bubble developed. Clearly people holding solar energy stocks this year would have got their fingers burnt. You can't just blindly invest in renewable-orientated companies.' But fund managers are quick to stress that they think the sector will recover. Michael Liebreich, chief executive of New Energy Finance, says: 'Particularly with the new US president likely to sign up to the climate change agenda, the underlying fundamentals look more positive than ever.'"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2007/dec/17/schools.uk1","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2007-12-17T15:16:59Z","webTitle":"All new schools to be zero-carbon by 2016","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2007/dec/17/schools.uk1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2007/dec/17/schools.uk1","fields":{"headline":"All new schools to be zero-carbon by 2016","bodyText":"Schools will install wind turbines and solar power systems in a multi-million pound drive to reduce carbon emissions, Ed Balls detailed today.

A typical secondary school will receive about £500,000 under the scheme to reduce carbon emissions in new school buildings. Projects will focus on making buildings more energy efficient and using renewable energy sources. Efficiency measures could include using low-power computers, energy-saving lighting and better insulation. Renewable energy sources could include biomass-fuelled boilers - usually using wood - and large wind turbines. Solar energy could be harnessed to heat water and provide electricity. One school already monitoring its carbon footprint is Kingsmead primary in Northwich, Cheshire, the project being used as a learning tool for pupils to understand more about the environment. The school has active voltage displays for the solar panels and an electronic meter that shows how much rainwater is collected by its inverted roof.

Deep in the verdant, rain-soaked mountains, just a few kilometres from the Spanish border, above the village of Sainte-Engrâce, Suez, the Franco-Belgian group, has just opened a hydropower plant that was first planned in the 1950s and abandoned by EDF in 1960. At a depth of 700m from the tip of the Massif de la Pierre-Saint-Martin, Shem, its hydropower unit in the south-west of France, has built this small plant and dam inside a huge cave that takes your breath away. It has a diameter of 250m and a height of 190m - six times the size of Notre-Dame de Paris. To reach La Verna you drive up a specially built path winding its way up the side of the mountain until you see a green door in its flank and then walk 660m through a narrow, twisting passage until you hear the roar of cascading water. The plant captures water from the subterranean Saint Vincent river at a rate of 860 litres a second. It took two years to complete, much of the work done manually by men hanging from ropes, and involved the painful construction of a passerelle to carry the pipes that transport the water 4km down the mountain to the turbine hall near the village. What is equally striking about this project is that the result of all this extraordinary effort is relatively puny. Suez, operating through its Belgian subsidiary Electrabel which owns Shem, has invested €6.2m (£4.9m) in it. The plant produces electricity for as few as 10-20,000 consumers - just 4MW or around 1,000 times less than the infamous Three Gorges dam in China. Shem itself has an annual capacity of 778MW at its 50 plants. But this could herald at least one element of Europe's green energy future: the use of small plants producing power from renewable sources. Already, there are 17,800 small hydroelectric schemes in the EU-27 producing 12.3GW of power. And La Verna should be profitable, experts say. For one thing, its output will fetch higher prices because it will help meet demand when it is at its peak. For another, Electrabel, which has 10 small hydroelectric schemes of its own in Belgium, will earn more money through renewable energy certificates in its home country. Energy groups may not be \"peak oil\" converts but they are investing in alternatives because they see them as profitable in the medium- to long-term. Xavier Votron, head of Suez's renewables business, says the group plans to expand its hydroelectric operations around the world and almost 40% of its overall capacity is already CO2-free, including 21% from renewables. The bulk of its renewable energy comes from hydropower. But the group plans an expanded presence in wind power, particularly offshore, and in solar energy. It has small biomass plants producing power from wood pellets, sewage sludge, olive residues and even coffee dregs. It is also exploring the prospects for wave energy. Votron says that, when the €92bn merger with Gaz de France (GDF) is complete - the two groups' shareholders vote to approve it on July 16 - the combined entity plans to invest some €1bn a year in renewables. But he concedes that, like Britain, France and Belgium will struggle to reach their share of the EU's overall 2020 target - 23% and 13% respectively compared with the UK's 15%. With biofuels increasingly challenged because of their impact on land use and food prices and the EU reviewing its own targets, Votron says Suez has rejected the use of palm oil. It is exploring 25 different biomass products but, he admits, many, if not all, of these raise problems of pollution and consistency. The technology so far is immature and biomass necessarily implies huge logistics, he says. Suez, he says, believes that subsidies remain inevitable but national support schemes should be harmonised at EU level - a tall order given the opposition by some countries to, say, Germany's \"feed-in\" tariffs which award higher prices for renewable energy and which have made the country the world's biggest solar power producer. The Franco-Belgian group feels left behind. Is Europe as a whole being left behind? The Worldwatch Institute this week said renewables were reaching a \"tipping point\" globally, with $100bn (£50bn) invested last year when installed capacity was 50% higher than in 2004. They account for 3.4% of the world's power production but more than nuclear if large hydro plants are taken into account. And, it said, China had the most comprehensive targets of any country. The EU still has ambitions to lead the world in developing renewable energy and combating climate change. But it will take an application on the grand scale of the effort that went into making La Verna work if it is to reach that goal."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2008/may/01/exxonmobil.oil","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2008-05-01T07:49:37Z","webTitle":"Myopic ExxonMobil is ignoring the planet's future, say Rockefellers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/may/01/exxonmobil.oil","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2008/may/01/exxonmobil.oil","fields":{"headline":"Myopic ExxonMobil is ignoring the planet's future, say Rockefellers","bodyText":"Descendants of legendary oil tycoon John D Rockefeller have accused ExxonMobil of adopting a myopic approach towards alternative sources of energy and of refusing to engage in any meaningful discussion about the future of the planet. At a feisty press conference in the penthouse suite of a luxury Manhattan hotel, members of the billionaire Rockefeller family complained that the world's biggest oil company has repeatedly declined to listen to concerns about the direction of the business which has its roots in their ancestor's 19th-century Standard Oil empire. \"There are an awful lot of people who are getting increasingly annoyed with Exxon,\" said economist Neva Rockefeller Goodwin, a great-granddaughter of the company's founder. \"Their [Exxon's] attitude is 'these pesky shareholders, they act as if they own the company'.\" In an unusually public step for the usually reticent philanthropic dynasty, the Rockefellers have set out four shareholder resolutions calling for an independent chairman; a taskforce to study global warming; a reduction in Exxon's greenhouse gas emissions; and a renewable energy policy. They cite support from 66 of John D Rockefeller's 78 direct descendants aged 21 or over. A significant number of institutional investors support their call for Exxon's chief executive Rex Tillerson to hand the role of chairman to an outsider - a similar motion for such a change won 40% of investors' votes at last year's annual meeting. Rockefeller Goodwin said her family \"almost defines the long-term investor\" as the oldest continuous shareholder in Exxon. She spoke of \"serious disjunctures\" between Exxon's short-term actions and \"the long-term health both of this company and of the world's economy\". Her cousin Peter O'Neill added: \"If the next 20 years of the energy business were going to be just about oil and gas, we wouldn't be holding this press conference.\" While other oil companies such as BP, Shell and Chevron have sought to paint themselves as green, ExxonMobil has adopted a hardline position. The Texas-based firm has $25bn (£12.6bn) of capital investment planned in exploration and research of carbon-based fuels. Its main environmental commitment is a relatively modest $100m to fund a Stanford University centre researching technical solutions to global warming. \"We think a few of those billions should go towards looking to the future and to the kind of energy this world might need,\" said Rockefeller Goodwin. She added that family members had been denied access to Exxon's non-executive board members and that letters to independent directors had yielded stock responses drafted by company executives. Exxon's top management, she said, consisted of veteran employees steeped in the firm's culture. \"Exxon has a very strong corporate culture - strong in good ways and not so good ways,\" said Rockefeller Goodwin. \"It includes an inability to listen to outsiders and an assumption that they know all the answers.\" Until recently, Exxon gave large donations to scientific institutes which disputed climate change. The company is reluctant to pump funds into environmental power forms such as wind and solar energy, arguing that such projects will not be viable until a step change in technology happens. \"We are focusing our support on research, both internally and externally, to achieve the large technological step changes that are needed,\" said an Exxon spokesman. He denied any reluctance to enter into talks: \"We have met members of the Rockefeller family on many occasions over a number of years.\" The shareholder proposals are not binding and Exxon merely says that any successful resolutions will be \"considered\" by its board. In spite of criticism over its strategy, Exxon's shares have surged by 20% in the last year and the firm commands a market value of $497bn. The Rockefellers declined to put a figure on the number of shares they hold. But according to company figures, the 12 family members formally proposing resolutions have 332,174 shares, worth $31m but amounting to only 0.006% of the company. Powerful Californian state pension fund Calpers has lent its support to the family, as has Connecticut's state pension fund which holds $300m in Exxon shares. Connecticut's state treasurer, Denise Nappier, said: \"We're trying to keep a giant, and it truly is a giant in the oil and gas industry, from falling.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2008/aug/13/conservation.activists","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2008-08-12T23:01:00Z","webTitle":"Community action revives Welsh mountain farm","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/13/conservation.activists","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2008/aug/13/conservation.activists","fields":{"headline":"Community action revives Welsh mountain farm","bodyText":"The lane to Moelyci farm in Gwynedd is fringed with harebells, and a green woodpecker flits from tree to fencepost in the morning sunshine. Behind a cluster of weathered farm buildings are fields full of endangered birds and rare fungi, where clouds of butterflies feed on \"weeds\"- such as Field Woundwort - that are on the Red Data list of threatened species. This is no ordinary Welsh mountain farm - and yet, until five years ago, that is exactly what it was. In 2003, intensively grazed and in the aftermath of the foot and mouth outbreak, its 320 acres were unable to support the farming tenant. But when the estate owner decided the farm should be sold - possibly for holiday accommodation - the local community had different ideas. Residents from Tregarth, Rhiwlas and Mynydd Llandegai, the three villages that surround Moelyci, in the shadow of Snowdon, dug deep and bought it. Around 200 people invested in the farm, forming a not-for-profit industrial and provident society (IPS), with the help of loans from Triodos Bank and ICOF, a community development finance institution that invests in areas of deprivation. It was the first venture of its kind in Wales and one of just a handful in the UK. Five years on, Moelyci IPS supports around 16 jobs and has 500 community shareholders. The original loans have been replaced by a mortgage, and when that is paid off, in 18 years' time, the farm and its mountain - much of which is now designated a site of special scientific interest and a special area of conservation - will really be theirs. \"Stubborn persistence, unfettered optimism, patience and trust\" account for the environmental, economic and community regeneration that has gone on here, according to one of Moelyci's directors, John Fazey, who lectures part-time in adaptive learning at Oxford University. A steady nerve is also crucial. On the day of my visit, Fazey was working hard to plug a temporary but critical £20,000 deficit in their finances, caused by the delayed payment of a government grant. \"This is the third time it's happened, and always at the end of the month when we have the mortgage and wages to pay, but, luckily, one of our supporters has stepped in with a personal interest-free loan,\" sighs Fazey, who put up his own property - a neighbouring farm - as security at the outset. Despite the fragile financing, he says they are fulfilling their initial aims of creating sustainable jobs and recreation opportunities for local people and the less advantaged, while protecting the environment. A compost processing plant, which recently won a £12,000 contract from Gwynedd county council to process green waste, and a timber recycling venture were part of the original plan, while a market garden has grown from an earlier project to sell saplings. An imaginative programme of wildlife, gardening and outdoor skills courses also bring in cash. Six core members of staff are on Moelyci's payroll, largely supported by grants and charitable funding. The Intermediate Labour Market (ILM) programme for long-term unemployed people supplies a large part of the workforce. The recent appointment of development manager Paul Christie, through a grant from the Tudor Trust, has been vital, Fazey says. Christie has already secured £100,000 from the Aggregates Levy Fund for the sensitive conversion of a barn into a training and meeting room. Responsible for the farm's burgeoning biodiversity is John Harold, an ecologist. Now on the staff, he worked as a volunteer to steer the transition from ranch-like farmland to a place brimming with wildlife that had been hanging on in the margins. \"I don't think we'd be here today if it wasn't for the funding of the biodiversity work,\" he says. \"When we realised the value of what we had, we tapped into things such as Natur Gwynedd, a biodiversity fund that was a huge support to us.\" Harold advises others embarking on similar projects to take stock of what is there and to rein in any ambition to \"make a mark\" on the land. However, some human intervention has been beneficial. \"When we started growing veg, those fields attracted huge flocks of birds such as linnets and yellowhammers in the winter,\" Harold says. \"Because we weren't farming too tidily, there were lots of weed seeds and insects for them.\" Important site Another field has now been turned over for intercropping of soft fruits and wildflowers - \"one crop for us, the other for the wildlife,\" Harold says. And a field of rare fungi, discovered by a volunteer, makes Moelyci one of the most important wax cap sites in Europe. Grants from Tir Gofal, the Welsh countryside stewardship programme, have paid for stockproofing of environmentally sensitive areas. Grazing by Welsh Black cattle and horses help with land management, and provide income and manure for Moelyci's 50 allotments used by local people. There are still sheep, and a shepherd grazes a small flock at favourable rates that allowed him to follow his father into farming. \"None of us individually could have done this,\" Harold says. \"I've never worked in an IPS or such a complex co-operative environment, or been a farmer or had a piece of land bigger than my garden to be responsible for. For all of us, it's been life changing.\" Paul Ellis agrees. He came to Moelyci on the ILM scheme after a year out of work. \"Then, when the market garden manager left, I got the job,\" he smiles. \"I'm paid two days a week, and [work as a] volunteer for the rest of the time. I love it.\" As the market garden grows, so will Ellis's paid hours. Like so much at Moelyci, it's a matter of keeping faith.

The House of Lords Economic Affairs committee have been wondering the same thing, you see, and so they've called in all sorts of experts to explain the economics of renewable energy to them. They've had professors from Oxbridge and Loughborough, they've had people from Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth, the British Wind Energy Association, and Noel Edmond's gang the Renewable Energy Foundation. They've had high-up folk from E.ON and Scottish and Southern Energy, and a couple of weeks ago they called in the Energy Minister Malcolm Wicks. And this is no backwater House of Lords committee: it includes no less than two ex-chancellors of the exchequer, Norman Lamont and Nigel Lawson (not a friend of the renewable industry - some of his interjections alone make the whole thing worthwhile). However, just in case you don't happen to have a day or so to spare to read the thousands of words of uncorrected oral evidence currently available on the website, here are a few of the cherries ready picked for you. Warning: for those of us who always blindly hoped that renewables would be the answer to everything, there are a few surprises in store. Shock number one: If the government hits its target of generating 30%-35% of the UK's electricity from renewable sources by 2020, the reduction in carbon dioxide emissions per year will be, they estimate, 20m tonnes. The UK's annual emissions are well over 500m tonnes, so that is less than one twenty-fifth. And that will cost something like £100bn. These are government estimates, obviously: other sources may reach other conclusions. Shock number two: One of the reasons that renewables may make smaller carbon savings than you would expect is because of the problem of intermittency. Basically you need to have power plants on standby in case the wind suddenly stops and people still want to have their lights on. You can't really have nuclear on standby, so these have to be fossil fuel plants. Moreover the owners of those fossil fuel plants may not be overjoyed to only be functioning as back up - they'll obviously make less money if they're only outputting seven hours a day instead of 24. So the government may also need to come up with some sort of financial compensation plan for fossil fuel plants. There is much talk about the hidden costs of nuclear, but let's not forget that there are also hidden costs to renewables. Shock number three: In order to have that much renewable energy in the system, we will need to considerably extend the grid. Think of it this way. The amount of energy that the grid can absolutely count on to receive from your plant is called your capacity credit, and because wind farms are pretty up and down they usually don't have a very high capacity credit. In fact, according to one of the witnesses appearing before the committee, in Denmark, one of the countries with the highest wind penetration in the world, \"the Danish head of their equivalent of our National Grid has said quite clearly that from a planning perspective, for example, wind there achieves a capacity credit of zero for planning purposes.\" I think that means that despite all their wind power, Denmark can never assume that any of it will be available. So the grid will have to be able to handle all the capacity for renewables and the capacity necessary to back it up. Simon Virley from DBERR tells the committee that: \"We have published some scenarios in our consultation document, and one of the scenarios that we have illustrated in here, which is a scenario with 32% of electricity coming from renewable energy, the sort of additional plant you need on the system is about 30 gigawatts of additional renewable capacity coming on by 2020 relative to 2008, and about 17 of additional conventional plant. That is just one of the scenarios that we have illustrated in the consultation document.\" Shock number four: according to Bob Taylor, the head of E.ON, the 20 or so wind farms in their portfolio mostly operate at about 8%-10% capacity. Shock number five: according to Malcolm Wicks and his colleagues from DBERR, they will expect to allow a capacity credit for renewables of around 10%-20%. To which Nigel Lawson bitingly replies: \"That is an unusually optimistic estimate.\" Shock number six: this will all start to hit our pockets by 2020, according to Wicks. \"While it is unlikely to impact energy bills before 2010, in 2020 both gas and electricity bills will be higher due to the cost of renewable energy, and it is important to recognise that.\" But you'd worked that out already. Shock number seven (this is just a little one and not really related to renewables - I just found it interesting): Malcolm Wicks states that: \"I should say to this committee that I worry greatly about climate change and global warming, although I think, with one or two exceptions, we are winning the argument on that one - with one or two important exceptions I think we are winning the argument on that one - but I worry more about energy security and national security.\" Not a shock, but illuminating. In fact the whole inquiry is illuminating: the committee has adjourned for the summer now, but I, for one, can't wait till autumn to find out what happens next. What does it all mean? It means that renewable energy is going to be very very expensive, but so is coal and gas (there's a lot of stuff in here about the way that carbon capture and carbon pricing is going to raise prices: no one seems to agree however). It means, I think, that wind turbines and tidal stream and wave and solar energy are not the pure, simple, beautiful things one may like to imagine. They bring their own complications and messes to the table, just like nuclear and coal and gas and oil. It means that finally, we are going to have to get very very real about energy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2008/mar/29/renewableenergy.climatechange","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2008-03-29T00:37:21Z","webTitle":"Britain seeks loophole in EU green energy targets","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/mar/29/renewableenergy.climatechange","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2008/mar/29/renewableenergy.climatechange","fields":{"headline":"Britain seeks loophole in EU green energy targets","bodyText":"Britain is seeking to change the rules governing renewable energy targets to make it easier for the UK to fulfil its commitment to promote clean energy, the Guardian has learned. At present, only 3% of the UK's power comes from renewable energy, but ministers have agreed to increase this fivefold within 12 years. To help reach this goal, the government has started lobbying the EU over the way the target is calculated. At a closed session of the energy council of ministers this month, the business minister, Lady Vadera, proposed that British investments in renewable energy anywhere in the world should count as part of UK's effort. In a speech that astonished European renewable energy companies, environment groups and other EU energy ministers, she said: \"It is imperative that cost-efficiency is at the heart of our approach ... Demand for renewable energy projects outside the EU should be considered [part of the renewable target].\" She also appealed to Europe to allow all EU countries to count carbon \"saved\" from coal-fired stations fitted with equipment that captures harmful greenhouse gas emissions. The electricity generated by this \"clean coal\" would then count as renewable energy and go towards UK national targets. \"Member states might be further incentivised to support carbon capture projects if they were allowed in some way to contribute to the 2020 [renewable] targets,\" she said. Environmental groups regard both proposals as a way for Britain to put off or scale back on increasing renewable energy through windfarms, hydroelectric and solar energy initiatives. Last year the Department of Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (Dberr) attempted to dilute EU renewable targets. Gordon Brown ordered a rethink on how Britain addressed renewables when leaked papers from Dberr were published in the Guardian. Last night renewable energy companies and environment groups reacted with alarm. \"This would kill renewable energy in Britain,\" said Dale Vince, chief executive of Ecotricity, Britain's biggest windfarm company. \"It makes a mockery of any attempts to address climate change. The idea that we can build wind farms or other renewable energy projects [abroad] and then offset them against the UK target is outrageous. If it were possible to build projects anywhere in the world where planning is lax, nothing would be done in the UK.\" John Sauven, director of Greenpeace, added: \"This would allow a UK minister to lay the foundation stone of a power station in China and say it counts as our contribution to European renewable energy targets.\" \"Yet again Britain is found trying to evade its environmental responsibilities,\" said a spokesman for the environment group WWF. The proposals to the EU have heightened concern among the groups that the UK is on a course for a massive nuclear power programme. The energy secretary, John Hutton, argued this week that Britain should not just replace existing nuclear plants but greatly expand the nuclear and coal industries. This week's state visit by President Sarkozy confirmed that the powerful French nuclear industry will be encouraged to develop at least four but possibly more nuclear power stations in Britain. Industry recognises that nuclear power and renewables in Britain are mutually exclusive because they both need government support as well as the same national grid infrastructure to distribute electricity. Last week Carlo de Riva, chief executive of French state-owned nuclear company EDF, said British backing for renewables, would undermine nuclear power. \"If you provide incentives for renewables ... that will displace the incentives built into the carbon market. In effect, carbon gets cheaper. And if carbon gets cheaper, you depress the returns for all the other low-carbon technologies. [like nuclear power].\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/blog/2007/nov/03/aweekintechsolarpowerleo","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2007-11-03T15:43:16Z","webTitle":"A week in Tech: Solar power, Leopard and paying for games","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2007/nov/03/aweekintechsolarpowerleo","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/blog/2007/nov/03/aweekintechsolarpowerleo","fields":{"headline":"A week in Tech: Solar power, Leopard and paying for games","bodyText":"Each week we're trying to give you a taste of what other people are reading on Guardian's technology pages.

But things could so easily have turned out differently. While people may have been burning oil and using it as a lubricant for thousands of years, it was not until the motor industry took off about 80 years ago that oil started to become such a key player. Henry Ford's Model T, the first production-line car, was actually designed to run off alcohol-based ethanol, as well as oil-derived petrol. But thanks to the prohibition of alcohol in the US, petrol fuels prevailed. In its raw form, oil consists of a black, viscous fluid made up of high concentrations of organic compounds originally derived from dead animal and vegetable matter, such as plankton, which have endured extreme geological processes over millions of years. When refined into hydrocarbon fuels, chains of carbon and hydrogen molecules, it becomes a useful fuel because it has such a high energy density, typically 10 times that of dynamite. Part of our dependence on oil is due to the fact that a vast range of chemicals and materials are derived from it, including plastics, detergents, solvents and adhesives. However, many of these products could be manufactured synthetically. Where our real addiction to oil lies is in its use as a liquid fuel. There are plenty of other cleaner and more sustainable energy sources that could be used to power and heat our homes. But when it comes to transport, alternatives start to get tricky. This does not just come down to the high energy density of oil-derived fuels - after all, hydrogen fuel has an energy density roughly three times that of petrol. The problem is that we already have a multibillion-dollar infrastructure designed to produce, distribute and burn petrol. Where does oil come from? Despite the popular conception that oil exists in vast underground caverns, or wells, oil is in fact formed in porous, sponge-like rock formations. Before a well is tapped, the oil exists under immense pressure, meaning that when it is first drilled it forces itself out - essentially self-extracting. However, when the pressure eventually dips, the porous nature of the rock starts to play havoc with the extraction process, making a large proportion of the oil difficult to get out, or even gauge how much oil is in the well. In fact, even after using the most advanced extraction techniques, such as blasting high-pressure steam into the rock to force the oil out, no more than 40% of the oil is currently thought to be recoverable. With all the biggest known oil wells now thoroughly tapped, this poses a problem for the oil industry if it is to maintain oil recovery rates that can meet our still-growing demand. In light of this, the US is pumping tens of millions of dollars into research to find new ways to find and extract whatever oil is still out there. One idea is to pump novel nano-materials into wells to help loosen the oil's grip on the rock so it can more easily be extracted. Similarly, nano-sensors are also being developed that would be distributed into wells and interrogated from above ground to help map wells and find what oil is left. But, inevitably, it will run out. Precisely when is a moot point, but some estimates say we have already reached peak oil production, while others say this won't happen until about 2030. With demand for oil rising by roughly 2% a year, increasing by up to 47% by 2030, it's hard not to assume we are driving into a major energy crisis. Desperate to keep productivity up, the oil industry is investing billions into extracting oil from more energy-intensive and costly sources such as tar sands and oil shales. Meanwhile, governments are investing in biofuel technologies, which make it possible to produce hydrocarbon fuels from feedstocks of crops such as rapeseed or maize. However, biofuels, although more sustainable than oil, are energy, land and water-intensive and carry a cost in terms of agricultural chemical pollution, and there is concern that it uses valuable land needed for producing food. One solution, now being explored, is the use of solar energy to reverse the combustion process and produce hydrocarbon fuels from carbon dioxide sucked out of the atmosphere."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2008/jan/31/johnmccain.uselections2008","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2008-01-31T19:30:37Z","webTitle":"Schwarzenegger hails 'American hero' McCain as his pick for president","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jan/31/johnmccain.uselections2008","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2008/jan/31/johnmccain.uselections2008","fields":{"headline":"Schwarzenegger hails 'American hero' McCain as his pick for president","bodyText":"California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger today formally endorsed John McCain for the Republican nomination for president, adding his considerable popularity to a virtual sweep of top level Republican support for the Arizona senator. Flanked by McCain and former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, who endorsed McCain yesterday as he abandoned his own campaign for the nomination, Schwarzenegger said, \"He is a great American hero and a great leader. That is why I am endorsing him to be the next president of the United States.\" Schwarzengger's endorsement was to be joined later today by the endorsement of another leading Republican, Texas governor Rick Perry. McCain, who represents Arizona, now commands the support of all the Republican border governors ahead of Super Tuesday next week. The support of Florida governor Charlie Crist on the eve of that state's primary was seen as crucial to McCain's victory. Acknowledging the support of his old friend and ally, McCain praised Schwarzenegger as the embodiment of the American dream, calling him \"the great American success story\". \"He came to this country with nothing very much except for his talents, his strength and his ambition ... He is a role model and a guide to millions of Americans and people across the world.\" The endorsement should buoy McCain's standing among independents and liberal Republicans in California, where the Arizona senator is ahead in the polls. But Schwarzzengger is unpopular among conservative republicans in the state, and his endorsement could move some Republicans to other candidates. McCain today denied that the image of the three liberal republican amigos standing together - McCain, Schwarzenegger and Giuliani - might hurt his standing among conservative Republicans, a key element of the broad coalition the Arizona senator intends to build. McCain said his \"big tent\" would embody the principles of Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan. \"I will never be anything but honoured by the presence of these two heroes,\" he said. \"You will see a flood of endorsements from liberals and conservatives in the coming days. I am confident that for the majority of the conservatives in my party the number one priority is the threat of extremists.\" The three Republicans appeared together during a visit to a solar roofing company in Los Angeles, a fact that gave Schwarzenegger an opportunity to indulge his Austrian sense of humour. Looking out at the banks of cameras and the more than 100 journalists in the warehouse on an industrial corridor near downtown LA, Schwarzenegger declared: \"This is the proof of how much excitement solar energy can create.\" He said he had decided to support McCain after Giuliani had ended his candidacy. Until recently, Schwarzenegger had insisted that he would not endorse any of the Republican candidates. \"It's all Rudy's fault,\" he said. Both of them [McCain and Giuliani] are friends of mine and this is why I didn't want to endorse. I thought it was better to stay out of it.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2008/oct/17/the-fiver","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2008-10-17T16:00:00Z","webTitle":"French Farce Part XXXXVIII; and Middle Eastlands Ethics Part I","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/oct/17/the-fiver","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2008/oct/17/the-fiver","fields":{"headline":"French Farce Part XXXXVIII; and Middle Eastlands Ethics Part I","bodyText":"WHISTLE POSSE In Serbia, folks say whistling brings mice; Koreans think it lures snakes; and in England, builders believe it seduces women in short skirts. The French government, meanwhile, reckons that whistling at a football match spawns terrorism and threatens the very future of Planet Earth. President Nicolas Sarkozy has, therefore, called for all referees to be rounded up and shot. No, hold on, that's not right. What France's very small big cheese actually decreed is that - following the whistling with which some Tunisia fans greeted the French national anthem before Tuesday's friendly between Les Bleus and Tunisia in Paris - the next time La Marseillaise is dissed before a match, the game should be cancelled and tens of thousands of angry fans should be sent home forthwith. It's a cracking plan and nothing could possibly go wrong. The government neglected to specify how many whistles constitute an assault on French democracy - if just one foreign fan inexplicably disrespects an anthem that calls for \"impure blood to water our furrows\", should the match be abandoned? - but that's OK because secretary of state for sport and former egg-chasing flop Bernard Laporte has a cunning plan to ensure the anthem is never again violated. After observing that the whistling has only occurred in Paris when the opposition is from North Africa, and that there are many people of North African origin in Paris, Laporte hissed: \"We should not play such matches in Paris any more, we should only play in the regions, in front of a clean crowd.\" \"What is a clean crowd?\" thundered Socialist Party mouthpiece Razzy Hammadi today before demanding the resignation of the entire government. \"This comment conveys a r@cist and xenophobic bent that is extremely grave coming from a minister of the Republic. In terms of respect to the values of the Republic, these comments are as serious as the whistling, if not more so.\" Of course, if it's a French farce involving attention-seekers in suits, you know Michel Platini isn't going to be far from the action and sure enough Uefa's top banana slipped in a few words of his own today. Less predictably, they were intelligent words: \"Football is being hijacked by politicians,\" parped Platini. \"If you stop a match because the anthem is whistled, you can also stop it as soon as a player is booed or a goalkeeper is jeered while kicking the ball out, it's absurd,\" he wibbled before adding: \"Oh, and why not put a policeman behind every fan?\" Note to Sarkozy and Laporte: he was being sarcastic. ********************* QUOTE OF THE DAY \"They have got probably a worse situation than I had last year.

Even more shocking was the realisation that City were not being panned for their former owner's human-rights abusing ways, but instead hailed as the Premier League's \"most progressive\" club on environmental issues. And that the Fiver was reading Ethical Consumer magazine. City received heady praise for, among other things, recycling initiatives, on-site electric vehicles, and experiments with rainwater toilets and solar energy at their City of Manchester Stadium. \"Most significantly,\" pootled the magazine, \"City have worked with the local council and public transport providers to co-ordinate buses and trains and to promote safe walking and cycling routes,\" it continued, neglecting to add \"so long as you're wearing a City shirt\". Not that City should be too pleased with themselves, of course. Ethical Consumer also assessed the credentials of team owners and sponsors before awarding each Premier League side an \"ethiscore\" (no, us neither, but this site may shed some light). Not one club scored higher than 10 out of 20, and City - whose new owners failed to impress the magazine with their hefty oil fortunes - didn't even manage that. Instead, in the overall ratings column, the words \"Manchester\" and \"City\" once again appear somewhere you might not expect to find them. Next to the word \"poor\". ********************* THE RUMOUR MILL You'll like this dept: Liverpool plan to partner Fernando Torres with Mr Em in January.

As David Adam, our environment correspondent, notes: Google will focus initially on solar thermal power, wind power, geothermal systems and other \"potential breakthrough\" technologies. It wants to find cheaper, less polluting ways to supply its own demand for energy, as well as accelerate the replacement of fossil fuels for worldwide electricity generation. Google plans to put hundreds of millions of its carbon repositories - sorry, dollars - into the projects. Google already uses a fair bit of hydroelectric power at its new data centre in Pryor, Oklahoma (whose choice was shrouded in secrecy)). So it's a bit green. But in line with Dell's \"Plant a Tree For Me\" scheme (even if it has had limp takeup - must chase up those numbers), it shows that the IT industry is starting to take notice, as anyone must amidst the double whammy of rising energy prices and increasing concern about global warming's short- and long-term effects, of how it's sourcing and using energy. It might only be the start, but it's a good road to head down. The initiative is called RE!C - but replace the ! with a less than sign. (We can't, because it will likely break the site - thinking it's an HTML markup - and lead to a meltdown of the interwebnet. Which would be bad.) Update: the Daily Green points out that by comparison, the US Department of Energy spent about $1.16bn on energy efficiency and renewable energy in 2006, and requested $1.24bn for 2008. So Google isn't going to make an overwhelming difference - but it may provide a useful flagpole to rally around. depending on how quickly Google spends its intended $100m, it will be spending more than the US federal government on renewables, where the Department of Energy spent $65m on research and development into biomass, wind and solar energy in 2006.."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/blog/2006/aug/17/musicslongtai","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2006-08-17T08:57:44Z","webTitle":"Music's long tail, charges for laws, free Wi-Fi with pasties, Tim Schafer interview, solar energy and much more","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2006/aug/17/musicslongtai","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/blog/2006/aug/17/musicslongtai","fields":{"headline":"Music's long tail, charges for laws, free Wi-Fi with pasties, Tim Schafer interview, solar energy and much more","bodyText":"Today's printed edition of the Guardian's Technology section is also online here.

Along the way, writer Simon Beaufoy did his level best to weave real-life climate science and politics seamlessly into the fictional drama. Most people who have spent any time at climate negotiations will conclude that he did a credible job. Those who have been influenced by the more effective pieces of contrarian propaganda, notably Channel 4's documentary The Great Global Warming Swindle, or Michael Crichton's novel State of Fear) will doubtless conclude that Burn Up is rooted in fantasy right across the sex-murder-science–politics spectrum. They might be right about the sex and murder, but they couldn't be more wrong about the science and the politics. Let me consider each in turn. The central scientist character, a British chief scientific advisor, feels an urgent need to warn the world about amplifying feedbacks in the process of being awakened as the world warms. He majors on methane emissions, including from warming hydrates below the permafrost. A hydrate is an ice-like solid that locks up the potent greenhouse-gas methane under pressure in cold sediments at high latitudes. In the first episode, the hero – CEO of an oil company not unlike BP – is converted to the popular global cause of deep carbon emissions reductions in part because he sees the methane feedback with his own eyes (plus enjoying a night of passion with Neve Campbell). In a sequence exactly like one filmed by the BBC in the real world, he breaks an ice layer capping permafrost and sets escaping gas alight. The methane hydrate amplifier, and all the many others we know about, have long been warned of. In 1990, I flagged the danger myself in Global Warming: the Greenpeace Report (Oxford University Press), and again in The Carbon War (Penguin, 2000). In 1990, such warnings tended to be dismissed as scaremongering, even by government climate scientists concerned about mainstream estimates of global warming. Even by 2000, only the boldest of government climate scientists spoke out about the worst-case analysis that amplifying feedbacks could snowball. Now, such warnings have entered the mainstream, for those with the eyes to see and ears to listen. Last week at a meeting in London, for example, a top German climate scientist told an audience of 150 captains of industry that climate scientists couldn't guarantee that a runaway greenhouse effect wouldn't happen, if emissions continue apace. He and the majority of his fellows now believe that we face a race to save civilisation of the kind Burn Up portrays. As for the politics, the drama centres on an oil-industry lobbyist based on the real-life carbon club hitman Don Pearlman, whose real-life antics I chronicle over almost a decade in The Carbon War. Viewers who have never seen climate negotiations at work might find the notion of a roomful of oil-coal-lobbyists plotting the subversion of a multilateral negotiating process involving over a hundred sovereign governments far-fetched. It isn't. The Carbon War describes plenty of such scenes. The idea that western oil-company lobbyists can ferry notes to Opec officials or senior US politicians telling them what to say might seem to involve too much dramatic licence. It doesn't. I have seen it with my own eyes at the most dramatic of moments in the real-life climate negotiations, just as vital negotiating issues hung in the balance. Burn Up also addresses some of the questions that puzzle many of us who care about the climate threat to civilisation. Why do the carbon-club lobbyists and contrarians do what they do? What is in their heads as they go about their work? Surely they must see the power of the emerging evidence that the threat is real, and massive? Even if they don't, or can't, surely they must realise that there is uncertainty in the equation that can have horrible downside implications. Why, then, don't they show a little humility? This is not an armchair scientific debate. If the contrarians are wrong, and, for example, the Greenland and west Antarctic ice caps melt and destabilise, civilisation cannot easily survive. How can transparently oil-funded scientific naysayers like Fred Singer keep spouting their disinformation with certitude, even as the scientific evidence hardens? How can the commissioners of naysaying for the media, like Channel 4's Hamish Mykura, persuade themselves that they are doing society a service? After Ofcom's ruling that The Great Global Warming Swindle had misrepresented climate scientists last week, Mykura – its commissioner – said: \"Channel 4 believes in engaging with the debate in its fullest form, rather than closing it down. That is why this film was a valid contribution.\" The true situation is that climate change, according to the vast majority of modern climate scientists (but not all), will kill many millions of people if it remains unabated. The holocaust, according to the vast majority of modern historians (but not all), did kill millions of people. Why is it a valid contribution to screen a film by one of the very few climate-change deniers, and not a film by one of the very few holocaust deniers? My conclusion is that Mykura, Singer, Pearlman, Crichton and the minority like them have made it more likely that millions are going to die now, because they have diluted the collective will to abate global warming. I still don't understand why or how they can do it. The answer in Burn Up, as we hear it from the lips of the Pearlman figure, is that the rich elite that created by the oil age secretly know it is all true, but they are worried by the rise of the global population. They are waging a wilful campaign to thin it: a game of last man standing. That device of the drama I have to roundly reject. Surely we are not collectively that evil. But I don't have an explanation to replace it with. Meanwhile, the carbon propaganda war goes on. Many of us prefer stories to documentaries, it seems. For those who do, I hope Burn Up leads you to the real-world truth. I hope that Mykura's poisonous DVD goes unwatched, and Crichton's toxic novel goes unread. They won't, of course. They will play their part in delaying humankind's survival reflex, perhaps until it is too late. A final thought. An unseen but oft-quoted long-term talisman for survival in Burn Up is solar energy. The hundreds of diplomats at the fictional climate summit in Burn Up are effectively trying to keep carbon fuel in the ground, while accelerating the survival family of technologies, including solar. That is the road I have trodden, vocationally, these last 20 years. Of course, cynical bloggers often choose to believe the reverse: that I hype the climate threat so as to sell more solar. I invite them to reconsider. Having read the above, and thought – just a little – about the real-world Burn Up, just how likely is that?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"money/2008/jul/26/capital.letters","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2008-07-25T23:01:00Z","webTitle":"Capital letters: Consumer champion Tony Levene fights for your rights","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/jul/26/capital.letters","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2008/jul/26/capital.letters","fields":{"headline":"Capital letters","bodyText":"A £5 purchase that landed me with £105 bank charge I have two bank accounts at Alliance &amp; Leicester (in my married and maiden names), one of which is dormant. Inadvertently, I used the dormant one when buying something online, which put the account £1.55 overdrawn. I discovered the error only when A&amp;L sent a statement charging me £105 for exceeding my overdraft limit. I rang immediately and they said that if I paid £55 plus the £1.55, then they'd waive the other £50. I agreed to do so. But the next month's statement still had the £50 remaining on it, plus a further £100 charge for being overdrawn. No one at A&amp;L is able to sort this out. Can you? CB, Gloucester A small error involving a £5 online purchase and a £1.55 overdraft has turned into a farce. You have been bounced from one department at A&amp;L to the next. When you complained, you were sent a standard-issue letter about the ongoing court battle between the OFT and the banks, which was irrelevant to your case. You have also had to make long and expensive calls to A&amp;L's 0870 number. The call centre told you it was a \"bank error\", but letters continued to arrive from A&amp;L demanding the money. The debt is building up at £5 a day, despite the fact that you paid the reduced fine and have been a long-term customer of the bank, keeping your main account in credit. When Capital Letters intervened, A&amp;L went back over its tapes. \"While the adviser said she would put forward a request for a refund of £50 of fees, it was made clear that there would be no guarantee that £50 of the fees would be waived. This request was looked at, and as there was no error by us, the request was refused.\" But it admits that, in a later call, a refund was indeed agreed. A&amp;L admits its service has fallen below its usual standards, and has agreed to repay all fees charged to the account - a total of £325 - plus £50 as a gesture of goodwill and a bouquet of flowers. Deposit that got lost in the Solar system In May, someone knocked on my door and said \"they were in my area\" and would I like to consider solar panels. They made an appointment for me to see a representative from Sunmaster Solar Energy Systems that very day. After the sales pitch, I said I wanted time to think about it but I was persuaded to pay a £2,275 deposit (a third of the £6,825 price) as the salesman said I had seven days to change my mind. I changed my mind but no refund! Can you recover my cash? KW, Kent Sunmaster Solar's directors are Robert Graham Rice, 60, and David Charles Mead, 49, who have appeared previously in this column when they were directors of other solar panel companies. Mead told Capital Letters he has made a fresh start and would have paid your refund but for his firm's cash flow problems and the credit crunch. Happily, following this conversation, Mead has sent you a cheque for the full amount which has now cleared into your account. What's the key to getting my prize? In February, I sent in a form in your travel section asking readers to nominate favourite holiday companies for the Guardian's annual travel awards. There were prizes. I forgot all about this but in mid June, the Guardian phoned to say I had won £2,000 in vouchers to spend on Keycamp holidays. I was delighted but despite my best efforts since, Keycamp says it knows nothing of my win. CA, Cheshire The Guardian can do no more than hold up its hands and apologise. Due to an internal structural reorganisation, the department dealing with the random selection of the 14 prizes to the 16,500 entrants failed to do this on schedule - it should have been in late March. We also failed to notify Keycamp of your details. The Guardian has sent your name and address to Keycamp which will now ensure you have your prize and enjoy your holiday. Impossible ... trying to get back to Flybe I bought a return ticket from Birmingham to Milan in June, from Flybe, but then had to change the date of the outward leg. It was cheaper to buy a new flight from another carrier than change the booking. I tried to tell Flybe but could never get through. However, when I turned up at Milan airport to fly home, I was told that because I hadn't travelled out, my ticket had been cancelled. After several rows - and numerous failed attempts to call Flybe's customer service line - I was forced to pay €533 (£425) for a single back home with BA. Is this fair? GT, Oxford Flybe has set a new low with its impossible-to-contact phone line - Capital Letters failed to get through on several attempts as well. Flybe says it is common practice in the aviation sector to cancel flights in this manner but adds if there is capacity on the intended return flight, passengers can travel at no extra charge. Whether there was a spare space or not isn't clear. The airline blamed your poor treatment on the fact that it does not employ staff at Milan. But it accepts you should have been treated better. It will now refund the €533 and investigate the incident. Your argument fails to make the grade I paid a non-refundable £1,000 deposit to finalise my admission to City University in London. Eventually, I chose another university. Could I have the deposit refunded on the grounds of not receiving the services for which I paid in part? FG, London No. This was not actually a deposit but a contribution towards the first year's tuition fees - City does ask for a small initial deposit which it will refund if you fail to make the grades. You can hardly claim the services could not be delivered when you chose to go elsewhere. City can argue you could, at any stage, take up the course for which you have paid in part. Update ... FSA rules on Mandrake complaint On May 31, Capital Letters carried a letter from a reader in Devon, stating that IFA Mandrake Associates of Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, had failed to respond to a complaint over a mortgage endowment. This week the Financial Services Authority issued a public censure against Mandrake for rule breaches, including a failure to deal with complaints effectively \"that resulted in an enhanced risk of the rejection and/or delay of potentially valid complaints\". The FSA says the firm (which no longer takes on new business) will \"engage a suitably qualified and independent consultant\" and \"will resolve current outstanding mortgage complaints within 12 months\". The firm would normally have been fined £400,000, but due to its financial position and the offer to deal with complaints, it has been waived. The FSA also made a prohibition order against William John Pirie, 62, the sole director of Mandrake. He is now banned from \"carrying out customer facing functions in relation to any regulated activity\" as he is not \"a fit and proper person\".

In the middle of a train journey to Bristol last Thursday evening, a man wearing a beige fleece and jeans calls down the first-class carriage to the minister. He comes over and hands a bemused Wicks a press release and thick report from the environmental lobby group about renewable energy. 'It will help you come up with a response,' he says helpfully. The bizarre interruption brings some much-needed light relief. Wicks is a worried man. He is worried that Opec, which is holding an emergency summit this weekend in Saudi Arabia, can't pump enough oil. He's worried about soaring fuel prices. He's worried about old people not being able to afford to keep their homes warm in a cold winter. And no wonder. Oil prices have doubled in a year and this month hit $140 a barrel. In the UK, utility bills are heading in the same direction and last month the worst power cuts for a decade plunged parts of the country into darkness. Britain is in the grip of a global energy crisis that seems to get worse by the day. Wicks looks pained. 'I always hesitate a bit to use the word crisis,' he says. 'But if someone used the word I wouldn't necessarily quarrel. This is totally unprecedented. If oil prices double, you are in a totally different ball park. It worries me greatly, not least because of the impact on vulnerable households.' Wicks, a former university lecturer, wrote a book called The Old and the Cold after the oil crisis of the 1970s, when fuel bills soared as now and the elderly struggled to heat their homes. So he knows all about oil shocks. But he's not confident that oil prices will slump again, as they did in the 1980s. 'A Liberal Democrat asked me in the House of Commons to predict what price oil would be in 2020. I said I can't predict what it's going to be next week. If I knew I would probably be a forecaster-stroke-liar and very well paid for that.' Hardly reassuring, but honest. This week, the government will issue what Wicks calls its 'greenprint' to bring about a 'renewable energy revolution'. 'We are talking about a revolution in how we build a house in the future, the kind of cars we drive.' It is fighting talk, but this week's consultation is by all accounts a radical departure from current policy. It has to be. The government has signed up to a binding EU target to source 15 per cent of its energy from renewable, non-fossil fuel sources. That requires a more than 10-fold increase from current levels. Because it is difficult to heat homes or power cars using renewable energy, the heaviest burden for meeting the 15 per cent target will fall on power generators. Analysts estimate that at least a third of all electricity generated will have to come from renewable sources, such as wind or solar energy, to meet the overall target in 2020. Only 5 per cent of the UK's electricity comes from renewables today. That means thousands more wind farms and solar panels and mammoth projects like the Severn barrage, which would be big enough to provide some 5 per cent of the UK's electricity, but cost at least £15bn and take more than a decade to build. Wicks admits that even with all this, the target will not be reached without buying in renewable credits from other countries in Europe. He also admits that the EU targets will add even more to households' utility bills: 'At a time when prices are rising and given the state of technology, the measures we take like the obligation to bring on renewables do add to cost. The EU target will add even more.' The Guardian reported last week that the government's Renewable Advisory Board had concluded that the UK would only be able to source a maximum of 14 per cent of energy from renewables. Wicks is not perturbed: 'It's like a team bragging they're going to win 10-nil and only winning nine-nil. I'm encouraged they are saying 14 per cent is do-able.' Wicks was on his way to the site of the proposed project on the Severn when The Observer interviewed him. He admitted the government was in talks with the European Commission about counting the project's electricity output to help the UK meet its renewable target, even though in 2020 the barrage would still be under construction. He denied this was 'creative accounting', saying it would 'pass the common sense test'. 'Although it's a 2020 target, if the Commission and our colleagues in Europe see the thing is up and building but won't come on stream until 2022... This is a grand project.' Bird lovers, represented by the RSPB, are already up in arms about the barrage, which would involve the construction of a dam, or series of dams, across the estuary, which they say would destroy the habitat for bird and fish. The subject of environmentalists provokes another pained expression from Wicks. 'We have some environmental lobbyists who seem to be opposed to things we need to do,' he sighs. 'Some of these environmentalists who have good hearts but confused minds are almost a barrier to tackling climate change. Historically that will turn out to be sad.' The controversy over the fate of the Severn estuary's mudflats is nothing compared to that over building new nuclear reactors: 'I find it genuinely disappointing and sad that some organisations seem to put their hatred of nuclear above their concern for global warming.' Wicks insists that his support for nuclear power - which results in only low-carbon emissions - does not extend to intervening in the stalled £11bn auction of nuclear generator British Energy. The government owns a 35 per cent stake in the company, whose sites are best to build more reactors. French nuclear giant EDF is the only remaining bidder, but the board of British Energy is demanding that EDF pay more for the company. 'How would we intervene - nationalise British Energy? We're not going to do that. These are matters for BE. We have a shareholding and take an active interest. But we're not going to start dictating to BE what they should do or what their next move should be.' Asked if he was relaxed about the situation, he replies: 'Relaxed is not a word I would use.

But next week the government will lay out an ambitious blueprint for what it says is an achievable energy revolution. It will affect everyone in Britain and raise electricity costs, the government concedes, but may also reduce greenhouse gas emissions and provide long-term energy security. Wind revolution As expected, wind power is the key to this \"green industrial revolution\". The government accepts that to reach the 15% renewable energy target, nearly 35% of all UK electricity will have to be from renewable sources by 2020 - up from less than 5% today. Over the next 12 years, under the plan, there will be six times more onshore wind turbines as there are now and a series of vast offshore windfarms built in the equivalent of a new North Sea oil rush. The dash for low-carbon energy will transform upland areas of Britain: 45% of the wind electricity will eventually come from Scotland, 18% from Wales, 10% from Northern Ireland and the rest from England. But the consultation paper, obtained by the Guardian, accepts the government may miss its ambitious wind targets. At present there are only three major manufacturers in the world able to make the large turbines needed offshore. In addition, the paper says, there are not enough vessels, cable suppliers, or skilled workers to set up the new wind farms. Bio-energy The second big growth area envisaged in the document is \"bio energy\": electricity generated from the burning of straw, wood, waste, and energy crops. Nearly 6% of all electricity demand, the paper says, could be generated from wood taken from existing, but better managed, woodland, and farmers growing more crops. It suggests 1m tonnes of wood a year could be extracted from existing woods, and 350,000 hectares (874,700 acres - an area the size of Essex) could be turned over to growing wood and other crops for bio-energy. In addition, sewage works and farms will be encouraged to supply bio gas to reduce dependency on conventional gas. Make your own power The third strand of the plan involves so-called microgeneration from homes, particularly from solar energy. At the moment there are 90,000 solar water heating systems in Britain but the government believes that with the right incentives, this could increase by 40% a year. By 2020 it suggests there could be up to 7m solar heating systems installed on the roofs of buildings, with one in four households generating their own hot water from the sun. It believes there could be a 90% increase each year in the installation of ground and air source heat pumps which provide \"free\" heat by tapping the warmth in the air or the earth. The paper suggests 14% of all UK heating could be generated locally in this way by homes and businesses. Biofuels The government says biofuels will be essential to meeting the 15% renewable target but is cautious about the future mix because biofuels could affect food supplies in the UK and in developing countries. Biofuels, it says, might be most useful for fuelling trains and planes. \"We are sensitive to the risks [of biofuels] in the current context of rising food prices. It would be unacceptable to clear rainforest to grow feedstock for biofuels,\" the paper says. The caveats echo concerns which will be raised by the Gallagher report into biofuels due to be published this week. In the longer term, the paper suggests that biofuels may prove less suitable for road transport than other technologies. It warns that if biofuel use does not reach 10%, the target the EU wants, \"it would be necessary to conclude that the [15% renewables] target would not be achievable by 2020.The plan acknowledges that there are few major sites left in the UK for big hydro-electric schemes, but hundreds of small scale energy generating schemes could be set up on rivers and canals. It expects tidal and other marine energy to become powerful sources of energy but does not think they will be on stream significantly in the next decade. Benefits The benefits of a renewables revolution, says the document, will be \"immense\" in terms of climate change, fuel dependency and energy supplies, as well as creating new business opportunities. Meeting a 15% target, it says, would cut oil dependency by 6-7% by 2020 and save as much as 265m tonnes of CO2 between 2013 and 2020. This is as much as 50% of what the UK emits annually. But a dash for renewables would also have affect demand for coal and other fossil fuels. The document estimates that UK dependency on coal would reduce by 13-18% and gas by about 1.5% In business terms, the document claims the strategy will create new markets worth billions of pounds a year. It estimates that offshore wind alone could be worth £2bn by 2020, and marine renewables could contribute £900m a year to the economy by 2020. In addition, the government says 160,000 \"green collar jobs\" could be created within 12 years. Nearly 3,000 would be created in installing and maintaining micro-generation systems. The green energy dash would also underpin nearly 17,000 farming jobs, with the rest of the new jobs coming from the expansion in wind farms and micro energy. Some of the new industry that would be kickstarted by the renewables push would be located in Britain. The document talks of jet engine companies turning to making wind turbines. Overall, says the paper which draws on the Stern report into the costs of climate change, the cost of not taking action could be the equivalent of losing 5-20% of GDP. But the cost of action would be around 1% of GDP. Costs The document talks of the renewable revolution costing the economy up t0 £6bn a year by 2020. The overall shift to a low carbon economy, it is anticipated, could be in the region of £100bn over 12 years. \"Our policies will add further to energy prices. The impact will increase as 2020 approaches. In the longer term, as renewable energy develops and fossil fuels become scarcer, we might expect society's investment today to [lead to] prices that are lower than they would otherwise have been,\" it says. No figure is given on the expected energy price rises. The drive to renewables will also have social costs which need to be addressed, it says. It envisages price rises for industry, business and households and increases in petrol and diesel prices. The higher fuel prices, it concedes, will increase \"fuel poverty\". But it adds: \"We are convinced that such costs are much more than outweighed by the very large benefits in terms of meeting our challenges of tackling climate change and ensuring secure energy supplies.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/blog/2007/nov/23/redfordversusgore","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2007-11-23T13:24:41Z","webTitle":"Redford versus Gore","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2007/nov/23/redfordversusgore","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/blog/2007/nov/23/redfordversusgore","fields":{"headline":"Redford versus Gore","bodyText":"In this week's New Statesman magazine, Hollywood actor Robert Redford makes a stinging attack on Nobel Peace Prize winner, Al Gore. Is his scepticism of the former US vice president's green credentials at all justied? Commenting on Gore's award, Redford, who himself has campaigned on green issues since 1969, says: \"He's making a lot of money, he's having a belle epoque, a heroic moment. It must have been really hard for Gore to suffer all that [losing the presidential election], so he found another thing to come back with; the environment.\" ouch... And he goes on... \"He had a lot of money behind him, because in Clinton's administration there was a lot of money. With that he was able to build himself a new campaign and pick an issue. And he picked an issue that just happened to arrive at its moment in time.\" Asked why the thinks Gore is not going back into politics, Redford answers: \"What's more important - to be a hero to your country and go save it...or do you want to be happy and rich and be a hero and not get into the political scene?\" Even if there is a germ of truth in what Redford says it looks like a case of sour grapes; while Redford was out there speaking about the environment before it became fashionable, Gore has taken all the credit. As Redford says: \"It was not a happy easy time [in the late 60s/70s], because those were the days that the oil and gas companies pretty much controlled the show on propaganda. Anyone speaking about solar energy would be smashed down as being a radical, a tree-hugger and granola-cruncher or what have you.\" If Redford was that radical, granola crunching tree-hugger - and he does like to give the impression that he reigns over the Hollywood left - surely he should be thrilled that someone has been able to finally bring green issues into the mainstream, whoever it is and whatever it took? Is Redford feeling aggrieved that Gore has robbed his green crown and he's not happy to relinquish it without a fight, or else is he just trying to deflect attention from his latest film, Lions for Lambs, which has had shockingly bad reviews?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2007/aug/01/comment.nuclear","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2007-07-31T23:14:01Z","webTitle":"Response: We don't need the nuclear option, says Keith Barnham","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/aug/01/comment.nuclear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2007/aug/01/comment.nuclear","fields":{"headline":"We don't need the nuclear option","bodyText":"Jim Al-Khalili is deeply concerned that people believe \"we can slash our reliance on coal and gas solely through renewable resources, such as wind and solar, along with energy conservation\" (Nuclear waste is hardly a worry when the climate change threat is so urgent, July 26). I own up to being a believer and, as a fellow physicist, ask: where is Jim's data? Here is some of mine. More solar energy strikes the Earth in one hour than is consumed by all human activity in a year. In the UK more than 60% of our electricity is used in buildings. The solar energy falling on those buildings exceeds by more than seven times the energy consumed inside. Hence more than half the UK electricity demand could be met by covering all south-facing roofs with the current 14%-efficient solar photovoltaic (PV) panels. That is ignoring small wind turbines and new technology. The PV cells my company is commercialising have twice this efficiency and can be much less obtrusive. The most significant feature of the newer wind turbine and PV systems is that they come in small units and can be installed very quickly. Not only do these micro-generation technologies have much shorter lead-in times than the 10-year wait for nuclear stations (or the 20-35 years for Al-Khalili's technology to transmute nuclear waste), but installations can grow exponentially, as happens for consumer electrical products. The most optimistic assumption for new nuclear build is a linear rise of one new reactor a year, starting in 10 years' time. For example, PV use in Germany has been growing exponentially over the past decade. One hundred times as much PV electrical capacity as in the UK has already been installed. If similar policies were introduced here, the combination of wind and PV electricity generation would dwarf the proposed nuclear build well before a single new nuclear unit of electricity is generated. According to Al-Khalili, people like me are \"utterly irrational\" in being concerned about nuclear waste. But plutonium will be a problem for hundreds of thousands of years, not tens of thousands as he claims. He argues that science will eventually find a way \"to deal with this buried waste thousands of years in the future\". I consider it immoral that we should leave more than 10,000 generations to deal with the waste of the three generations who will have consumed the world's exploitable uranium reserves. For a start, how will they know where the plutonium is buried, when the store must survive intact for more than 100 times the age of Stonehenge? Rather than developing transmutation or fast-breeder schemes which may not work, and which involve the transportation of large amounts of plutonium, the highest priority of the nuclear industry should be to solve the long-term waste storage problem. The urgency of finding a solution was re-emphasised by the recent revelation that the failed London tube bombers had the plans of the Sizewell B nuclear station. · Keith Barnham is emeritus professor of physics at Imperial College London, and a co-founder of the solar cell manufacturing company QuantaSol k.barnham@imperial.ac.uk"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2008/apr/03/carbonambivalent","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2008-04-03T19:00:00Z","webTitle":"Carbon ambivalent","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/apr/03/carbonambivalent","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2008/apr/03/carbonambivalent","fields":{"headline":"Carbon ambivalent","bodyText":"At a Senate press conference held recently to urge national action on climate change policy, 16 major US environmental organisations shared the stage in solidarity. But while it appears the nation's green groups are united in the fight against global warming, they remain divided on which technologies would best create a carbon-free economy. This division may cause major roadblocks as Congress prepares to debate several climate change policies that could lead to sweeping changes. Environmental organisations agree that global warming is a serious concern and that emissions from coal-fired power plants must be drastically curtailed. To do so, many support carbon capture and sequestration, commonly known as CCS. CCS technology is designed to trap and store (either in the Earth's crust or the deep oceans) the massive quantities of carbon dioxide spewed from coal power plants. Groups like the Natural Resources Defence Council (NRDC) and Environmental Defence Fund are already lobbying on behalf of CCS. Others, such as the Sierra Club and the World Wildlife Fund, are more cautious about promoting CCS. They insist that affordable and proven technologies, such as energy efficiency and wind or solar energy, should be more fully implemented before CCS is considered. Greenpeace specifically opposes the technology. A divided environmental community is reflective of a still unproven technology. Although CCS is almost certainly technically feasible, both the timing and the cost are highly uncertain. A Massachusetts Institute of Technology report released last year, The Future of Coal, concluded that the US CCS programme is not on track to achieve large-scale commercial operation for at least a decade. Carbon liability concerns have led major investors and the US government to rein in financing for coal-fired power plants. As a result, the coal industry has embraced CCS as essential to its survival. Some environmentalists say CCS is critical to creating a political deal that would dissuade power companies from blocking new climate legislation. \"Congress should require planned new coal plants in the United States to employ CCS without further delay,\" NRDC said in a statement last year. According to NRDC science fellow George Peridas, as long as China continues its surge in coal emissions and the US coal industry wants to build new plants, the coal industry must be presented with an alternative. \"There are cheaper ways and cleaner ways and preferable ways to meet energy demands, but I think CCS will ultimately be needed too,\" Peridas said. \"I'd love to be actively campaigning against all use of coal, but I don't think that's the best way to reduce emissions.\" US Representatives Henry Waxman of California and Edward Markey of Massachusetts introduced a bill last month that would ban any coal plants that do not capture and store at least 85% of carbon dioxide emissions. The Sierra Club supports the legislation because it places a moratorium on coal plants until CCS is ready. The group's support, however, does not reflect an embrace of CCS. \"We need to make sure that the technology to capture and store carbon is feasible and in place,\" said Bruce Nilles, the Sierra Club's national coal campaign director. \"While we are evaluating the role coal should play in our energy future, we should continue to move forward with the clean, affordable energy solutions that are available today, like wind and solar power.\" Greenpeace has taken a hard-line approach against CCS. \"We are opposed to CCS technology,\" said Kate Smolski, Greenpeace USA global warming campaigner. \"The number one reason is it's a way the dirty polluting coal industry can prop itself up. It's an unproven technology. And it takes resources away from solutions that we can use right now.\" The main concern with CCS is whether carbon stored inside empty aquifers would leak and pollute groundwater reserves. \"If people think this is the solution, think again. A lot of research is needed,\" said Steven Chu, director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory at the \"Summit on America's Energy Future\", sponsored by the National Academies of Sciences and Engineering in March. Researchers are calling for \"urgent\" expansion of CCS research and development funding. Massachusetts Institute of Technology physicist Ernest Moniz, also director of the Energy Initiative, said experimental CCS power plants are needed to improve cost and performance. The US government's plans for its first large CCS plant were halted in January when the Department of Energy cancelled major pilot programme FutureGen after concluding that the costs had mushroomed out of control. \"What we need is several demonstrations in parallel,\" Moniz said at the Academies' summit. The World Resources Institute (WRI) has organised a stakeholder partnership to address CCS liability, permit procedure and site selection. Participating environmental groups so far have included the Bellona Foundation, Clean Air Task Force, Conservation Law Centre, Environmental Defence, Great Plains Institute, NRDC, and Pew Centre on Global Climate Change, according to John Venezia, a WRI associate. \"There are groups that agree CCS should be fiercely looked at; other groups will disagree,\" Venezia said. \"Those discussions are important to have.\" For his part, Worldwatch Institute president Christopher Flavin is sceptical of CCS. \"It will be many years before we know for sure whether large-scale carbon sequestration is practical and affordable,\" Flavin says. \"The only thing that's certain today is that we shouldn't assume CCS will be a major solution to climate change-unlike solar, wind, and energy efficiency, all of which are being deployed on a significant scale today.\" This article originally appeared on the Worldwatch Institute website: www.worldwatch.org."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"music/2008/feb/03/popandrock.worldmusic","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2008-02-03T00:24:00Z","webTitle":"Pop, world and jazz CD releases: American Music Club | Jack Johnson | The Duke Spirit | Rivers Cuomo | Shelby Lynne | Kenny Wheeler","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/feb/03/popandrock.worldmusic","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2008/feb/03/popandrock.worldmusic","fields":{"headline":"Pop, world and jazz CD releases","bodyText":"American Music Club The Golden Age (Cooking Vinyl) £11.99 Long before Elliott Smith became the poster boy for West Coast depression, there was Mark Eitzel and his American Music Club. The sorrowful croon of the self-described 'gay communist' Eitzel has illuminated eight previous AMC albums, as well as a welter of solo efforts of wildly varying quality. The good news is that the ninth album from these inveterate melancholics is a burnished pleasure. Eitzel's gift has long been that he delivers his bleak missives in a voice made of cashmere. Here, voice, songwriting and band (50 per cent new) conspire to create a plush album that glimpses the odd silver lining in the thunderheads. Kitty Empire Jack Johnson Sleep through the Static (Universal) £12.99 Since his 2001 debut, Johnson has peddled wispy acoustic ditties that are presumably intended to evoke images of sunny afternoons, but are more likely to induce a coma. Perhaps to answer his critics, his fourth album throws in some electric guitar riffs, though they're a red herring - his folk-funk languor prevails, along with his bored vocals and gauche lyrical instinct, responsible for clunkers like 'I want to take the preconceived out from underneath your feet'. Solar energy powered the recording sessions; shame the music shows no such innovation. Hugh Montgomery The Duke Spirit Neptune (You Are Here) £10.99 Remember Republica and their ubiquitous 'Ready To Go'? The Duke Spirit certainly do and, with revved up guitars and feisty lead Leila Moss, it's as if female-fronted Britpop never went away. Recorded with Queens of the Stone Age producer Chris Goss, this second album from the Cheltenham fivepiece extends their dark rock catalogue with more than a few nods to Kim Gordon's Sonic Youth output. Sumptuous ballad 'This Ship Was Built To Last' is the high point, but elsewhere the songs fail to make an impression. The Dukes' admirable effort to keep proper rock alive is stifled by an unmistakably dated sound. Katie Toms Rivers Cuomo Alone: The Home Recordings of Rivers Cuomo (Geffen) £12.99 Rivers Cuomo has always been free and easy with his demos and now, in advance of his band Weezer's sixth album, he's releasing a whole career's worth of them. Those who know the dork rockers by 'Buddy Holly' - included here in its wonky embryonic state - will be bewildered by their frontman bellowing Ice Cube lyrics on 'The Bomb'. Many of these tracks are from Weezer's unrealised concept album Songs From the Black Hole: 'Blast Off ' gives a short, sweet taste of what may have been, but others such as 'This is the Way' show how bland Cuomo and co can be at their worst. Killian Fox Shelby Lynne Just A Little Lovin' (Lost Highway) £11.99 A refugee from Nashville's conformity, Lynne had a Grammy-winning blend of country and R&amp;B on 2000's I Am Shelby Lynne, since when her languorous vocals have struggled to find their place - a title like 'Identity Crisis' says it all. An album of Dusty Springfield covers produced by Phil Ramone suggests a shift to mainstream diva-dom. Instead, Lynne recasts the Dusty songbook - 'You Don't Have To Say' et al - as intimate, bedroom confessionals, with hushed, skeletal backings. At times less proves to be plain less, but Lynne's poise and honesty never waiver, and with another's songs, she's still her own woman. Neil Spencer Kenny Wheeler Other People (Camjazz) £13.99 With a highly personal style ranging from glacial free improvisation to limpid romanticism, Wheeler has been at the forefront of European jazz almost from the beginning. As both trumpeter and composer, Wheeler is always apt to come up with surprises, and this set is no exception. Working for the first time with a string quartet, he produces eight pieces that manage to be at the same time both fragile and energetic. No other trumpeter around can play extreme high notes as quietly as this. The warm tones of the Hugo Wolf Quartet and delicate piano of John Taylor make a perfect setting.

Before that, the idea of travelling around Europe with our two daughters Frida, 10, and Silvie, seven, was nothing more than a pipe dream. We are not exactly well-travelled, being against casual air travel on environmental grounds. But we really wanted our daughters to see the world and how other people lived, in a way that's impossible to do on a regular holiday. So we took the plunge and bought a safari caravan for £140 and a Mercedes-Benz Diesel for £500 on eBay. Our plan was to cover five countries over two continents in just under six months - and all for no more than £3,000. We gave up our jobs and took the children out of school. One immediate tip: tell everyone what you're doing, then it's impossible to back out. And if you're thinking our experience has no relevance for anyone who can't give up the day job; well, we've learnt lessons about travelling on a budget that will remain with us for the rest of our lives (some of which are outlined over the next couple of pages). More importantly, our children have blossomed, our family has become closer, and we've proved to ourselves that money and consumables are not important to our lives at all. It's been a fantastic experience ... Kate's top tips for a cheap, long trip 1. Before you go Contact your bank and credit card companies and give them your travel details - they'll stop your cards if you don't. Inform your children's schools in advance, too. They may be reluctant to agree, but it's not against the law. Get them onside; they can recommend useful resources, and we were able to buy workbooks from the school. They also gave us a list of topics they would be covering during our kids' absence. 2. Sign up for free accommodation Join Helpx (helpx.net), a cultural exchange programme. It costs £10 to join and gives you a choice of farms and homesteads across Europe, where you get free accommodation and food in exchange for your labour (usually gardening, building or looking after animals). Many accept requests from families and have children who yours can play with and pick up languages from. The amount of work expected varies (four hours a day is suggested, although one we visited expected eight), so it's worth asking before accepting a place. This can considerably extend the duration of your travels and give a real taste of living elsewhere - you're living with local people. We organised two in Portugal, in Coimbra and Odemira, doing light gardening, and one in the Sierra de Almijara in Spain, where we worked full days building, baking bread and cooking while the girls spent their time playing with the hosts' children. We planned the rest of our trip around these stops. 3. Take the following essential items Pack good sleeping bags and blankets - we travelled in winter to avoid crowds, and it got very cold. Get a solar energy source: \"trickle chargers\" and small solar panels are available from Halfords and similar shops. Once attached, the charger keeps the battery topped up no matter how remotely you're camped, so we always had light in the caravan. Wind-up torches are also a must, as is a toolkit for making the inevitable repairs to your car and caravan. It should include a saw, hammer, screwdrivers, socket set, sewing kit and duct tape. Take a good sound system, too: you'll need a soundtrack for the road. 4. Eating out will blow your budget Our budget of £3,000 over five months was actually less than we would spend at home. We used the credit card only for buying petrol (you need to keep painfully tight control over your cards if you want to avoid going home with a massive debt). We cooked one-pan meals - soups, stews and pasta - which are both cheap and nutritious. Save eating and drinking out (and attractions with entry fees and campsites) for special occasions, as these will all devour your budget. 5. Camp for free Wild camping is liberating. We have stopped off in open land in beautiful, remote areas. We parked up next to a medieval chateau near Roquefort in the Haute-Languedoc national park, and also in the foothills of the Pyrenees. It's easy in Portugal and Morocco (where we spent a week next to the beach in Essouira) if you're travelling off-season. France also has a great network of Aires de Repose, rest places where you can stay for free. They are plentiful and available on even minor roads. Just keep your eyes open for the signs when you're in a picturesque area. Cities and coastal resorts are difficult and stressful to park in with a caravan - too much traffic and too many people. And if you're on a tight budget like us, only use campsites when you need to shower and recharge electrics. If you're on a long journey, it's unfeasible to pay up to €40 a night every night - and campsites are not always open out of season anyway. 6. Be realistic about driving distances - and the odd luxury We travelled to Santander on the ferry, then drove through Spain and Portugal, caught the ferry to Morocco from Algeciras, and drove back through Spain, France and Italy. Everything takes longer than you expect, so don't over-extend yourself. We could drive about 300km with an early start, driving through the day and stopping off for a picnic en route. Find an interesting place to pitch up if you need an overnight stop: we stayed in a beautiful, remote spot next to Os Almendres, a stone circle near évora in Portugal, and by the Roman viaduct in Tarragona, Spain. For (very occasional) city breaks, leave the rig in a campsite and use public transport to travel into town, then stay in a hotel for the night. It's more relaxing and you'll appreciate the luxury. It's pricey though. 7. Stay in touch on the cheap Take a mobile and tell people to text rather than phone. Use a phone box if you're calling home (internet cafes aren't always available). Don't forget to take phrase books for any languages you're not familiar with - contrary to popular belief, not everyone speaks English. 8. Entertainment isn't about €50 theme parks Be creative: it's all around you, and often it's free. Some of our favourites were climbing mountains in Asturias, open-air discos with the car stereo on full blast, making films, reading, drawing, \"school trips\" to Roman remains (Conimbriga in Portugal is a revelation), visiting places with funny names, exploring and playing games. For the adults, cheap wine generally does the trick. 9. And another thing ... Don't overplan. Some of our best stops were pure serendipity. We met people on the ferry to Santander who invited us to stay in their village at the top of the Asturian mountains, and travellers in Tarifa, Spain, who gave us invaluable advice on where to stay in Morocco. Make a video diary. Don't get bogged down by the hardships. And don't drive home after your first row."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"environment/2007/oct/24/renewableenergy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2007-10-24T00:33:26Z","webTitle":"Minister confirms retreat from 20% renewable energy target","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/oct/24/renewableenergy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2007/oct/24/renewableenergy","fields":{"headline":"Minister confirms retreat from 20% renewable energy target","bodyText":"The government signalled last night that it is pulling back from its aspiration to source 20% of Britain's energy supply from renewables by 2020. Malcolm Wicks, the energy minister, said Britain would source up to 15% of its power from renewables by 2020, but that did not mean it was backing away from the EU-wide target of 20% by the same date. The targets were announced after the Guardian reported yesterday that ministers were planning to water down climate change pledges and were seeking lower renewables targets before binding commitments are framed in December. Mr Wicks said yesterday that the Brussels deal did not specify that all EU members had to meet the 20% level, as long as it was achieved across Europe as a whole. \"We're negotiating with the European commission, but it's got to be a considerable figure,\" he told BBC's Newsnight. \"It's got to be somewhere between 10% and 15%.\" He also said Britain was contributing to the fight against climate change in other areas. \"At the end of the day, renewables is a means to an end. The end is bringing down carbon emissions,\" he said. Leaked briefing documents prepared for Gordon Brown by John Hutton, the secretary of state for business, and obtained by the Guardian, revealed that the target Tony Blair had signed up to earlier this year (for 20% of all European energy to come from renewable sources by 2020) was expensive and came encumbered with \"severe practical difficulties\". The documents also said Mr Hutton would tell Mr Brown that Britain should work with governments that were sceptical about climate change to persuade them to set lower renewable targets. Mr Blair not only signed Britain up to the EU deal, but also made it an \"aspiration\" that Britain should achieve a mix of renewable energy sources equivalent to 20% of Britain's energy needs by 2020. Yet wind power in the UK lags well behind Europe's frontrunners, while marine energy is still in its infancy. The leaked report estimated that increasing wind, wave and solar energy from the current UK level of 2% to just 9% by 2020 would cost around £4bn. Environmental campaigners have said they are concerned that the potential shift in government policy will mean Mr Brown will surrender any claim to international leadership on climate change."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2007/nov/29/research1","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2007-11-29T11:56:15Z","webTitle":"How solar power could become organic - and cheap","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2007/nov/29/research1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2007/nov/29/research1","fields":{"headline":"How solar power could become organic - and cheap","bodyText":"Physicist Neil Greenham of Cambridge University's Cavendish Laboratory likes turning a good idea on its head. His PhD involved researching polymer light emitting diodes, since used for displays in some televisions, MP3 players and mobile phones. But then he joined a research group trying to use similar polymers to generate electricity from light. Now, more than a decade of pioneering work has resulted in an organic solar cell that doesn't use expensive silicon. Conventional photovoltaic (PV) solar cells are made from a thin slice (around 200 microns) of silicon that is doped with chemicals to form a bilayer structure called a p-n junction. When photons of light are absorbed by the silicon, electrons flow, creating a small electric current. An organic solar cell takes a similar approach but uses an ultra-thin (100 nanometre) film mixture of two semiconducting polymers instead. The prototype organic solar cell - the size of Greenham's hand - produces enough power to run an electronic calculator. The idea of a purple-coloured polymer as a conductor seems odd when plastics are normally considered excellent insulators. But mounted on glass, this solar cell uses the same class of materials as the polymer light-emitting diodes: long-chain plastics with double bonds which permit electron flow. \"My interest is in understanding how these things work from a physics point of view. The fact they may turn out to be helpful to the environment is certainly a bonus,\" Greenham says. Taking the organic solar cell from laboratory to rooftop is a trade off between efficiency and cost. Greenham says the world record for silicon solar cell efficiency - the conversion of light energy to electricity - is more than 40%, but standard cells are between 10% and 15%. While organic cells fall well short of that, they're much cheaper to make. Will the prototype organic solar cell really deliver? \"It's less efficient than the solar cells you might have in your calculator by a factor of three or four,\" Greeham says. \"But we know how to make it 5% efficient.\" Greenham is now working on a £5m project funded by the Carbon Trust to deliver solar energy at radically lower cost. Led by the University of Cambridge's Cavendish Laboratory with The Technology Partnership, there's a huge target: deploy more than one gigawatt of organic PV by 2017 to make carbon dioxide savings of more than 1m tonnes per year. Just to add to this challenge, the scientists want to \"print\" solar cells with an ultra-thin mix of two semiconducting polymers on a flexible plastic backing up to one metre wide. Unlike high-energy silicon manufacture, this will be a cheap low-temperature process for a small carbon footprint. \"The first type of products might be solar cells in consumer electronics, maybe built into the top of your PDA, laptop or iPod,\" Greenham says. \"But we'd like to get something that's going to generate some useful power and make a bit of an impact.\" Is organic solar likely to replace silicon, then? Even though the more efficient silicon has an obvious cost penalty, Greenham doesn't think so: \"There's going to have to be a lot more PV of all kinds. We want to make it cheap enough to really expand the market.\" That view is shared by Professor Paul O'Brien at the University of Manchester. He's been involved with solar cells for more than 20 years, especially those that don't use silicon. \"Silicon is made in a foundry and the technology is the same as we use to make silicon chips. That, of course, is far too expensive,\" says O'Brien, who reckons that solar cells need be no more pricey than high-performance self-cleaning glass. \"Get the cost down, and the whole thing becomes viable.\" Led by O'Brien and Professor Jenny Nelson at Imperial College London, a £1.5m Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council project is trying to do just that. Its target is a mass-produced hybrid solar cell with energy conversion efficiencies approaching 10%. The first laboratory prototype will be assembled next year. \"We're very interested in solar cells where we take an organic layer that's printable or sprayable containing an inorganic material like lead sulphide which will actually do the photon capture,\" O'Brien says. Photons knock out loose electrons, which then flow through the cell to produce electricity. Lead sulphide (PbS) adds a new twist to silicon-free solar cells by using nanotechnology. The lead sulphide will be in the form of nanorods, 100 or so nanometres long and 20 by 20 nanometres in section. (One micron is 1,000nm.) When photons hit the rods distributed within a semiconducting polymer, electrons are released. Researchers also plan to use equally small \"quantum dots\" to achieve the same photovoltaic effect. \"The big driver for me is always cost reduction, not efficiency,\" O'Brien says. Despite falling short of silicon's efficiency, the benefit will be huge cost reductions. If all goes well, O'Brien reckons the new solar cell technology may be one hundredth of the cost of a silicon cell when in mass production - promising a solar energy revolution. \"The world needs to look at alternatives to fossil fuels,\" O'Brien says. The idea of solar cell research at UK universities delivering electricity as cheaply as fossil fuels do today is exciting. But waiting around for the science to become technology isn't an option, says Martyn Williams, senior parliamentary campaigner at Friends of the Earth. \"We are aware of moves to find new ways to generate electricity from solar power. We have to move faster than that because every tonne of carbon we pump out is adding to the problem.\" Six years ago, he installed solar PV on his Victorian terraced house when it needed a new roof. \"It produced about £250 of electricity a year,\" says Williams, who received a £10,000 (50%) grant from the government. Over the seasons, the silicon-based panels have provided 75% of his household's electricity needs, with any surplus sold back to the national grid. However, even allowing for the new roof, he calculated his payback period at 20 years. Williams has since moved home - leaving the PV panels behind - and installed \"fantastically efficient\" solar thermal panels to heat water with a payback time of five to eight years. Modest grants for householder projects involving renewable energy are periodically available from the government's Low Carbon Buildings Programme. For example, the maximum grant for solar PV or thermal is now £2,500. \"Government grants have proved completely inadequate for demand. The whole purpose of them - to stimulate the setting up of a new industry of solar fitters - has also been seriously hampered by the stop-start nature,\" says Williams, who prefers an innovative German scheme which guarantees payments for surplus electricity exported to the grid. \"Germany has been far more successful. They are streets ahead of us in delivering solar roofs, and it would be good if ministers had a serious look at which policy has worked best.\" Powering up the numbers £5m: The amount of funding that the project has received from the Carbon Trust 2017: The year by which the team aims to deploy more than 1GW of organic PV 40%: The amount of light energy converted to electricity using silicon solar cells"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2008/sep/27/top100skibreaks.green","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2008-09-26T23:01:00Z","webTitle":"Snow surfing the green way","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2008/sep/27/top100skibreaks.green","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2008/sep/27/top100skibreaks.green","fields":{"headline":"Norse play","bodyText":"It started when we were searching for an old cat basket in the in-laws' garden shed. There, among all the discarded furniture and boxes of dusty school books, Maddy found a 20-year-old cache of skis, suits, gloves and goggles. Naturally we forgot about the cat basket and concentrated on dressing up, with results that looked like a Duran Duran photo-shoot from the early 1980s. \"It's a shame,\" said Simon Le Bon (aka Sophie), resplendent in an electric green and shocking pink one-piece. \"Being green means we can't go skiing any more.\" \"Nonsense,\" I said, with the kind of confidence that is based on lack of information. \"We could hire a remote cabin in the mountains, take a few huskies and a sled. It'd be totally green. Imagine - log fires, igloos, snowball fights ... \" \" ... The howl of the wolf pack closing in,\" Sophie added unhelpfully. \"Then the helicopter rescue.\" A few days later I had managed to prove that my vision was rather difficult to set up. Any hope of living like an Inuit family was given a hefty dose of reality by reading Gretel Ehrlich's chilling accounts of Greenland expeditions during the 1990s. Somehow having your eyeballs frozen to your eyelids and a raw seal blubber supper didn't sound like family fun. The Norwegian Tourist Board, however, knew of an area in the new Hallingskarvet national park where green policies were being encouraged: they even took their ski lift out of service in 2007. On top of that the only access to the lodge, known as Finse 1222, was by train. \"Norwegian families ski between lodges,\" they explained. \"But if you're beginners to cross-country, maybe you should base yourselves at Finse and explore the area.\" Perfect. Flying in via Oslo or Bergen, the two ends of the railway line, would have been easier, but we did the honourable thing and booked the ferry from North Shields (sadly now discontinued - see below). At Bergen we acclimatised. \"£40 for a bottle of wine! £3 for a tiny croissant!\" (To halve the cost of a Norwegian holiday, take any alcohol with you.) Then we caught the train up into the mountains. Snow fell, crags loomed, pine forests huddled together and finally disappeared. We had reached the high plateau. \"In summer,\" a cheery fellow passenger told us, \"we do mountain biking up here and it's all alpine meadows and sunshine.\" He smiled at the happy memories. \"In winter it is very different. They say it is the closest thing to experiencing Antarctica - Ja!\" Sophie frowned. I had omitted to tell her that bit before we set out - the bit about Scott of the Antarctic and his men training at Finse before their doomed mission. I murmured something about modern equipment changing everything. \"What modern equipment?\" she hissed. \"We haven't got any. I'm bloody freezing!\" Finse Hotel is something of a Norwegian icon: opened in 1909 when the railway made it to the top of the plateau, it has seen all the great polar explorers. Amundsen and Shackleton both used it, as did Scott's team who were honoured with a monument on the railway station platform. Rather worryingly the monument was buried under snow when we arrived, but fortunately the short path to the hotel was easily negotiated. Andreas, the manager, was full of enthusiasm and optimism. \"We'll get you kitted out and you can start skiing immediately.\" Through the large picture windows, I could see people whizzing across a snowy plain, some pulled by kites. \"That's a lake in summer,\" explained Andreas. He gestured to the left where the snow rose up to a second mountain lodge. \"You could ski there for coffee.\" I remember standing at the top of the first gentle decline that led down to the frozen snow-covered lake. Norwegian octogenarians were whizzing past, lighting their pipes while chatting to nonagenarian friends. It was like a scene from Brueghel. I pushed my poles in hard and set off. A few seconds later I was in a shivering heap on the lake. It was like a scene from Touching the Void. Cross-country skis are too narrow, and forward movement is afforded by the subtle manipulation of muscles that I don't seem to have. Sophie did rather better than me. Maddy (5) and Niall (12) were the best. An hour later, when we had covered the 200m to the second lodge, we gave up and played igloo-building. The Norwegian attitude to skiing, I have to say, is far simpler than other nations. And with the easygoing nature of it comes a refreshing lack of paraphernalia, at Finse at least. No lifts or concrete silos housing machinery, no bars or nightclubs - it is pretty light-footed on the Earth. Unlike our group, of course, whose footprints were deep and numerous. Being an incompetent Brit in the swanky resorts of Switzerland or France can be intimidating for the uninitiated, but Norway is a lot less stressful. People were simply bemused by our ineptitude, treating us as victims of some bizarre syndrome that meant we could not stand up for more than a minute. \"With skiing, falling over is an acceptable means of stopping,\" said Hans, a 70-year-old from Oslo who was staying with us at Finse. We responded by doing what our doughty nation does best in snow: sledging, snowball fighting and digging holes. In the evenings the après-ski was the sauna or a game of Scrabble. Finse is a convivial sort of place with a fine old dining room and an excellent heating system that even warmed up Sophie. Maddy found company with two small boys from Yorkshire and spent her time wrestling on the floor. A group of 100 nurses from Bergen hospital ate all the reindeer steaks, went outside to smoke in blizzards and then partied all night in the sauna. \"With drinking,\" explained Hans, \"falling over is an acceptable means of stopping.\" By the final day, we had scraped together sufficient competence for Niall and me to attempt a real cross-country expedition to \"Orange Hut\". We crossed the frozen lake easily enough, but then we had to scale the mountain on the far side. This was where they filmed the ice planet scenes in The Empire Strikes Back, a disorienting frozen wilderness of ever-changing conditions. Soon we began to understand why Scott had sent his team here: every few yards brought a new challenge of soft snow, hard blue ice or sudden dips and fractures. A pair of men passed us without a greeting. I felt like shouting after them, \"Didn't I sit next to you naked in the sauna last night?\" When the wind picked up, the normal markers of distance disappeared and all that was left was a flimsy line of twigs - our route. We reached the top and decided to turn back. Our own South Pole would have to wait. By the time we reached the lake, I was shattered and fell over at the slightest bump. Marie, one of the Bergen nurses, helped me up. \"Is that your wife?\" she asked, pointing to an electric green and shocking pink figure, waving at us from the top of the slope. \"What amazing outfits you all have! Are the 1980s back in fashion?\" It was something of a relief to finish our first, and strenuous, attempt at green skiing, but Norway had a last triumphant card to play. From Finse we took the train to the next village, Myrdal, and then caught the 20km-long Flåm mountain railway to the Sognefjord. This stunning marvel of engineering takes you down through 865m of gorges, ravines and mountain precipices, stopping to admire a frozen waterfall or pick up a local farmer. After an excellent lunch in the Fretheim Hotel - a favourite salmon fishing haunt of 19th-century English aristocrats - we boarded the ferry and sailed down the fjord towards Bergen. The scenery was marvellous, food was good and people friendly, but what I really enjoyed about that wonderful coda to our trip was the simple things in life: like not falling over, and not being in Duran Duran any more. • Finse by ferry and rail is an epic journey: sail Harwich-Esburg (20hrs), then take the train to Copenhagen, then sail Copenhagen-Oslo (16hrs30mins).

I will let stars form and explode, and planets move in their orbits, and I will have people create great cities, and there will be battles that destroy those cities, and then I'll let the survivors create new civilisations. There will be fires and horses and oxen pulling carts; there will be coal and steam engines and factories and even mighty locomotives and iPhones. \"Yet throughout the whole sequence, even though the types of energy that people see will change, even though sometimes the energy will appear as the heat of human or animal muscle, and sometimes it will appear as the gushing of waterfalls or the explosions of volcanoes; despite all those variations, the total amount of energy will remain the same. The amount I create at the beginning will not change. There will not be one millionth part less than what was there at the start.\" Expressed like this, it sounds the sheerest mumbo jumbo, like something Yoda would mysteriously speak in Star Wars; or like the popular superstitions that would drive Richard Dawkins into an apoplexy. What's extraordinary, though, is that it's true (although the God part is contestable). When you swing closed a cupboard door, even if it's in the stillness of your home at night, energy will appear in the gliding movement of the door, but exactly that much energy is removed from your muscles. When the cupboard door finally closes, the energy of its movement won't disappear, but will simply be relocated to the shuddering bump of the door against the cupboard, and to the heat produced by the grinding friction of the hinge. If you had to dig your feet slightly against the floor to keep from slipping when closing the door, the earth will shift in its orbit and rebound upward by exactly the amount needed to balance that. This was only first fully recognised in the Victorian era of the industrial revolution, when steam engines showed it happening all the time. Measure the chemical energy in a big stack of unburned coal, then ignite it in a train's boiler and measure the energy of the roaring fire and the racing locomotive. Energy has clearly changed its forms; the systems look very different, but the total is precisely the same. Later in the Victorian era, when Darwin had proven that God wasn't needed to create the living species on our planet, this vision of an unchanging total energy was often felt to be a satisfactory alternative, a proof that the hand of God really had touched our world. Since then, researchers have found that it's not quite as absolute as at first believed. Stars and a few other objects can be places where fresh energy gushes forth into our universe (though in such cases, a balancing amount of mass usually disappears). Down on earth though, we're reduced to simply trying to stir it around. Which has not been without its consequences. For millennia, humans had been limited in what they could do by the power of the sugars in their muscles, or the similarly stored sugars in working animals. Simple wind and water power helped a bit; by the time Durham Cathedral was built, waterwheels could sometimes match the output of 60 or 70 men. But only when much denser forms of energy were accessed could more complex civilisations really get started. Or rather, civilisations sometimes were complex before, but they depended on hundreds of thousands or millions of peasants working as near-slaves to create enough excess for a small number of scribes, priests, warriors, and bronze age Paris Hiltons to live in even moderate ease. To have a large democracy at a comfort level we would appreciate, something more than freshly created muscle sugars had to be used for fuel. The first solution was to hunt for more concentrated sources of these sugars. Trees are good, since they accumulate modified sugars over many years, storing that chemical energy in the wood of their trunks, and never erupting with proto-Marxist grievances when dragged away to be exploited. Charcoal is even better, for it's denser and easier to transport (and burns more cleanly). Yet even aside from the problem that forests are easily cut to oblivion - as much of England's was by late medieval times - there's a more ingenious place to hunt. A tree holds stored energy that was built up from a few decades, or at most a few centuries, of incoming sunlight. But coal or oil? Those come from several hundred million years of stored sunlight, locked away in deceased forests or microbes. It's a very, very large bank to draw from. The British empire didn't just draw from the labour of several continents. It used the accumulated energy from those past millions of years of fossil fuels, too. Once mines and wells were in place, a tremendous amount of work could be done with a minimum amount of bicep flexing, using this ancient solar energy, transformed once more. But not all fuels are created equal. A powerful pattern began to emerge, for certain fuels are far denser in energy than others. Toss a scrap of paper on a stove's lit flame, and it'll just singe or burn slowly; toss a thimbleful of petrol, and it explodes. The key factor is the ratio of hydrogen to carbon in a fuel. The main fuels used in history form a nearly exact sequence, from ones having less hydrogen to ones having more. Wood and charcoal were the earliest fuels, and have only a little hydrogen. Much of their burning is wasted in pouring out great gusts of carbon, which was needed to build up the tree from which the wood came, but doesn't do much for the user burning that wood. Coal has more hydrogen, and its burning can be cleaner. Oil - which dominated next - has yet more hydrogen per unit of carbon; natural gas has even more, and its burning is the cleanest and most efficient of them all. The trend line points pretty strongly to a pure hydrogen economy - but when that will occur is in the hands not of the scientists, but our wise political masters. ·David Bodanis is the author of E=mc2 and Electric Universe.

Cowering in the basement below their house, Alanna Goodman and her parents knew their roof had just been ripped off. The shrieking winds eventually died and when the Goodmans finally emerged it was to a scene of utter devastation and death in Greensburg, Kansas. The vast twister had wiped it off the map. \"You could not see anything. It was all just ruins,\" Goodman said. The tornado last May killed 11 Greensburg residents, injured more than 60 and levelled 95 percent of the city, reducing houses to matchsticks and sturdy brick churches to piles of rubble. In an area of rural depopulation and few jobs, where towns struggle in the best of times, it seemed nature had delivered Greensburg a death blow. That was almost a year ago. Now Greensburg is not only being rebuilt but it aims to become one of the most environmentally sensitive cities in America. In a groundbreaking scheme the town's residents are trying to make sure each new house and city building is as green as possible. Now the usual rural Kansas talk of cattle and corn has been replaced by solar panels, geothermal energy and which type of insulation keeps out the winter cold the best. The scheme has won support from government agencies and environmental charities. It is even being covered by the Discovery Channel who will produce a TV series about the town's transformation from rural backwater to cutting edge mecca for green activists. The show has got star backing too; from movie star Leonardo diCaprio, who campaigns on green issues and will be the series' producer. On the ruins left by the tornado, Greensburg's residents now aim to build a model town for environmentalists across the globe. 'We are talking about a model green community for the world. And we want the world to visit. We could end up having ecotourism here,' said Daniel Wallach, a local businessman who formed the Greensburg GreenTown organisation to co-ordinate the effort. The plans are ambitious. Twelve different types of environmentally sensitive homes are being pitched to residents, who currently mostly live in mobile homes donated by the disaster management agency FEMA. The new homes will be up to 50% more energy efficient than their old houses. The city council plans has also vowed that all public buildings will be built to the highest environmental standards, the so-called 'platinum' rating of the US Green Building Council. No other city in America has ever tried such an ambitious scheme. Business is behind it too, setting up environmentally-friendly buildings decked out with solar panels, thermal insulation and other green technology. Just how far the city is willing to go is shown by the plans on display in Greensburg's temporary City Hall, currently a complex of temporary trailers. But the architectural blueprints for a new city hall and a town museum show plans for geothermal heat pumps, rainwater collection systems, solar energy cells and 'living walls' decked out with plants and grasses. City officials know that the task ahead of them is large, especially with getting funding, but they see being green as central to Greensburg's reconstruction. \"It might take another five years but we'll do it,\" said Kim Alderfer, Greensburg city recovery co-ordinator. The irony, of course, is that Greenburg needed the tornado to wipe it out before such a scheme could even be attempted. The tornado was an F5, the most powerful kind of twister. It boasted winds of 300 mph and was perhaps two miles wide. On May 4, 2007, it literally swallowed the town whole, destroying everything in its path and leaving 10 million cubic feet of debris. That devastation is still evident. Greensburg is still flattened, its streets dotted with concrete slabs where homes and businesses once stood. Tree stumps shorn of all their branches dot the landscape, which still looks like the aftermath of a war zone or bomb site. But the scale of devastation also provided a blank slate on which to experiment. Now teams of workmen toil all over town and a handful of buildings have already been fully rebuilt: almost all of them to stringent new ecological standards. One of them is the furniture warehouse of Wylan Fleener, whose family has been in Greensburg for five generations. Fleener is an enthusiastic convert to the town's new green identity. \"I used to be thinking about leaving 10 or 20 times a day right after the tornado. But not now,\" he said. Next month he will start building his own new home. \"I was thinking about geothermal energy but now I am leaning towards solar,\" he wondered. In some ways a green town emerging in the heartland of Kansas is an anomaly. The region is deeply conservative. City officials admit that they had initial trouble persuading people to get on board with ideas often derided as \"tree hugging\". But once they were persuaded that initial expenses for rebuilding would be quickly repaid by much lower heating and utility costs, the idea took off. \"It was a little difficult at first. But you just have to talk in terms local people appreciate. These are conservative people so you talk about conserving energy, conserving money. People get it,\" said Wallach. One person who took little convincing was Goodman. Her family had moved to Greensburg from Las Vegas, seeking the quiet life. When the tornado destroyed her family's home and businesses, she feared they would have to leave. \"I thought it would be just rebuilt quickly and cheaply. I did not want to live in a town of cheap metal houses,\" she said. Now, standing next to the pile of rubble that is all that is left of her own vintage clothing business, she is watching Greensburg emerge from the ruins as an ecological trendsetter. \"I always wanted to live in a green town. But I did not think it would take a tornado to do it. I guess you have to be careful of what you wish for,\" she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2008/nov/19/global-climate-change-policy-obama","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2008-11-19T00:01:00Z","webTitle":"Ian McEwan on what Obama's election means for the environment","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/nov/19/global-climate-change-policy-obama","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2008/nov/19/global-climate-change-policy-obama","fields":{"headline":"The world's last chance","bodyText":"'I refute it thus!\" was Samuel Johnson's famous, beefy riposte one morning after church in 1763. As he spoke, according to his friend James Boswell, he kicked \"with mighty force\" a large stone \"till he rebounded from it\". The good doctor was contesting Bishop Berkeley's philosophical idealism, the view that the external, physical world does not exist and is the product of the mind. It was never much of a disproof, but we can sympathise with its sturdy common sense and physical display of Anglo-Saxon, if not Anglican, pragmatism. Still, we may have proved Berkeley partially correct; in an age of electronic media, where rumour, opinion and fact are tightly interleaved, and where politicians must sing to compete for our love, public affairs have the quality of a waking dream, a collective solipsism whose precise connection to the world of kickable stones is obscure, though we are certain that it exists. The contest for the US presidency, like all elections, had the self-enclosed quality of a squash game, a chess match, a postmodern novel - and this one was far better than most. While the candidates appeared to address an external reality, they were bound by strictly ethereal requirements: to cast spells on large crowds while seeming ordinary, to trample their opponent into oblivion while seeming pleasant, to be inspirational yet sensible, to avoid offending a score of sensitive constituencies, and, an old wizard's touch, to promise the electorate various gifts without further borrowing or raising taxes. And to win. As Barack Obama steps forward, the smoke machines and mirrors are packed away - or perhaps we can never, or should never, let them go. To those who believe that climate change in the context of global poverty is our most pressing problem, underpinning all others, requiring degrees of cooperation and rationality we might not even be capable of, the elevation of this slender, handsome man becomes the object of unreal expectation. Inevitably, after a long campaign of crowd pleasing, the question hangs in the air: is he merely the expert coiner of a stirring speech, or does he have the steel to turn intentions into results? At the very least, America finally has a president who, whatever his profession of faith, has a high regard for science (look at his sturdy views on intelligent design in Nature magazine of September 25) and has surrounded himself with scientific advisers of impeccable quality, and committed himself to the dreamy target of an 80% reduction below 1990 levels of CO2 emissions by 2050. The issue of climate change is itself another near-virtual reality. Ever since 1979, when James Hansen's Ad Hoc Group on CO2 reported to President Carter, there have been symposia, denials, summits, documentaries, marches, legislation, trading schemes and, above all, resounding speeches high on ambition - in Europe we rather excel at these. However, on the all-too-kickable stone we call the Earth, where results from thousands of measurements in oceans and on land masses are mapped against satellite data, the mean temperature has continued to rise. In 2006, and even more in 2007, the shrinking of the summer ice in the Arctic exceeded the gloomiest predictions. Data for the past year, during an economic downturn, show CO2 levels rising as fast as ever. It is doubtful whether there is yet a single recorded instance of a carbon-producing power station taken out of commission to make way for a clean energy installation. The burning forests, the dissolving coral reefs, the extinction of species - we have numbed ourselves with these familiar litanies. During the past 30 years we have dealt with the issue, if at all, only in our minds. There are, of course, first signs of a new clean energy infrastructure - along certain stretches of the Danish coastline, on some German and Japanese rooftops, in certain deserts - but the effect so far is miniscule. We are still dreaming, still murmuring in our sleep as we grope for the levers that connect thoughts to actions. Domestically, Obama will have a number of factors on his side, beyond good working majorities in both houses. There is at least agreement that there is a problem - anthropogenic climate change is a fact, an American fact. Doing nothing is simply too expensive. A good part of the Republican party accepts this, as do major corporations, and even oil companies. The deniers are, or should be, folding their tents - and what was to deny? A molecule of CO2 absorbs the longer wave length of light, trapping radiant heat from the earth. More CO2, more trapped warmth. If temperatures drift much beyond 2C above pre-industrial levels, the human and economic consequences could be catastrophic. Americans have already seen what happens when a warmer Atlantic Ocean lends its energy to the hurricane season. Thus the matter is passing from virtue, from idealism and sombre invitations to self-denial, which government, markets and the electorate distrust, to self-interest and necessity, for which they all have respect. Oil production will soon decline, and alternatives must be found anyway; many oil-producing countries are grisly human constructs on which no one wants to depend; if the US does not invest in green technologies now, it will have to buy them later from its competitors; Germany has created a quarter of a million jobs in renewable energy; it is beginning to be apparent that there is a vast amount of money to be made retooling and supplying a whole civilisation with new energy sources. The technologies are developing at speed, but the basic ideas have a simple allure. Consider just one form of solar energy. An alien landing on our planet and noticing how it was bathed in light would be amazed to learn that we believe ourselves to have an energy problem, that we ever should have thought of overheating or poisoning ourselves by burning fossil fuels or generating plutonium. Sunlight falls on us in a constant stream, a sweet rain of photons beyond counting. On average, by Nasa's calculation, 200 watts for every square metre of the Earth's surface. A single photon striking a semi-conductor releases an electron, and so electricity is born, right out of sunbeams. These are the photovoltaics that Einstein described and for which he won a Nobel prize. If you believed in God, you might say this free energy was his greatest gift. Let there be light! If you did not, you might wonder at how auspicious the laws of physics are. As is often pointed out, less than an hour's worth of all the sunlight falling on the Earth would satisfy the whole world's needs for a year. A fraction of our hot deserts could power our civilisation. Millions of acres in the American south-western deserts have already been identified for suitable sites. Installations are beginning to appear, some of them funded by European companies taking advantage of state tax-breaks. In private and public labs, new technologies are being invented. How can a solar or wind plant generate power by night? Daniel Nocera at MIT has imitated photosynthesis to crack water efficiently into hydrogen and oxygen; at night these gases are recombined in a fuel cell to drive a turbine. In other labs, the race is on for that industrial golden egg, a cheaper, lighter, more powerful battery for use in electric cars; nanotechnology is being used to derive two electrons from one photon; thin film solar panels are already in production; other labs are working on solar paints. The lines of inquiry are proliferating by the thousands. That resourceful Californian generation that made its fortune refining the internet is beginning to relive its youth in clean energy. The whole sector is like a coiled spring, waiting to unleash its full force into the economy. In other words, Obama assumes power at a time when renewable energy has ceased to be a marginal pursuit. The hour may have summoned the man, but this happens to be a particularly difficult hour. In Berkeleyan mode, we have entered a global recession because we always thought we would. The fictional head of a snake has begun to devour its actually existing tail - a circularity the great Argentinean fabulist, Jorge Luis Borges, would have appreciated. We dreamed of this recession, we saw it coming and we made it so. Meanwhile, in the Johnsonian \"real\" economy, factories, distribution systems, human inventiveness, the will to work, the need for goods and services are much as they were last year - except, as certainty of the recession tightens, people fear more and spend less, corporations begin to make redundancies, and so the recession is locked in. Beyond that, the problems are solvable, but they are formidable too. The departing president has been energetically pulling levers in the real world, facilitating coal-fired power plants, opening up federally owned wilderness to oil and gas drilling and encouraging the commercial exploitation of oil shale. This will all have to be reversed by President Obama. Solar- and wind-generating plants are often far from cities; as in Europe, a new direct current grid is needed; the old is chaotically devolved to state level. The costs will be enormous, the benefits will not be immediately obvious to many consumers, and the US government has colossal debts. Coal remains a crucial energy source in the States, but \"clean\" coal is still a fantasy, and piping CO2 to the appropriate geological sites and pumping it underground is expensive. Oil interests will not be happy with their loss of supremacy and ancient privileges, or with contemplating a cap and trade scheme during a recession. Acceptable electric vehicles are still a good way off. And beyond the administrative and technological problems, there are the usual obstacles. It is not only Harold Macmillan's \"events, dear boy, events\" that can blow a thoughtful politician off course. There are half a dozen other pressing domestic and international concerns, then - mistakes, enemies, political process, the fumblings or ambitious scheming of lieutenants, the fading novelty of a new presidential face. And above all, undue caution. Within the climate science community there is a faction darkly murmuring that it is already too late. The more widely held view is hardly more reassuring: we have less than eight years to start making a significant impact on CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions, eight years to move from Berkeley's solipsism to Johnson's pragmatism. Thereafter, as tipping points are reached, as feedback loops strengthen, the emissions curve will rise too quickly for us to restrain it. In the words of John Schellnhuber, one of Europe's leading climate scientists and chief scientific adviser to Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, \"what is required is an industrial revolution for sustainability, starting now\". To be effective, this is only possible at the level of international cooperation - far more difficult to achieve than any technological breakthrough. There is a rendezvous next year in Copenhagen in late November which the entire world of climate expertise is preparing itself for and which is considered by many in the field to be our best and possibly last hope of addressing the problem before it runs away from us. It is the global successor to Kyoto, known in the trade as COP (Conference of Parties) 15. There is a case to be made that it will be one of the most important international meetings ever convened. If it does not result in practical, radical measures, the fight to control our future could well be lost. Every nation on the planet will be represented. The general feeling is that the conference cannot be allowed to fail. And it cannot succeed without the leadership of the United States. There are fears that Obama will move too cautiously on climate change for political reasons, and that would be a tragic error. Schellnhuber says, \"If he were prepared to come in person to Copenhagen and make a speech, a bold commitment, similar to what Reagan did in Reykjavik, he would become a hero of the planet, for good.\" And so the mechanisms of the unreal, the smoke and mirrors, might have to come to the aid of our actually existing, overheating world. The process that let us believe we were dealing with climate change when we were doing nothing at all, or let us think our way into a recession - these emanations of collective and collusive dreaming can have their positive side. Obama may succeed in tipping the nations toward a low-carbon future simply because people think he can. Scientists, whose stock-in-trade is scepticism, and conference-weary diplomats, along with millions around the world are attributing to him something like unearthly powers. He is invested with more symbolism - of renewal, of rationality - than his slight frame can bear. But having persuaded everybody else, he may be doubly persuaded himself. This aura will be his empowerment, as numinous as good luck, as permanent as spring snow. He has to move decisively. There were those who said during the campaign that Obama turned a fine speech, empty of intent, that he was, as they say in Texas, all hat and no cattle. He must confound his detractors and start the detailed, practical preparation for Copenhagen, and refute them thus! © Ian McEwan"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2008/may/18/green.yorkshire","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2008-05-18T16:35:30Z","webTitle":"Could Straw Bale Cabin be Britain's most eco-friendly holiday cottage?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2008/may/18/green.yorkshire","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2008/may/18/green.yorkshire","fields":{"headline":"A haven - not just for little pigs","bodyText":"There are few assignments more pleasurable for a journalist than those given out by the travel editor. So when I was asked if I'd like to write for this section I enthusiastically said yes as visions of sipping cocktails on a Thai beach or diligently checking out the shopping opportunities in New York popped into my head. Then the editor followed her question with: 'Great. You come from East Yorkshire, don't you?' Readers not familiar with holidaying in the area can be forgiven. As fond as I am of it, East Yorkshire lacks the grandeur of the Yorkshire Dales to the west and the beauty of North Yorkshire's seaside resorts. In fact, if I'm honest, I couldn't think of a single reason why anyone would want to go there for a short break. I was heading to Howden, which is just off the motorway near Goole and not very far from Hull, to stay in the intriguingly named Straw Bale Cabin. The cabin is the labour of love of Carol Atkinson, a former accountant who turned her back on the profession to pursue an MSc in environmentally aware architecture. Her cabin was built both as a project on which to base her thesis and as a holiday home. In keeping with her eco credentials Carol encourages visitors to arrive by train at Howden, where she will collect them. However, as we set off on a drizzly Friday night from London we were, I'm ashamed to say, travelling up in 'the monster', a borrowed Mitsubishi Animal and a car my boyfriend pointed out was probably the least eco-friendly vehicle he had ever driven. Approximately £70 of diesel later, we were nearly at our destination when I called Carol to ask for directions to the local pub and a taxi number, as we had made it in time for last orders. She helped us out with the necessary information then texted: 'It's not too far to walk, or you could cycle. The bikes are in the passageway and the bike lights are in the cupboard under the sink.' We liked the idea but it was late and dark and we were hungry so we succumbed to the local cab firm. The cabin itself is tucked away in front of a lake behind Carol's farmhouse down a country lane just outside of Howden. It may be called Straw Bale Cabin, but as you approach there's not a stalk of the yellow stuff in sight. The cabin is built from bales of straw but it's plastered with lime render so from the outside looks like any other sweet little whitewashed cottage. Inside, it's amazingly warm even with no heating on and the rain lashing down outside. Apparently, the straw walls make it 10C warmer than a conventional mobile home. And the interior is just as cosy-looking as the exterior, with wooden floors and white-washed walls. The kitchen is basic but modern and there is one double bedroom. My boyfriend interrupted my happy exploration of the cabin by saying: 'You might want to look at the bathroom.' I did. It all looked very nice: clean, modern and white with all the bits you could need... The toilet, however, was not, it turned out, all that it seemed. I lifted the lid and saw nothing but a hole, at the bottom of which sat a pile of sawdust. Next to the seat was a box of more sawdust with instructions for how to use it and under what, er, circumstances. Suddenly this break seemed intimate in ways I never could have imagined. We set about exploring the local attractions over the next couple of days - trips into Hull, which is undergoing something of a renaissance, the market town of Beverley with its pretty tea rooms and antique shops, and an outstanding meal in the Pipe and Glass pub in South Dalton. But to my mind, it is holidaymakers who have a specific interest in eco-build and environment-friendly holidays who will want to visit, not tourists wanting a taste of Yorkshire. We met Carol on the day we were leaving and she ran through the cabin's impressive eco-credentials - features which, all credit to her, we had barely noticed as the cabin feels like any other cosy holiday home. Its energy is provided by a micro wind turbine and solar panels. Like most of the materials, the straw used to build the body of the house is local - in this case from a neighbouring farm. The only sign of it is in the tiny round, glass 'honesty window' - apparently integral to all straw-built homes - set in one wall of the sitting room allowing you to see the straw. Quirky touches include the beams in the lounge and the bedroom, which were made from the farm's old barn door, and the hanging rails in the wardrobe, which were salvaged from the old milking parlour. Carol is running courses on straw-bale construction and, from July, will offer instruction in lime and clay plastering. She is also working on her second eco-build project on the other side of the farmyard: a two-bedroom cottage that will be big enough to cater for families and, crucially, will be fully plumbed - including a flush toilet. · To rent the cabin for a week costs between £245 and £280, and for the weekend between £150 and £165 depending on the time of year.

It is the tidal bridge concept developed by Blue Energy Power Systems of Canada. It comprises vertical axis rotors between bridge supports. Each rotor produces a peak output of 10MW. According to its designers, a 1,000m run of rotors can generate the equivalent of a nuclear power station. The great contribution of the system to the present debate is that it preserves the integrity of the intertidal zones and is therefore much less of an ecological threat than a barrage. It also fulfils the secondary purpose of providing a road link. Being a modular system, it is economical to construct. The modules can be built onshore and floated into position - a technique developed for the Mulberry harbour in the second world war. This enterprise should be seen in the context, not only of climate change, but also of the energy crisis that will grow in intensity towards the middle of the century. Professor Peter Smith Nottingham Won't climate change have a dramatic impact on Severn estuary habitats anyway? It's hard to be a wading bird if the mud dries out in a heatwave or lies under a few extra feet of water. And I don't know much about these \"lagoon\" alternatives, but they don't seem to be mutually exclusive. Can't we build them and the barrage? The objection that construction will necessitate greenhouse emissions is absurd. It is being built precisely to provide a clean energy source for future construction projects. We don't cancel vaccination programs just because injections hurt. Dr Mark Lewney Cardiff A conventional concrete barrage, as presumably envisaged by Jonathan Porritt, would certainly have an adverse effect on wildlife in the estuary, but a floating barrier that allowed the free flow of silt, fish and other forms of marine life at all times would not. This type of barrier, known as a hydraulic ram barrier, is described on the Cheshire Innovation website. Bill Courtney Cheshire Innovation The goal of reducing carbon emissions can only realistically be achieved in the short term by reducing our energy consumption. If the government has £15bn of our money or more to invest, then a simpler, less enviromentally damaging and quicker option would be to provide - free of charge - solar energy systems and building insulation to between 6m and 10m houses. Oh and yes, they could start in South Wales and the south-west of England, in the areas, whose environment the government seems prepared to blight.

The pace of advances in technology means the rate of progress will be 30 times faster in the next half century, futurologists believe - and that opens up the prospect of innovation in many fields. Better understanding of our genes could lead to more personalised medicines and longer, healthier lives; communication technology should get faster and cheaper; and we will hopefully find more sustainable ways of living in our environment. The 18-stong team of scientists, entrepreneurs and thinkers was convened by the US National Academy of Engineering (NAE) to identify problems for technology in the 21st century that, if solved, would change the world. The group included biologist Craig Venter, inventor Dean Kamen, Google co-founder Larry Page and Harvard University professor of international development Calestous Juma. The experts presented their report and list of challenges yesterday at the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) annual meeting in Boston. The NAE group focused on four areas for their engineering grand challenges: sustainability, health, vulnerability, and joy of living. \"As the population grows and its needs and desires expand, the problem of sustaining civilisation's continuing advancement, while still improving the quality of life, looms more immediate,\" they wrote in their report. \"Old and new threats to personal and public health demand more effective and more readily available treatments. Vulnerabilities to pandemic diseases, terrorist violence, and natural disasters require serious searches for new methods of protection and prevention.\" The provision of clean energy was a priority. They identified sunshine as a \"tantalizing source of environmentally friendly power, bathing the Earth with more energy each hour than the planet's population consumes in a year\". But capturing that power, converting it into something useful and storing it poses a challenge. \"We only need to capture one part in 10,000 of the sunlight that falls on the Earth to meet 100% of our energy needs,\" futurologist Ray Kurzweil, a member of the NAE group, told the AAAS. \"This will become feasible with nanoengineered solar panels and nanoengineered fuel cells.\" Alongside clean energy comes clean water, which is in short supply. New technologies for desalinating sea water may be helpful, but small-scale technologies for local water purification may be even more effective for personal needs.\" Personalised medicines are another challenge. The recent sequencing of the human genome and a better understanding of how the body works offer scientists a way to identify the things that determine the health of an individual. \"An important way of exploiting such information would be the development of methods that allow doctors to forecast the benefits and side effects of potential treatments or cures,\" they wrote. Genetic technology allows scientists to switch off selected strands of DNA and new techniques in gene therapy enable them to modify the behaviour of genes. \"Within one to two decades, we will be in a position to stop and reverse the progression of disease and ageing, resulting in dramatic gains in health and longevity,\" said Kurzweil. The NAE report also hailed the potential of advanced computer intelligence that it said would enable automated diagnosis and prescriptions for treatment. Kurzweil went further on artificial intelligence. \"Once non-biological intelligence matches the range and subtlety of human intelligence, it will necessarily soar past it because of the continuing acceleration of information-based technologies, as well as the ability of machines to instantly share their knowledge.\" He added: \"Intelligent nanorobots will be deeply integrated in the environment, our bodies and our brains, providing vastly extended longevity, full-immersion virtual reality incorporating all of the senses ... and enhanced human intelligence.\" The experts said none of the challenges would be met without the economic and political will. \"Despite environmental regulations, cheaper polluting technologies often remain preferred over more expensive, clean technologies,\" they wrote. Goals: Improving the quality of life Make solar energy affordable Sunlight is a free energy source, but the ability to capture it is limited and expensive at present Provide energy from nuclear fusion Could supply a near limitless supply of energy using seawater as fuel Prevent nuclear terror Engineers must find ways to secure energy sources that might attract the attention of terrorist groups Engineer better medicines Personalised medicine would combine genetic information with clinical data to tailor drugs and doses to meet the needs of an individual patient Provide access to clean water About one in six people do not have adequate access to water Manage the nitrogen cycle Humans have doubled rate at which nitrogen is removed from the air relative to pre-industrial times, contributing to smog and acid rain, polluting drinking water, and worsening global warming Develop carbon sequestration Capturing carbon dioxide produced by burning fossil fuels and storing it could help tackle global warming Enhance virtual reality From psychiatry and education to entertainment, virtual reality is seen as a powerful tool for training experts and treating patients Restore/improve urban infrastructure Engineers need to find ways of keeping cities and services running and beautiful while preserving the environment Secure cyberspace Identity theft and computer viruses will disrupt an increasingly connected world.

It's not a guarantee; it's only an opportunity. The question facing us is, simply put, will we seize this opportunity for change? That's why I came here tonight: to tell you why I feel so strongly that we must seize this opportunity to elect Barack Obama president of the United States. Eight years ago, some said there was not much difference between the nominees of the two major parties and it didn't really matter who became president. Our nation was enjoying peace and prosperity. Some assumed we would continue both, no matter the outcome. But here we all are in 2008, and I doubt anyone would argue now that election didn't matter. Take it from me, if it had ended differently, we would not be bogged down in Iraq, we would have pursued bin Laden until we captured him. We would not be facing a self-inflicted economic crisis; we would be fighting for middle-income families. We would not be showing contempt for the Constitution; we'd be protecting the rights of every American regardless of race, religion, disability, gender or sexual orientation. And we would not be denying the climate crisis; we'd be solving it. Today, we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000, though it may be even more obvious now, because John McCain, a man who has earned our respect on many levels, is now openly endorsing the policies of the Bush-Cheney White House and promising to actually continue them. The same policies all over again? Hey, I believe in recycling, but that's ridiculous. With John McCain's support, President Bush and Vice-President Cheney have led our nation into one calamity after another because of their indifference to fact; their readiness to sacrifice the long term to the short term, subordinate the general good to the benefit of the few and short-circuit the rule of law. If you like the Bush-Cheney approach, John McCain's your man. If you want change, then vote for Barack Obama and Joe Biden. Barack Obama is telling us exactly what he will do: launch a bold new economic plan to restore America's greatness; fight for smarter government that trusts the market, but protects us against its excesses; enact policies that are pro-choice, pro-education and pro-family, establish a foreign policy that is smart as well as strong; provide healthcare for all and solutions for the climate crisis. So why is this election so close? Well, I know something about close elections, so let me offer you my opinion. I believe this election is close today mainly because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change Barack Obama represents. There is no better example than the climate crisis. As I have said for many years throughout this land, we're borrowing money from China to buy oil from the Persian Gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the future of human civilisation. Every bit of that has to change. Oil company profits have soared to record levels, gasoline prices have gone through the roof and we are more dependent than ever on dirty and dangerous fossil fuels. Many scientists predict that the entire north polar ice cap may be completely gone during summer months in the first term of the next president. Sea levels are rising, fires are raging, storms are stronger. Military experts warn us our national security is threatened by massive waves of climate refugees destabilizing countries around the world, and scientists tell us the very web of life is endangered by unprecedented extinctions. We are facing a planetary emergency which, if not solved, would exceed anything we've ever experienced in the history of humankind. In spite of John McCain's past record of open-mindedness on the climate crisis, he has apparently now allowed his party to browbeat him into abandoning his support of mandatory caps on global warming pollution. And it just so happens that the climate crisis is intertwined with the other two great challenges facing our nation: reviving our economy and strengthening our national security. The solutions to all three require us to end our dependence on carbon-based fuels. Instead of letting lobbyists and polluters control our destiny, we need to invest in American innovation. Almost 100 years ago, Thomas Edison said, \"I'd put my money on the sun and solar energy. What a source of power! I hope we don't have to wait until oil and coal run out before we tackle that.\" We already have everything we need to use the sun, the wind, geothermal power, conservation and efficiency to solve the climate crisis - everything, that is, except a president who inspires us to believe: \"Yes we can.\" So how did this no-brainer become a brain-twister? Because the carbon fuels industry - big oil and coal - have a 50-year lease on the Republican party and they are drilling it for everything it's worth. And this same industry has spent a half a billion dollars this year alone trying to convince the public they are actually solving the problem, when they are in fact making it worse every single day. This administration and the special interests who control it lock, stock and barrel after barrel, have performed this same sleight-of-hand on issue after issue. Some of the best marketers have the worst products; and this is certainly true of today's Republican party. The party itself has on its rolls men and women of great quality. But the last eight years demonstrate that the special interests who have come to control the Republican party are so powerful that serving them and serving the national wellbeing are now irreconcilable choices. So what can we do about it? We can carry Barack Obama's message of hope and change to every family in America. And pledge that we will be there for Barack Obama - not only in the heat of this election, but in the aftermath as we put his agenda to work for our country. We can tell Republicans and Independents, as well as Democrats, why our nation needs a change from the approach of Bush, Cheney and McCain. After they wrecked our economy, it is time for a change. After they abandoned the search for the terrorists who attacked us and redeployed the troops to invade a nation that did not attack us, it's time for a change. After they abandoned the American principle first laid down by general George Washington, when he prohibited the torture of captives because it would bring, in his words, \"shame, disgrace and ruin\" to our nation, it's time for a change. When as many as three supreme court justices could be appointed in the first term of the next president, and John McCain promises to appoint more Scalias and Thomases and end a woman's right to choose, it's time for a change. Many people have been waiting for some sign that our country is ready for such change. How will we know when it's beginning to take hold? I think we might recognise it as a sign of such change, if we saw millions of young people getting involved for the first time in the political process. This election is actually not close at all among younger voters - you are responding in unprecedented numbers to Barack Obama's message of change and hope. You recognise that he represents a clean break from the politics of partisanship and bitter division. You understand that the politics of the past are exhausted, and you're tired of appeals based on fear. You know that America is capable of better than what you have seen in recent years. You are hungry for a new politics based on bipartisan respect for the ageless principles embodied in the United States Constitution. There are times in the history of our nation when our very way of life depends upon awakening to the challenge of a present danger, shaking off complacency to rise, clear-eyed and alert, to the necessity of embracing change. A century and a half ago, when America faced our greatest trial, the end of one era gave way to the birth of another. The candidate who emerged victorious in that election is now regarded by most historians as our greatest president. Before he entered the White House, Abraham Lincoln's experience in elective office consisted of eight years in his state legislature in Springfield, Illinois, and one term in Congress - during which he showed the courage and wisdom to oppose the invasion of another country that was popular when it started but later condemned by history. The experience Lincoln's supporters valued most in that race was his powerful ability to inspire hope in the future at a time of impasse. He was known chiefly as a clear thinker and a great orator, with a passion for justice and a determination to heal the deep divisions of our land. He insisted on reaching past partisan and regional divides to exalt our common humanity. In 2008, once again, we find ourselves at the end of an era with a mandate from history to launch another new beginning. And once again, we have a candidate whose experience perfectly matches an extraordinary moment of transition. Barack Obama had the experience and wisdom to oppose a popular war based on faulty premises. His leadership experience has given him a unique capacity to inspire hope, in the promise of the American dream of a boundless future. His experience has also given him genuine respect for different views and humility, in the face of complex realities that cannot be squeezed into the narrow compartments of ideology. His experience has taught him something that career politicians often overlook: that inconvenient truths must be acknowledged if we are to have wise governance. The extraordinary strength of his personal character - and that of his wonderful wife, Michelle - is grounded in the strengths of the American community. His vision and his voice represent the best of America. His life experience embodies the essence of our motto - e pluribus unum - out of many, one. That is the linking identity at the other end of all the hyphens that pervade our modern political culture. It is that common American identity – which Barack Obama exemplifies, heart and soul - that enables us as Americans to speak with moral authority to all of the peoples of the world, to inspire hope that we as human beings can transcend our limitations and to redeem the promise of human freedom. Late this evening, our convention will end with a benediction. As we bow in reverence, remember the words of the old proverb: \"when you pray, move your feet.\" Then let us leave here tonight and take the message of hope from Denver to every corner of our land, and do everything we can to serve our nation, our world - and most importantly, our children and their future - by electing Barack Obama President of the United States."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2007/dec/18/keeponthesunnyside","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2007-12-18T11:00:00Z","webTitle":"Keep on the sunny side","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/dec/18/keeponthesunnyside","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2007/dec/18/keeponthesunnyside","fields":{"headline":"Keep on the sunny side","bodyText":"Last week saw two more slights on the power of solar microgeneration in the UK. They were very different in origin, but no less irritating for those of us advocating a place for solar energy in the family of survival technologies. The first, on the front page of the Times on Wednesday, was a photo of the solar panels on the prime minister's home (the web version of the story is here but it omitted the picture). I can only imagine it was placed by one of the PR agencies on the nuclear industry's payroll, because the photo aimed to make the industry's latest champion look good and solar look bad. Here was the PM going green, but at what sacrifice: the payback on Brown's solar electricity, the caption informed us, would be 100 years. Some young PR whiz would have had a very happy morning soaking up the plaudits for his or her genius in getting on the front page of a national paper with that double hit. (A shame, then, that Brown's panels are thermal not electric.) The second attack was in the Guardian, from carbon guru Chris Goodall. Microgeneration is \"an astonishingly expensive way of reducing emissions,\" says he. \"Less expensive and more effective would be a plan to put a £20 note in every roll of loft insulation.\" Ouch! The pooled argument, that solar PV is too expensive to be a good way for Britain to cut emissions, is dangerously wrong for three inter-related reasons. First, the long payback argument is an illusion, based on the profoundly unrealistic assumption of a static price for polluting energy over decades to come. The cost of fossil fuel electricity is sure to rise rapidly. Extraction and transportation costs for oil, gas and coal are going through the roof, and fears that oil and gas reserves are overblown are breaking out in the International Energy Agency, in the oil and gas industry itself, and increasingly within governments overseas. Meanwhile, to make nuclear economics deliver we have to omit potentially enormous blank cheques from the balance sheet, and forget about the paper-thin divide between a world building more civil nuclear stations and a world building more nuclear weapons. Second, the cost of solar PV manufacturing is coming down steadily. It falls roughly 20% every time the industry doubles global manufacturing capacity, which is every two years or so, so fast are solar manufacturing companies scaling up these days. This means that the rising cost curve for polluting power will intersect the falling cost curve of solar sometime rather sooner than most people expect, in most electricity markets. At that time we will have the conditions for a mass market, and then the industry will grow at rates that will amaze people. Third, is a strategic argument. Energy conservation and efficiency are the most cost-effective and most important ways to cut emissions today. No sensible person can deny that. But we cannot conserve and insulate our way out of the global warming and energy security traps. We need energy supply weapons alongside demand weapons in the same way that bombers need fighters in a mobilisation for war. Solar happens to be a vital member of energy-supply-for-survival family. Without being a magic bullet, it is the only supply technology today that can give you electricity right at the point you need it. And it will marry brilliantly in the years ahead with the advanced storage and efficiency technologies under development now. Even today, with gold standard energy efficiency designed into a new house, that house can be taken to zero carbon with as little as 10 square metres of solar PV rooftiles. What a prize, if it can be done at scale. More than half all UK emissions come from buildings. More than half of them come from residential properties. Worth a bit of strategic investment by governments and individuals, perhaps, in among the conservation and efficiency investments? On top of the three main arguments, there is also the value argument. Price and value are in the eye of the beholder, and not to be confused. There is every reason to believe that the value of Brown's home has gone up by at least the capital cost of his solar system, so keen is the public proving to be in this technology. In part this must be because people realise the prime minister has inflation-proof energy for decades to come. The payback time on that? As little as zero. The return on investment? Certainly better than leaving your money in a bank."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2008/apr/14/windpower.energy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2008-04-14T15:10:46Z","webTitle":"Big oil to big wind: Texas veteran sets up $10bn clean energy project","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/apr/14/windpower.energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2008/apr/14/windpower.energy","fields":{"headline":"Big oil to big wind: Texas veteran sets up $10bn clean energy project","bodyText":"T Boone Pickens is famous for thinking big. He founded his Texan oil company, Mesa Petroleum, in 1956 with just $2,500 (£1,200) in the bank. After a string of audacious takeovers he turned it into an independent empire that challenged the big oil companies, and today he is worth $3bn. Now this straight-talking Southerner is launching the biggest and most audacious project of his career. This month he will make the first down payment on 500 wind turbines at a cost of $2m each. The order is the first material step towards his goal of building the world's largest wind farm. Over the next four years he intends to erect 2,700 turbines across 200,000 acres of the Texan panhandle. The scheme is five times bigger than the world's current record-holding wind farm and when finished will supply 4,000 megawatts of electricity - enough to power about one million homes. It's not just the breathtaking scale of the scheme that is striking, though at a total cost of $10bn it impresses even Pickens himself: \"It's pretty mind boggling,\" he says. The fact that Pickens, a tycoon who made his fortune in oil, has turned his attention to wind power is an indication of how the tectonic plates are moving. Until recently wind was seen as marginal and alternative; now it is being eyed by Wall Street. \"Don't get the idea that I've turned green,\" Pickens tells the Guardian in the Dallas offices of his new venture Mesa Power. \"My business is making money, and I think this is going to make a lot of money.\" His fascination with wind developed as Pickens engaged in his favourite leisure pursuit - quail hunting. For years he has been shooting Bobwhite quail on his 68,000-acre ranch in the panhandle. \"I've been hunting quail for 50 years, I know where the wind is,\" Pickens says. The idea formed that this area of Texas, with its wide-open space, low population and steady south-westerlies would make a perfect location for wind-generated energy. Studies proved him right - there was more wind than even he had imagined, much of it at peak times in the middle of the day when power sells at a premium. So he set about convincing neighbouring ranchers to join his scheme, promising them between $10,000 and $20,000 in annual royalties for every turbine they allowed on their land. They have all signed up, eager to cash in on this literal windfall. (Pickens, by contrast, refuses to have any of the turbines placed on his own ranch. \"They are ugly!\" he says, unashamedly.) To see exactly what the promise is to ranchers and rural communities of the new dash for wind, you have to drive four hours west of Dallas into the Texan prairies. Until a couple of years ago Sweetwater was a gently declining railroad town, its population falling year on year and its infrastructure quietly rotting. Now it is a boom town, a 21st-century equivalent of the Wild West. German wind technicians who have poured into the area have coined a name for it - the Wind West. The three largest wind farms in America are all situated in the surrounding area, Nolan county, which, with a population of just 18,000, now produces more wind power than the UK, France and California. While other towns in the region are struggling with plummeting house prices and job losses, Sweetwater is in the midst of a construction explosion. Two new companies opened this week, one servicing the blades of the county's 2,000 turbines, another renting out cranes used in erecting new turbines. The turbines, state of the art models 400 feet to the tip of their blades, span out for 150 miles in any direction. New roads and houses are going up, and local schools and medical centres have been renovated using the influx of tax revenues from the energy companies. Greg Wortham, Sweetwater's mayor, says he has watched over the past two years as wind power was transformed \"from a hobby - a green thing - into an industry. Suddenly it was all about welders and engineers and truckers. We have companies here begging for new workers and paying them more than the thousands being laid off by the car companies.\" Back in Dallas, Pickens believes there are several reasons to invest in this new energy source. Beyond the mere profit motive, which clearly excites him, there is the fact that Texan oil has been on the wane since it peaked at 10m barrels a day in 1973, and is already down to half that amount. \"Oil fields have a declining curve - you find one, it peaks and starts downhill, you've got to find another one to replace it. It drives you crazy! With wind, there's no decline.\" There is also a political edge to his obsession. Politics and Pickens go together, as is obvious from the walls of his offices, lined with photographs of him with world leaders. One shows him with the Queen, Prince Philip and George HW Bush; another is with Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan; a third shows him on board Air Force One with the current President Bush. There is a signed calendar from Arnold Schwarzenegger on the table. As the pictures suggest, Pickens has for many years been a major financial backer of both George Bushes, but he professes to be frustrated by the lack of action on energy by this administration and all its predecessors. \"George Bush has done nothing. Nothing. Every guy that ran for president clear back to Nixon said he would make us energy independent, but not one goddamned thing has been done. Zero. The biggest problem facing the United States in the next 50 years is energy and nobody has come up with a solution.\" Pickens, being Pickens, has come up with a solution - and it makes his own gargantuan plans for a wind farm in the panhandle look tiny. For the benefit of the Guardian, he draws on a white board his master scheme. He carves out an enormous corridor of land running north to south through the middle of the US - along the great plains - where he would build an army of wind farms. Then he draws an equally enormous corridor running east to west from Texas to southern California which he would similarly dedicate to solar energy. \"You need a giant plan for America. Not the pissant 83 megawatt [windfarm] deals being stamped all over the country. There needs to be a huge plan from someone with leadership. It's going to take years to do, but it has to start now.\" Only then, he explains, can the US stop what he regards as the madness of a flood of money flowing out of America to the oil producers of the Middle East. \"That money is going God knows where - a few friends, a lot of enemies. We've got to stop it.\" T Boone Pickens certainly is thinking big. And all this as he prepares to celebrate his 80th birthday next month. How is it that he appears to be expanding his ambitions at a stage in life when most people are retrenching theirs? \"You're getting older so you are running out of time,\" he says. \"So let's go! We haven't got long, and we've got to get this job finished.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2008/nov/23/safari-south-africa","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2008-11-23T00:01:00Z","webTitle":"'I wanted to walk, smell and touch the landscape'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2008/nov/23/safari-south-africa","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2008/nov/23/safari-south-africa","fields":{"headline":"'I wanted to walk, smell and touch the landscape'","bodyText":"It was getting up close and personal with a pair of white rhino that did it: that was the moment that changed everything. Until then, the idea of a safari had always left me slightly cold - perhaps because, as a born-and-bred city girl, I thought I was more interested in people than animals; perhaps because my previous safari experiences had turned out to be a disappointing circus of 4x4s, annoying tourists and 'wild' animals so accustomed to the sight of camera-toting humans in vehicles they had basically turned into performing monkeys. It was only because my poor husband - who spent much of his childhood in South Africa and loves the bush as I love Soho - was beginning to despair that my impression of that country would forever be restricted to the perimeter of the wine and garden routes around Cape Town, that I eventually agreed to try it again. I had my caveats, however. If we were to do this, I decided, we had to find places that were well off the beaten track, somewhere remote and beautiful and not teeming with tourists, yet containing all the best game, birds, flora and fauna. Having always felt it was unconscionable that safari in Africa remains the preserve of wealthy whites and tourists, I was also keen to stay in places that had a social conscience and were not blithely indifferent to the plight of the local community. Most important of all, I wanted to be able to get out and walk, smell, listen, touch; be in the landscape itself. I had no interest in sitting like a sardine in a jeep all morning, being intoned to by a guide who had already told the same giraffe jokes 20 times that week, before heading back to a fancy brunch and a massage or a round of golf, Kruger-style. Madikwe turned out to be the perfect place to begin our 'slow safari' adventure. Lying on South Africa's border with Botswana, on the edge of the Kalahari, it boasts the Big Five (lion, elephant, leopard, rhinoceros and buffalo) but there are only 35 lodges on the 300 square-mile reserve, which inevitably limits the volume of holidaymakers tramping and trundling over its great plains. Moreover, within Madikwe itself there is a 65 square-mile concession of private land rich in game that has only three small lodges on it; one of these, Morukuru, was where we chose to stay. Unlike many safari lodges which have to be reached by light aircraft, this one is relatively easy to reach by car, further enhancing its 'slow travel' credentials. After three hours' driving from Johannesburg we hit a dirt road and bumped along it for 25 miles, before eventually reaching the banks of the Marico River. So far, so remote. Indeed, Morukuru's exclusive spot meant that in five days we never saw another game vehicle; never even spotted another traveller - an unlikely sort of bliss, given the staggering beauty of the surroundings and the superb quality of the service. As well as providing all the trappings of a top-notch safari lodge, Morukuru has an active involvement with its local community, helping to fund a nearby school and providing regular educational outings for the Tswana kids who, despite growing up in Madikwe, may never have seen its game. It also boasts a rifle licence, hard to obtain under South African law, which means you can take long walks on the wild side with your ranger and tracker. This was how I came to have my white rhino moment. On a tip from Tom, our Shangane tracker (who I suspect might have some kind of X-ray bush vision), we rounded an acacia tree and there they were: just a few feet away, two of them, mammoth, magnificent, having a late afternoon snack. We moved even closer - scrunch, snap - and stood, transfixed. I can't explain why it was that much more extraordinary to see these animals at such close quarters, the late afternoon air balmy on my skin, the scent of the savannah in my nose, than from the inside of a vehicle. But it was. And suddenly, I was hooked. White rhinos, after elephants, are the largest land animal in the world, yet the soundless elegance with which they eventually gambolled off after we had stared at them going about their business for a quarter of an hour was remarkable. We four humans - trying to be as silent as possible - had been crunching along in ungainly fashion through the bush, but the rhinos, weighing 2,500kg each, were miraculously light of foot. It was thrilling. Even more thrilling than the walking, however, was the sleeping. Not because I'm particularly lazy (honest) but because to go to bed under a dome of stars in a Big Five area such as this with only an invisible electric fence to protect you is one of those singular experiences that you can't recreate anywhere else. Even if it were possible to sleep out in the Kruger or one of the other mega-reserves, the chances are you probably would not want to, mosquitoes being hard to repel and malaria being rampant. But the combination of Morukuru being on private land, and that land being malaria-free, makes sleeping out in their 'hide' a magical option - so long as you can handle being serenaded all night by a chorus of operatic frogs and the occasional grunting warthog. The hide, which resembles a glorified treehouse, is positioned on the edge of a large watering hole that draws all sorts of wildlife to it throughout the wee small hours. So it certainly wasn't the most restful night's sleep we ever got, but it was probably the most fun. And to wake to the sun rising pink and perfect over the horizon and know that it's just you and nature for thousands and hundreds of square miles all around, before setting off for another three-hour bush walk - well, even I have to admit that Soho can't offer that. From glorious Madikwe we headed east to Limpopo in the quest to discover a similar slow safari experience in a different kind of landscape. Marakele National Park is bordered by the Waterberg Mountains, a majestic sandstone range whose capacity to retain and release water constantly nourishes the land, making the bushveld here radiantly lush. Marataba, a lodge set on 90 square miles of private land within Marakele, is the only accommodation on the concession. So once again, if you are feeling misanthropic, you will never have to see or make conversation with tourists from other lodges. Guests sleep out in the wild in tents - admittedly, these are luxury tents, prettily designed and complete with air-conditioning and hot water, but still, they are tents. Plonked in the middle of the wilderness, in a Big Five area, without so much as an electric fence as protection. It is an amazing sensation to be so exposed in such a place, although it does make for some vivid dreams ('Was that a lion? Or perhaps an elephant?') and if you haven't already been raised by the sun streaming in through the fabric walls at 5.30am, you are likely to be woken up soon after by the melodic sounds of various bush animals starting up their daily business all around you. This close communion with the wildlife continues throughout the day: warthogs, wildebeests, baboons, duikers and other creatures roam freely around the watering hole which lies below the grassy spot where tables are set up for meals. And so it was that I happened to be sitting there (after a morning roaming the bush), tucking into a tender ostrich steak and indulging in a cheeky glass of local pinotage, when I looked up and there was an elephant... no, two... no three! just calmly strolling along mere metres in front of me, also partaking in a little lunchtime drink. It is not South Africa's northern provinces that boast these unforgettably different safari experiences; they also exist in the Cape region, although more for tracking natural and marine life than game. We discovered heaven, for example, by way of Grootbos, a gorgeous private nature reserve not far along the coast from the popular whale-watching town of Hermanus but a million miles away in spirit. Overlooking the dramatic sweep of Walker Bay, the cluster of Grootbos lodges are the only buildings as far as the eye can see; and they are subtle ones at that, deliberately designed so as not to blot the very special landscape in which they sit. The Cape Floral Kingdom, one of six such botanical regions in the world, makes up 0.01 per cent of the world's land mass, yet is by far the richest in species in the world. To compare: the British Isles, three times its size, boasts 1,551 plant species, of which 25 are endemic; the Cape kingdom contains 9,700 species of which 6,800 are endemic. And again, you can truly feel yourself part of it. Here you can take long, quiet conservation walks through the 1,000-year-old milkwood forest, or explore the vast feynbos landscape, which is beginning to erupt in colour at this time of year; a veritable smorgasbord of yolky yellows and electric pinks and a green for every variation of the light. You can traverse breathtaking rocky coastline, ride horses on deserted beaches, experience the finest coastal whale watching in the world (more than half of the 350 southern right whales that come to give birth in this region at this time of year are to be found in this bay) and do a marine safari, observing gigantic breaching whales and snarling great whites in such proximity it is impossible not to be awe-inspired. Here too, as at Morukuru, there is a sustained collaboration between Grootbos and the local community - including the establishment of a school, Green Futures, which educates and employs locals from the Masakhane township in fynbos conservation - meaning that you can appreciate the phenomenal food, drink and service on offer in the knowledge that the people to whom this land really belongs are also, finally, being given a stake in it. I had set out my 'criteria' cynically believing they could never be met in a country where the generic, package-tour holiday has become such a mainstay of its tourist industry. But having been fully converted to the magic of a different kind of safari altogether, how wildly grateful I was to be proved wrong.

It's all very well, for instance, to set ambitious targets - and Gordon Brown's latest targets on emissions reductions are impressive. But it's another thing to identify mechanisms that will actually enable us to meet them. If, as the prime minister promises, Britain will fully contribute to a EU target that 20% of our total energy will come from renewable sources by 2020, that requires radical action now. We will need, for instance to increase the amount of renewable electricity we generate to 40%. At present, only 2% of energy in the UK comes from renewable sources. How? Enabling local communities to benefit directly from wind farms, as he suggested, may help. Sending energy teams to the 50 poorest areas in the UK to help install energy efficiency measures will also help. Smart meters too. But these are small steps. And they will, in any case, be overshadowed by government contradictions elsewhere. We are seeing increasing risk, for instance, of flooding, and yet we continue to build on flood plains. We are committed to cutting emissions, and yet current policy is geared towards trebling of our airport capacity. This is what is so deeply frustrating. Gordon Brown has made the right noises. But he has failed to come up with significant answers. I think the problem is that he confuses \"cost\" with investment, and has been unable to see opportunities presented by the shift to a cleaner economy. He also fears a voter backlash. But if there have been rumblings of an anti-green backlash, I believe Gordon Brown is partially to blame. It has been successive, clumsy initiatives by his government that have contributed to eroding people's appetite for green solutions, and worse, legitimising scepticism about politicians' motives. Gordon Brown's previous idea, for example, of imposing an extra £50 on vehicle excise duty for a car they have already bought clearly won't lead to any shift in behaviour. Similarly tax reductions on \"zero carbon homes\". It sounds great, but what's the point in offering carrots for goals that are currently unattainable? The best mechanism for pricing pollution and the use of scarce resources is through a shift in taxation. If the tax emphasis shifts from good things like employment to bad things like pollution, companies will necessarily begin designing waste out of the way they operate. But governments need to accept that people do not trust them. So if a tax is levied against a \"bad\" activity, it must be seen to be offset against \"good\" activities. In principle, Brown is committed to \"green taxation\". But, in practice, the change on his watch has been negligible. The actual level of green taxation has fallen since 1997 from 9.4% to 7.7%, even while the tax take generally has soared. Gordon Brown said yesterday, we need \"governing not gimmickry\". A good first step is to examine the successes of other governments. If \"feed-in tariffs\" have triggered a renewable energy boom in Germany, why not implement them here, as the Conservative party has proposed? German householders are guaranteed a high price for the energy they generate and sell back to the grid. As a result, a single town in Bavaria generates more solar energy than the whole of the UK. If existing energy-efficient appliances can deliver massive energy savings, why not demonstrate real leadership by raising appliance standards, instead of distributing token lightbulbs? We know the manufacturers can and will respond. Change will happen, one way or another. It's a mathematical certainty. But if we take the lead now, it will happen on our terms, and we can emerge with a cleaner, leaner, more efficient economy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"technology/2008/jan/31/energy.greentechnology","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2008-01-31T10:50:13Z","webTitle":"Blowing hot and cold on thermoelectrics","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/jan/31/energy.greentechnology","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2008/jan/31/energy.greentechnology","fields":{"headline":"Blowing hot and cold on thermoelectrics","bodyText":"Is the UK ignoring the potential of thermoelectrics? For Professor Mike Rowe OBE, of Cardiff University, thermoelectrics has been a 40-year passion. His pioneering work helped Nasa power space exploration vehicles and he's been on national television showing how a warm bath can run a TV. Now he's determined to see electricity generated from the waste heat in vehicles. And that may soon mean your car's alternator being replaced to save fuel. Getting warm Using a heat difference to generate electricity - and to use electricity to generate a temperature difference - has been around a long time. A thermoelectric device - a junction of two dissimilar metals or metal alloys - creates a voltage when there's a temperature difference between each side. This was discovered by German physicist Thomas Seebeck in 1821 and, over a decade later, French physicist Jean Peltier found that applying an electric current produced a temperature difference. Now known as the Peltier-Seebeck effect, it's the science behind thermocouples for temperature measurement and even solid-state wine coolers. Pack a series of thermocouples - known as modules - around a heat source, and you can reliably and silently generate small amounts of power. In his PhD in 1964, Rowe perfected a method for generating alloys with an ultra-small \"grain\" - the microscopic crystals of metal. This greatly enhanced its thermoelectric properties - a discovery taken up by Nasa. But he's since been preoccupied with something more down to earth. \"Following the first oil crisis, I identified thermoelectrics as a possible technology for recovering waste heat and then focused my attention on combating global warming,\" he says. Rowe's research is now underpinning Japanese efforts to exploit thermoelectrics as, in 2002, Japan began a research programme to develop advanced thermoelectric modules. Its goal is a module with a thermal to electrical conversion efficiency of 15% by 2010. The idea is to convert waste heat - from sources such as warm waste water - into electricity and save the country 20m gallons of crude oil and 105,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide. \"The Japanese are genuinely pro-active in trying to develop alternative energy,\" Rowe says. \"They've capitalised on the work I did over the last 15 years and have several prototypes operating from waste heat.\" Rowe reckons that the UK has missed out on thermoelectrics. This country's interest in his work has proved more trivial than serious - like the thermoelectric demonstration he did to show there's enough heat energy in a bath to run a small television. However, he received an OBE for services to technology in 2007. \"The cost per watt is comparable if not less than solar energy,\" Rowe says. \"It's an area which I think has got future potential and it has been neglected. It has proved very difficult to get funding in the UK.\" So what could thermoelectrics do here? If taken up, it's likely to revolve around waste heat in cars and trucks. For example, belt-driven alternators generate electricity but use a significant amount of fuel. Might exhaust heat do the job instead? \"The main interest in cars is to decrease the petrol consumption. If you can utilise the exhaust heat you could replace the alternator. So straightaway, you will get 5% saving in fuel,\" Rowe says. Vehicle manufacturers are collaborating with the US Department of Energy to develop thermoelectric generators powered by waste heat from exhaust and cooling systems to provide auxiliary power. General Motors and BMW are pushing ahead with thermoelectric developments to improve fuel economy by as much as 10%. Professor Neil White of the University of Southampton is looking at thermoelectrics on a much smaller scale. He's working on an Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council-funded project to increase the efficiency of thermoelectric materials as an energy source for low-power electronics. \"Certainly there is sufficient excess thermal energy in many areas that can be tapped into. You only need to obtain a few milliwatts to do something useful,\" White says. His focus is very small temperature differences. For example, the difference between skin and ambient temperatures could provide the energy for low-power electronics in applications such as smart garments. His challenge is to get useful amounts of power from a few degrees, rather than the larger difference between warm and cold water in Rowe's TV experiment. \"What we're trying to do is use nanostructured technology to increase the amount of thermojunctions in a given volume,\" White says. Exchange economics Like other alternative energy technologies, storing power from thermoelectrics is a problem. John Loughhead, executive director of the UK Energy Research Centre, sees such practical issues better than most. Making a solid-state thermoelectric device takes a lot of energy and it's not, Loughhead suggests, immediately obvious you'll get that energy back. However, such devices would be more reliable than a mechanical alternator, which he reckons has an energy conversion efficiency of less than 10%. \"Cars are consuming an increasing amount of electricity. They have a fairly high temperature exhaust that's difficult to use for anything else,\" Loughhead says. Does he think thermoelectrics is viable? \"It's one of those things where you'd be looking at the exact economics.\" Nevertheless, using waste heat to provide a new power supply for cars seems feasible. BMW in North America is engineering a prototype 750 watt thermoelectric generator for 3.0 litre Series 5, while General Motors plans a GM Suburban SUV with a thermoelectric generator using engine waste heat. And if vehicle manufacturers eventually succeed in replacing mechanical alternators with thermoelectric modules, then it's going to be good for your pocket and the planet.

Set in the not-too-distant future, the Orwellian novel describes a Britain run by a dictatorship called the Authority, where electricity is rationed, the miserable population subsists on tinned food and mountain-dwelling outlaws revert to subsistence living. Last week, in the real world, the price of oil finally went through the $100 a barrel mark, and was a whisker away from breaking the all-time record price of $101.70. While Britain is not about to turn its back on oil and become a dictatorship as a result, it makes investing in clean energy a better bet. Lord Oxburgh, the former chairman of Shell who now heads Aim-listed biofuels company D1 Oils, says: 'We are quite a long way from anything we can describe as a \"post-oil world\". But $100 a barrel makes a heck of a difference.' New Energy Finance estimates that last year, the amount invested in the clean energy sector grew to $117bn, up 41 per cent from 2005 and much more than expected. It now accounts for 10 per cent of the energy market globally. Biofuel technologies are direct substitutes for oil, so the higher the price of the black stuff, the more attractive they become. Oxburgh says that biofuel from the non-edible plant jatropha is economic at $70 a barrel. But because it takes several years to build a refinery and harvest the crop, investors are nervous about gambling that oil prices will remain high. 'Biofuels need subsidy because no one is going to invest unless they are confident it will be economic,' he says. 'That depends on the price of the competing fuel, oil.' Other clean forms of power generation, such as solar and wind power, compete with gas-fired electricity plants, whose costs go up when oil prices rise. According to Green Econometrics, solar energy costs about five times more than oil-powered generation. But Dipesh Shah, chairman of solar company Jetion and of Hg Capital's renewables investment fund, says that solar should become price-competitive with fossil-fuel power generation during non-peak times in the mid-2020s. 'If oil stays at over $100 over the next two decades,' he adds, 'it would bring the crossover point, when solar becomes competitive with conventional generation, forward by up to a decade.' While rocketing oil prices are a useful incentive to put money into clean energy, green investors say that it's just icing on the cake. Steve Mahon, chief investment officer of the Aim-listed environmental fund Low Carbon Accelerator, says his investments are economic if oil is at $40-$50. 'In general high oil prices or high carbon prices are just a way of making significantly higher profits.' Governments' increasing fears about being reliant on importing oil from unstable regimes and about climate change are bigger boosts than the price of oil. They are the main drivers to create a global price for emitting carbon dioxide. Companies that can generate electricity without emitting carbon dioxide will be financially rewarded. 'Dirty' generators, such as coal and gas plants, will be penalised under schemes like Europe's Emissions Trading Scheme, which charge companies for the right to emit carbon dioxide. Rather than gamble that oil prices will go higher and stay there, green investors are betting that the price of carbon will rise. This should be a safer bet than volatile oil prices, as governments influence the carbon price by deciding how many permits to distribute. Brian Count is chairman of Progressive Energy, which wants to build a clean-coal plant with Centrica using an expensive new technology to reduce CO2 emissions called carbon capture and storage (CCS). 'High oil prices are good for Progressive Energy,' he says. 'But the main driver for CCS is a high carbon price.' He wants the government to fix a price for carbon to make CCS economic. It is possible that governments may decide that stopping climate change is no longer a priority, cut subsidies and dismantle the carbon markets. In the US, wind farm developers are anxious that tax credits which expire next year will not be renewed. But with talks to replace the Kyoto protocol having started in Bali last month, government support for low carbon technologies is increasing and is unlikely to weaken. There are other risks to investing in clean energy. Vincent Tchenguiz, the property tycoon who is raising a new £1bn environmental fund, says that such investments are best suited to private investors rather than the listed market. 'Many are long-term investments which have to prove themselves and don't provide immediate returns. Most stock market investors don't understand them.' Michael Liebreich, chief executive of New Energy Finance, points out that the clean energy sector is a more crowded market than five years ago. Like any new investment craze, clean energy has thrown up its fair share of duds and not every company is a sure bet. 'As an investor you have to pick your winners carefully,' he warns. So while green investors were certainly toasting $100 a barrel last week, they know there is no guarantee the price will remain high. As Mahon from the LCA says: 'An environment where fossil fuels are more expensive is good for our business. But there is no direct link between investing in all renewables and high oil prices.'"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2008/jan/19/familyandrelationships.family7","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2008-01-19T23:44:47Z","webTitle":"Things to do with your family this week","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/jan/19/familyandrelationships.family7","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2008/jan/19/familyandrelationships.family7","fields":{"headline":"Things to do with your family this week","bodyText":"Take your own taste test Our kids tend to like sweet foods but I didn't realise quite how sweet until we tried a family hot chocolate taste test.

So we set up a panel of four kids and three adults to test eight of the major brands. It turned into a proper event with lots of discussion and opinion, and the kids - rather like (I imagine) Stephen Fry doing a spoof wine tasting - were super enthusiastic at detecting multifarious textures (powdery, gritty, cloying) and flavours (rich, milky, fatty, cinnamon, \"mucked around\" and sweet - that's super sweet to most adults). It was great fun debating it, and for perhaps for the first time in their lives, the kids really tuned in to their tastebuds and discovered the subtle flavours in their food.

The plan may not look like much, since it basically committed the world to more talking rather than specific actions, but I am optimistic for three reasons. First, the world was sufficiently united that it forced the United States to end its intransigence. Second, the road map marks a sensible balance of considerations. And, third, realistic solutions are possible, which will allow the world to combine economic development and control of greenhouse gases. The first step at Bali was to break the deadlock that has crippled the global response to climate change since the signing of the Kyoto Protocol a decade ago. This time the world united, even booing the US lead negotiator until she reversed position and agreed to sign the Bali Action Plan. Likewise, the unwillingness of major developing countries such as China and India to sign on to a plan also seems to be ending, though considerable work remains to craft a global agreement to which both rich and poor countries can agree. Doing so requires balancing many concerns. First, we must stabilise greenhouse gases in order to avoid dangerous human interference in the climate system - the key goal of the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the global treaty under which the Bali negotiations took place. Second, we must accomplish this while leaving room for continued rapid economic development and poverty reduction. Poor countries do not and will not accept a system of climate control that condemns them to continued poverty. Third, we must help countries adapt to the climate change that is already occurring and that will intensify in the future. The Bali Action Plan addresses all three concerns. The plan's main point is to establish an Ad Hoc Working Group to reach a detailed global agreement by 2009 that will set \"measurable, reportable, and verifiable\" commitments to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. Such commitments are to be taken in the context of \"sustainable development,\" meaning that \"economic and social development and poverty reduction are global priorities.\" The plan also calls for knowledge transfer to enable poor countries to adopt environmentally sound technologies. The great question, of course, is whether stabilisation of greenhouse gases, continued economic development, and adaptation to climate change can be achieved simultaneously. Using our current technologies, no; but if we develop and rapidly adopt new technologies that are within our scientific reach, yes. The most important challenge is to reduce, and eventually nearly eliminate, carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas, and coal. These fuels are at the core of the modern world economy, supplying around four-fifths of the world's commercial energy. Such emissions can be eliminated by either shifting to renewable forms of energy or reducing the emissions from fossil fuels. The key insight is that roughly 75% of our fossil fuel use goes for just a few purposes: to produce electricity and heat at power plants, to drive automobiles, to heat buildings, and to power a few key industries such as refineries, petrochemicals, cement, and steel. We need new environmentally sound technologies in each of these sectors. For example, power plants can adopt solar energy or capture and safely dispose of the carbon dioxide they produce with fossil fuels - as can large factories. Automobiles can be engineered for much greater mileage through hybrid technology combining battery power and gasoline. Buildings can reduce their heating needs through improved insulation, or by converting from heating oil to electricity produced by clean technology. According to the best economic and engineering estimates, if each key economic sector develops and adopts environmentally sound technologies in the coming decades, the world will be able to reduce carbon emissions dramatically for less than 1% of annual global income, thereby avoiding long-term damage that would cost far more. In other words, the world can combine economic growth with declining emissions of carbon dioxide. And rich countries will be able to afford to help poor countries pay for the new, cleaner technologies. To reach agreement by 2009, we must move beyond current generalities by which rich and poor countries argue about who should be blamed for climate change and who should pay the costs. We will need a true global business plan that spells out how the new technologies are developed, tested, and adopted on an expedited basis worldwide. We must ensure that all countries adopt a verifiable strategy for environmentally sound technology, and that rich countries fulfill the Bali Action Plan's promise to provide \"financial and other incentives\" to enable poor countries to adopt the new technologies. With so many crises afflicting our world, there is perhaps cynicism that yet another global conference did little more than promise to continue talking. But let's see the positive message instead: 190 countries agreed on a sensible plan, and the underlying science and technology gives us realistic hopes for achieving it. There is considerable and difficult work ahead, but the situation is better as a result of the deliberations in Bali. Now it's time to role up our sleeves and achieve what we've promised.

In a month that marked the 50th anniversary of the beginning of the first space race, with the Soviet satellite, Sputnik, it looks as if we're in for another. The question is why. China aims to put a citizen on the moon by 2020, the same target set by President Bush for a US return. The reasons given for this new lunar push are national prestige and science. But no space programme has ever been about science: when President John F Kennedy laid his Apollo project on a stunned world in 1961, his chief scientific advisor made him promise never to claim that the thing was about research, and, to his credit, he never did. JFK's motives involved the need to salvage his presidency and, perhaps, a desire to keep missile makers busy with work that didn't involve blowing up the world. We got some excellent state-funded theatre, but the science could have been done by robots. China certainly has strong political reasons for taking a tilt at the moon. On one level, its lunar programme is an expensive advertisement for economic prowess. As every Republican president since Ronald Reagan has demonstrated, politicians equate space with vision, even if the vision has little chance of being realised. This one does, however. Yet, hidden beneath the expressions of patriotic pride in the Chang'e-1 probe's launch is evidence that this new space race will be different from the first. Examine the mission statement and you'll find the objectives given as creating maps and \"analysing the chemical composition of lunar dust\". Innocent-sounding science at first sight; on closer inspection, nothing of the sort. I first heard about helium-3 (He-3) from the geologist Harrison \"Jack\" Schmitt, the only scientist among the 12 Americans who walked on the moon between 1969 and 1972, and a tireless campaigner for a US return. He understood a 21st-century programme would never happen without an economic rationale, and he hoped that He-3, which is deposited on the surface by the solar wind, might provide one. If the necessary fusion technology could be made to work, he said, this isotope would be a source of clean energy for Earth. Against Schmitt's enthusiasm were the facts that, a) no one had made the technology work, b) the US had to get up there first, and c) mining He-3 would involve ripping up the lunar surface to a depth of one metre. So the idea of mining moon dust has gained little support in the US. Now it seems China might be with Jack on this one - and where they go, everyone else will try to follow. Whether it turns out to be He-3, solar energy, or some as yet unknown technology that draws humanity back to the moon, there's an irony here. In 1968, Apollo 8 brought back the first shimmering image of an \"Earthrise\" as seen from the moon. Four years later, Apollo 17 came home with the famous whole Earth picture. These new views of our fragile, heartbreakingly isolated planet are often credited with having helped to kickstart the environmental movement - even with having changed the way we see ourselves as a species. At present, nations are forbidden under international treaty from making territorial claims to the moon, but the same has hitherto been true of Antarctica, of which the UK government is trying to claim a chunk. Earth's sister has played a role in teaching us to value our environment: how extraordinary to think that the next giant leap for the environmental movement might be a campaign to stop state-sponsored mining companies chomping her up in glorious privacy, a quarter of a million miles from our ravaged home. · Andrew Smith is the author of Moondust: In Search of the Men Who Fell to Earth · This article was amended on Saturday November 3 2007.

The 120 sq m heliostat mirrors automatically track the sun as it moves east to west. They will produce temperatures of up to 250C (482F). The tower will produce 11MW of electricity, enough to power some 6,000 homes. \"It will save 18,000 tonnes of carbon emissions every year,\" a spokesman for Abengoa, the company behind the power tower, said . The tower, known simply as PS10, represents a comeback for this form of solar energy, which was first tested in the Mojave desert of California in the 1980s. It is the first stage of an ambitious solar power project at the Sanlúcar la Mayor site, which will use various kinds of solar technology to produce some 300MW of energy within six years. That will be enough to light up some 180,000 homes. The project includes a second power tower, the PS20, which is due to produce almost twice as much energy as the first. The power tower in the Mojave became well known when it featured in films such as Percy Adlon's Bagdad Cafe, but other forms of solar energy gained favour in the 1990s. Solar panels, especially, have been the main focus of research in recent years but improvements in the technology behind the heliostat mirrors has brought renewed interest. Other mirror-based systems, known as concentrating solar power systems, direct the sun's rays onto tubes of liquid or on to a central collecting point in a dish-shaped mirror. A 64MW solar concentrating power plant, which does not use a tower, is due to open in the Eldorado valley of the Nevada desert later this month, while Israel, Egypt, France, Australia and Algeria are all studying ways to build concentrating solar power system plants. South Africa is considering a 100MW power tower with 5,000 mirrors in the northern Cape. It still costs around twice as much to produce electricity via concentrating solar power as it does from fossil fuels."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2007/apr/03/furthereducation.uk","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2007-04-03T22:52:22Z","webTitle":"Greening Africa","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2007/apr/03/furthereducation.uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2007/apr/03/furthereducation.uk","fields":{"headline":"Greening Africa","bodyText":"Recent discoveries of oil in Uganda should bring joy to Rogers Kyagulanyi and Peter Ssali at the impending wealth it will bring to their country. Instead they feel nothing but dismay. The two students at Cornwall College are proud of the fact that green energy from sustainable sources provides 99% of the electricity generated in their homeland, and they want it to stay that way. That is why they feel unable to celebrate four big oil finds in their native land during the two years they have been in the UK. Both students are solar-power engineers studying for a foundation degree in renewable energy technologies at Cornwall, learning to be able to bring power to more people in Africa. Only about 5% of the 28 million population receives electricity from the national grid, which runs predominantly on hydroelectric power generated by a Nile dam. But both Kyagulanyi and Ssali firmly believe that fossil fuels are not the answer to Uganda's energy needs. Kyagulanyi says: \"Uganda is on the equator and the river Nile runs through it for 500 miles. We have access to more than enough solar energy and hydroelectric power to meet all our energy requirements.\" The two men now face a dilemma on whether to continue their studies after completing their course, or to return so they can advance their arguments as soon as possible before commercial exploitation of the oil reserves, which is due to begin in 2009. \"We want to make people understand about climate change so they turn away from fossil fuels,\" says Ssali. The two men work for a company that instals solar photovoltaic (PV) panels to homes in areas that do not have access to the national grid, providing them with enough electricity to have light, television and radio, and one or two small appliances such as a mobile phone charger. Ssali has also worked on solar thermal installations, providing hot water to properties in urban areas. At Cornwall, the only FE college in the UK offering the course, they have been learning about energy from wind, water and waves, solar energy, biomass and sustainable construction. \"At home there are many villages and communities that live by small rivers and streams that could harness mini-hydro systems,\" Kyagulanyi says. \"There are a couple in Cornwall that we have looked at. Biomass [in which crops are used as fuel] could also work very well in Uganda. \"This course has given me the proper training to introduce these technologies at home. Before I knew how to fix the pipes. Now I have a depth of knowledge about renewable energy.\" Cornwall College introduced the course three years ago and it has been rapidly growing in popularity. There were six students in the first year and 19 this year. Cornwall's principal, John Latham, says the college, whose energy bill amounts to £900,000 a year, is also taking steps to \"green up\" its own act. It has appointed a full-time sustainability officer exclusively to work on reducing its carbon footprint. \"There is active talk about Cornwall becoming the first carbon-neutral county in the country. It would be odd if this college did not take the same attitude,\" he says."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2007/jun/09/1","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2007-06-09T12:08:31Z","webTitle":"Five other cabins to escape to","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2007/jun/09/1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2007/jun/09/1","fields":{"headline":"Five other cabins to escape to","bodyText":"Brimnes Cabins, Ólafsfjördur, Iceland Famous for its isolated ruggedness and expansive vowel usage, the northern tip of Iceland is prime cabin country.

Scheer, chair of the World Council for Renewable Energy, has been a fierce advocate of renewables for more than 20 years, and it was he who came up with the idea of the \"feed-in tariff law\", which has been picked up across Europe and by opposition parties in Britain. According to what has become known as \"Scheer's law\", German households and businesses that generate renewable energy can sell it back to the grid at more than triple the normal market price. \"The key to it working is that consumers have guaranteed access to the grid at guaranteed prices,\" explains 63-year-old Scheer, a qualified economist. This probably goes further than any single piece of national legislation in the world to encourage the growth of the renewable energy industry. Power companies do not like it, but it has given incredible verve to an industry that had not until now had many believers. More than 300,000 individuals and small businesses have jumped at the opportunity in Germany, and the number is rising all the time. Scheer's family, whose house is powered by a windmill, is among them. \"The general target is to mobilise all renewable options, producing a renewable energy mix and reducing the dependency on conventional energy over time,\" he says. So far, 15% of Germany's energy comes from renewables, an increase of 11% in just eight years. By 2030 at the latest, the 100% target should have been reached. \"We could increase the speed of this growth if it weren't for the barriers we're facing at local and regional levels,\" he says, citing both psychological and legal obstacles. Scheer's law has created whole new industries - wind power, which employs 80,000 people in Germany, and photovoltaic (solar) power, which employs 40,000. The jobs are, in effect, subsidised, but in time this will become less and less significant because of the system's commercial success. Both wind and solar sectors are growing at around 30% a year, making them attractive for investors and for developers of technology. The potential returns are huge. Feed-in tariff Several Mediterranean countries - including Spain, Italy and Portugal - have latched on to Scheer's law and are in the process of introducing it. The governments of Brazil and China have also called on Scheer to advise them as to how they might apply it. In Britain, the Conservative leader, David Cameron, has shown an interest in the feed-in tariff concept, which Scheer will make the focus of his address to a parliamentary committee on environmental matters. Scheer comes to London next week as part of the Royal Institute of British Architects' series of architecture and climate change talks. But while Britain is under pressure to adopt something similar, Scheer can feel the strong resistance to his ideas in a government that appears to be more wedded to nuclear power and coal. He calls the British government's negative attitudes towards renewables \"small-minded\" and \"inexplicable\". He dismisses the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform's view that the feed-in tariff, with its system of subsidies, stifles competition. \"The fact is that the subsidies paid for fossil and nuclear energy are much higher - hundreds of millions of pounds a year - around 10 times more than has been spent on renewables over the past two decades,\" he says. \"And nuclear power stations, for instance, are even relieved from having to pay their huge insurance bill because the taxpayer picks it up. So this argument about renewables and subsidies doesn't stand up. \"I cannot understand the [UK government's] attitude. I think it's a big mistake, based on ignorance over years about the real potential of renewable energies. Because this was ignored, there's a so-called nuclear renaissance taking place, and according to the British government this will happen without public money. This will never work. I assume this is just a trick to get the British public support for nuclear, but without public money it's impossible.\" He also cites the damage he thinks British independent scientist James Lovelock has done for the renewables cause, with his claim that only nuclear power can halt global warming - an attitude that the government seems to have adopted. Scheer says: \"[Lovelock] says renewable energies cannot work, but he shows that he has practically no knowledge of the real state and development of renewable energy whatsoever.\" Among the myths, he says, are that renewables are expensive to acquire and unreliable. \"What's happening in Germany proves that that's not the case, and the more widespread it becomes, the better the technology will be and the cheaper it will be.\" Scheer will try to communicate that when in London. \"I'll tell them all about the benefits renewables have for economic, cultural and civilian development, and will urge them not just to look at actual cost comparisons, because that's such a small-minded view and with that we can't find a grand strategy or solve this macro-economic and macro-ecological problem.\" Scheer, a holder of the Alternative Nobel Prize, and a self-described \"possibilist\", would like to reverse the view in Britain, which he refers to as \"the unbroken power of one-dimensional thinking\", by demonstrating how free and plentiful renewables are compared to fossil fuels and nuclear. \"The amount of sun, wind, geothermal and bioenergy at our disposal is by far sufficient,\" he says. \"Take just the sun - it sends around 15,000 times more energy to our planet than all 6 billion people need. These resources are indefinite and cheap - the sun and wind won't be sending you a bill, and neither can you privatise them. \"And don't give me the arguments against the aesthetics of windmills. They're not there to be liked - it's enough to accept that they're necessary, because we need 100% emission-free energies. Who, after all, likes power lines? But they're accepted. Here we're dealing with an existential problem.\" To illustrate the unmilked potential in Britain, he points out that Germany is home to 20 times more installed windpower systems than the UK, \"although the UK has better wind conditions, longer coastlines, and more space for good sites\". The difference is, he says, \"thanks to the feed-in tariff, we created an industrial dynamic\". Scheer is the author of the seminal works A Solar Manifesto and The Solar Economy, the most widely-read books on the subject of the transition to renewable energy. In them he argues that modern technologies will help create a \"solar information society\". Backing his point is the world's first mass implementation programme of photovoltaic solar energy roofs, which Scheer helped to push. It saw 100,000 solar roofs installed in homes and businesses across Germany. \"We're talking about the most important and exciting structural change of civilisation since the beginning of the industrial age,\" he says, with another chuckle. \"The benefits and ramifications are huge. Not only do renewables mitigate climate change, they also give us cleaner cities, improved health, revitalise the agricultural economy so that the farmers of today will become the oil sheikhs of tomorrow, and fight underdevelopment and deprivation in the developing world.\" Social commitment One of the most exciting aspects, he says, is the boost given to the freedom of individuals as they become less dependent on conventional power and its providers. \"You give people energy independence and you get social commitment - you only get that with renewables,\" he argues. Even national security issues could be overcome, and wars over energy become obsolete. \"Look at all the political support there is for oil and gas,\" he says. \"For a start, you could get rid of the British costs for military commitment in Iraq which belongs to the oil bill. Think of the savings!\" At some point, Scheer believes his ideas will become commonplace. He lets the 19th-century German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer make the point for him. \"There are three stages to a new idea,\" Scheer says. \"At first, it is ignored. Second, there is strong opposition against it. And finally, those who once opposed it set about introducing the initiatives themselves as if they'd been theirs all along.\" · Hermann Scheer will be speaking on April 22 at the Royal Institute of British Architects as part of its International Dialogues: Architecture and Climate Change series.

But when he finished he was astonished to be assailed by cries of \"No we can't!\" No, the world will never cooperate! No, humankind will never be reasonable! No, we can't bridge the divides! \"I was taken aback,\" says Sachs. \"I thought that in this place at least there would be a unanimous approval. This was the elite of UK society. But there was a measure of pessimism that I found frankly amazing.\" The story is a sharp illustration of Sachs's peculiar role in life. He has become a sort of pantomime dame of global politics. As the chorus rises around the world of \"Oh no we can't!\", his riposte grows louder too: \"Oh yes we can!\" Yes we can lift Africa out of the poverty trap and stabilise population at sustainable levels. Yes we can continue to enjoy rising living standards and longevity. Yes we can avert catastrophe by finding new technologies to combat climate change. Were these protestations coming from anyone else, they might be dismissed as the ravings of Widow Twankey. But Sachs has the intellectual muscle to be taken seriously. He has been called the most important economist in the world. He has worked in more than 100 countries and advised governments across Latin America and the old Soviet Union. More recently he has turned his attention to the major crises engulfing the planet, from Aids in Africa to water wars. He directed the UN's Millennium Project under Kofi Annan. Bono calls him \"my professor\", observing that \"when this man gets going, he's more like a Harlem preacher than a Boston bookworm.\" In the flesh, though, Sachs resembles neither of those archetypes. Rather, he comes across as a bushy-tailed graduate who, despite his 53 years, is as eager to launch himself at a problem as a twentysomething straight out of college. We are sitting in his elegant but sparsely furnished townhouse on the edge of Central Park, Manhattan, where he lives with his paediatrician wife and three children, and as we talk he radiates an infectious enthusiasm. His new book, Common Wealth: Economics for a Crowded Planet (Penguin Press), has the same quality - it bursts with ideas and is suffused with what can only be described as irrepressible optimism. So where does this optimism come from? \"From observation and experience,\" he replies in true Enlightenment style. \"Maybe by temperament also. I see the possibility of success. But I am clear. This is about choice. It's not about the blind working of the market or the miracles of science. It's about a decision.\" Sachs is a great believer in breaking things down, to reducing a daunting problem down to its smaller and more manageable parts. He applies the same logic to himself, saying his optimism has two components: a belief in the \"ability of science to allow people to live prosperously and sustainably on the planet, and an optimism about the ability of people to cooperate across cultures, religions, language\". He pauses, then adds: \"Both of these ideas are under attack.\" Sachs can point to practical examples of what he means. His favourite is the prescription of anti-retroviral medicines in Africa. \"I remember a decade ago finding out that it was technically possible to treat very poor people with Aids using anti-retrovirals. I asked my colleagues could this be done, and the answer was 'Yes, why not? Come, and I'll show you.' So I took that knowledge and put it to use.\" Problem. Scientific hypothesis. Practical solution. Then, working with the UN and other agencies, implementation. \"As late as 2001 there wasn't one African - not one human being - on a donor-supported programme to receive anti-retrovirals. Looking back it was shocking the things that were said. The head of the US aid agency said it wouldn't work as Africans couldn't tell the time. But now there are close to two million Africans on anti-retrovirals.\" Sachs's life has followed an extraordinary trajectory. Brought up in Michigan, he took Harvard by storm, joining its economics faculty while still an undergraduate and being made a full professor by 29. He spent more than 20 years there before moving to Columbia University in New York, where he is director of the Earth Institute. There he has taken on a mission that makes tackling Aids in Africa look timid. His book is a call to action on the three great challenges facing the world - over-population, extreme poverty and global warming. The most alarming projections suggest today's 6.6 billion people could rise to 11.7 billion by 2050; poverty means African life expectancy is 33 years shorter than in high-income countries; and at current rates of economic growth in China and India, carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere could double by 2050, leading to catastrophic climate change. Confronted by that vision of apocalypse you feel an affinity with the Royal Society audience. \"Oh no we can't!\" Sachs's response is, well, Sachsian. He breaks each problem down, analyses it, and sets out practical solutions which he says are achievable and would cost the world remarkably little - a mere 2% to 3% of total income. \"We are liable to be overwhelmed by the immensity of what is going on, even paralysed. It's a paradox. We could do enormous damage to ourselves - and are on a path to do that - and yet the cost of finding an alternative direction is extraordinarily modest.\" Environmentalists protest that Sachs wants to have his cake and eat it. He wants economic growth to continue, but he also wants to avert disastrous climate change born of economic activity. To which he replies, quite unashamedly, that he believes in the power of technology and human ingenuity. Take climate change. He sees great hope in carbon sequestration as a possible way of reducing CO2 levels, and if that fails solar energy may step into the breach. In any case, he doesn't want to set the clock back: \"Is it wrong that fossil fuels had this massive climate effect and therefore we never should have used coal to fire a steam engine two centuries ago? I don't think so. Do technologies have unexpected consequences and side-effects? Of course. But then you need to readjust.\" But the sharpest assault has come from Naomi Klein, who in her new book The Shock Doctrine lays into Sachs with gusto. She claims the taming of Bolivian hyperinflation in the 1970s, an act of economic wizardry that helped make Sachs's name, was only achieved through government repression that she calls \"a kind of junta lite\". Later in Poland the free-market shock therapy he encouraged caused a full-blown depression, she contends. \"Well, come on, let's have some sense of proportion,\" is Sachs's slightly peeved reply when I put Klein's case to him. \"Poland ended up the most successful recovery, with robust democratic institutions, and I couldn't be more thrilled. Oppression in Bolivia? That's just factually wrong. There was no loss of life. When she called it Pinochet lite - I mean, Pinochet killed thousands and tortured tens of thousands. Bolivia was a 30-day emergency rule under the constitution at a time of 50,000% inflation.\" But Sachs agrees with Klein that the US abdicated responsibility after the collapse of the Soviet Union. He says it felt as though he were shouting in the middle of a hurricane as his recommendations for debt cancellation and emergency loans for Russia were not listened to by the defence secretary in George Bush Sr's administration: one Dick Cheney. Which brings us to Sachs's greatest complaint. His book argues that the administration of George W Bush has stood in the way of progress on all the most critical fronts: from family planning, to aid in Africa and action against climate change. Instead, it has pursued a relentlessly militaristic path in which the US now spends almost as much money on warfare as the rest of the world combined. As you read Common Wealth, in which he piles case upon case in which Bush has said no to global action, it dawns that the American president's most damaging legacy will not be the Iraq war, or Kyoto, or any other single decision, but more generally his pervasive sponsorship of what Sachs calls \"negativism as a state of mind\". Bush has encouraged the chorus of \"No we can't!\" It may distress many of them to hear this, but the audience at the Royal Society are in this regard his disciples. Sachs admits we are headed towards a cliff but, unsurprisingly, remains relentlessly upbeat. Though he won't declare which Democratic candidate he is supporting, he hails \"the wonder of the American constitution. We will have a new president on January 20 2009, around noon, and this will give us the chance for a fresh start.\" And then he offers a quote by poet Wallace Stevens: \"After the final no there comes a yes / And on that yes the future world depends.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2007/sep/16/climatechange","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2007-09-16T10:01:15Z","webTitle":"Arctic thaw opens fabled trade route","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/sep/16/climatechange","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2007/sep/16/climatechange","fields":{"headline":"Arctic thaw opens fabled trade route","bodyText":"The Arctic's sea covering has shrunk so much that the Northwest Passage, the fabled sea route that connects Europe and Asia, has opened up for the first time since records began. The discovery, revealed through satellite images provided by the European Space Agency (Esa), shows how bad the consequences of global warming are becoming in northerly latitudes. This summer there was a reduction of a million square kilometres in the Arctic's ice covering compared with 2006, scientists have found. As a result, the Northwest Passage that runs between Canada and Greenland has been freed of the ice that has previously blocked it and that, over the centuries, has frustrated dozens of expeditions that attempted to sail northwest and open up a commercial sea route between the Atlantic and the Pacific. In addition, scientists have found that the Northeast Passage, a corresponding route that runs parallel to the north coast of Russia, may also soon become navigable - though the clearing of both passages is likely to fuel animosity between countries trying to exploit the region's oil, fish and mineral resources, experts have warned. According to scientists led by Leif Toudal Pedersen of the Danish National Space Centre, Arctic ice this summer dropped to around 3 million square kilometres, a decrease of 1 million square kilometres on last year's coverage. Given that for the past 10 years Arctic ice has been disappearing at an average annual rate of only 100,000 square kilometres, this year's reduction is 'extreme', said Pedersen. 'The strong reduction in just one year raises flags that the ice [in summer] may disappear much sooner than expected and that we urgently need to understand better the processes involved,' he added. Pedersen and his team used 200 images - acquired earlier this month by the Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar instrument aboard Esa's Envisat satellite - to create a mosaic that shows the Northwest route across northern Canada is currently navigable, while the Northeast Passage along the Siberian coast remains blocked, but only partially. Finding a Northwest Passage from the Atlantic to the Pacific was a dream of European merchants since the 16th century. Explorers including Martin Frobisher and Henry Hudson tried to find a route but failed. Finally, in 1845, a well-equipped two-ship expedition led by Sir John Franklin attempted to find the passage. It disappeared, with all its 129 crewmen. Subsequent investigations found the bodies of Franklin's sailors and uncovered evidence that contaminated food may have helped doom the expedition. It is also thought some crewmen may have resorted to cannibalism to try to save themselves. The passage was finally conquered in 1906 by the Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen, who completed the journey in a converted 47-ton herring boat called Gjoa. However, some of the waterways used by Amundsen were extremely shallow, making his route commercially impractical. Although the discovery that the passage is now opening up dramatically, indicating it may soon be possible for shipping to take highly profitable northerly short cuts between the Europe and Asia, scientists are also very worried about the rate at which the region's ice is melting. They fear the polar regions may have passed a crucial tipping point. Ice reflects solar energy. But if it starts to disappear, heat is absorbed by the dark seas and rock below ice floes and glaciers. The Arctic then gets warmer and even more protective ice covering is lost - so melting accelerates dangerously. The opening up of the sea routes is also like to increase the intensity of international disputes in the Arctic. Canada claims full rights over those parts of the Northwest Passage that pass through its territory and has announced that it will bar transit there if it wants. However, this claim is disputed by the US and the European Union. In addition, Russia has laid claims to large tracts of the Arctic seabed, claiming these are extension of its maritime zones. Again this claim is disputed by other countries, including Canada, which recently announced it was building a fleet of naval vessels to protect its northern waters."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2007/dec/28/usa.world","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2007-12-28T15:15:46Z","webTitle":"Rebecca Solnit: The growth of local power is a bright spot in seven bleak years of Bush","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/dec/28/usa.world","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2007/dec/28/usa.world","fields":{"headline":"The growth of local power is a bright spot in seven bleak years of Bush","bodyText":"The centre cannot hold, and that's the good news in the United States these days. Quietly, doggedly, cities, regions, counties and states have refused to march to the Bush administration's drum when it comes to climate change, the environment and the war. Some of the recent changes are so sweeping that they will probably drag the nation along with them - notably efforts by Vermont, Massachusetts and California to set higher vehicle emissions standards and generally treat climate change as an environmental problem that can be addressed by regulation. The Bush administration has notoriously dragged its feet on doing anything about climate change, and it will now be dragged along by the states, themselves prodded forward by citizens. It wasn't supposed to work that way. States' rights was a rallying cry for conservatives for much of the 20th century, first in allowing segregation and racial discrimination across the south and then in allowing environmental destruction around the west. Rightwingers have usually believed in a weak federal government - except when they run it; and that weakness, or rather the strength of the local, has been one of the bright spots during the seven bleak years of life under Bush. The changes operate on all scales. Across the country, quite a lot of cities and towns have passed measures condemning the Iraq war or calling for the troops to be brought home. A handful of California counties have banned GM agriculture, and others have tried but been defeated by industry money - but may try again. North Dakota farmers created so powerful a pact against the use of Monsanto's GM wheat that the corporation eventually gave up on commercialising the invention worldwide. My own city, San Francisco, has made plans to issue identity cards to undocumented immigrants, attempted to legalise same-sex marriage a few years back, and as of November 20 2007 banned plastic grocery bags in supermarkets and pharmacies as a step towards banning them altogether. San Francisco, which is as much a peninsular republic unto itself as an irritation on the left edge of the superpower, has also gone for solar energy in a big way, kerbside compost pick-up as part of a successful programme to radically reduce landfill, and various other green programmes (though affluence itself is environmentally devastating, and we also have lots of big cars and air traffic). We are also trying out a universal healthcare plan. Since a 2005 national mayors' conference, more than 500 mayors from around the country have vowed to make their cities comply with or exceed the Kyoto accords, even while the federal government stalls. Any bleak picture you may have of the American hinterland as a vast sprawl of big-box stores, soulless suburbs and mindless consumption isn't wrong, but is incomplete. Eating locally, starting community gardens in the inner city, supporting and spreading farmer's markets, growing organically, promoting bicycle use, creating denser, more alternative, transport-friendly housing, increasing solar and wind technology, and building greener are all proliferating parts of the contemporary landscape too. Portions of New Orleans, for example, are being rebuilt to be energy efficient, use alternative energy and generally be green. Detroit is full of community gardens and experiments with local economies. As Los Angeles becomes a more and more Latino city, it develops more neighbourhoods of small businesses and lively pedestrian life. From abroad, viewers mostly see this country as its federal government, the government that brought on a belligerent foreign policy while refusing to address the crises of climate change. It's more than fair to say that the federal government could not behave this way without implicit consent from the majority of the governed. And from afar, it's hard to see how tacit that consent is, or how much dissent is part of the landscape - it's a big part, especially on climate change. Alexis de Tocqueville noted about 160 years ago that Americans had a talent for congregating in groups and organisations, so there's nothing new about the way that existing environmental groups and new grassroots organisations have taken up that issue. But it is exciting. Last year in Vermont the environmental writer Bill McKibben and a few college students started a walk across the state, something that grew into a thousand-person march to demand positive action on climate change. This push went for federal legislation to stipulate a reduction of 80% in climate-change gases by 2020, a far more radical standard than most have yet broached. A weaker federal bill is under consideration, and, pushed by his constituents, the Vermont senator, Bernie Sanders, continues to work towards far tougher regulations. However, the big changes may be made by an end run around the federales. Since 2002, California has been battling the federal government for the right to set emissions standards for vehicles within the state. Since more than 10% of the nation's population lives in California, any such regulation could change the face of the domestic auto industry, and so both car-makers and the White House have tried to defeat the measures. Happily, they have lost. One step came when Massachusetts sued to get the Environmental Protection Agency to stop saying that it didn't have the power to regulate greenhouse gas emissions; the state won in the supreme court in the autumn of 2006. Another landmark came in November when a federal circuit court for the west struck down national vehicle mileage standards that increase efficiency by one mile per gallon, which California's attorney general called \"pathetic\". Soon afterwards, the attorney general joined 16 states in demanding that Congress prevent the Bush administration from blocking its 2002 motor vehicle greenhouse-gas emissions law. Change for the better largely comes from the bottom up, and in a decentralised country it doesn't always have to reach the top to matter. These changes that are afoot across the US suggest that the federal government may become increasingly irrelevant on many issues. The centre cannot hold, Yeats wrote; his next line is \"Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world\". Anarchism in the contemporary sense of decentralised direct democracy is on the loose, and that's the rest of the good news. Globally, as the nation-state becomes increasingly less meaningful - a provider of positive goods and more and more just an army and some domestic enforcement - people are withdrawing to shape and support more localised forms of organisation and power. To the extent that it's part of that civilised and localising world, the same is true of the US. · Rebecca Solnit is the author of Hope in the Dark: The Untold History of People Power comment@theguardian.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2007/aug/20/energy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2007-08-19T23:09:21Z","webTitle":"Housebuilders win battle against green technologies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/aug/20/energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2007/aug/20/energy","fields":{"headline":"Housebuilders win battle against green technologies","bodyText":"The government is preparing to torpedo a local authority policy which has been one of the few genuine drivers of renewable energy technologies in Britain, the Guardian has learned. The Department for Communities and Local Government is to in effect abolish the so-called \"Merton rule\", under pressure from housebuilders who do not want to bear the cost of adding things like solar panels to the buildings they construct or the effort of marketing them as \"green\". The decision to axe the Merton rule comes a week after the Guardian revealed that officials at the business and enterprise department had admitted the country had no hope of meeting EU targets on renewables over the next 13 years and had advised ministers to find ways to wriggle out of the targets. The Merton rule is named after the London borough that established it in 2003. It requires any new building to reduce its carbon emissions by 10% through the use of renewables. More than 150 local authorities have either introduced it or are about to. In the absence of a proper interest in renewables from central government, the Merton rule has become central to tentative steps towards a low carbon future. But housing minister Yvette Cooper, who last year wanted all local authorities to adopt a Merton rule, will soon publish a new draft planning policy statement which outlines the abolition of the rule. Adrian Hewitt, principal environment officer at Merton council, said: \"The new draft ... on climate change confirms our absolute worst fears. The Merton rule and any mention of local authorities being able to secure a percentage of renewable energy on new buildings seems as if it's going to be airbrushed out of history like a dissident from an old Soviet photograph.\" The communities and local government department is holding a \"sounding board\" meeting on Tuesday to discuss the new draft policy statement and will run into protest from concerned groups. The Royal Institute of British Architects yesterday attacked the government's apparent U-turn on the Merton Rule. RIBA president Jack Pringle said: \"The RIBA strongly believes that local authorities should be free to demand higher building standards than those set nationally. \"Individual local authorities can play a huge role in driving innovation and can themselves become beacons of sustainability. If the reports are true and this ability will be lost, that will be detrimental to the government's goal of reducing carbon emissions from buildings.\" On the other side of the argument is the House Builders Federation. Ms Cooper has been heavily lobbied by the group, which argues for a national, rather than local, strategy for the government's plan for new homes to be zero carbon from 2016. The federation's chairman, Stewart Baseley, wants a national strategy phased in over 10 years and says action at local level will lead to confusion and higher costs. \"Local authority political posturing for the green ground with ever-more unaffordable and potentially unachievable targets, and taking no responsibility for how these targets are to be achieved, will serve no one's interests,\" he said recently. Renewable industry representatives say the Merton Rule is many times more important to them than the government's low carbon buildings programme, which provides grants but has repeatedly run out of money and had its rules changed. The sources say that the U-turn on the Merton rule makes a mockery of the consultation: half of all respondents supported the Merton rule and only three of 324 objected to it on grounds of cost. Tony Book, head of a company called Riomay which is involved in several solar energy projects in London, said the rule only added 3-4% to building costs. \"It has driven some really big projects here in London. The solar thermal project we are installing on the old Arsenal stadium at Highbury is the biggest of its kind in the world. It would not have been done without the Merton rule,\" he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theguardian/2007/dec/09/obsextra3.observerspecial1","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2007-12-09T11:02:42Z","webTitle":"The wind of change?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2007/dec/09/obsextra3.observerspecial1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/2007/dec/09/obsextra3.observerspecial1","fields":{"headline":"The wind of change?","bodyText":"MAJOR changes in support for renewable energy schemes, and for aid to house owners and businesses, will be needed if the government is to achieve its ambitious goals on carbon emission cuts. This is the consensus that has emerged since the government committed to 'a technological revolution' that would help Britain tackle global warming. As international delegates gathered for the UN climate change summit in Bali last week, Britain placed itself in the vanguard of nations seeking to set up an effective carbon emissions strategy in the wake of the Kyoto agreement. So far, Prime Minister Gordon Brown has received cautious support for his stance. However, at home, ministers will need to radically rethink their climate, energy and transport policies, and their integration. In particular, new road schemes and airport expansion plans now sit incongruously with aspirations to cut carbon dioxide emissions. Several motorway widening and runway construction schemes could therefore be early victims of Brown's new green agenda. In addition, a new approach to the funding of the generation of energy by wind, wave and tides will be needed - though few doubt that renewable energy can play a comprehensive role in power generation in Britain. One recent study by the Carbon Trust has shown that there will be a power gap of at least 14 gigawatts between supply and demand for electricity by 2015. This discrepancy - the equivalent, roughly, of the output of 10 electricity generating stations - will occur as old nuclear plants and coal stations are closed down. The government is committed to building new nuclear plants but has yet to say how many. Renewable energy could still have a significant part to play in making up this balance, says the Trust, but its introduction is being hampered by the current policy approach. A key problem is the renewable obligation system by which consumers pay extra cash for power generated in a carbon-friendly manner. It is, by far, the most important method Britain has worked out for funding carbon-friendly power. More than £14bn will have been paid out through renewable obligations by 2020, it is estimated. But the system fails to provide sufficient help for developers wanting to bring new types of carbon-friendly power, such as tidal, wave and offshore wind, on to the market. Instead, mature renewable plants - onshore wind farms that are cheaper than new, untried marine systems - are favoured. 'We therefore need to adjust the renewable obligation certificate system to put this right,' says James Wilde, director of insights for the Carbon Trust. Certainly, offshore wind farms have considerable potential. They cost more but are blasted by far more energetic winds. At present, it costs about £900,000 a megawatt for onshore wind-generated electricity, compared with between £1.3m and £1.5m from an offshore generator. But in the North Sea or Atlantic, gales sweep over these great devices in ways that we are, thankfully, spared from on land. Operators therefore get several percentage points more power from an offshore farm than an onshore one, which helps recoup some of that extra outlay. And given Britain's expertise in North Sea oil work, the potential for industrial development is considerable, says Paul O'Brien, a renewable energy expert with Scottish Development International. 'After all, we are good at putting things in the water and keeping them there.' However, unless the government takes firm action, those offshore farms won't happen, and the tidal and wave power plants that are being developed in their wake, will not make it to the grid either. The latter are considered particularly important. While countries such as Japan have taken an international lead in developing solar energy plants, and Germany and Denmark have done the same with wind plants, Britain still has a strong chance of making a mark in marine renewable energy. This point was stressed by Gordon Brown in his first full speech on climate change last month. Brown said he wanted Britain to become a 'world leader' in building a low-carbon economy, which could lead to thousands of new British businesses, hundreds of thousands of new jobs and a 'vast export market'. And Britain has already made some important steps to such a goal. It has set up a facility in Orkney (Emec, the European Marine Energy Centre) where devices such as Pelamis, a wave power plant that looks like a floating train set, and Lunar Energy's seabed tidal power generators, went through rigorous trials. Sixty of the latter devices have been selected by the power generator E.On to form a tidal power farm off the Pembrokeshire coast. Such moves are encouraging, but there are still issues to overcome if Britain is to become the Denmark or Japan of marine power. The most important of these concerns the country's notorious inability to take promising prototype machines and turn them into full-scale commercial devices. Not enough support is given for this, and it will be a measure of the government's commitment to exploiting the promise of marine energy if it provides funds for this critical gap in the system. In addition, while the next generation of renewable power plants possess few of the drawbacks of onshore wind farms that enrage walkers, landowners, and heritage groups because of their visual impact, they still have environmental drawbacks. Power from these plants has to be carried to cities, adding to the strain already placed on electricity lines that run from the north to the south. These can be upgraded, but such moves are highly controversial. A plan to improve the Beauly-Denny electricity link through the heart of Scotland, a move that would see pylon heights doubling, is now bogged down in a lengthy inquiry following protests by more than 18,000 people. The answer is to build underground or sub-sea cables, but these are more expensive. The government may therefore be forced to intervene to provide the necessary funds, at a cost of billions of pounds. In addition, improvements in tax and council tax rebates, and in grants, will be needed to encourage householders to improve insulation and install renewable energy devices, say green campaigners. Perhaps, as Nicholas Stern warns, it will be a choice of either paying up now or paying the real price later."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"society/2006/sep/20/communities2","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2006-09-19T23:07:18Z","webTitle":"Clean, green and lean","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2006/sep/20/communities2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2006/sep/20/communities2","fields":{"headline":"Clean, green and lean","bodyText":"Domestic solar heating panels installed by Kirklees metropolitan council in West Yorkshire represent around 5% of the total amount of solar electricity generated in the UK. The scheme, which is reducing tenants' electricity bills by up to £50 a year, led to the council winning an Ashden award for sustainable energy in July this year. \"To low-income tenants, a £40 or £50 a year saving means being able to keep the fridge running all the time, or extra money in your pocket,\" says Kirklees environment officer Kate Parsons. The 500-home installation is the largest domestic establishment of solar power in the country. At Kirklees, a one kilowatt photovoltaic (PV) installation generates 20% of a typical home's needs. A three square metre (sqm) solar thermal system is even more efficient, generating 60% of a home's hot water requirement. Across 500 properties, that leads to a saving of 175 tonnes of CO2 emissions a year. The council's commitment to solar began in the early 1990s, when it created a 19-strong environment unit, installed the first solar energy systems and set up a sustainable energy fund. But the programme stepped up a gear in 2000 when Kirklees was invited to partner Dutch and German municipalities in a pan-European bid for funds under the EU's SunCities programme. This encourages councils to make sustainable energy part and parcel of their sustainable community strategies. A £283,000 grant kick-started a bid for more funds with investment totalling £1.82m as Kirklees undertook to generate 400 kilowatts of total solar power output within five years. To gain maximum experience in fitting solar systems, Kirklees split this target between solar thermal and PV, and a range of different house types. It selected around 250 homes owned by the council's management company, Kirklees Neighbourhood Housing (KNH), two 40-bed care homes in Netherton and Newsome, a luxury warehouse conversion, Titanic Mill in Linthwaite and 31 new properties owned by housing association Yorkshire Housing in Primrose Hill, Huddersfield, which are nearing completion. To avoid dissipation of solar energy through the cracks and gaps of poorly insulated homes, KNH selected properties that had been brought up to the \"decent homes\" standard. After holding a tenant open day and visiting tenants individually, KNH got 100% sign-up from those in suitable homes. The installation process took two days: one day to fit the panels to the roof, and one on internal wiring. Doreen Attfield, 62, who lives in one of 12 KNH bungalows in Primrose Hill, Huddersfield, fitted with PV panels last August, expects to save far more than the average £50, thanks to this summer's sustained sunshine. \"It's done 698 kilowatt-hours (kWh) since we started. In a day it can do as much as 7kWh, and I even got 5kWh in winter sun. I'm all electric, so if the solar panels take care of it during the day my main expense will be Economy 7 at night.\" As well as contributing to Kirklees' drive to reduce carbon emissions, KNH energy officer Richard Garner says the project helps meet the organisation's long-term policy aims. \"If it gives our tenants more money to spend, that's more money going into the local economy, and that makes the communities more sustainable.\" Low fuel bills Likewise, Yorkshire Housing development programme manager Jim Reed hopes that lifelong low fuel bills will make its 31 new homes in Huddersfield more attractive to tenants and reduce the knock-on costs associated with tenant turnover. But despite the need to cut carbon emissions by 12.5% from a 1990 baseline to fulfil the UK's Kyoto commitments, Kirklees is a lonely pioneer. Solar power is a proven technology and is the most cost-effective option in the renewable energy menu open to housing providers - it has a better ratio of kW/h generated per pound spent than wind turbines, ground source heat pumps or fuel cell technology. But installation is expensive and there is no obligation on landlords to take action. Reed regrets there is no policy framework to boost social landlords' take-up of solar power. \"The social sector is encouraged to do so, but there's not a lot down in writing to help us. And it's come at a time when our grant framework has been constrained and build costs have gone up, so we've to work out our priorities.\" The government's proposed Code for Sustainable Homes does promote renewable energy, but its implementation date has slipped from April to late this year. And as it only applies to newbuild, the code will do nothing to encourage retro-fitting of renewable energy technologies. Rather than policy sticks, however, Kirklees and its tenants are hoping for financial carrots. If solar households could sell back electricity they do not use to the electricity supply companies - perhaps through an intermediary company - then each property could be a mini solar-power station. Currently, the excess is donated, with the perverse effect that government grants for solar systems actually subsidise the electricity providers. Creating such a market mechanism could help reduce payback periods for solar installations and the need for grant subsidies. The arguments are clear to solar power user Doreen Attfield. \"A lot of older people say [global warming] isn't going to bother us. But it will bother my children and my grandchildren. And when you think about what's happening in the world today and how we're running out of oil, we're going to be over a barrel, aren't we? I think we should all do what we can, not just for greenhouse gases, but the economy as well.\" The price of power: how much does solar cost? Solar thermal installations on existing Kirklees homes cost £1,000 each, while the PV arrays cost around £5,000. Taking Kirklees' conservative savings estimate of £50 per property per year, the pay-back time for solar thermal is 20 years, while PV takes 100 years to pay for itself. However, break-even point will be reached faster in a PV household that is all-electric compared to a property that has gas-fired central heating. Typical grant funding of around 50% has the effect of halving the pay-back period. Kirklees enjoyed a 60% grant. As well as its £283,000 EU grant, it won £970,000 from the Department of Trade and Industry's Major PV programme, invested £351,000 from its own sustainable energy fund and had contributions from Kirklees Neighbourhood Housing, Yorkshire Housing, Kirklees Community Association and property developer Lowry Renaissance Fund - the developer of Titanic Mill. The total funding package was £1.82m.

I would never think to write so objectionably against my fellow citizens who are Protestants. We Catholics are still fair game. The jury is out on nuclear power's contribution to reducing pollution, but what is certain is that any money the government is willing to invest in the transition to a low-carbon economy should go to areas that will deliver the greatest returns. That's not nuclear. The Tory Quality of Life Policy Group recommends zero subsidies for nuclear and suggests that nuclear providers should demonstrate an ability to cover future costs of waste disposal and decommissioning. My view, shared by all the energy experts I've consulted, remains that there can be no new nuclear power without government support. Our emphasis is on a massive energy efficiency drive. We recommend following Germany's example: anyone generating electricity from solar, wind or hydro is guaranteed a payment of four times the market rate for 20 years. The system boosts take-up by consumers by reducing the pay-back times on such investments to under 10 years, compared with 25 or 30 years in Britain. As a result, Germany has 200 times as much solar energy as Britain. We also propose the introduction of a levy that would charge the large-scale plants, including nuclear, for the heat they generate which is wasted. Zac Goldsmith Richmond, London Happy ending wanted Cristina Odone's article 'Let's all grow old and grey together' (Comment, last week) struck a very strong chord with me. Being in my early 80s, but still (I claim!) of sound mind, I worry endlessly about the probably stressful route to my eventual demise. As a retired professor, I live alone and have few funds to cushion my gradual decline into the real horrors of old age. And my exceptional children are not in a position to help financially to any significant degree. Odone's suggestion of creating caring establishments, owned and run by like-minded friends, and catering not just to the bingo-playing fraternity but to those who retain an interest in the world about us, is like manna. But how? I have lived a peripatetic life and, here in rural Hampshire I have few close friends of the appropriate age range with whom to create and run such an enterprise.Any ideas would be welcome. Ian Mackintosh Headley Down, Hampshire Why we need a new Goya Contemporary conflicts may have inspired a surge in 'fine art' but, in my opinion, contemporary Western 'war/protest' artists have failed to express a true ethical response to suffering and remembrance that produced the First World War paintings of CRW Nevinson, John Nash, Felix Valloton, Percy Smith, among others ('Iraq inspires surge of protest art', World, last week). The shock of Abu Ghraib was in the casual, mundane nature of the photographs that parallel the scenes in and reaction to Goya's Disasters of War. Every person with a genuine concern for human rights and the dignity of man was outraged by the images of torture and humiliation, but the attitude and approach of artists, such as Fernando Botero or Richard Serra, has been feeble and lazy. They plundered the visual media for the 'shock factor' and exploited the victims of terror. Contemporary painters should refuse to compete with the butchery circulated daily by the media. Only then will art find its own voice to respond to the horror of modern conflict. Breandan O Suilleabhain Connemara, Co Galway Why are men so stupid? Only a man could have made the daft suggestion that women be given a grant in the seventh month of pregnancy to encourage them to eat healthily (News, last week).

Now the UN experts offer some hope and spell out how to tackle the problem. This report, the third from the panel this year, contains few surprises - by definition the IPCC must base its conclusions on already published material - but it still has the power to shock. Even the most strident and expensive action to curb greenhouse gas emissions, the report says, will see global temperatures still increase by at least 2C, defined by the EU as \"dangerous\". We are heading for hostile territory. To limit that rise to 2.4C, the report says, our emissions must peak by 2015 - an unlikely scenario, particularly given they are increasing at record levels in many parts of the world. Peaking just five years later in 2020 would bring an extra 0.4C rise; by 2030 that climbs further to a full 3C over pre-industrial levels. If pollution continues to worsen until 2060, then we face a full 5C rise at best. All of these estimates, a key footnote to the report warns, are probably underestimates. How to bring about such a change? Energy efficiency, renewable supplies such as wind and solar energy and better insulated houses all feature. So do biofuels, nuclear power, changes in forestry practice and waste disposal. In other words, technology we already have at our fingertips. By 2030, the report sees the wider use of carbon capture and storage as a way to offset the inevitable increase in coal in the booming developing economies of China and India. None of this will be cheap, or easy. The IPCC warns of \"vested interests\" in the fossil fuel industry and says, as hard as it looks, it cannot find a strategy to save the planet that will also save money. And while lifestyle changes made by individuals get a mention for the first time, written heavy between the lines on each of the report's 35 pages is the message that it is the responsibility of governments to force through the required changes.

Otherwise, it will upset the organic water filtration system.\" It's safe to say that my wife is not as enthusiastic as I am about staying in a Norman eco-gîte. She's seen the pictures of the glass and earth building on the website and is not impressed. I knew that this trip would be a hard sell. We were going to stay in the first earthship holiday home in Europe - a totally off-grid, power-generating, water-collecting miracle cottage. I've been hooked on earthships since I first set eyes on one in 2003, so much so that I wrote a book about them. But while my wife appreciates the intelligent design, she is less convinced about spend her hard-earned holiday in one. A pretty guest house or a chateau would do her nicely, thank you. But the earthship's owner Kevan Trott is expecting us so there's no backing out now. We get the train to Portsmouth and settle into our cabin for the overnight crossing to Saint Malo. \"It's even got a shower. With shampoo,\" my wife says. \"Why don't we just stay here?\" Invented by US architect Mike Reynolds in the desert of New Mexico, earthships got their name because they \"float free\" from infrastructure - the pipes and cables that connect most homes to mains water, gas, electricity and sewerage - by providing these services themselves. And also because earth - rammed into old car tyres - forms the main building material of their thick walls. Kevan's earthship is on the edge of the small village of Ger, midway between Saint Malo and Caen and surrounded by hills, pastures, woods and orchards. He built it last year with his wife Gillian and a team of volunteers after being inspired to get involved at a talk given by Reynolds in Brighton five years ago. After driving for just over an hour from Saint Malo we find Ger where a friendly cyclist directs us to the earthship, 200m out of the village. \"It looks like a giant greenhouse,\" says my wife. \"Shame we're not staying in one of those instead.\" She points to the picturesque stone cottages dotted around the site. But this, I insist, is a unique opportunity. It's the only earthship in Europe available to rent as a holiday home - the rest are either lived in or, like the two in the UK, are non-residential buildings. It is a chance to have a go at genuine low-carbon living and also to marvel at - and understand - a home that can deliver almost all its occupants' needs with minimal running costs and practically zero carbon emissions. The reason it looks like a greenhouse is because it works in a similar way. The building faces south with vast windows to capture the maximum amount of sunlight and heat possible, so that only the very coldest of nights require heating - provided by a wood burning fire. Inside, it smells of earth and wood. There is a kitchen and living room, three bedrooms and a bathroom. The view through the windows takes in cottages and fields. We settle in, relax and bathe in the warm sunlight, listening to birdsong and snorting horses. It would be easy to do nothing here, but there's plenty to do around Ger. We explore the network of ancient sunken paths that wind through the fields, heathland and woods. The pace of life seems slow and the agriculture of low intensity. We make it back from our walk as the rain sets in. \"At the moment those 10,000 litre cisterns are filling up with water for us,\" I enthuse. My wife listens to my eco-babble patiently before taking a shower. \"Was your shower OK without the shampoo?\" I ask later over goats cheese salad and local cider in the earthship kitchen. \"Great. It's so nice knowing you're bathing in rainwater heated by the sun,\" she replies with unexpected enthusiasm. \"When are we going to build ours?\" Kevin Telfer · earthship-france.com, from £600 a week.

Alas no. What the UN environment report said was that an area of the Sahara 800km x 800km (800km squared, not 800 sq km) could do that: 640,000 sq km, or in square miles 250,000 (not 310). The total area of the Sahara is more than 9,000,000 sq km. The 500 million people who live in the world's desert regions can expect to find life increasingly unbearable as already high temperatures soar and the available water is used up or turns salty, according to the United Nations. Desert cities in the US and Middle East, such as Phoenix and Riyadh, may be living on borrowed time as water tables drop and supplies become undrinkable, says a report coinciding with today's world environment day. Twentieth-century modernist dreams of greening deserts by diverting rivers and mining underground water are wholly unrealistic, it warns. But the report also proposes that deserts become the powerhouses of the next century, capturing the world's solar energy and potentially exporting electricity across continents. For instance, a 310-square mile area of the Sahara could, with today's technology, generate enough electricity for the whole world. The problem now facing many communities on the fringes of deserts, says the UN environment programme report, is not the physical growth of deserts but that rising water tables beneath irrigated soils are leading to more salinisation - a phenomenon already taking place across large tracts of China, India, Pakistan and Australia. The Tarm river basin in China, it says, has lost more than 5,000 square miles of farmland to salinisation in a period of 30 years. The report suggests that Middle Eastern countries such as Saudi Arabia have used water from the desert very unwisely. Rather than growing staple crops such as wheat or tomatoes, it suggests that precious water should be used only for high value crops such as dates and fish farming. The mining \"fossil\" water, laid down many millions of years ago, was once believed to have the potential to green deserts, but is now not thought to be a solution - except in Libya, where opinion is divided as to whether supplies may last 100 or 500 years. But the greatest threat to people and wildlife living anywhere near deserts is climate change, which is already having a greater impact on desert regions than elsewhere. The Dashti Kbir desert in Iran has seen a 16% drop in rainfall in the past 25 years, the Kalahari a 12% decline and Chile's Atacama desert an 8% drop. Most deserts, says the report, will see temperatures rise by 5-7C by the end of the century and rainfall drop 10-20%. This will greatly increase evaporation and dust storms, and will move deserts closer to communities living on their edges. The problems of more heat and lower rainfall are being compounded by the melting of glaciers in mountainous regions. These waters sustain life in deserts but would be perilously close to drying up if global warming continued as expected. The glaciers in the mountains of south Asia are expected to decline by 40% to 80% in the next century with profound effects on large populations in Bangladesh, Pakistan, India and China. Much of the water used for farming the south-west US, central Asia and around the Andes is drawn from rivers that originate in snow-covered mountains, says the report. Development in the next 100 years is largely contingent on what happens to the climate. However, the report envisages that deserts will become more popular tourist destinations and that some of the plants that grow there could be \"crops of the future\". \"Deserts are threatened as never before by climate change, overexploitation of water and salinisation,\" said Professor Andrew Warren of University College London, one of the report's authors. \"We risk losing not only astounding landscapes and ancient cultures but also wild species that may hold keys to our survival.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2007/aug/13/greenpolitics.uk","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2007-08-13T14:35:48Z","webTitle":"Meeting energy target will be 'major challenge'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/aug/13/greenpolitics.uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2007/aug/13/greenpolitics.uk","fields":{"headline":"Meeting energy target will be 'major challenge'","bodyText":"The government today admitted that meeting the new European Union renewable energy target will prove a \"major challenge\" following a leaked report obtained by the Guardian that reveals officials have briefed ministers that it was an impossibility. The briefing paper by officials at the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform warned that the UK \"has achieved little so far on renewables\" and was set to fall far short of the EU target of generating 20% of its energy from renewable sources by 2020. The energy minister, Malcolm Wicks, however, said today that the government was on course to meet its own target of generating 15% of Britain's electricity from renewable sources by 2015. But he acknowledged the EU target - which covers total energy production including heat and transport - was more demanding, as he declined to be drawn on whether the 20% target could be met on time. \"We are moving steadily year after year in the right direction,\" Mr Wicks told BBC Radio 4's the World at One. \"We are ambitious about renewables and I am absolutely determined that we move forward on renewables. I am confident that we will play our role in the European Union hitting that very, very demanding target. We are committed on climate change, we are committed on renewables.\" According to the DBERR document, the best Britain can hope for is to raise the level of renewable energy generation from 5% at present to around 9% by the end of the target period. It suggested ministers should consider \"what options there are for statistical interpretations of the target that would make it easier to achieve\". Ministers will face further questions over their environmental credentials when MPs return to Westminster in the autumn, with the chairman of the environmental audit select committee suggesting today that it would investigate the government's record on renewables as part of a wider inquiry into biofuels. Tim Yeo, Conservative MP for Suffolk South, told Guardian Unlimited: \"The very strong impression is that we are not making enough progress [on renewable energy]. If the concerns are growing we may want to look more widely into this before very long.\" Tony Blair signed up to the tough EU target alongside other European leaders shortly before standing down as prime minister. Downing Street today said it was now up to the European commission to come up with ideas to deliver the \"ambitious\" new target. A No 10 spokeswoman said: \"It is no secret that these are ambitious targets and it will be a major challenge to meet them, not just for the UK but for all EU states. It is now for the commission to propose how the EU-wide targets should be met.\" The Liberal Democrat environment spokesman, Chris Huhne, said it was clear ministers were trying to \"wriggle out\" of their commitments on renewables. \"If government efforts are now to be taken seriously, and not just seen as green window-dressing, ministers must now come forward with an action plan to boost renewables,\" he said. Mike Childs of Friends of the Earth said the leaked document showed officials were actively trying to weaken the government's commitment to renewables. \"What this document clearly shows is that civil servants are working away to try to undermine that target,\" he told The World at One. \"What they are trying to do is weaken it far as possible. It does give a very interesting insight to the way government operates when it comes to reacting to ambitions agreed to at an EU level by heads of state.\" Jeremy Leggett, a former member of the gGovernment's renewables advisory board who now runs a solar energy company, said senior officials in Whitehall did not believe renewables could \"cut the mustard\" as a major energy source. The DBERR pointed to a pledge in the recent energy white paper to increase renewable electricity threefold to 15% by 2015 as proof of the government's commitment to renewables. Meanwhile, the communities secretary, Hazel Blears, today signalled plans to remove some of the red tape hampering green technologies. The minister has asked Entec - a leading environmental and planning consultancy - to draw up new rules which allow small-scale low carbon technology such as wind turbines and solar panels to be set up without costly planning applications."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2007/mar/28/leadersandreply.mainsection","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2007-03-27T23:07:03Z","webTitle":"Corrections and clarifications","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/mar/28/leadersandreply.mainsection","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2007/mar/28/leadersandreply.mainsection","fields":{"headline":"Corrections and clarifications","bodyText":"In a report headed Oligarch buys up French hotels, page 25, yesterday, we described Leonard (Len) Blavatnik as a Russian.

The announcement that the government is giving the go-ahead to a new generation of nuclear plants is based on this premise. Ministers warn that renewable sources of energy are not able to provide enough electricity to meet our needs. This is nonsense. There is plenty of renewable capacity, including renewable sources that can provide constant supply and be timed to meet peaks of demand. But the starting point for any serious energy policy has got to be energy saving. Reducing wastage in energy production and saving on wasteful energy consumption are two very simple measures that can slash our energy needs, making a new generation of nuclear power plants unnecessary and redundant. The government's 2002 Energy Review (pdf) advised that the UK could cut its energy needs by one-third through a comprehensive programme of energy conservation in homes, offices and factories, including double-glazing, loft insulation, draft exclusion, energy-efficient boilers and appliances, and switching to low-energy light bulbs. This large-scale energy saving programme would, in addition, create tens of thousands of new jobs and boost the economy. More efficient industrial motors in factories could enable us to save enough electricity to shut down four nuclear power stations, according to Friends of the Earth. If the whole country switched to low-energy light bulbs, we could save the equivalent of the electricity generated by one nuclear power plant. Currently, around 60-70% of energy is lost in conventional oil, gas and coal-fired power stations. There could be immense savings through more efficient fuel-to-energy conversion technologies and by building combined heat and power plants to pump waste hot air and water into local factories and homes. In addition to saving huge amounts of energy through conservation, we can also generate vast amounts of energy from renewable sources that are credible, practical and effective. The government's own estimates, commissioned from the Carbon Trust, suggest that all the UK's energy needs could be met from sustainable, non-global warming sources. Microgeneration is a massively under-exploited system of energy generation in the UK. A study undertaken by the Energy Saving Trust (pdf) for the Department of Trade &amp; Industry suggested that by 2050, microgeneration could provide 30% to 40% of the UK's electricity needs and help reduce household carbon emissions by 15%. The forms of microgeneration identified as viable included solar photovoltaics, wind turbines and small-scale hydro (in suitable areas), ground source heat pumps (GSHP), bio-energy, mini-combined heat and power, and hydrogen energy and fuel cells. Offshore wind farms could comfortably generate the same amount of electricity as 12 nuclear power stations. One recent report suggested that existing and proposed wind turbines could produce 20GW of clean electricity - around 17% of our total electricity needs - by 2020. Friends of the Earth calculates that wave power could match the electricity output of 8.5 nuclear reactors. Since waves are constant in the rougher seas where wave power facilities would be sited, wave energy can help ensure constant supplies of electricity. Tidal power is another major option. It is capable of producing around 12% of our electricity needs. Just one project, the proposed (pdf) Severn estuary tidal lagoons scheme, has the potential to fulfil almost (pdf) 7% of the UK's electricity demand. An additional 5% or more of UK demand could be met by tidal schemes in Liverpool Bay and several other estuaries. The great strength of the tidal lagoons system (pdf), as opposed to the tidal barrage proposed for the Severn estuary, is that its impact on the environment is much less and its generating power much greater (around 25% to 40% greater). Moreover, tidal lagoons can help solve the energy baseload problem by capturing and holding incoming tides in giant reservoirs and then releasing the tides through turbines to generate power at times of peak demand. A variation on the tidal lagoons system involves under-sea turbines that turn and generate power based on the ebb and flow of the tides. These can be submerged out of sight at depths of up to 20 to 40 metres to take advantage of deeper sea tidal flows. Since tides are constant, this renewable source can provide constant power to the grid. Other renewable sources include solar power, which actually generates energy from light, with or without the sun's rays. This means that it works even in less sun-endowed climates like the UK's. Within five years, Germany will generate as much of its electricity from solar power as we currently generate from nuclear (around 20%). We could match and exceed Germany if we made solar panels the universal, mandatory roofing material for all domestic, industrial, commercial and public buildings. New cheap, ultra-thin solar foil has the potential to be mass applied to rooves and a wide range of other surfaces. This would massively increase the UK's solar generating capacity. Using this technology the US company Nanosolar says it can cut the cost of solar power to 50p a watt and can build a 10MW solar power station within nine months, compared to the 10-plus years for a coal-fired plant and at least 15 years for a nuclear reactor. If we need a quick-fix to an energy shortfall, solar is one of the fastest, cheapest options. Other big breakthroughs in solar technology are being pioneered by the Cardiff-based company, G24 Innovations, which has developed much cheaper ways of producing solar energy than traditional photovoltaic panels. Another alternative is rolling hydro power, which involves placing turbines on river-beds to capture the power of river flows; and mini-hydro electric schemes, which can operate productively on even very small streams. A new frontier technology is hydro pressure from the gas pipe network. Mini-turbines in gas pipes could utilise natural variations and changes in gas pressure to produce electricity. This technology is producing promising test results in the US, Switzerland and Italy. Geothermal power has some potential in the UK, but our best bet would to import from Iceland, via undersea cables, electricity generated from its geo-thermal (and hydro) sources. Having access to renewable energy from Iceland as a back up, could be another way to ensure baseload top-ups at times when demand surges. One other possible import is electricity produced by concentrated solar power (CSP). This technology, already successfully trialled in the US and Spain, involves giant mirror farms in desert regions like southern Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece, Cyprus and north Africa. CSP uses these mirrors to concentrate the sun's rays to create intense heat to drive turbines and generate electricity, which could then be exported by grid to the UK and elsewhere. The heat captured in the day can be stored overnight to provide on-going electric power after dark; which means that constant energy can be supplied to the grid until the next sunrise. Scientists have calculated that by covering less than 1% of the world's desert regions with the concentrated solar power stations, we could produce enough power to meet the entire world's electricity needs. On very positive side benefit of CSP technology it that could also aid the economic development of sun-rich but often arid, under-developed regions. In particular, an energy partnership between the UK-EU and north African countries could be the basis of a new north-south alliance, which may also increase the chances of these countries embracing democratisation and rejecting fundamentalism. All these various practical non-nuclear energy options are discussed by Roger Higman of Friends of the Earth, in my online TV programme Talking With Tatchell, which you can watch here. So far, the government has not even considered most of these alternatives, which is a big shame and a clear dereliction of its public responsibilities. It is has instead sought to ram through a biased, flawed consultation (pdf) that was skewed in favour of the nuclear option, as I explained in my previous article. I would urge MPs of all parties to reject Gordon Brown's \"there is no alternative\" mantra, and to vote down the nuclear option. Renewable green energy technologies are cheaper, faster, safer and cleaner than nuclear, gas, coal or oil - and they can produce all our energy needs, in perpetuity."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk/2007/jul/25/ruralaffairs.science","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2007-07-25T22:47:47Z","webTitle":"Renewable energy projects will devour huge amounts of land, warns researcher","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/jul/25/ruralaffairs.science","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2007/jul/25/ruralaffairs.science","fields":{"headline":"Renewable energy projects will devour huge amounts of land, warns researcher","bodyText":"Large-scale renewable energy projects will cause widespread environmental damage by industrialising vast swaths of countryside, a leading scientist claims today. The warning follows an analysis of the amount of land that renewable energy resources, including wind farms, biofuel crops and photovoltaic solar cells, require to produce substantial amounts of power. Jesse Ausubel, a professor of environmental science and director of the Human Environment programme at Rockefeller University in New York, found that enormous stretches of countryside would have to be converted into intensive farmland or developed with buildings and access roads for renewable energy plants to make a significant contribution to global energy demands. Prof Ausubel reached his conclusions by ranking renewable energies according to the amount of power they produce for each square metre of land. The assessment allows direct comparison between the different approaches, based on the impact they will have on the surrounding landscape. The analysis showed that damming rivers to make use of hydroelectric power was among the most harmful to the landscape, producing around 0.1 watts of power per square metre. The world's largest dam, the Three Gorges power station on the Yangtze in China, stores nearly 40bn cubic metres of water, submerging land that was previously home to more than 1 million people. Biofuel crops and wind energy fared better in the study, with both generating around 1.2w to a square metre. Leading the renewable energy sources were photovoltaic solar cells, which use sunlight to create electricity, at around six to seven watts to a square metre. Prof Ausubel investigated how much land renewable energies would need to provide electricity for large populations and compared them to output from nuclear power stations. In one example he showed that damming rainfall and flooding the entire Canadian province of Ontario would generate hydroelectric power equivalent to 80% of that produced by the country's 25 nuclear power plants. Another calculation revealed that to meet US energy demands for 2005 with wind power would require constant winds blowing onto wind farms covering more than 780,000 square kilometres of land, the area of Texas and Louisiana combined. A comparison of solar energy with nuclear found that a hectare of photovoltaic cells was needed to produce the same amount of power as one litre of fuel in the core of a nuclear reactor. The report breaks what Prof Ausubel calls the \"taboo of talking about the strong negative aspects of renewables\", by focusing on examples that highlight their limitations. \"When most people think of renewables and their impact, they're mistaking pleasant landscaping with what would be a massive industrial transformation of the landscape,\" he said. \"A fundamental credo of being green is that you cause minimal interference with the landscape. We should be farming less land, logging less forest and trawling less ocean - disturbing the landscape less and sparing land for nature. But all of these renewable sources of energy are incredibly invasive and aggressive with regard to nature. Renewables may be renewable, but they are not green,\" he added. The report, which appears in the International Journal of Nuclear Governance, Economy and Ecology today, also criticises plans for widespread farming of biofuels. With current technology, Prof Ausubel estimates that one to two hectares of land would be needed to produce fuel for each of the world's 700m cars and other motor vehicles. \"From an environmental point of view the biofuels business is a madness,\" he said. Prof Ausubel said that despite technical and political concerns, nuclear power plants still ranked as the most environmentally-friendly for large conurbations. \"The good news about nuclear is that over the past 50 years all of the forms of waste storage seem to have worked.\" Power compared Dams Hydroelectric energy is the least efficient way of using land to produce power. One square metre on average produces 0.1 watts. Biofuels A generator burning biomass requires crops from 250,000 hectares to match the electricity output of a nuclear power station. Wind energy Wind farms generate around 1.2 watts for every square metre of land. Solar power Photovoltaic cells covering an area of 150,000 square kilometres would be needed to meet US electricity needs for a year. To power New York city would take 12,000 square kilometres, about the size of Connecticut."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2007/jun/06/cuba.china","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2007-06-06T08:04:00Z","webTitle":"Castro gives first TV interview since surgery","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jun/06/cuba.china","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2007/jun/06/cuba.china","fields":{"headline":"Castro gives first TV interview since surgery","bodyText":"Fidel Castro appeared alert and upbeat in his first television interview since falling ill last year, but he gave no hint of a possible return to power. The Cuban leader spoke with passion about various subjects for almost 50 minutes in an interview broadcast on state television yesterday, granting the world its first proper look at the communist icon since he disappeared from public view 10 months ago. Wearing black trainers and an Adidas tracksuit in the Cuban national colours, his convalescence trademark, Mr Castro was far more robust than the spectral figure glimpsed in previous brief clips. He appeared to enjoy being back in the limelight but there was no disguising his frailty and a sense that he remains detached from day-to-day government. The 80-year-old devoted much of the interview to Vietnamese development statistics and other arcane topics. He engaged only briefly with international issues and did not say if or when he would resume ruling Cuba. He said he was focused on recuperating. \"I tell my compatriots, I'm now doing what I should be doing. There are no secrets.\" He praised his improved diet but warned he was not fully recovered. \"There are dangers that threaten the health of a human being. I don't want to disappoint.\" The interview was recorded on Monday at an undisclosed location. The furniture appeared similar to previous footage, suggesting he may be at the same hospital that has treated him for months. Randy Alonso, the host of the government's nightly Round Table programme, asked gentle, open-ended questions that the veteran leader answered at length, often straying into unrelated topics - a habit from the marathon speeches he used to give. A meeting last weekend with the general secretary of Vietnam's communist party, Nong Duc Manh, prompted Mr Castro to reminisce about the humidity he experienced during a wartime visit to Vietnam. \"How hot it was. It was like you jumped in a pool with clothes on.\" Speaking slowly and distinctly, he consulted a notebook while reeling off statistics about Vietnam's rice and coffee harvests and praising its modern toilets. Later he talked about coffee production, solar energy and food security. He made just one fleeting reference to the US president, George Bush, in the context of a summit on energy and global warming. Some analysts said Mr Castro's focus on the past rather than the future was part of the government's strategy to signal that the succession had happened and that \"el maximo comandante\" was now to be viewed as an elder statesman and a talisman, but not a chief executive. After almost half a century dominating his Caribbean island, and being a thorn in Washington's side, Mr Castro ceded power to his brother Raul last July to be treated for what is thought to be diverticulitis, a weakening of the intestine. He has not appeared in public since, but has made a choreagraphed return to visibility: he sipped orange juice in a brief video in January, phoned his Venezuelan ally Hugo Chávez in a radio programme in February. He strolled with the novelist Gabriel García Márquez in a photo published in March and meet a Chinese delegation in a brief April video. Mr Castro has also recently started penning articles that have criticised biofuels, British nuclear submarines and President Bush. Analysts have been left guessing at how much influence Mr Castro now wields over Raul. Four years younger than his more famous brother, the acting president has kept the country calm during Fidel's absence and has hinted at economic reforms to alleviate grinding poverty."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2007/jun/27/guardianextra3.guardianspecial62","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2007-06-27T08:09:25Z","webTitle":"A sustainable partnership","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/jun/27/guardianextra3.guardianspecial62","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2007/jun/27/guardianextra3.guardianspecial62","fields":{"headline":"A sustainable partnership","bodyText":"When Wal-Mart CEO Lee Scott announced in October 2005 that the world's biggest retailer was preparing to take serious action on climate change, it was a wake-up call for global business. Yet Scott's announcement that Wal-Mart had ambitions to reduce waste to zero, get all its energy from renewable sources, and sell only sustainable products came two years after Gazeley, its Milton Keynes-based warehousing subsidiary, had quietly opened its first facility based on those principles. Gazeley's website could not be more explicit: \"Welcome to Gazeley. We develop sustainable warehousing for customers.\" Jonathan Fenton-Jones, Gazeley's commercial director, says the company's ethos is that there should be no premium on sustainability. The company, one of the largest in Europe, worked with US eco-architect Bill McDonough and solar energy specialist SolarCentury to develop an \"eco-template\" for environmentally friendly warehousing. Occupiers pay no more than what they would for an unadorned tin roof and four walls, but get 11 energy- and water-saving features fitted as standard. These include solar thermal heating, storm water collection, energy-efficient lighting, recyclable floor coverings, water-saving toilets and timber from sustainable sources. All developments also feature some other renewable technology to cut occupiers' carbon footprints, such as ground source heat pumps, solar electric panels and wind turbines. The company says its occupiers enjoy average energy savings of 8%, and 50% cuts in water usage on a standard warehouse. Where Gazeley also fits out the interior of the warehouses, with low-energy heating and lighting systems, the environmental impact is much more dramatic. A 3.4m sq ft development in Milton Keynes, which John Lewis Partnership will move into in August, will cut CO2 emissions by a projected 67% compared with a standard warehouse over its 25-year life. Dino Rocos, distribution director for John Lewis Partnership, said it will be the first new distribution centre the company has built in 19 years, needed because John Lewis plans to expand from 26 branches to 36 over the coming decade. \"The thing that drew us to Gazeley was that from our very first meeting they had a green agenda,\" said Rocos. \"One of their team who was exclusively focused on the environment was involved in the development from day one. And they expected us to embrace this agenda as well.\" It was not difficult for Rocos to see the rationale of going green. The fully automated plant, which will have to power 7.5kms of conveyor belts running 24 hours a day, seven days a week, could have had dire implications for the company's carbon footprint, and cost John Lewis £200,000 in energy bills a year. As it is, the company is hoping the plant, which will get all its power from a huge wind turbine, will be carbon-neutral. \"It's good for us, and it's good for the environment,\" said Rocos. \"This has shown me that the business agenda and the green agenda can comfortably run along side each other.\" When asked how Gazeley can afford to do all this without charging its customers more than the standard market rate, Gazeley's chairman, John Duggan, makes clear that the \"eco\" in the eco-template stands for \"economical\" as well as \"ecological\". \"It adds a small percentage to the build cost,\" he says. But the eco-template design helps smooth progress through the planning system, and also attracts five-star customers, such as John Lewis, B&amp;Q and Woolworths, at an early stage in development. \"Letting them out earlier more than makes up for any extra build costs,\" Duggan says. \"There's a strong business basis for this.\""},"isHosted":false},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2007/aug/25/homes","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2007-08-24T23:18:13Z","webTitle":"Novelist Jill Dawson on leaving a cramped council flat for wide open space","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/aug/25/homes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2007/aug/25/homes","fields":{"headline":"Another country","bodyText":"I spent 11 years in a council flat in Hackney, east London, on the top floor, which, although it had its downside (I was burgled nine times), had as an upside something I prized highly: I felt cut off and a bit lonely. Feeling cut off is as necessary to me as chat around the watercooler is to others. Somehow, it produces work. I always loved the feeling that no one could reach me. In that flat I had no curtains in the kitchen, despite the police helicopters' constant twirling beams, like the blade in a liquidiser. At night I could see only the red tail lights of aeroplanes and Canary Wharf winking in the distance. I worked in my bedroom, facing a wall. So when we planned to move to Cambridgeshire, when my partner - an architect - first mentioned his desire to buy a plot of land and design us a house, I was in a panic. Maybe I won't be able to write if I live somewhere else? The trick I relied on, the assurance that if I sat down at the table in the corner of my bedroom, words would come out - might it all disappear if the table were a proper desk, the bedroom a proper study and the view the wind combing through the fen sedge like fingers through a feather, rather than a square of grey with two birds or an aeroplane in it? Our plot was on an ordinary street along with a smattering of council houses. Our home also had to be a workspace for both of us, and accommodate a teenage son and new baby. And for my partner, Meredith, it was essential that the house used as many recycled materials as possible, fitted in with the local aesthetic - no thatched barns here, but some black-clad sheds - and made use of passive solar energy. My input was minimal. Could we perhaps have a built-in bin in a sensible place in the kitchen? \"It's always such a drag to walk from one end to the other carrying a soggy teabag.\" Meredith teases me about this comment now - he's used to the demands of clients, poring over every decision. But I had confidence in him, and anyway, he does most of the cooking. The beauty of the design is that the house opens to the fens at the back. From every room - bedroom, study, kitchen, living room and bathroom - the black and green squares of fen roll in, spooling towards Ely cathedral. As we are not overlooked, I can even have a bath while staring out at that view and watching a barn owl dive over the cornfields looking for mice. The house is raised on stilts, and has a high, pointy shape, like a child's drawing, which somehow emphasises the horizontal flatness of the fens. Having such thickly insulated walls everywhere (using recycled newspaper insulation) means that I can't hear the children shouting, and having my study at the top of the house means that, yes, I still feel happily cut off. My fears of writer's block were unfounded. If anything, I'm more productive. I've written three novels in the six years since moving here (despite the upheaval of a second child, and a year renting a cottage while the house was built). This spring, Meredith finished a second building, a timber-framed, shed-like studio in the garden, from where he now runs his architectural practice, rather than the room downstairs from me. Unsurprisingly, the fen landscape I see from the windows has started to worm its way into my writing. I tried to set my last novel, Watch Me Disappear, in Yorkshire, where I grew up, but the fen sky kept drawing my eye - \"that white uncooked space, the page I left blank\" - and once I'd set it here, the writing poured out. When Watch Me Disappear was published, the novelist John Harding wrote to me asking if I lived in the village he grew up in, and naming it, because the view I describe is the one he saw every day growing up. Could I, in fact, be living in his old street? Astonishingly, I am. We're not the only writers who have found inspiration here. A friend of mine, the crime writer John Harvey, stayed in our house while we were on holiday and set his latest novel, Gone To Ground, here. Our house was Meredith's first completed building. It won the Manser Medal at the 2004 Riba awards and was nominated for countless others. One morning I awoke to find a Norwegian student filming outside, and on another occasion the \"friends\" of a local museum visited, leaving 50 pairs of shoes neatly lined up on our step. Now the studio is completed and Meredith can \"go out\" to work in the morning, I've started work on a new novel, also set in Cambridgeshire. It's just me and the words again - exactly how I like it. Jill Dawson's latest novel is Watch Me Disappear, published by Sceptre."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"environment/2007/aug/13/renewableenergy.energy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2007-08-13T11:56:55Z","webTitle":"Revealed: cover-up plan on energy target","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/aug/13/renewableenergy.energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2007/aug/13/renewableenergy.energy","fields":{"headline":"Revealed: cover-up plan on energy target","bodyText":"Government officials have secretly briefed ministers that Britain has no hope of getting remotely near the new European Union renewable energy target that Tony Blair signed up to in the spring - and have suggested that they find ways of wriggling out of it. In contrast to the government's claims to be leading the world on climate change, officials within the former Department of Trade and Industry have admitted that under current policies Britain would miss the EU's 2020 target of 20% energy from renewables by a long way. And their suggestion that \"statistical interpretations of the target\" be used rather than new ways to reach it has infuriated environmentalists. An internal briefing paper for ministers, a copy of which has been obtained by the Guardian, reveals that officials at the department, now the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, think the best the UK could hope for is 9% of energy from renewable sources such as wind, solar or hydro by 2020. It says the UK \"has achieved little so far on renewables\" and that getting to 9%, from the current level of about 2%, would be \"challenging\". The paper was produced in the early summer, around the time the government published its energy white paper. Under current policies renewables would account for only 5% of Britain's energy mix by 2020, the document says. The EU average is 7%; Germany is at 13%. It acknowledges that Germany, unlike Britain, has built a \"strong and growing renewables industry\". EU leaders agreed the 20% target for the bloc in spring. The European Commission is working out how to reach this . DBERR officials fear that Britain may end up being told to get to 16%, which it describes as \"very challenging\". The paper suggests a number of ways ministers could wriggle out of specific commitments. It also suggests ministers lobby certain EU commissioners and countries such as France, Germany, Poland and Italy to agree to a more flexible interpretation of the target, by including nuclear power, for example, or investment in solar farms in Africa. Officials ask ministers to examine \"what options there are for statistical interpretations of the target that would make it easier to achieve\". They suggest the target lacks credibility because it is so ambitious, while acknowledging that the Germans will be difficult to persuade because the Chancellor Angela Merkel is the champion of the 20% target and wants to commit Germany to 27%. \"These flexible options are ones that may be difficult to negotiate with some member states such as Germany, who we expect to resist approaches that may be seen to water down the renewables target,\" the briefing says. Environmentalists were shocked. \"This briefing reads like a 'wriggle and squirm' paper,\" said Andrew Simms, director of the New Economics Foundation. \"It combines almost comic desperation from civil servants suddenly realising that they actually have to do something to promote renewable energy, with a breathtaking cynicism as they explore every conceivable get-out clause to escape the UK's international commitments.\" A spokesman for DBERR said he would not comment on leaked documents, but added: \"This government is committed to renewables and reducing emissions in line with EU targets.\" The Conservative's shadow secretary of state, Alan Duncan, said: \"This is a staggering revelation and shows the government has known all along it won't meet its targets but has deliberately avoided admitting it. They have been living a lie.\" The Lib Dem environment spokesman, Chris Huhne, agreed: \"This news confirms that the government has said yes to an EU target of 20% of renewable energy without any visible means of achieving it. If the government's policy is now to have any credibility and not be seen as a cynical attempt to woo green opinion, ministers must stop fudging and start acting.\" The paper reveals an aversion to renewables on the basis of perceived cost, arguing that they are a more expensive way of reducing carbon emissions than the European Emissions Trading Scheme. It estimates that getting to 9% by 2020 could cost the economy £4bn a year. Environmentalists reject the idea that renewables are too expensive. Even £4bn a year is only about one third of the 1% of gross domestic product rich countries were recommended to spend a year combating climate change. The paper also reveals that carbon capture and underground storage of CO2 emissions from new coal-fired power stations is projected to make little contribution before 2020. \"This is betrayal of the highest order,\" said Rajiv Bhatia, head of renewable energy distributor Alternergy. Jeremy Leggett, of solar energy company Solarcentury, said: \"It would not surprise me if this delay in renewables deployment was the tactical objective all along for some senior officials in DTI. Serving on the government's Renewables Advisory Board from 2003 to 2006, I witnessed what cynics could easily have mistaken for a deliberate campaign of delay, obfuscation, and the parking, if not torpedoing, of good ideas coming from industry members of the board.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2007/feb/08/usnews.supermarkets","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2007-02-08T23:54:15Z","webTitle":"Tesco goes Fresh & Easy into US","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/feb/08/usnews.supermarkets","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2007/feb/08/usnews.supermarkets","fields":{"headline":"Tesco goes Fresh & Easy into US","bodyText":"Tesco has revealed the first details of its expansion into the US market - starting with at least 20 stores around Phoenix and other outlets in Las Vegas, San Diego and Los Angeles.

A tributary from the river Krka runs through the lush countryside nestled close to the sun-drenched Adriatic coast. It is a tranquil place, one that would make an ideal spot for a campsite or a clutch of holiday homes. But instead the land is destined for a rather more bizarre sort of retreat. It is here that a small cabal, comprising senior members of the British National Party, plans to hole up once, as they expect, the world's supply of oil runs out, triggering anarchy. The land is owned by an anonymous BNP sympathiser from south-east England whose late father is understood to have made a fortune in the pizza business. At the moment it lies unused, but the BNP chairman, Nick Griffin, has visited the site several times. One day some in the party hope it will become a sustainable community, one that is not reliant on fossil fuels or outside power of any kind but instead is capable of harnessing solar energy and tapping into local streams for fresh water. A spokesman for the BNP said this scenario was 'totally without foundation'. But The Observer has established the plans were discussed extensively during a three-day secret BNP meeting last September at a Hampshire hotel. Griffin and several senior members of the BNP, including Lee Barnes, the party's ponytailed second-in-command, had invited an energy expert, Andrew McKillop, to speak about his pet theory, the end of oil and gas supply, a subject about which he lectures widely on the conference circuit. Also at the meeting was the BNP's economics adviser, a man called Alan Good-acre when residing in Britain but who, when in the US on business, apparently uses the name Ian Fletcher, according to party sources. Throughout the meeting Fletcher carried a large briefcase stuffed with thousands of pounds in cash which he used to pay the hotel and restaurant bills. 'It was like something out of a film,' a member of the hotel staff said. 'He just kept dipping into the briefcase and doling out the money.' For McKillop, who lives in the US, the meeting was equally surreal. He had been told he would be picked up from Heathrow airport by two BNP stalwarts, only to be instructed at the last minute to make his own way to Portsmouth. From there a car took him to a hotel. 'It was all a bit Monty Python,' McKillop recalled. 'They seemed extremely paranoid.' As soon as he arrived, Griffin ushered McKillop, who previously had links to the French far right and the late billionaire James Goldsmith, into a room to address eight of his colleagues. Over the next two days McKillop, who says he was not paid for his presentation and had been contacted by the BNP via the internet, talked widely about his belief that global oil and gas supplies are peaking and that this would have profound repercussions for mankind. As he talked his audience became more excited. 'They didn't want to know what I was talking about,' said McKillop. 'They just wanted to know how to use it to their advantage. They grabbed it as a ball to play with. They developed a completely exaggerated idea of when the world's oil supply will be turned off. They were asking, \"How can we exploit this, how can we use it to build an election platform?\"' McKillop was told a BNP supporter owned a large amount of land in Croatia that the party's senior figures had high hopes for. Initially he thought the BNP intended to use it simply for eco-tourism. But as the conversation developed there was talk of turning the land into a community for the BNP and its supporters. 'In the end I formed the impression they saw it as a bolthole for when the world blows up,' McKillop said. Claims that the BNP senior hierarchy have discussed developing the Croatian site have been corroborated by several disgruntled party members who have supplied detailed information to Lancaster Unite Against Fascism (UAF), a body that campaigns against the BNP. The revelation that the BNP senior hierarchy anticipate a doomsday scenario has parallels with millenarianism - the view that the world is on the brink of an apocalypse. The links between such views and the far right are well known. The Oklahoma bomber, Timothy McVeigh, harboured suspicions that the UN was trying to take over the world and that a global war was an inevitability. McVeigh and the London nail bomber David Copeland, jailed for an explosion at a gay pub in Soho, London, which killed three people and left 70 injured, were heavily influenced by William Pierce, the founder of the white supremacist National Alliance in the US. Pierce was also the author of The Turner Diaries which predict a series of racial wars that develop into global genocide. Several BNP members have attended National Alliance meetings."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2007/aug/11/theairlineindustry.politics","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2007-08-11T14:13:53Z","webTitle":"Heathrow protesters keep site a secret","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/aug/11/theairlineindustry.politics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2007/aug/11/theairlineindustry.politics","fields":{"headline":"Heathrow protesters keep site a secret","bodyText":"Heathrow climate protesters last night were refusing to say where they intended to set up their camp as the police appealed to organisers for more information. \"We've had some dialogue but not as much we would like. To be fair, the organisers themselves do not know exactly what will take place or where it will go. They are not a single group, but a large group all with separate interests,\" said Commander Jo Kaye of the Metropolitan police. He accepted that the organisers do not know what will happen when the expected 1,500 people turn up at the as yet unidentified site. But anyone expecting protests from the start will be disappointed. The first four days are billed as \"education, low-impact living, debates and learning skills\" with talks on everything from how BAA intends to expand Heathrow to why some people deny climate change. Only at the end of next week will the talking stop and the protesting start against BAA, the aviation industry and the government. The organisers admitted Heathrow was not everyone's choice to begin with, partly because it was feared that no one would be able to sleep or hear people talk because of the planes, but also because of fears that anyone going would be branded as dangerous. \"It took us a whole weekend to decide whether to come,\" said Lucille, one of the organisers. In the end, the decision was made because the protesters calculated that Heathrow is more environmentally unfriendly than Drax coal-fired power station, the scene of a similar camp last year and Britain's largest emitter of carbon dioxide. Heathrow uses 20m litres of fuel per day, but its effect is greater because emissions at high altitude have more effect on the atmosphere and proposals for a third runway would expand its impact. Police say protesters may attempt \"lock-ons\", in which people attach themselves to vehicles and fences, drop banners over buildings and sit-down protests across roads. Protesters are expected to travel to west London from across Europe. British Transport police will join officers from Surrey, Thames Valley and the Metropolitan police during the event, codenamed Operation Hargood. Officers have studied last year's camp at Drax in North Yorkshire, where about 40 campaigners were arrested during a mass day of action. Offences included criminal damage, aggravated trespass and possession of offensive weapons, as a small number of people gained access to the plant. If the camp is organised in the same way as Drax, when 600 to 800 people descended, the boundaries of Heathrow will resemble an instant tented town. Visitors can expect a semi-utopian gathering, with the site divided into neighbourhoods, and several large marquees. The camp will be powered by wind and solar energy, and everyone will cook and eat communally. The idea, say the campers, is to demonstrate that people can live together without emitting much carbon. The aim is to practise a different form of democracy, said one organiser. \"We will have open meetings. In our meetings we don't vote, because that may leave out a minority. Everyone must come to an agreement. It's a different way of working.\" More than 100 people have been involved in organising the camp, with groups around the country responsible for collecting and bringing different things. Yesterday there were urgent appeals on the web for toilet seats, sofas, mattresses, wheelbarrows and wood. \"Its not a dodgy activists' camp. Last year the field we camped in was in a better state when we left than when we found it,\" said one organiser. FAQ Carbon footprints Should I feel guilty about flying from Heathrow? Perhaps, but environmental campaigners are saying that the real culprits are the government and BAA which are seeking to increase air traffic with expanded airports as well as cheaper flights. What impact on the climate will I have if I fly to New York from Heathrow? The average annual emissions of a British person are about 12 tonnes of carbon dioxide a year. A return flight to New York takes up about 1.54 tonnes. That's about the same as driving 5,000 miles, or one month's worth of emissions in a few hours. What can I do? Calculate your carbon footprint on one of many websites. Try giving yourself targets and timetables to reduce. Simple first steps could include turning the heating down, getting better house insulation and flying less. You could also join carbon reduction groups which trade emissions and reward people who use little in the way of emissions. Can I offset my emissions? Yes. You pay someone to reduce CO2 in the atmosphere on your behalf. That way you can pay for the damage you cause and the money should help fund a lower-carbon world. Can I not just leave it to government? Not really. Government regulation is just not enough to achieve the carbon reductions needed at the speed required. Voluntary offsets go above and beyond existing government policy and international emissions targets, helping to drive international action. How much would offsetting my whole year's worth of emissions cost? Probably under £100. The latest science suggests we need to reduce emissions by 90% within 35 years.

For the Irish-speaking, Protestant-born north Dublin politician has an image a far cry from the shambolic cliche of the Green activist. But in line with the credentials of his party he took the Dart rail service to support Green candidate and local councillor Deirdre de Burca, who could gain a seat in the Wicklow constituency. If the opinion polls are correct Sargent could make or break any coalition that sees his party shoring up Fine Gael and the Labour party. The Greens had six TDs in the last Dail and they are expected to increase that number after 24 May. The Greens will not, he insisted, impose hard-line conditions on the other two parties before joining an anti-Fianna Fail government. This included any cast-iron demands that Shannon airport be forbidden from allowing American troops to use it as a refuelling stopover en route to Iraq and Afghanistan. 'We are not in the business of imposing bottom lines,' Sargent says when pressed about whether the Shannon issue is a make-or-break principle for the Greens entering government. 'The Greens are in favour of Ireland having an independent foreign policy and we want Shannon to be a wholly non-military air base, but we are not going to put down bottom lines.' Inside the Heritage Museum in Bray, which includes memorials to the fallen in the First World War, Sargent was more rigid about Ireland's oil dependency culture. Up to 60 per cent of Irish energy relies on oil imports, 20 per cent higher than the European Union average. 'The Irish economy is extremely vulnerable to hikes in oil prices. So the Green policies of reducing our dependency on fossil fuels is not only good for the environment, it makes sound economic sense,' he says His formula - and a precondition for entering government with Labour and Fine Gael - is a radical programme to insulate all Irish homes and to expand the use of solar panels on houses across the Republic. Sargent insisted he would drive a hard bargain if the numbers were right and the Greens held the balance of power. 'Our demands include a commitment to build 100,000 new homes for social housing in the lifetime of the government. We will want a serious commitment to increasing renewable energy sources in Ireland and bringing Irish homes up to EU standards when it comes to insulation and solar energy.' He stressed he was non-dogmatic about the Greens' price of joining a Rainbow Coalition, although control of the Department of the Environment would be a bonus: 'We will enter negotiations with an open mind ... but it would be great to take the Environment brief.' Sargent acknowledged that the Greens have, until now, been an east coast-biased party with all of its six seats shared between Dublin and Cork. 'We are very hopeful that our candidate in Galway will take a seat,' he said. He wanted to end the day as he had begun it, using the train. Unfortunately, a billboard near the station had been set on fire and smoke was billowing across the link between Bray and Dublin. The line had to be shut and Sargent was forced to travel back to the capital by car."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2007/sep/01/moneysupplement.consumeraffairs","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2007-09-01T22:51:32Z","webTitle":"Solar panel misery going through the roof","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2007/sep/01/moneysupplement.consumeraffairs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2007/sep/01/moneysupplement.consumeraffairs","fields":{"headline":"Solar panel misery going through the roof","bodyText":"More elderly victims of solar panel mis-selling have emerged this week after Guardian Money revealed the double-glazing-style techniques used by commission-hungry sales men to push overpriced and often unsuitable systems. Judging by our postbag, those on the south coast have been especially hit. The panel-pushers claim the weather is better, but they really target this area because it has a high percentage of well-off elderly people. The worst case is that of an Isle of Wight reader, pensioner Robin Ford, who not only had to deal with a hard sales strategy, but also with HSBC. Last year, he received a mailshot from Bournemouth-based Solar Technik, extolling free energy from the sun and promising huge fuel savings. Mr Ford replied, arranging for a visit from a representative. He did not realise this meant he lost his \"cooling off period\" because he had invited him into his home. He was initially quoted £22,000. The price then dropped to £15,000, but only if he signed up that very night. \"I admit it was foolish and I should have thought about it, but it was getting late and he had been in my home for hours,\" Mr Ford told Guardian Money. He paid a £5,070 deposit with his HSBC Gold credit card that very evening. Mr Ford did not know a competitive quote for panels would have been £4,000 - or little more than 25% of what he paid. Nor did he know that in August 2005, the Advertising Standards Authority upheld a complaint from trading standards officers in Cornwall and Essex against Solar Technik. The ASA said: \"The claim that 'a Solar Technik home energy system is so effective that it can massively reduce your hot water and heating costs' is misleading and exaggerated.\" Solar Technik did not respond, despite promising to do so. Last October, BBC South West's Inside Out programme investigated Solar Technik. It filmed the firm trying to sell an unsuitable and overpriced system to an undercover reporter posing as an environmentally-friendly widow. She was quoted £12,800 - more than three times the fair rate for a house with the wrong sort of roof (very little faced the sun) and boiler. Dorset Trading Standards officer Ivan Hancock told the programme that Solar Technik's claims were in contravention of the Trade Descriptions Act. But the criticisms hit their mark. Soon afterwards, the company went bust. An affidavit signed by director Floyd Lewis, 31, on March 26, 2007 acknowledged the firm had £43,000-worth of assets but liabilities of £1.38m including £681,000 owed to HM Revenue &amp; Customs, £265,000 owed to customers, and £81,000 outstanding to Barclays Bank. Lewis has held other directorships where companies have been dissolved. Solar Technik's other director was June Lewis, 58, of Ashley Heath, Hampshire. The liquidation was good news for Mr Ford and many other customers who paid with their credit cards. Their contracts had been breached by the firm going bust and, under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974, they could apply for refunds against card issuers - in Mr Ford's case, HSBC. The £5,070 was credited to his account and he congratulated himself on a lucky escape. But 10 days ago, he took a phone call from HSBC. It said a new company, Ultimate Energy plc, was ready to install the original contract as it had taken over from Solar Technik. The bank said he would have to give back the £5,070 and could put it on his credit card if he wished. \"I was utterly non-plussed, so I agreed,\" he says. \"I then contacted Consumer Direct which was amazed. It sent my complaint about HSBC to trading standards here on the island.\" Ultimate Energy has two directors, June Lewis and Floyd Lewis, and is based in Poole, near Bournemouth. The Financial Ombudsman says this is the first time it has heard of a bank taking money back in this way. \"The bank should not have attempted to claim back the money from the consumer. The consumer has no contract with the newly-formed firm.\" Former trading standards officer and credit expert Bob Imrie says: \"The original contract was with Solar Technik. Your reader has not signed a new contract with the successor company so the money cannot be taken back. Banks should not do this, but they will try anything if they think they can.\" HSBC says: \"This is an amazingly complex issue which our lawyers are wrestling with. Here the customer asked for a refund before the company went into liquidation, so this was under chargeback rules which apply if a customer is not happy with a product, not section 75. Because the contract is non-cancellable, it can be argued that it could be sold by the liquidator and passed on to a new company. However, this process has been going on for a significant period of time and we are very aware of the concern it has caused to a long-standing bank customer. We have now agreed to re-credit his card with £5070.\" Other readers have told us solar firm problems including: · sellers who refuse to leave without a signature - one Northampton reader endured a four-hour marathon. · salesmen using the \"drop close\" - offering a discount on an inflated price if homeowners sign up on the spot. · promises of a further discount if the home can be \"featured in a magazine\" - the magazine does not exist. · fears over planning permission - some contracts do not allow a refund even if the local authority refuses permission - this can happen in conservation areas and with listed buildings. · concerns over whether a roof is suitable - some face the wrong way or may be made of unusual materials. So how can you get a safe purchase? Robert Kyriakides is chief executive of Genersys, a technology company supplying 25% of the market. He says: \"Look for companies in the REAL Assurance scheme (run by the Renewable Energy Association). REAL is in the course of being approved by the OFT. Or go for members of the Solar Trade Association, which has an ethical selling scheme. \"REIGA (Renewable Energy Installation Guarantee Association) is an industry-backed scheme which provides a free 10-year installation guarantee. And ask if the installer can provide local case studies where old customers can be asked about their experiences.\" \"Thermal solar energy is an important weapon in the fight against climate change. The antics of these dubious 'direct' selling businesses are very unhelpful in this enterprise.\" t.levene@theguardian.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2006/dec/13/cultivatingenergy","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2006-12-13T09:15:00Z","webTitle":"Sun worship","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/dec/13/cultivatingenergy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2006/dec/13/cultivatingenergy","fields":{"headline":"Sun worship","bodyText":"From climate change to volatile oil prices, all signs point to a looming global energy crisis. Confronting the growing challenge means that humanity can no longer afford to ignore the inexhaustible resource found in the organic material that the sun provides each day through photosynthesis. Solar energy enables plants to absorb carbon gas and thereby produce not only oxygen, but also matter that the animal kingdom uses for food - and that our machines can use for energy. Since the Neolithic (or late Stone Age) period, humans have been cultivating this \"biomass\" in order to feed itself. Yet, even in today's world, its energy potential is ignored. Beginning with the industrial revolution, humans sought energy from coal, and later from oil and natural gas, but this leads to the exhaustion of non-renewable resources. Existing alternatives for diversifying energy production are limited. Nuclear energy presents a number of disadvantages, owing to concerns about safety and disposal of radioactive waste. Hydroelectric power is already widely used, while wind and solar energy are structurally sporadic and disparately available. Biomass, on the other hand, has several advantages. Supplies of it are large and available throughout the world. Moreover, the technology necessary to convert it into energy - including high-yield burning, gas conversion, and liquefaction into synthetic fuel - has long been mastered. Widely used during World War II, this technology has since advanced considerably. Biomass energy, however, is the victim of unfair competition from fossil fuels. Oil's price reflects its extraction, refining, and distribution costs, but not that of creating the raw material. Millions of years and 200 tonnes of plant matter are necessary to produce one litre of oil, whereas just 15 kilograms of plant matter are required to make one litre of synthetic fuel. After the oil glut, with oil below $20 a barrel, interest in developing energy from biomass ebbed, attractive only to \"green\" militants and those interested in fundamental science. Yet the potential is immense. The planet's biomass - forests, pastureland, savannas, and crops - make up productive capital that generates a 10% \"return\" every year. Like a battery that runs out and is then recharged by the sun, this supply is renewable indefinitely, as long as it is managed properly. The annual return on this capital is currently estimated at 60 billion tonnes, yet only two billion tonnes is consumed for food purposes and 10 billion tonnes for energy. Increasing the responsible use of this energy source would contribute to the fight against climate change by reducing the amount of carbon in the atmosphere and diminishing the amount of fossil fuel required to produce energy. Moreover, its abundance in southern countries promises to facilitate their economic development. Considered the \"energy of the poor\" until today, biomass could become a source of wealth if it is grown and harnessed with the support of the international community. Thus, \"energy crops\" could be developed to produce biofuel. Residue from forest, agricultural, and agro-industrial activities could be collected and converted. For example, the six million tonnes of waste produced annually by Niger could theoretically be used to meet that country's entire energy needs. However, in many places, energy cropping would certainly compete with food crops. Long-term estimates project that over a 50-year time horizon, most of the planet's arable land would have to be used to feed the world and for forest conservation. Thus, areas dedicated to energy production, particularly biofuel, may not reach the level that societies would wish. But, while such competition would reveal new global scarcities, it would also bring higher prices, thereby encouraging producers to increase yields and productivity. Thus, while cultivating energy would create new constraints, it would also open new possibilities for many economic actors. The farmer and the forest worker could become more involved in the market, the mine engineer could begin to take an interest in crop fields, the banker in plant shares, etc. But, in order to prepare for a scaling up of energy cropping, new policies must be implemented, both in northern and southern countries, in terms of agriculture, land and water management, protection of biodiversity, fuel taxes, and information and awareness raising. The ancient Egyptians and the Incas practiced a religion of the Sun, believing it to be at the beginning of all life on Earth. Science has since proven this to be the case. Nowadays, when it has become more important than ever that we embrace renewable resources, we should use the Sun to cultivate our energy, just as our ancestors used it to cultivate their food. ©Project Syndicate, 2006."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2006/nov/26/thegreengaugeenvironment.ethicalliving","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2006-11-26T00:14:53Z","webTitle":"The green gauge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2006/nov/26/thegreengaugeenvironment.ethicalliving","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2006/nov/26/thegreengaugeenvironment.ethicalliving","fields":{"headline":"The green gauge","bodyText":"Going up · Plastic is considered far from fantastic in the Goan town of Vasco, which has gone plastic free.

In the 1820s Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier discovered that \"greenhouse gasses\" trap heat radiated from the Earth's surface after it has absorbed energy from the sun. In 1859 John Tyndall suggested that ice ages were caused by a decrease in the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide. In 1896 Svente Arrhenius showed that doubling the carbon dioxide content of the air would gradually raise global temperatures by 5-6C - a remarkably prescient result that was virtually ignored by scientists obsessed with explaining the ice ages. The idea of global warming languished until 1938, when Guy S Callender suggested that the warming trend revealed in the 19th century had been caused by a 10% increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels. At this point scientists were not alarmed, as they were confident that most of the carbon dioxide emitted by humans had dissolved safely in the oceans. However, this notion was dispelled in 1957 by Hans Suess and Roger Revelle, who discovered a complex chemical buffering system which prevents sea water from holding on to much atmospheric carbon dioxide. The possibility that humans could contribute to global warming was now being taken seriously by scientists, and by the early 1960s some had begun to raise the spectre of severe climate change within a century. They had started to collect evidence to test the idea that global temperatures were increasing alongside greenhouse gas emissions, and to construct mathematical models to predict future climates. In 1958 Charles Keeling began long-term measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide at the Mauna Loa observatory in Hawaii. Looked at now, the figures show an indisputable annual increase, with roughly 30% more of the gas relative to pre-industrial levels in today's atmosphere - higher than at any time in the last 700,000 years. Temperature readings reveal an average warming of 0.5-0.6C over the last 150 years. Climate change sceptics have pointed out that these records could have been due to creeping urbanisation around weather stations, but it is now widely accepted that this 'urban heat island effect' is relatively unimportant and that it doesn't explain why most of the warming has been detected far away from cities, over the oceans and the poles. Since the 1960s, evidence of global warming has continued to accumulate. In 1998 Michael Mann and colleagues published a detailed analysis of global average temperature over the last millennium known as the \"hockey stick graph\", revealing a rapid temperature increase since the industrial revolution. Despite concerted efforts to find fault with Mann's methodology, his basic result is now accepted as sound. Then, in 2005, just as the Kyoto Protocol for limiting greenhouse gas emissions was ratified, James Hansen and his team detected a dramatic warming of the world's oceans - just as expected in a warming world. There is now little doubt that the temperature increase over the last 150 years is real, but debate still surrounds the causes. We know that the warming during the first half of the last century was almost certainly due to a more vigorous output of solar energy, and some scientists have suggested that increased solar activity and greater volcanic emissions of carbon dioxide are responsible for all of the increase. But others point out that during the last 50 years the sun and volcanoes have been less active and could not have caused the warming over that period. By 2005 a widespread scientific consensus had emerged that serious, large-scale disruption could occur around 2050, once average global temperature increase exceeds about 2C, leading to abrupt and irreversible changes. These include the melting of a large proportion of the Greenland ice cap (now already under way), the reconfiguration of the global oceanic circulation, the disappearance of the Amazon forest, the emission of methane from permafrost and undersea methane hydrates, and the release of carbon dioxide from soils. This new theory of \"abrupt climate change\" has overturned earlier predictions of gradual change, and has prompted some scientists to warn that unmitigated climate change could lead to the complete collapse of civilisation. Fears have been fuelled by the possibility that smoke, hazes and particles from burning vegetation and fossil fuels could be masking global warming by bouncing solar energy back to space. This \"global dimming\" effect is diminishing as we clean up air pollution. As a result global average temperature could rise by as much as 10 degrees Celsius by the close of the century - a catastrophic increase. A more conservative assessment by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 2001 indicated that with unabated carbon emissions, global temperature could rise gradually to around 5.8C by 2100. An increase of this nature would still threaten the lives of millions of people, particularly in the global south, due to sea level rise and extreme weather events. Although some people still deny that climate change is a problem we can do something about, last year the UK government indicated that it was on board. The Stern Review showed that without immediate and relatively inexpensive action, climate change would lead to severe and permanent global economic depression by 2050. There is now a strong scientific and economic consensus about the severity of the climate crisis. · Stephan Harding is Coordinator of the MSc in Holistic Science at Schumacher College in Devon, UK.

Is giving birth to one child the equivalent of burdening the planet with the same amount of CO2 produced by 300 transatlantic flights? Is the government's Low Carbon Building Programme really so paltry that at current rates, it would take 76 years for every house in Britain to have solar panels on the roof? All these questions, and more, were chewed over during a maddeningly shapeless conversation - billed as \"Greening Britain\" - between eco-author Mark Lynas, campaigner and green entrepreneur Jeremy Leggett, and David Miliband. To be slightly cruel, however, they paled into insignificance next to another question, backhandedly raised by the BBC's Guto Harri in the event's opening moments: in that brief and fevered period when Blairite panic was defining the headlines, was the latter really being touted as the next Prime Minister? Fair play to Miliband: this was a sticky wicket, defending the government's alleged green credentials against scattershot attacks from the floor, and the very different tacks taken by Leggett and Lynas. The former is the CEO of Solar Energy, the UK's largest solar electricity company, and spent much of his time decrying the fact that he and his associates aren't given the subsidies they supposedly deserve, which seemed a little rich. The latter, the author of High Tide, Six Degrees and The Gem Carbon Counter, was more impressive, but not exactly in the mood for a give-and-take debate. \"Either the government's in denial, or they're totally incompetent,\" went his opening gambit. \"Which one is it, David?\" He spent the ensuing 55 minutes with his arms tightly folded, the picture of seething dissent and all-or-nothing absolutism. Miliband, you would have thought, could have made a go of things - but he was rather lacking what his old overlord Tony Blair always had in spades: that ability to face endless brickbats from those opposed to him and affect a concerned openness to their criticisms, only to eventually come out fighting. He seemed too brittle and impatient, and far too fond of parrying criticism by either awkwardly flipping into another subject or issuing transparently stock responses. Not that, in several areas, he didn't have a reasonable story to tell: his enthusiasm for carbon credit cards sat well with the audience, as did his spiel about the imperative to decentralise more of our energy production, and what he had to say about the \"common but differentiated\" response to cutting greenhouse-gas emissions in China and India. His repetition of the need to focus on \"electricity, heat and transport\" gave him a rhetorical blade with which he could slice through a debate that often threatened to go simultaneously everywhere and nowhere. But he was hobbled by an old New Labour conversational tic. By way of grappling with a good deal of Lynas and Leggett's points, he limply acknowledged that people were right to challenge the government to \"go further\" and \"do more\" - shades here of the government mantra \"so much done, so much more to do\". But, in so many areas, that isn't actually the point. As Lynas said, projects like the widening of the M1 and the expansion of Heathrow Airport are flatly wrong - so wrong that they shred the idea that opponents of the government are merely decrying the pace of their policies, rather than their essential direction. These questions will only get louder: shutting them down with a textbook New Labour response really won't do. Miliband also needs a much better line on the revival of nuclear power, presented here - slightly apologetically - as a status quo-preserving option that he would rather quickly bat away before getting back to the cuddly subject of renewables. That's surely the wrong approach: by way of engaging with the kind of public disquiet that will be whipped up by anti-nuclearites as the government's policy takes shape, they need fleshed-out arguments that go straight to the most thorny issues - the real cost, waste disposal, supposed safety risks - as well as a willingness to state the nuclear case enthusiastically. Perhaps he ought to read some James Lovelock. His last mistake, in these surroundings, was something of a killer. As detailed in a G2 cover story I wrote last month, a vast gas pipeline is being built from West Wales to Gloucestershire - it runs straight past the Hay site and has prompted much discussion during the festival's four days (at a cost of £840m, it will supply a fifth of the UK's natural gas requirements). At Harri's suggestion, it came up via a question from the floor, but the environment secretary appeared to know next to nothing about it. The future PM of recent legend, you might have thought, would have done his homework. All our blogs from Hay will be collected here.

So an eco spa has to make sure it hides some of its do-gooder credentials underneath lashings of scented oils and treatments guaranteed to dispatch wrinkles and fat. Even an eco warrior wants visible results from a spa visit, not just nicely aligned chi. At the same time, punters need to be confident that their carbon footprint is being minimised - or how can they fully relax during their afternoon hot stone therapy with Melanie or brow reshaping with Charlotte? The sad truth is that these pantheons to pampering typically guzzle water, heat and electricity, while sending litres of non-biodegradable solutions down the drain, potentially poisoning fish - definitely not a good look. Eco spas are big business, but usually work best when they utilise the natural surroundings, such as hot springs, to cement their Earth-friendly credentials. But at the Titanic Spa near Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, perched on the admittedly picturesque Pennines, mother nature is often too damp and blowy to be turned into part of the treatment. The building is an imposing former textile mill - built in 1911 when the Titanic was commissioned, hence the name - that conforms to all 'dark satanic mills' stereotypes. So it is an agreeable surprise to step inside and find a chlorine-free pool, a friendly gym and a huge range of therapies carried out by enthusiastic staff in newly decked-out suites. And it all works like clockwork - efficiency is very comforting if you're staying at a spa. There for three days, my friends and I spend a delightful time shuffling in fluffy slippers between our apartment - decked out in Ikea with beautiful views of the Pennines - and the treatment rooms. All the while we are safe in the knowledge that 'most' of the energy being squandered in cleansing and firming our epidermal layers is derived from a 50-kilowatt peak photovoltaic panel on Titanic's roof, converting sunlight into energy, while our toes are warmed by sustainable wood heating that is part of a cutting-edge combined-heat-and-power system. Titanic treatments use a mix of Decleor and Elemis products, both of which are apparently underpinned by strong eco theory. For example, Decleor monitors ingredients to ensure that they are not sourced from endangered plants. Spas are not usually known for integrating with the local community, but Titanic is part of Britain's first large-scale domestic solar power project. As well as the panels on the building, 500 houses in the surrounding region of Kirklees have also embraced solar energy. The panels are mainly out of sight, but it's harder to miss the borehole. Titanic draws its own water, rather than siphoning huge quantities from the mains as most spas do, and the borehole is celebrated in front of the building, rising up from a large wooden plinth. All of which might make you confuse the Titanic Heat Experience with a homage to climate change, but it is an invigorating mix of hot and cold therapies, plunge pools and steam rooms. Most packages include this, along with lunch in the Bistro (mainly organic and locally sourced). Opened last year, Titanic is no longer the only eco spa in the UK. Daylesford Organic, purveyor of fine organic produce, has opened the Hay Barn (www.daylesfordorganic.com/scat/haybarn), made from eco materials in the Cotswolds. Senspa, in the New Forest (www.senspa.co.uk), is accessible and affordable, and flirts with being green. Car-free guests are offered a 10 per cent discount at Careys Manor next door, a lift from the station and free cycle hire to help keep their carbon footprint low. All energy is from a green supplier and treatments are organic, biodynamic or from a sustainable European source. Back at Titanic, I was offered a novel form of recycling as Charlotte asked if I wanted to take the cast from my body purifying treatment home with me. When I politely declined she said: 'What about just the top half?' Which is how I ended up dragging a cast of my upper torso along with my rucksack on the train journey from hell. After the first train broke down half way between Huddersfield and Wakefield, the rest of the journey became a nightmare of improvised bank holiday connections, hours of waiting and tense conversations with ticket inspectors. At some point, I'm afraid, the body cast got dumped, next to a bin; it would not fit in it, so it technically became litter. We had at least saved a few carbon emissions by taking the train rather than driving, but by the time I returned to London the good work was undone. The fluffy robe had definitely turned to a hair shirt. · Titanic Spa breaks start from £99 per person including accommodation, breakfast, one lunch and dinner and use of pool, gym and sauna.

I haven't taken flights for holidays for over 10 years, and have minimised professional flying. Holiday travel has been by car, ship, train, sailing boat, canoe, bicycle or boot. Most holidays we camp, and eat local food. Where are you going for your holidays this year? Norfolk, Scotland, France. Do you feel guilty about travelling overseas? I feel OK taking the train to France, though in carbon terms, it will be the most extravagant holiday we have taken for some years. Is cutting back on flying a sensible response to the issue? It's a personal choice, but cutting out unnecessary flying is the single most effective consumer response to the climate crisis."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2007/mar/10/eu.greenpolitics","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2007-03-10T02:11:00Z","webTitle":"Europe sets benchmark for tackling climate change","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/mar/10/eu.greenpolitics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2007/mar/10/eu.greenpolitics","fields":{"headline":"Europe sets benchmark for tackling climate change","bodyText":"Europe became the world leader in tackling climate change yesterday when 27 governments agreed to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 20%, and commit the EU to generating a fifth of its energy from renewable sources, within 13 years. Greenpeace praised it as the biggest decision taken to fight global warming since the Kyoto protocol 10 years ago. European leaders said it was a historic pact and Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel, was praised for steering it through despite opposition from France and eastern Europe. Ms Merkel is due to host a summit in June of leading industrial countries at which she will seek to persuade the US, China, India, and others to follow Europe's example. The two-day EU summit, which ended in Brussels yesterday, boosted the outgoing French president, Jacques Chirac, and Tony Blair by recognising nuclear power as one way of reducing emissions. It also introduced the possibility that millions of homes will have to change from filament light bulbs to more energy-efficient light bulbs by moving to ban traditional bulbs by 2009. The European commission is starting work immediately on a summit demand to produce proposals to trigger a wholesale switch to modern low-energy fluorescent light bulbs. Mr Blair said the measures chimed with proposals outlined in a climate change bill to be tabled in parliament next week and in the energy white paper being drafted. \"These are a set of groundbreaking, bold, ambitious targets,\" he said. \"It gives Europe a clear leadership position on this crucial issue facing the world.\" Ms Merkel, chairing her first EU summit, said she was \"very satisfied\" with the outcome, but warned that the world had to act \"to avoid what could well be a human calamity\". She said Brussels would come up with rules within two years on more energy-efficient street lighting and domestic light bulbs. \"It's a sensible and practical step where people can make a difference,\" she said. In an unusual verdict on a meeting of European governments, Greenpeace said: \"EU leaders deserve top marks for pushing climate change to the top of the agenda. Other nations should now sign up and follow their lead.\" The European commission is charged with drawing up detailed plans on how to implement the package agreed yesterday. That could take months or years of horse-trading as individual countries among the 27 EU members haggle over the \"burden-sharing\" that needs to be agreed to make the plan a reality. The summit breakthrough, following disputes on nuclear energy, renewable sources of power, and whether the targets should be binding or voluntary, means greenhouse gas emissions have to be cut by 20% across the EU by 2020, although Europe will go further to 30% if an agreement can be struck with the US and other key countries. All 27 member countries have to achieve a 10% minimum target in the use of biofuels for transport fuels overall by 2020. The pact stipulates that the provision of 20% of European energy consumption from renewable sources such as wind and solar energy is compulsory. But within that overall target there can be great variations on how much individual member countries contribute. Poland and the Czech Republic complained they were being penalised unfairly since they could not afford the investment in renewable sources. France's priority was to water down the renewables pledge to accommodate the fact that most of its energy is supplied by carbon-free nuclear power. Mr Chirac, at his final EU summit, cheered the \"exemplary\" agreement as \"one of the great moments in the history of Europe\", likening it to the creation of the euro. Margaret Beckett, the foreign secretary, said: \"We have got ambitious but achievable targets on emission reductions, on renewable energy, efficiency, biofuels, and a deployment action plan on carbon capture and storage. It is a big achievement.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2007/jun/23/featuresreviews.guardianreview21","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2007-06-23T22:51:43Z","webTitle":"Non-fiction: Jun 23","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/jun/23/featuresreviews.guardianreview21","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2007/jun/23/featuresreviews.guardianreview21","fields":{"headline":"The world's thermostat","bodyText":"The Weather Makers: Our Changing Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth, by Tim Flannery (Penguin, £8.99) Australian zoologist Tim Flannery has written \"a manual on the use of Earth's thermostat\". This compelling account of climate change is inspired by the holistic worldview of Australia's Aborigines and James Lovelock's Gaia theory, and it provides an excellent summary of the state we're in: the science and history of the planet's climate, suggestions for reducing your personal carbon footprint, as well as the prognosis for our overheating planet (it's not good). Flannery reveals some frightening facts about our carbon addiction: \"half of the energy generated since the industrial revolution has been consumed in just the last 20 years\". And every year the minute mineral particles produced by burning coal kill nearly 60,000 people in the US alone. But he admits that curing our carbon habit will cost trillions of dollars. A role for nuclear power is not ruled out, but he favours a future in which wind and solar energy allow people to generate their own power, as he does himself. Flannery describes becoming self-sufficient in energy as \"one of the most satisfying things I've ever done\". Australia could learn a lot from his example: it has yet to sign the Kyoto Protocol. PD Smith Surely You're Joking, Mr Feynman!, by Richard P Feynman (Vintage, £8.99) For his work on quantum electrodynamics, Feynman shared the 1965 Nobel prize for physics. But throw away all your preconceptions about scientists when you read this book: Feynman loved practical jokes, playing the bongos, cracking safes and visiting topless bars, where (he claimed) he used to \"work a little physics on the paper placemats with the scalloped edges\". He could be irascible, opinionated, even rude; but he was always brilliant. He accused artists of not knowing \"anything about the beauty of the real world - the scientific world\". Then he took drawing classes to show them how it should be done and was soon selling his art. This classic memoir, first published in 1985 and now reissued, is based on a series of taped interviews with a friend. It reveals a uniquely inventive and inquiring mind. Even as a boy of 12 he was always looking for new ways of doing the most mundane things. His ingenuity took him from the Heath-Robinson gadgets he invented as a youngster to the ultimate 20th-century gadget: the atomic bomb. A great read and a wonderful insight into the life of physics. PDS Global Outlaws: Crime, Money and Power in the Contemporary World, by Carolyn Nordstrom (University of California Press, £13.95) Anthropologist Carolyn Nordstrom is here to tell us that there's more to illegal trade than a guy selling dodgy DVDs down the pub, photogenic white girls trafficking heroin through Bangkok, and The Sopranos. Her report from the frontlines and backyards of the \"extra-legal\" explores both how it works and its broader relationship to how we organise ourselves as a world. It's a poetic and hardnosed intellectual travelogue, starting on a dusty street in Angola with a child selling Marlboros and ending with human traffic in China. Nordstrom interviews numerous security officials, meets narcotic folk hero Howard Marks, and discovers just how easy it is to buy her own bank. Global Outlaws troubles conventional wisdom by suggesting that in this world of raw resources, hot dollars and cool goods, illegal products can sometimes be better than legal ones, and that the most significant crime lies in the \"structural violence of inequality embedded in our institutions\". For, as illegal trade both saturates and is symptomatic of a broader economic system, \"these exceptions aren't the exception to the rule of the economy. They are the economy\". Jo Littler Having It So Good: Britain in the Fifties, by Peter Hennessy (Penguin, £9.99) This history of 1950s Britain opens with Peter Hennessy describing a contemporaneous film about Blackpool called Holiday. All beach, beauty pageants and swimming pools, the film gets so close \"you can almost smell the chlorine\". He uses such everyday colour and sensory memory to supplement his top-down history of the intricate workings of governments during the decade. He says he is \"uneasy with high politics absorbed neat\", so added to the details of the Suez crisis and rows between Churchill and Eden are his memories of Babycham bottles and Perry Como singing Magic Moments. Hennessy is a well-regarded left-liberal historian and, in this second part of his history of post-1945 Britain, he argues that in the early postwar years there was a high level of political consensus around left-liberal ideas - for \"Britain's New Deal\" - which was later eroded. And although, even with its addition of \"everyday memory\", the book ends up emphasising the powerful white men he primarily examines, it also provides an important and useful analysis of what they were up to. JL Crete, by Barry Unsworth (National Geographic, £6.99) What a surprisingly old-fashioned book. Unsworth went on a long Cretan holiday with his wife (so formally and uxoriously referred to throughout that I imagined her in a 50s-style cardie); eating mezze and noting their ingredients as if unaccustomed to them; filing through the Samaria gorge amid a hustle of tourists; using the worn tropes of the travel piece - \"old quarter\", \"excellent restaurant\", \"impeccably dinner-jacketed head waiter\", \"one can wander at will\". For a while I thought he might be attempting Greek-period Patrick Leigh Fermor (Mani, Roumeli), what with the summaries of Cretan history, myth and poems, but he lacks PLF's expansive brio. And while Unsworth's details are lovely (the jar of burnt peas excavated from the Minoan ruins, the spread and loft of the Samarian cypress trees), they're almost rationed - as if there had only been space for a few on the postcard. Poor man, touring the palace at Knossos in a state of horde-resentment and fulminating against those modern deluxe palaces, the mega-hotels. It's the way the world is, and all you can control is the way that you understand it.

It is 40 times what the government is spending on its low-carbon buildings programme aimed at boosting the take-up of renewable energies. It is also what the government will reap from its recent rise in air passenger duty over three years. That, though, will do nothing to deter air travel because it only adds a few pounds to a ticket. Instead of using the £3bn to widen a road, spending it on railways, solar panels, wind turbines or insulation might have been more sensible. So many things make a mockery of the government's claim to be leading the world on climate change that this latest news hardly comes as a surprise. Professor Nicholas Stern's review of the economics of climate change emphasises that Britain is talking the talk, not walking the walk. His call for extra spending now was not heeded. What the government has also not done is send out new \"price signals\", as economists call them. If as a country we want to reduce carbon emissions in a serious way, those emissions have to be made more expensive. The government has long urged people to get out of their cars and on to trains and buses. But there is no price signal. Protests Motoring has got cheaper under Labour while train travel has shot up in price. So expect no change in habits, with car use continuing to grow. But if the cost of petrol was, say, doubled over a few years, that is a price signal people would respond to. The government's problem is easy to see. It put up petrol duty by more than inflation until the fuel duty protests of 2000, since when it has backed away from any action in that area. There are already two cars out there doing more than 70 miles to the gallon and there will soon be a diesel Mini that will join them. But people won't move over en masse with fuel at 95p a litre. They would at £2 a litre. Another price signal would be a much bigger rise in air passenger duty than the recent increase. The absurdity that airline fuel is not taxed can at least be partly compensated for by raising APD. People could still fly, but would pay some of the cost of the carbon they emit. Another price signal could come from a feed-in tariff (FIT) for renewable energy, used so successfully in countries such as Germany. The FIT sets a guaranteed price a consumer will get for any electricity he or she generates and exports to the grid. At present, the government is running the ineffective low-carbon buildings programme, providing grants for things such as solar panels and wind turbines. But it keeps changing the system and recently slashed the grants to ensure that the £80m allocated for the three years to 2008 does not run out. Britain's nascent micro-generation industry is suffering as a result. Some readers may recall that I installed a solar photovoltaic system on my house in the spring. I heard last week that the small company which fitted it has gone bust for lack of cash flow. Another company, Thermomax, the country's largest maker of solar thermal panels, has just gone into administration. Britain's climate change strategy, such as it is, is crumbling. The problem is that the government has helped create monopolies by restricting its lists of approved suppliers for projects to a handful of companies, ensuring that the small guys go the wall and prices to consumers remain higher. My solar PV system, for example, would be more than 30% cheaper in Germany than it was in Britain. The government's other support mechanism, the renewable obligation (RO) system, which requires energy producers to use a growing proportion of renewable sources, is hardly working. The government is planning changes but they won't come until 2009. The proof of the pudding is in the eating. Britain's use of renewables rose about 10% last year to 4.6% of all energy use. And the pace of increase slowed. In Germany it is rising much faster and is already at 13% of all energy, a share Germany proposes to double by 2020. Germany now has 200 times as much installed solar energy capacity as Britain, for example. Britain's chances of achieving the EU target of a 20% cut in emissions by 2020 are negligible. Indeed, the government has acknowledged it will not achieve it. Germany plans to over-achieve it. The RO's essential problem is that it does not send a clear price signal and is aimed only at producers rather than consumers as well. The FIT gives a very clear price signal. It works because it is clearly understood by producers and consumers. Rather than going bust as in Britain, German renewables companies are some of the fastest expanding on the planet. Early adopters In the case of solar electricity, you get about 35p per kilowatt hour, four times the market rate, for 20 years. This puts the return on your investment up towards 10% - four times that in Britain - and brings the payback time below 10 years. The cost of the FIT is spread by the electricity companies among all consumers and has added about £1 a month to the average electricity bill. The FIT for solar will be cut by 5% a year over the next 20 years, the idea being to encourage early adopters and give a boost to production levels so that costs will fall rapidly and eventually make the FIT unnecessary. With a FIT, a company can expand knowing that the demand for its products is there. Banks will lend on projects because of the secure flow of finance. The market still works because consumers shop around for the best and cheapest products so firms have to innovate and compete. Prices of renewable technologies in Germany are much lower than the UK and it has 250,000 jobs in the industry - 10 times the total of the UK and a number expected to double by 2020. I don't think Germans will tell you that going green is damaging their economy. The FIT brings ordinary people into the fight against climate change and reinforces the notion that something can and is being done. Governments, except ours, like the FIT because it does not cost them anything. Thus, while in Britain you have to be mad to get into renewables, in Germany you are mad not to. That is what a price signal does. At the latest count, says Miguel Mendonca of the World Future Council, 47 other countries or states have brought in FITs. Academics like it. \"There is a lot of theory and evidence showing that large volumes of renewable energies are delivered cheapest under a feed-in tariff,\" says David Toke, senior lecturer in environmental policy at Birmingham University. \"The RO system is a cumbersome, expensive and opaque way to finance renewables.\" Other political parties are supportive. The Lib Dems are calling for an FIT. The Tories say the current system needs to change. But the chancellor, Alistair Darling, told the Guardian recently the government could not keep chopping and changing, even though it has been doing exactly that with its grant system. So next time you hear the government claim it leads the world on climate change, do as the Germans do: burst out laughing. ashley.seager@theguardian.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2007/aug/06/climatechange.greenpolitics","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2007-08-06T14:45:41Z","webTitle":"Green means slow to this government","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/aug/06/climatechange.greenpolitics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2007/aug/06/climatechange.greenpolitics","fields":{"headline":"Green means slow to this government","bodyText":"Last week's news that widening a stretch of the M6 motorway will cost £3bn, or £1,000 an inch, was depressing not just because of the huge sum but for what it says about the government's spending priorities.

The jolt comes at a time when venture capitalists are practically falling over themselves to invest in cleantech startups, no doubt reminiscing for the days when companies like Yahoo!, eBay and Amazon first floated their shares and gave them exit strategies they have been only able to dream about since the bubble burst. In the first quarter of this year US venture capitalists invested $264m (£133m) into 23 cleantech deals, a 41% increase in dollar value over the fourth quarter of 2006, according to the MoneyTree Report by PricewaterhouseCoopers and the National Venture Capital Association (NVCA). The report, based on data by Thomson Financial, shows that while the 2006 US investment in cleantech of $1.5bn in was only slightly bigger than a blip in the overall total of $26bn, it is growing \"exponentially\" said Emily Mendell, the vice president of strategic affairs at the NVCA. According to Lux Research, which has just completed a comprehensive report on the sector, \"the warning signs of a bubble are flashing in the energy technology segment, where initial public offering values and venture capital deployments more than doubled last year – setting the stage for a boom and bust\". Lux reported around 930 startups in global solar energy and biofuels arena and that some 200 of them have received some venture capital money. The $1.5bn figure MoneyTree reported was only $623m in 2005. Says Michael Holman, a senior analyst at Lux: \"I think from looking at the sheer amount of money that is being invested right now we have to think that a lot of that money is now chasing after some opportunities it wouldn't be in a more sober climate.\" Later stage institutional investors have also been caught up in the hype. Lux reported that in the energy segment where IPO value rose from $1.6bn in 2005 to $4.1bn in 2006. Most of those companies came public either on London's Aim market or in Frankfurt, because there are less stringent revenue milestones that the US Nasdaq exchange. However, one ethanol company that chose the Nasdaq disappointed investors this month by reporting a loss when Wall Street analysts were confidently predicting another profitable quarter. That company is VeraSun Energy, which is the number two producer of ethanol in the US after giant Archer Daniels. It reported a loss of $312,000 on revenues of $144.5m when analysts thought it would better last year's corresponding quarterly profit of $2.7m. Those results sent its share price plummeting 15% to $16.72 , well below its IPO figure of $20. It also dragged down the share prices of Archer Daniels and others in the sector. Mr Holman is quick to point out that the public has not bought in on the hype as have venture capitalists and consequently many alternative fuels stock prices are not outperforming the market. \"The herd mentality has begun to take over in the venture capital community and there is probably some not very wise money that is flowing into the ethanol segment in particular,\" he said. Even before those VeraSun financials came out, Lehman Brothers was also questioning the viability of ethanol suppliers, saying the US just did not have the infrastructure to digest the amount of fuel being manufactured. VeraSun blamed its travails on the high cost of corn – a situation that may be alleviated when a massive planting of subsidised corn by US farmers is ready for harvest. But experts like Mr Holman believe the future lies not in fuel made from corn or sugar but from cellulose-based farm waste such as corn kennel, wheat and barley straw. Leaves and stalks of plants can also be used as the source of ethanol. Unperturbed by the hullabaloo about the viability of ethanol or the possibility of a \"cleantech bubble\" is America's most prominent venture capitalist in the renewable energy space, Vinod Khosla, whose firm has invested in 25 start-ups. Those companies include three that use corn or sugar and four that use cellulosic waste to produce ethanol as well as others that are looking for alternative energy sources using wind, solar and water. Khosla won't say how much he has invested – estimated to be hundreds of millions of dollars - but he believes the rewards will be high and that they will come sooner rather than later: \"I suspect most of these (investments) will be public offerings and I expect to see IPOs in months not years. This area is really going to heat up.\" He admits there is a possibility of a bubble as \"every market that is attractive goes through high expectations\". Nonetheless he is delighted that more venture capitalists are investing and professes to welcome the competition for investment opportunities: \"I am encouraging more people to come into this business because I think it will help us switch away from fossil fuels and that's a good thing. And the more experiments that we try the more likely we are to succeed.\" He attributes the bad press ethanol is getting to misinformation being supplied by the big oil companies. Those companies have a lot to lose and have launched a massive PR campaign to discredit new technologies, he claimed. Big Oil is \"doing what the tobacco companies did when they tried to fight the notion that smoking caused cancer.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2007/mar/14/scienceofclimatechange.climatechange","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2007-03-14T00:04:06Z","webTitle":"The appliance of science","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/mar/14/scienceofclimatechange.climatechange","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2007/mar/14/scienceofclimatechange.climatechange","fields":{"headline":"The appliance of science","bodyText":"Climate change is happening, but it appears that science is split on what to do about it. One of the central reasons why there is disagreement about how to tackle climate change is because we have different conceptions of what science is, and with what authority it speaks - in other words, how scientific \"knowledge\" interacts with those other realms of understanding brought to us by politics, ethics and spirituality. Two scientists - one a climate physicist, the other a biologist - have written a book arguing that the warming currently observed around the world is a function of a 1,500-year \"unstoppable\" cycle in solar energy. The central thesis is linked to evidence that most people would recognise as being generated by science. But is this book really about science? It is written as a scientific text, with citations to peer-reviewed articles, deference to numbers, and adoption of technical terms. A precis of the argument put forward in the book by Fred Singer, an outspoken critic of the idea that humans are warming the planet, and Dennis Avery is that a well-established, 1,500-year cycle in the Earth's climate can explain most of the global warming observed in the last 100 years (0.7C), that this cycle is in some way linked to fluctuations in solar energy, and because there is nothing humans can do to affect the sun we should simply figure out how to live with this cycle. We are currently on the upswing, they say, warming out of the Little Ice Age, but in a few hundred years will be back on the downswing. Efforts to slow down the current warming by reducing emissions of greenhouse gases are at best irrelevant, or at worst damaging for our future development and welfare. This, of course, is not what the fourth assessment report of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said a few weeks ago. The report from its climate science working group concluded that it is likely that most of the warming of the last 50 years has been caused by rising greenhouse gas concentrations and that, depending on our actions now to slow the growth of emissions, warming by 2100 will probably be between about 1.5C and 6C. The upper end of this range is almost an order of magnitude larger than the warming that Singer and Avery suggest is caused by the 1,500-year cycle. So is this a fight between scientific truth and error? This seems to be how Singer and Avery would like to present it - \"science is the process of developing theories and testing them against observations until they are proven true or false\". Means of inquiry At one level, it is as simple as this. Science as a means of inquiry into how the world works has been so successful because it has developed a series of principles, methods and techniques for being able to make such judgments. For example, we now understand the major transmission routes for HIV/Aids, that smoking injures health, and that wearing seat belts saves lives. And so it is with climate change. Increasing the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere warms the planet and sets in motion changes to the way the weather is delivered to us, wherever we are. Science has worked hard over a hundred years to establish this knowledge. And new books such as Singer and Avery's, or opinion pieces in the Daily Mail, do not alter it. So far so good. Deploying the machinery of scientific method allows us to filter out hypotheses - such as those presented by Singer and Avery - as being plain wrong. But there are two other characteristics of science that are also important when it comes to deploying its knowledge for the benefit of public policy and society: that scientific knowledge is always provisional knowledge, and that it can be modified through its interaction with society. That science is an unfolding process of discovery is fairly self-evident. The more we seem to know, the more questions we seem to need answering. Some avenues of scientific inquiry may close off, but many new ones open up. We know a lot more about climate change now than 17 years ago when the first IPCC scientific assessment was published. And no doubt in another 17 years our knowledge of how the climate system works and the impact that humans have made on it will be significantly different to today. Yet it is important that on big questions such as climate change scientists make an assessment of what they know at key moments when policy or other collective decisions need to be made. Today is such a time. But our portrayal of the risks of climate change will always be provisional, subject to change as our understanding advances. Having challenges to this unfolding process of discovery is essential for science to thrive, as long as those challenges play by the methodological rule book that science has painstakingly written over many generations of experience. The other important characteristic of scientific knowledge - its openness to change as it rubs up against society - is rather harder to handle. Philosophers and practitioners of science have identified this particular mode of scientific activity as one that occurs where the stakes are high, uncertainties large and decisions urgent, and where values are embedded in the way science is done and spoken. It has been labelled \"post-normal\" science. Climate change seems to fall in this category. Disputes in post-normal science focus as often on the process of science - who gets funded, who evaluates quality, who has the ear of policy - as on the facts of science. So this book from Singer and Avery can be understood in a different way: as a challenge to the process of climate change science, or to the values they believe to be implicit in the science, rather than as a direct challenge to scientific knowledge. In this reading, Singer and Avery are using apparently scientific arguments - about 1,500 year cycles, about the loss of species, about sea-level rise - to further their deeper (yet unexpressed) values and beliefs. Too often with climate change, genuine and necessary debates about these wider social values - do we have confidence in technology; do we believe in collective action over private enterprise; do we believe we carry obligations to people invisible to us in geography and time? - masquerade as disputes about scientific truth and error. We need this perspective of post-normal science if we are going to make sense of books such as Singer and Avery's. Or indeed, if we are to make sense of polar opposites such as James Lovelock's recent contribution The Revenge of Gaia, in which he extends climate science to reach the conclusion that the collapse of civilisation is no more than a couple of generations away. The danger of a \"normal\" reading of science is that it assumes science can first find truth, then speak truth to power, and that truth-based policy will then follow. Singer has this view of science, as do some of his more outspoken campaigning critics such as Mark Lynas. That is why their exchanges often reduce to ones about scientific truth rather than about values, perspectives and political preferences. If the battle of science is won, then the war of values will be won. If only climate change were such a phenomenon and if only science held such an ascendancy over our personal, social and political life and decisions. In fact, in order to make progress about how we manage climate change we have to take science off centre stage. This is not a comfortable thing to say - either to those scientists who still hold an uncritical view of their privileged enterprise and who relish the status society affords them, or to politicians whose instinct is so often to hide behind the experts when confronted by difficult and genuine policy alternatives. Two years ago, Tony Blair announced the large, government-backed international climate change conference in Exeter by asking for the conference scientists to \"identify what level of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is self-evidently too much\". This is the wrong question to ask of science. Self-evidently dangerous climate change will not emerge from a normal scientific process of truth seeking, although science will gain some insights into the question if it recognises the socially contingent dimensions of a post-normal science. But to proffer such insights, scientists - and politicians - must trade (normal) truth for influence. If scientists want to remain listened to, to bear influence on policy, they must recognise the social limits of their truth seeking and reveal fully the values and beliefs they bring to their scientific activity. Chink of weakness Lack of such reflective transparency is the problem with \"unstoppable global warming\", and with some other scientific commentators on climate change. Such a perspective also opens a chink of weakness in the authority of the latest IPCC science findings. What matters about climate change is not whether we can predict the future with some desired level of certainty and accuracy; it is whether we have sufficient foresight, supported by wisdom, to allow our perspective about the future, and our responsibility for it, to be altered. All of us alive today have a stake in the future, and so we should all play a role in generating sufficient, inclusive and imposing knowledge about the future. Climate change is too important to be left to scientists - least of all the normal ones. · Mike Hulme, a professor in the school of environmental sciences at the University of East Anglia and the founding director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, is writing a book, entitled Why We Disagree About Climate Change · Unstoppable Global Warming - Every 1,500 Years, by S Fred Singer and Dennis T Avery, is published by Rowman &amp; Littlefield (£21.72).

We'd arrived in a damp, green Jordan just as the last of the spring rains drenched the land. For this is one of the driest countries on Earth, and to the Jordanians every drop of water is welcome. It was welcome for us too, as we were avoiding the set tourist pieces: the Dead Sea, Petra and Wadi Rum. We wanted to visit some of Jordan's nature reserves, exploring on foot while staying in eco-friendly guesthouses and lodges. Searing heat would not have been pleasant. The rain had cleared by morning, and we set off along roads lined with feathery mimosa, passing meadows speckled with spring flowers and glossy olive trees sprouting from rich, red earth. The scenery was pure Tuscany, except for the Bedouin shepherds, red-checked keffiyehs wrapped around their heads, tending their shaggy flocks. But as we neared the Eastern Desert the hills flattened and a rocky wilderness opened out. This arrow-straight road follows the old caravan route linking the Mediterranean with the East and is home to the country's famous Desert Castles. Our base for two nights was the Desert Lodge, in the oasis town of Azraq. Converted from a British army field hospital into a comfortable guesthouse, it has quaint military touches - a Bakelite telephone, old ammunition chests, squishy leather sofas - though its creature comforts are entirely 21st century. The Desert Lodge is run by Jordan's Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature (RSCN), which also manages the Azraq Wetland Reserve. At a major crossroads in the desert, the oasis was for centuries a resting place for caravans laden with frankincense, silks and spices. It is also a stopover for millions of migrating birds that drink, feed and breed on this major avian junction between Africa and Europe. Sharing the lodge with us were a group of British ornithologists, armed with a terrifying array of binoculars, telescopes and long-lens cameras. We tagged along on one of their walks and learnt about the RSCN's project to restore the wetlands - damaged by decades of water extraction - and protect the wildlife: not only birds but the buffalo that have drunk here for thousands of years. The afternoon was spent at the Shaumari Reserve, home of endangered wildlife such as the Arabian oryx. The last wild oryx in Jordan was shot in the 1920s, but a programme of breeding by the RSCN has ensured their future, and Jordan is the only country in the Middle East to employ rangers to stop illegal hunting. At the lodge that evening we tucked into traditional fare washed down with surprisingly good Jordanian wine, smuggled in by the resourceful birdwatchers. As we headed west next morning, the desert gave way to the verdant, fertile country north of Amman. The Roman city of Jerash is the main tourist site here, but we stopped off at the lesser-known Roman settlement of Umm al-Jamal, near the Syrian border. Our accommodation was at another RSCN reserve, Ajloun, and we slept in safari-style tented lodges surrounded by pistachio, carob and ilex trees. That night all I could hear was the occasional shriek of an owl then, at dawn, the call to prayer from a village mosque. As the morning mist lifted, we walked through terraced olive groves and pasture thick with wildflowers to the Byzantine church of Mar Elyas, supposed birthplace of the prophet Elijah, on a lonely limestone hilltop. As we strolled among mosaic floors overgrown with flowers, a shepherd wandered past with his flock, the chink of goat bells carried on the wind. The biblical scene was complete. From Ajloun we swung south, stopping at Qal'at ar-Rabadh, a 12th-century fort dominating the valley. It was built to repel the crusaders, though when we were there the only invaders were an army of teenage girls dressed in jeans, high heels and hijabs, scaling its walls and teetering along its precipitous parapets, chattering into mobile phones. Following the Jordan Rift Valley, we bumped along a track past black-tented Bedouin encampments to RSCN's Feynan Wilderness Lodge in a bowl of arid, orange hills. It is run in partnership with the Bedouin community and is designed along strict ecological principles, powered by solar energy and at night illuminated only by countless flickering tea lights, set into niches or suspended in chandeliers. The effect is deeply romantic, and as the sun slid behind the hills we sat on rooftop cushions, mesmerised by the darkest, starriest of desert skies. Set at the mouth of the Wadi Dana reserve, Feynan is a desolate site. We poked around the ruins of a Byzantine city and watched women working at the crafts which they sell at the lodge shop and which provide an alternative source of income from goatherding. This is encouraged by RSCN because over-grazing has damaged the ecosystem. Next day we hiked up the oleander-fringed wadi with our Bedouin guide, Ahmed, who took us into his mother's tent to taste freshly made goat's yogurt and sweet tea flavoured with thyme. Six hours later we arrived, breathless, at the Dana Guesthouse, perched high on the rim of the wadi. This is the RSCN's flagship project, breathing new life into an abandoned Ottoman village, providing work for the villagers and a market for their produce. With only nine rooms, most offering stupendous views down Wadi Dana, the guesthouse is booked months ahead in the spring. We had decided to avoid Petra, but the lure of the rose-red city was too great. Joining a night-time excursion, we walked along the famous Siq, our way lit by hundreds of candles. Sitting on kilims in the moonlight, we listened in awe as a Bedouin played a mournful tune on his reed pipe, the strains echoing round the wall and wafting up to the stars.

Here, it ain't. Click through to see what people thought of government data, organic solar cells, and Apple's icons for Leopard, inter alia. GOVERNMENT DATA I have been reading Michael Cross' article about gov IT prompted by the loss of child benefit records. I can't help wondering - why the government secure intranet wasnt used to send this data, and - surely such a massive database would have fairly sophistacated querying capability, why was so much data sent - why established information governance procedures arent in place This smacks a lot of internal fraud- are the police investigating this incident? Anna Harvey, Eastbourne Your articles really miss what for me is the fundamental point in this. The office which sent the data apparently was unable to strip out the sensitive information from the file on its own. Much of the rest of the story is bizarre but understandable. It is very odd that it was possible to extract a database of 25 million people unencrypted, and copy it to a file, but maybe it will turn out this could only be done under strict safeguards. Unlikely but possible. That they were then unable to encrypt it before sending also seems very odd indeed. However, that they were unable to use Perl or Awk to strip out the data boggles belief. It says that they do not have on site even one competent systems administrator with half an hour to spare. This sort of file manipulation is something you learn very early on. Without the ability to do modest amounts of shell scripting, you simply have no business working in IT support. And to extract from a file, even a file with 25 million records, four or five columns only, requires quite literally a one-line shell command. It is as simple as typing in just one line of code as a command. One imagines a world in which the only thing they and their admins have learned is how to run Windows as if it were a washing machine, but heaven help them if it needs any servicing. This is what has to be remedied. Its nothing to do with IT and democracy. Its to do with competence and training in how to use the tools supplied. Peter Berrie, London The most sensible thing I've read on the data loss fiasco. Exactly the same is happening in Local Govt.

Not that there is less bureaucracy- God forbid- but there is no such thing as \"sensitive personal information\". If for example someone managed to steal all your personal details, they would have nothing to gain from them! In Greece it is impossible to access a bank account just by knowing the number or names and addresses. You would need a \"deposit's book\" and you ID card! And although the Greek authorities are perfectly capable of losing a couple of CDs with sensitive information, no one would bother with the fact. http://mariapin.blogspot.com/ &gt;&gt; I asked... what would happen in Sweden if Skatteverket (the equivalent of HMRC) had lost personal data CDs, and whether a Minister would be put under pressure in the same way as Alistair Darling was. Her answer was a resounding 'no' - it's an administrative matter, and the head of Skatteverket would have to face the press. http://blog.jonworth.eu/ &gt;&gt; This is what decent journalism is all about.

And the proof mentioned in Tom's article - if it holds up - demonstrates that it's possible to create a fully functional computer, one that could in principle run Excel and Tomb Raider, from a design that's much simpler than any computer anyone else has ever conceived of. http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/ ORGANIC SOLAR CELLS Interesting article. However, you conclude in the \"Powering up the numbers\" section: \"40%: The amount of light energy converted to electricity using silicon solar cells\" But the article states \"Greenham says the world record for silicon solar cell efficiency - the conversion of light energy to electricity - is more than 40%, but standard cells are between 10% and 15%\". You should include \"can be\" or change the \"40%\" between \"10% and 15% from standard cells\". Robin Murray, AEA Energy &amp; Environment, Beijing Good article on the cheap solar energy but thought the very last section powering up the numbers was slightly misleading when it says \"40%: the amount of light energy converted to electricity using silicon solar cells\" when in your article you say that is the world record but the average is around 10-15%, this makes out that the average efficacy is 40%. At least how I read it. But otherwise enjoyed reading it, always think the Gaurdian do a good job covering science and tech better than most. Phil Bentley, BG Energy Holdings Limited, Reading The report on organic solar cells by Michael Pollitt (Thursday 29th Nov) was a lot more accurate than most on the subject but the record 40% efficiency was not with silicon solar cells. It was a triple-junction gallium indium phosphide, gallium indium arsenide, germanium structure (see http://compoundsemiconductor.net/cws/article/news/26606). Although very expensive per unit area, these cells operate at concentration ratios of several hundred so that only a fraction of a percent of the collecting area needs to be covered by the semiconductor. Tiny cells a few millimetres across sit spaced out behind an array of plastic lenses. Thin film cells cannot work at high concentration ratios. Concentrator schemes only work well in low cloud areas where most of the sunlight is direct and they must be used with a moving tracker system. In the UK much of the available light is diffuse. Any single junction solar cell is limited to about 28% efficiency and silicon is limited to 27% 23% efficiency at cell level and 18% at module level has been achieved in silicon by Sunpower Corp and Hitachi. Although organic solar cells are very exciting, I worry about their durability. Organic chemical bonds are easily broken by ultra-violet light. Silicon in contrast, as a pure element, is almost immune. I have not seen this crucial factor discussed anywhere. Nick Rouse, Plumpton Green COPYRIGHT TERMS For Victor Keegan to equate using a published source for inspiration with a direct breach of copyright is disingenuous. I imagine that he is commenting from the perspective of a salaried staff writer. His constant wage replaces future royalties and the copyright is assigned to the publisher - The Guardian. For an author earning a living book to book, copyright lasting just 15 years will cut them off from small but significant sums that help to keep a roof over their head. Authors who sell in large numbers are rare indeed. 15 years and a day from the publication of a popular book, the publishing and film industries will descend on the work in order to exploit it for free. Any success will generate profits for them alone. Given that there is zero chance that authors would be paid more at the outset in order to balance the division of spoils, why exactly does Mr Keegan that this is a just solution? Rodney Sims, Hundon &gt;&gt; At a bare minimum, any item of Hollywood's in copyright would be locked down for 140 years!?!? :O WTF??? Copyright should be slashed down to 15 years. Period IMHO. http://devastator.wordpress.com/ MAP PRICING Ordnance Survey mapping prices (for paper maps) seem to defy logic. They are good value at 50k (Landranger) and 25k (Explorer) scales, at around £7-£8 for an accurately printed colour map about a square metre in area. But at larger scales its much worse. At 10k it works out at £240 per square metre of paper map! At even larger scales of 2.5k and 1.25k its £375 per square metre. This defies commercial logic, as the general public just walks away, so OS loses sales. At these prices you would take pride in finding odd planning maps in libraries etc or on lamp-posts, and photocopying these. Planning departments, solicitors etc have to have these maps but pass the cost onto the public anyway via fees and council tax. The OS are well rehearsed in this criticism, and say there are so many of these map sheets (10,000 for the whole of GB at 10k scale, a lot more at the larger scales) that costs are high. The maps are small, 40 or 50cm across, so why not print bigger areas as the OS did when the 25k Pathfinder series was replaced with the Explorer? As your \"Free our data\" campaign often says, the digital data doesnt incur paper costs, yet the latter is also very expensive at these larger scales. Finally, the Spanish province of Catalunya should join the list of free mapping sources, and they are more advanced by offering GPS-ready data. At 10k and 25k map scales you can download maps in the sdw format which makes them suitable for use in those satnavs, PCs or PDAs which run applications supporting the sdw format. See http://www.icc.cat/portal/index_c.jsp?lang=en_UK&amp;profile=pro Other Spanish provinces have free downloads, but just the map images without the calibration data, but its quite easy to calibrate the images yourself.

When he goes the bank's owners - the nations of the world - will have a rare opportunity to think deeply and act decisively to ensure the institution not only survives, but realizes its considerable promise. What kind of World Bank does the world really need? The bank has two key strengths. The first is solid expertise on how governments can foster poverty-reducing growth. Even China and India, which are flush with private capital and borrow little from the bank, value its advice - whether about education, agriculture, bank supervision, major infrastructure, small business development, or pension and judicial reform - which is based on practical experience around the world. Technical expertise of this sort is unlikely to be funded through charitable contributions. In a popularity contest, vaccinating children and providing small loans to poor village women will always trump advice on banking supervision, tax reform, and electricity distribution, even though sound banks, fair taxes and village electricity are also crucial for development. The bank has a solid track record in these and other technical and policy areas. What it badly needs is more effective leadership in deploying this knowledge better - and letting demand for its advice rather than for cheap loans guide its future. The second key strength is providing global public goods. With its financial heft and technical expertise, the bank is arguably the best-armed institution to address urgent 21st century challenges that are beyond the scope of any single nation state: fostering an overdue green revolution in Africa; creating incentives for development of an Aids vaccine and new solar energy and biofuel technologies; helping poor countries to adapt to accelerating climate change; and combating money laundering, cross-border bribery and other international corruption. Economists have long recognized that even well-functioning markets do not provide for national public goods, such as defense and prevention of contagious disease. Thus there is a role for government. Ordinary people understand this, too. That's why most of us pay our taxes. But while national governments exist to solve collective action problems for nation states, there is no global entity to provide for global public goods - and certainly no stomach for a global tax system. How can the world finance these needs? One solution is a global cooperative, a sort of club, where the nations of the world commit themselves jointly to do what no state would undertake on its own. Conceivably we could start such a club from scratch. But we already have one, and it is called the World Bank. The world needs a strong and effective World Bank to finance and coordinate the provision of urgently needed global public goods. Take climate change. Resulting water scarcity and extreme weather threaten the agriculturally based livelihoods of millions of poor people in the developing world. The bank is uniquely placed to help address the resulting challenges. But it currently lacks both the mandate and the financial instruments to make a difference. So far its role has been confined to pilot projects financed by ad hoc donations from a few of its members. A visionary president ought to ask the bank's member governments to provide a clear mandate and serious money to attack globally shared risks and exploit new technological and other opportunities. The bank is currently asking for $30bn over three years to replenish funding for its activities in the world's poorest countries. Surely at least $3bn of that could go to grant-making for grossly under-funded \"global\" investments that would benefit the poor - including new agricultural technologies, a malaria vaccine, and credible monitoring of greenhouse gas emissions. Emerging market and middle-income countries - including China, India, Brazil and Russia -should contribute as well, whether with direct contributions or by agreeing that a hefty proportion of net income from the bank's loans should go annually to a global goods facility. These contributions would ensure that developing countries have voice in the allocation of the resulting resources. Such collaboration would help to make the bank an effective setting for the give-and-take on climate change and technology transfer that the world so obviously needs. To be sure, the bank faces many other problems. Prominent among these is the closed system for choosing the president (as the Wolfowitz fracas has amply shown), and perverse incentives that cause otherwise enlightened and committed staff to push always for more lending. The bank's core business - working with developing world governments - will continue to be hard to explain to rich world taxpayers. Even before the Wolfowitz fracas, the bank risked sinking into irrelevance, with private capital flows and high reserves reducing demand for loans. The bank is in desperate trouble. The world is in trouble too. We do not need yet another aid agency. We need a technically agile institution prepared to work on complex issues governments around the world face; and committed to addressing the distinctly global challenges of this century. These are the challenges and opportunities awaiting the next president of the World Bank. Let us hope that this time around the international community chooses wisely.

Not to mention the world's tallest building, some 7,000 metres (2,300 ft) high, rising above palm-shaped artificial archipelagos in the warm waters of the Persian Gulf. Oh, and a growth rate of 16% and a population where foreigners in need of \"luxury\" homes outnumber locals. Well, what about the world's first rotating skyscraper? Commissioned by the Dubai Property Ring, a firm of UK-based developers, the 30-storey apartment block will use solar energy to power 20 electric motors that will rotate the tower through 360 degrees over the course of a week. \"This will be a fair building,\" says Nick Cooper, the British engineer working with MG Bennet and Associates of Rotherham, which will build the mechanism. \"Everybody will have the same views for the same amount of time.\" Mr Cooper is not referring to \"fair\" as in \"funfair\" - though the building is, it has to be said, the spectacular proposed centrepiece of the giant City of Arabia amusement park, complete with animatronic dinosaurs, which is due to open in 2009. Time Residences will comprise 200 apartments. Its 80,000-tonne bulk will rest on a series of more or less friction-free polymer bearings. \"It moves very slowly,\" says Mr Cooper. \"It is not a theme park ride.\" Will it work? Cooper has previously designed the drilling machine that bored for England and France beneath the Channel, allowing Eurostar trains to race between London and Paris. He has also designed a giant rotating rock-crushing machines for use in mines. Getting a 30-storey building to turn slowly should be a doddle. And, Cooper claims, the power required to make it spin should be no more than is needed to boil 21 electric kettles. Rotating parts of buildings is nothing new: London's Post Office tower, featuring one of the world's first rotating restaurants (with a very British catering service ,provided by Butlins), opened in 1966. But, this side of an observatory, getting a whole building to turn around its axis is something else - a case of a \"white hot\" sixties technological dream realised in a blazing hot emirate half a century on. The £41m building is designed by British architects at Glenn Howells Associates, the company currently converting the Birmingham Rotunda into a block of 230 flats, and the Dubai city developers Palmer and Turner. It will be capped with a crescent-shaped Moon Lounge, which will feature a theatre and an observatory. From here, future residents may just be able to catch glimpses of the further 23 rotating towers the Dubai Property Ring plans to build in cities around the world - one for every time zone. The idea is enough to make anyone dizzy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2007/may/18/google.ericschmidt","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2007-05-18T11:17:54Z","webTitle":"The masters of the online universe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2007/may/18/google.ericschmidt","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2007/may/18/google.ericschmidt","fields":{"headline":"The masters of the online universe","bodyText":"They are the masters of the online universe - the wealthiest, most powerful and influential duo in the internet business. But Google's two founders do seem a tad on the lugubrious side. Sergey Brin, 33, and Larry Page, 34, both put in appearances this week during a media day at the \"Googleplex\" - the company's sprawling campus in the affluent Silicon Valley town of Mountain View. Brin dressed down for the occasion - he turned up wild-haired, straight off his bicycle in a sweaty red sports top and a disconcertingly tight pair of black cycling trousers. But during a question and answer session, he was immediately on guard when a female reporter congratulated him on his recent nuptials on an off-shore sandbar in the Bahamas – which, until recently, were a closely guarded secret. \"First of all, I'd like to say 'mazel tov' to Sergey on his recent wedding to Anne,\" the reporter chirped cheerfully. An awkward pause ensued before Brin, without cracking a smile, replied: \"Let's just stick to questions about search.\" Clearly, you don't need to act like a chat-show host to build the world's most successful internet enterprise. Brin and Page made their fortunes, which presently stand at about $16bn each, by spending endless hours slumped in front of computer screens, perfecting complex algorithms for online searches. Over lunch in the staff canteen (an impressive spread including seared rabbit), Page wandered in and sat down at a table with Google footsoldiers and a few reporters. Picking disinterestedly at his food, he looked like a man who hadn't slept for days and his repartee was, shall we say, monosyllabic. How much time, I asked, did he think it would take for Google to fine tune its much vaunted new \"universal search\" which ranks video results in among blogs, books and text? Page looked at me in between fork-fulls with an expression of baffled incomprehension. \"Infinite,\" he replied, declining to elaborate. Perhaps it was a stupid question. He was similarly tight-lipped, though, to other enquiries, becoming briefly animated only when he accidentally dropped his cellphone on the floor. The Google story is a familiar Silicon Valley tale - the company originated in 1998 as a research project established by Brin and Page during their student days at Stanford University. The company's technical director, Craig Silverstein, offered some poignant recollections about being the first paid employee. Space was limited, he recounted: Brin's dorm room was the business centre used for programming and phone calls. The nascent enterprise used Page's room as a machine space for its increasingly large collection of computers and servers. \"That worked until Larry's room-mate came back and complained that the big computers were keeping him awake,\" Silverstein recalled. In June 2000, they hit the big time by completing \"giga Google\" - a project to accumulate a search \"crawl\" of more than a billion pages. Silverstein recounts: \"We celebrated with a McDonald's.\" Today, Google has just over 12,200 staff. With annual revenue of $10.6bn, that means the average income per employee is almost $1m. Google is arguably the hottest company in the world - and its sheer clout extends to political circles. The firm recently extended invitations to all candidates for the 2008 presidential elections to address its staff. So far, three have made the trip to Mountain View - Hillary Clinton, John McCain and Bill Richardson. Not bad for a company with a workforce barely above the capacity of a New Hampshire town hall meeting. Richardson, incidentally, didn't do too well. The New Mexico governor failed to mug up on Google-ology and spoke on tax breaks to encourage companies to harness solar energy - something which, employees pointed out, Google was already doing without fiscal incentives. He also irritated communications chief Elliot Schrage by looking around and suggesting Google didn't seem to have many Latino staff. \"Of course we do,\" snapped Schrage, who was hosting the speaker meeting. Although Google has branched into ventures such as office applications and radio, its internet search offering remains its core mission. At regular sessions, volunteers come into perform searches under close scientific observation. The company even rigs up \"eye print\" cameras to analyse where these guinea pigs' glance falls on each page. The typical \"eye print\" is an F shape in the top left corner of the screen, as users read the first couple of results fully before glancing briefly at those lower down. Google points out that it constantly refines its search page. Recent features include automatic maps which pop up for any query about a specific business - or an instant weather forecast offered for any search term relating to climatic conditions. Then there are subtleties - such as Google's ability to correct users' spelling or to suggest alternative search terms. Kerry Rodden, a Scottish-born Cambridge graduate who runs Google's \"usability\" unit aimed at making the search engine constantly easier to use, laments that these gradual improvements create a \"loop of laziness\" as people barely notice changes and assume that Google will correct their syntax mistakes. \"When I tell my friends I work on the usability of the search page, they say 'that page never changes - what do you do all day?'\" she complains. Google offers a simple example on how the net has changed the world. A person wanting to test their typing speed might tap \"typing words per minutes test\" into Google and will be directed to an array of pages offering instant on-line assessments. Within minutes, they will get an approximate speed. A decade ago, testing typing speed would probably have involved buying a special piece of software. Two decades ago, it would have meant going through the Yellow Pages, finding a testing centre and making an appointment - taking, all told, perhaps a week. On the shady, tree-lined streets of Mountain View, there are black Google sweatshirts everywhere. The town's main drag, Castro Street, is alive with upmarket eateries, bookshops and bars. Google has gone from a dormroom to giga and to global. This Silicon Valley town can justifiably claim to be the epicentre of the internet."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theguardian/2007/dec/09/obsextra3.observerspecial8","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2007-12-09T11:02:33Z","webTitle":"The greening of the markets","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2007/dec/09/obsextra3.observerspecial8","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/2007/dec/09/obsextra3.observerspecial8","fields":{"headline":"The greening of the markets","bodyText":"Dr Steve Mahon, chief investment officer at the venture capital business Low Carbon Accelerator, has a fixation that some might find slightly odd. 'I am particularly excited about algae right now,' he says. Algae, he quickly goes on to explain, is one of the many alternatives to fossil fuels currently being explored, and has the potential to become a significant source of renewable energy. The slimy substance can be used to produce biofuels, and in theory will have a vastly higher yield per hectare than more conventional biofuel crops, such as sugar cane or rape seed. It also doesn't compete for land with food crops. 'There are a lot of crops for sugar cane or maze to produce bioethanol, but you are using land that has intrinsic value and that is always going to make the economics difficult,' says Mahon. 'With algae, you are not displacing arable land. It can have up to 70 per cent oil content and grows in a matter of days. You can also use saline water. So I think algae is extremely exciting and we are looking very hard at a number of companies.' Low Carbon Accelerator is one of a growing number of venture capital or investment funds getting behind the clean technology or renewable energy market as issues around climate change and rising demand become more pressing, and as the political landscape has become more favourable. It has made 13 investments to date, including a company called HelioDynamics, which is able to produce steam for industrial use with solar energy; Proven Energy, which provides small-scale wind turbines for the likes of Shell to power its offshore gas platforms; and Turbine Developments, a company spun out of Queen's University, Belfast, which has developed a gas turbine engine that generates power from landfill gas. Low Carbon Accelerator was listed on AIM, the junior London stock market, in October last year, raising £44.5m to invest in early-stage businesses. In the next couple of months it expects to have committed around 75 per cent of its cash, when it will begin to work on a second round of fundraising. 'If you look at this market - how much money is coming in - people realise there are great growth opportunities,' Mahon says. 'The market drivers are here to stay.' A GROWING MARKET As little as five years ago, the renewable energy market was not seen as a place for sensible investors to put their cash. But in the past two or three years there has been a huge influx of private sector money pumped into the market. According to forecasts from New Energy Finance, which publishes a monthly bulletin on the clean tech investment market, around $94.5bn will have been invested worldwide in clean energy during 2007 - a 25 per cent increase on last year. That includes $8.8bn of venture capital and private equity funding, $13.7bn raised on the public markets through initial public offerings or secondary offerings, and $46bn of investment in assets. The remainder is government and corporate spending on R&amp;D and smaller scale projects, such as a warehouse installing solar panels. The largest share of the cash is still going into wind, the most mature part of the renewable energy market, followed by biofuels and solar. The industry can offer a broad range of risk to meet any appetite. Many of the wind power companies and some solar companies are already profitable. Some of the more cutting-edge technology is still years away from commercial application, like algae, wave power or fuel cells, but could be the next big thing. 'The primary issue is that companies have become a lot more profitable,' says Ian Simms, who runs the environmental investment company Impax. 'The cost of generating electricity from wind has fallen by 80 per cent in 25 years, so it is now competitive with new-build coal. We started tracking quoted stocks, and in 1999 there were 180 around the world. Today there are 600, and there has been a huge increase in the average size of those companies.' There is something like $250bn a year of aggregate revenue, he adds. 'This isn't just about doing the right thing for the environment. We sometimes tell people that we are red-blooded capitalists to get across that we are here to make money for investors.' If there were any doubt that renewable energy is moving into the investment mainstream it would have been dispelled by the rush of the large investment banks to get into the sector. In May, Citigroup, the world's largest banking group, committed to an investment of $50bn in clean energy and alternative technologies such as wind farms, biofuels and solar panels over the next decade, including a $10bn investment to reduce its own carbon footprint. It is already backing a housing project on the Baja coast of Mexico where all of the electricity will be supplied by wind turbines. Earlier this month, Deutsche Bank announced the launch of the DWS Climate Change Fund. The bank described the shift from a carbon-based economy as a 'mega-trend'. Others to target clean energy with investment funds include Merrill Lynch, Schroders and Jupiter. Clean energy is also attracting more maintsream private equity and venture capital groups, including Europe's largest, 3i. Angus McCrone, editor of New Energy Finance, says growth in investment is running at 25-30 per cent per annum. 'The first year that we saw really strong growth across the board was 2004. Then in 2006, the message got through in the US, which is the biggest market, that this is a real issue that has to be tackled, and at that point you started getting the investment banks committed to spending billions on renewable energy and the carbon market. So late 2006 was probably a second tipping point.' PUSH AND PULL Adam Workman, a partner at Carbon Trust Investments, says renewables have changed from 'technology push to market pull' - instead of new technologies being developed and looking for markets to penetrate, the market is now demanding low-carbon alternatives. 'There has been a continual flow of events from Kyoto, to the Stern Report, to the oil price now heading toward $100 a barrel, to market leaders such as Tesco and Marks &amp; Spencer saying they want to do something about this. Collectively that gives investors like ourselves confidence.' The Carbon Trust has invested £8.8m across 11 businesses so far. Climate Change Capital, a London banking group focused on renewable energy, closed a €200m fund in September with investors including HSBC, Alpinvest and Alliance Trust. Bruno Derungs, one of the partners managing the fund, says the market has changed significantly. 'It had been very difficult to make money in this sector in the past, but the environment has improved in the past three or four years. The regulatory situation has been clarified and more long-term frameworks put in place. It is a more stable situation for investors and global warming has become a political issue, which is good for us as well.' AN ERA-DEFINING TREND HgCapital closed a £300m fund almost a year ago and has committed a third of the money. Tom Murley, who runs the fund, says that the institutions backing the likes of HgCapital have become more comfortable with renewable and clean energy, even as recently as the past 18 months. 'In pre-marketing, the first tranche of investors came in June 2006, and we had to spend a lot of time talking - there was a lot of education. By the second closing, people had accepted the premises and we were over-subscribed. It had clearly become a lot easier. People were much more up to speed on the market and the opportunities.' The Carbon Trust suggests that clean energy is now attracting 10 per cent of the venture capital cash being invested in Europe, putting it on a par with semiconductors, biotech and IT. Among private equity deals in the third quarter, an infrastructure fund managed by Prudential M&amp;G paid £145m to increase its stake in the UK's largest wind farm owner Zephyr Investments to 66 per cent. Some 42 per cent of private equity investments across Europe over the past three years were made in UK companies, where there is a lot of entreprenerial activity, followed by Germany and France. Private equity and venture capital firm 3i began actively targeting renewables and clean energy about two and half years ago, and has invested in companies including Solar Direkt in Germany and Spanish wind power group Gamesa. The majority of venture capital and private equity money is currently being pumped into solar. Much of the money going into wind is now larger-scale project financing from banks and utilities. Energy efficiency is another hot sector, particularly firms producing technologies that reduce the demand for power. Hansjerg Sage, a director at 3i, says the firm was attracted to clean energy as the 'returns became more visible'. The potential for profitable exits has risen as other investors look to take stakes and investment banks clamour to take clean energy companies to the stock market. At the more mature end of the market, in wind power, trade buyers have also started to appear in the shape of the large utlities. E.On recently paid $1.4bn for the Airtricity wind business in north America, while Energias de Portugal bought Horizon Wind Energy. In August, International Power paid £1.2bn for the Italian wind assets of Trinergy, outbidding specialists HgCapital and Babcock and Brown. 'Clean technology has the chance to become an era-defining trend like the internet or mobile phones, so it is something that no real investor can close its eyes to,' says Sage. BUMPY RIDES The rate of venture capital investment in Europe has lagged growth in the US, but that is partly explained by the number of companies raising money on the public markets in Europe, particularly London and Frankfurt. Companies are especially attracted to AIM because of the lighter regulatory regime and an investment community with an appetite for climate change stocks. There are around 75 clean tech companies listed on AIM (41 are UK-based businesses) with a combined market capitalisation of nearly €7bn. One of those companies, XL TechGroup, has signed a licensing deal with Arizona State University for its algae-to-biofuels technology. Others on AIM include Climate Exchange, a market for carbon trading; and Clean Energy Brazil, a producer of bioethanol from sugar cane. The rate of IPOs has slowed because of turmoil in the markets, yet in the third quarter of this year, three new clean energy companies joined the market: IdaTech, producing fuel cells, energy efficiency firm Vphase and solar company Jetion holdings. Ten of the 18 IPO filings around the world in the third quarter were solar companies. Investors on AIM have in many cases had a bumpy ride, some company share prices showing huge gains, and some dramatic losses. Investors who bought shares in Clipper Windpower when it joined the market in September 2005 are sitting on a gain of 1,078 per cent. Investors in Climate Exchange, who invested at its IPO in September 2003, have a gain of 1,178 per cent. Investors in China Biodiesel (down 67 per cent) have not been so fortunate. The amount of money pouring into renewables has raised the spectre of a bubble, similar to what happened to dot.coms in the late 1990s. There has already been nervousness around the biofuels sector. McCrone of New Energy Finance says: 'One of our recent themes has been that perhaps the amount of venture capital being raised is increasing faster than the number of opportunities to invest.' Derungs from Climate Change Capital says: 'A fundamental difference here is we are talking about real assets being rolled out. If it is a solar plant, it has assets that produce electricity ... and because you have real assets, they can be valued much easier, whereas with the internet and software it was much more difficult to value and people tended to get over excited.' Murley at HgCapital notes just how high some of the valuations currently are. 'Traditional utilities are trading around 18.8 times... I don't think this is a bubble in the sense that the market will fall away, but I think it is a bubble in terms of expectation. Is there some irrational exuberance? Maybe a little. But I am a big believer in this industry.'"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2006/aug/03/energy.renewableenergy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2006-08-02T23:09:08Z","webTitle":"Letters: The sun rises on solar power ...","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2006/aug/03/energy.renewableenergy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2006/aug/03/energy.renewableenergy","fields":{"headline":"The sun rises on solar power ...","bodyText":"I've had solar panels for five years (In praise of... solar panels, August 1).

Also, there is no way to store the excess generation, which is fed back into the grid, and which I would prefer to have when the sun goes down. East Herts district council is putting up housing on every available space, none of which takes into account renewable energy or other aspects of conservation. The planning department seems more anxious to keep the building industry placated than to save the planet, or at least make a reasonable contribution. Carol Howard Port Vale, Hertford Solar panels have to be manufactured and installed; this requires energy. Purchasers should ask how long will it take the gizmos to produce as much useable energy. Until that time is reached their output can't be considered \"green\". Unfortunately the answer both for solar panels and for domestic windmills, like the fashion statement which David Cameron is having installed, may well be longer than their expected lifetime. Brian Hughes Cheltenham, Gloucestershire The Bournemouth Energy Trust is about to be launched to compete in the solar energy market. While Currys is offering a solar electric system for £9,000, the trust will, for £8,000, pay for two megawatt hours per year per investor for 20 years at the lowest market price for grid electricity. This will save the client from the bother of installing and maintaining a solar panel system for 20 years. Net profits are to be invested in sunny developing countries.

It's open season for those who want a chunk of UK plc.' Lyons reckons that the Chinese are the ones to watch: with foreign reserves at around $1.3trn, Beijing has money to burn. Last week, the China Development Bank sent shockwaves round the City when it paid more than £1bn to take a stake in Barclays. Temasek, the Singaporean state-owned fund, also acquired a holding in the UK bank. The transaction is part of a deal that will furnish Barclays with extra cash to buy ABN, the Dutch financial institution that is the target of a bidding war between Barclays and a consortium led by the Royal Bank of Scotland. One analyst says: 'It's an extraordinary turn of events: Communist China helping a Western bank buy a continental competitor. This gives globalisation a new twist.' The amount that the Chinese bank is paying is relatively small, but it throws the spotlight on foreign state-owned institutions and companies that are gobbling up British firms with increasing frequency. An investment fund owned by the government of Qatar is bidding for J Sainsbury in a move that has sparked opposition from trade unions. Last year, Dubai acquired P&amp;O, the UK ports group, while British water and electricity companies have been snapped up by European rivals in a manner that UK utilities firms cannot emulate because continental countries are far more protective of their home markets. So is Asia: India and China impose strict limits on foreign investment. But not Britain, which is the most open market in the world, as illustrated by the large number of Russian, Central Asian and Chinese firms that have listed on the London and Aim stock markets. China's decision to acquire Western assets raises concerns because the amount of money that the Chinese have at their disposal could have wide-ranging economic consequences. Karen Ward, UK economist at HSBC, says: 'There are policy implications because by pumping liquidity into Western markets, the Chinese are doing something that runs counter to the wishes of the Bank of England, which is trying to remove liquidity by raising interest rates. If the Chinese are going to invest heavily in UK companies, it will push up asset prices in much the same way as the influx of foreign money into London has pumped up the property market.' Sensing, perhaps, that a protectionist backlash may not be far away, Alistair Darling, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, gave a speech last week in which he praised open markets as a force for good. According to Darling, foreign capital creates wealth and jobs, especially where the money is used to open new factories or expand existing businesses. He said: 'I welcome investment in Britain: it is a sign of our success. So I start this job championing free trade.' But Darling is aware of the drawbacks of openness when countries such as China restrict foreign investment. Foreign banks, for instance, are not allowed to own more than 25 per cent of Chinese institutions. Britain's EU partners have been talking about a European response to so-called 'sovereign funds' - state-owned institutions that seek to buy up corporate entities. These include funds operated by rich countries in the Middle East such as Delta Two, the Qatari vehicle that has J Sainsbury in its sights. But Darling has come down decisively against protectionism as a response, and British business organisations agree with him. Miles Templeman of the Institute of Directors, says: 'I am so glad he made that speech. You don't get anywhere by putting up barriers; it is better to engage with countries such as China and quietly persuade them to liberalise their markets. You cannot be half in favour of globalisation, in much the same way as you cannot be half pregnant.' Darling acknowledges, however, that 'investment needs to be a two-way process. So just as we welcome investment here, there needs to be a level playing field for British investment overseas. Openness should be a commitment by all. Free trade should be just that.' Earlier, Sir John Gieve, deputy governor of the Bank of England, told a City audience that the rising power of state-owned funds would lead to political tension and calls for protectionism. He may be right, but the Chinese are aware of Western sensitivities and can hardly be accused of taking the world by storm. Analysts say that Beijing has learnt a lot since 2005 when a Chinese oil company, CNOOC, tried to take over US-based Unocal but was thwarted by opposition on Capitol Hill. Now the Chinese appear to be more content with acquiring minority stakes in Western companies - they hold 7 per cent of Barclays and last month bought a 9.9 per cent share of Blackstone, the US private equity giant that floated on Wall Street. The conventional view is that China wants to diversify its reserves out of foreign currencies, principally the dollar, which accounts for 50 per cent of the total, by investing in assets that offer better returns than the 3 to 4 per cent generated by US treasury bills. Professor Laixiang Sun, at London University's School of Oriental and African Studies, says: 'China wants a more balanced portfolio with enhanced returns. It has seen how Temasek has grown rich by acquiring stakes in companies in Asia and elsewhere. Now it wants to do the same.' But Vince Cable, treasury spokesman for the Liberal Democrats, says China is 'also buying experience about how capitalism works - in areas such as intellectual property rights, private equity and research and development. It is investing in knowledge and expertise, which it still lacks in many sectors of economic activity.' In the case of Barclays, the China Development Bank will be represented on the bank's board, giving it a bird's eye view of how one of Britain's largest public companies operates. The way that deal was cemented is also instructive: it shows how, in a relatively short period of time, the Chinese have exploited a growing network of international contacts. It was John Studzinski, the former Morgan Stanley banker, now at Blackstone, who acted as a broker. Throughout the negotiations, Studzinski was in touch with Antony Leung, who runs Blackstone's China business and is in turn a member of the CDC board. For the Chinese, then, the connection with Blackstone proved crucial. The private equity firm was the obvious place to go for advice, given that the Chinese government has been one of its biggest investors after its June flotation. Despite China's new gently-gently approach to investing abroad, no one should doubt its determination to use its wealth to buy up foreign assets. It is already one of the biggest foreign investors in Africa, where it has acquired mines to secure a steady supply of the commodities needed to oil the wheels of rapid industrialisation at home. But the real issue for Beijing is how to spend the vast sums of money that have been accumulated via the dramatic build-up of trade surpluses, generated by an unparalleled export boom with the West and neighbouring countries in Asia. So China is to set up an investment fund that is expected to have a kitty in excess of $300bn. One analyst says: 'That is an incredible amount of money. Even adjusted for inflation, the US Marshall Plan after World War Two was only worth $100bn. I simply cannot believe that a fund of that size won't move markets.' He adds: 'Just think about private equity: stock prices have been inflated by the knowledge that cash-rich private equity firms have been circling publicly listed firms and could strike at any moment. Just knowing the Chinese are out there is bound to affect asset values.' But at what point do the activities of foreign investors ignite domestic political opposition? Cable, who is against Britain or the EU taking protectionist measures, says that our open markets haven't really been tested. 'Yes, we have had European monopolies taking over British utilities, but we have been very tolerant, hoping to lead by example. 'Funnily enough, it is the Russians, rather than the Chinese, that could provide a bigger test. If a company such as Gazprom [the Russian gas giant], with its close connections to the Kremlin, sought to acquire British Gas, it could raise problems about security of UK energy supplies, although it's difficult to see how we could stop it.' For his part, Laixiang Sun prefers to put a positive gloss on the emergence of China: 'The more the world can involve China in the global market place, the better,' he says. 'The EU was set up, in no small measure, to help prevent another conflict between France and Germany. If China is more closely integrated within the world economy, it reduces the likelihood of war.' Rising in the East The stakes 2005 Chinese computer manufacturers Lenovo buys out IBM's personal computer division. 2006 China Construction Bank acquires Bank of America's retail division in Hong Kong and Macau. May 2007 China Development Bank (CDB) buys 9.9 per cent stake in US buyout firm Blackstone for $3bn. July 2007 CDB buys £2.4bn stake in Barclays, with provision of a further £6.5bn if the British firm were to purchase ABN Amro. The listings Chinese companies have started floating on Western bourses: in London, 53 floated on Aim in 2005/7, including solar energy firm Renesola, while China's largest TV home shopping company, Acorn, and communications firm Qiao Xing Mobile floated on the New York Stock Exchange.

It is called Solar Home Energy (not Solar Energy). This has been corrected. Philip Pullman, Oxfordshire I am naturally concerned about climate change and our energy use, and it occurred to me that there is a roof on our house which is completely invisible from the road, and which faces south-west, so would be perfect for solar panels. (To heat water rather than generate electricity, by the way: I'm not entirely convinced that photovoltaic panels are all that effective yet, but as soon as they are I shall slap them up too. Water-heating panels, on the other hand, seem solidly based.) So we spoke to the council about putting panels up and they said immediately that we could forget it because this is a grade II-listed building. And then this energy company, Solar Home Energy, tried again, but about 10 days ago we got a letter from the council saying it was highly unlikely that consent would be granted. The letter did not give a reason, but the reason was obviously the fact that the house is listed. This just seems crazy to me: anything to do with a listed building has priority over everything else. If my house was a beautiful half-timbered Tudor building, I could understand it, but it is just an ordinary farmhouse and these are temporary, fully removable panels, being put on the roof in a position people would have to be invited into my garden to see. The man across the road from me has actually got solar panels on his roof: luckily for him, his house is not listed. My impression is that the council has got a set of guidelines and it is sticking rigidly to those, and it doesn't even occur to it that there are more urgent and recent considerations that should override them. There are these two sets of guidelines coming into conflict, and the wrong ones are trumping the right ones, as it were. There is just no indication of any awareness of the problem of climate change and the need to do something about it. I feel I have an individual responsibility, but at the same time putting in low-energy light bulbs or flying as little as possible - as I do now - will make not one atom of difference. This problem can really only be dealt with by the government, and I have absolutely no faith that the craven liars who are in power now will do anything at all. In my pessimistic moments, I think we are all heading for a catastrophe in which the planet is just going to slough off about five billion of us. In my better moments, I remember other things I was worried about that just went away. Miles Rich, Dorset I was in the army for a long time - I am retired now - and I have always been convinced that if you can heat water for free, you would be stupid not to take advantage of it. We've got solar water heating panels on our roof that I built about 30 years ago (and got pay-back from after 10 years) and this year I became interested in putting in photovoltaic cells. The plan was to install 10 panels on our garage roof. I knew about the government's Low Carbon Buildings Programme grants (www.lowcarbonbuildings.org.uk) and worked out that if I got one it would mean I could just afford it. I got in touch with Sunpowered Energy Systems, who were very good. They said the new grant allocation system was all online now. The man I was dealing with came over to help with our grant application on March 1 because I am in my 70s, and don't have much experience with the internet. We started at 8.30am, because at 9am the monthly allocation of grant applications was set to be released on a first-come, first-served basis. However, there were problems with my connection and we couldn't get into the website. Then it emerged that the postcode I had been using for the past 30 years was not correct. And by 10.20 all the grants had gone. It was maddening. If all the allocations can go in an hour and a half, then either the system does not give enough time to get to it, or there is not enough money. As a result, I have had to call the plan off. The grants for April have been cut, so even if we did succeed next month we would be £2,000 short. I believe that everyone needs to do their bit about global warming. It is frustrating to have been thwarted by this stupidity. Greg Manning, Aberdeenshire Since 1983, I have been living out in the middle of nowhere, in an old farmhouse, which we have now converted to tourist cottages. We have always been pretty green - we have got a wood-burning stove, and we have had solar water heating panels for about seven years. This year, I decided to put in a wind turbine. There are plenty of these turbines in Aberdeenshire; I can think of three in our area. When I put in the planning application in January this year, with the help of Joe Brown at Energy Renewed, I thought it would just be rubber-stamped. But it came back, not from the planning officers - they have been quite helpful - but from the environmental health department, which decided it wanted some noise data. The document it sent me is from the Department of Trade and Industry, and is about the assessment and rating of noise from wind farms. But I am not starting a wind farm - I just want to put up one turbine. And the manufacturer does not have this data, because no other department in the country has ever asked for it. And the cost of getting the data will be about £25,000, because you need to take measurements at specific wind speeds and specific heights, for specific amounts of time. My nearest neighbour is 500 yards away, but the department is concerned about the occupants of the holiday cottages, even though they are probably coming because we are known for being green, and they are hardly going to be surprised to see a turbine. So my application is stuck in the pending tray until the department changes it mind or the data materialises. The Scottish Executive and the government bang on about being green, but then you get something like this. Something has to be done to unblock the system."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2006/sep/20/art.culture","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2006-09-20T10:48:37Z","webTitle":"Another view: Michael Dickson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2006/sep/20/art.culture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2006/sep/20/art.culture","fields":{"headline":"Another view: Michael Dickson","bodyText":"Observation, measurement, invention and experiment are the key skills of any good engineer, and that's as true now as it was in Leonardo's time. In that respect, Leonardo is an example to us, but I wouldn't call him an engineer, partly because I don't think he had a formal knowledge of structural mechanics. I'd call Newton an engineer - Leonardo was truly a wonderful inventor. It all starts with intense observation, and that's very clear in the exhibition. I think he had a remarkable ability to watch and draw exactly what he saw, in proportion, very quickly. And then he would think about why it looked right, or didn't look right. I think he instinctively understood the nature of equilibrium. All the sketches that relate to the making of things are drawn to scale, whether you're looking at the flow of water through a sluice, or the pulley systems that he uses to open up a mountain in his stage spectacles. They're all, in his mind, a reality of action. That's fascinating. It comes from an acute sense of measurement - not in the pedantic sense but simply an appreciation of scale, and the relationship of all parts to the whole. They're blueprints. I suppose that's why he is so secretive in the mirror-writing that goes with them: they are patentable objects. The pages of his codexes are crammed with ideas. There's such a range of invention. His mind is working on parallel themes at the same time, and because he draws so exquisitely, he commits an idea to the page as it occurs to him. So, you might get a study of a convex mirror that harnesses solar energy to boil water next to a calculation of the volume of a pyramid. When I teach engineering students I refer to drawing as thought, and it seems to me that Leonardo is the apogee of that. He's using his incredible skills as a draughtsman to think through problems. Because he has a base in Aristotle and Archimedes, he can call instinctively on that knowledge. He didn't know any of the structural mechanics introduced by Robert Hooke and Newton, but he did have a very acute sense of the centre of gravity of objects. It's clear that he realised from his studies of humans that if you didn't have the centre of gravity in the right place, it wouldn't look right. There are so many ideas in the exhibition that it's hard to pick a favourite, but I loved the stage design for the opening of Pluto's mountain. The concept of these counterweights and pulleys that peel back the mountain to reveal its innards - that's an incredible sketch.

Climate change is a result of the rich world's inability to live sustainably and, as with the ozone hole, we in the developing world suffer the worst consequences. The average European emits 9,000kg of CO2 a year, the average American emits 22,000kg and the average African emits about 1,000kg. This means that while the rich world must decrease its average CO2 emissions drastically, we Africans are entitled to increase ours moderately as we pull ourselves out of poverty. We are the forest, you are the factory, so why should we be penalised for your smoke? I help to run Bulungula Lodge, a community-owned lodge in one of the poorest, most remote amaXhosa villages in South Africa. The village has no school, no clinic, no road, no electricity, no shop, no piped water and no toilets. The lodge runs on solar energy, uses compost toilets and recycles its grey water through a lush banana circle. It offsets CO2 emissions from its vehicles by planting 50 slow-growing forest trees per year and we will soon offer guests the opportunity to offset their airplane emissions by planting three trees of their own. The lodge, located in the heart of the village on a stunning beach, offers comfortable accommodation in traditional Xhosa rondawels with an eclectic atmosphere where guests can socialise with the local people. The community not only jointly owns the lodge, but also runs the activities that allow guests to immerse themselves in the cultural and natural environment: you can walk through the forests with a herbalist learning about traditional medicines; ride horses on the beach; canoe up the Xhora river; or just hang out at the local shebeen, where the traditional umqombothi beer never runs out. More than 40 jobs have been created by the lodge and associated businesses, which include guided hiking, village cultural tours, a solar restaurant, honey projects, a nursery, a low-pressure, drip-irrigated veggie farm supplying the lodge, guided fishing, and craft-making. This means that almost half the families in the village have moved on from subsistence farming and now have an income (and thus money for medicines and other essentials). If this lodge were to close, the only other realistic source of income for local people would be the rich titanium deposits found on the beaches and primary dunes of this coastal paradise. The mining companies have already begun tempting communities with lucrative deals. I believe the fair way to attribute CO2 emissions generated by holiday travel is to \"give\" them to the destination country. In South Africa, we have 1 million foreign tourists flying here annually, each emitting about 2,300kg of CO2 in the process. When divided by our 45 million population this would raise our average emissions by a mere 51kg per person per year. It would be utter hypocrisy to demand that South Africa reduce its average emissions by 51kg a year when Africa is by far the least polluting continent on Earth, and in the process destroy its tourism economy creating widespread poverty. Instead of increasing our emissions by building factories, we prefer to fly tourists to our continent. You wouldn't dispute our right to build a factory, so why complain about these flights? This isn't \"creative\" accounting, this is fair accounting. Yes, cancel your holidays to Europe, Australia and the US, countries that have grown rich off climatic destruction/ industrialisation. Cancel your business trips (use video conferencing) and holidays to the rich world (by train, plane or bus), and save up for a worthwhile holiday to the developing world. Your CO2 emissions are on us!

Food shortages, the credit crisis, escalating oil prices, a melting Arctic ice cap and the failure of the Doha trade negotiations: one or all of these issues could be the harbingers of profound change for our global civilisation. And just 16 months from now, in December 2009 in Denmark, humanity will face what many argue is its toughest challenge ever: to agree the fundamentals of a climate treaty to succeed the Kyoto protocol. It all seems to have happened so quickly. Just two years ago we received warning of an imminent disaster - a climatic shift that \"could easily be described as hell: so hot, so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive\". The Cassandra was no deep green fundamentalist, but James Lovelock, the acclaimed scientist, pro-nuclear advocate and past adviser to Margaret Thatcher, who, 27 years earlier, had surprised the scientific community with his book Gaia: A New Look at Life on Earth (OUP). At a time when reductionist science (which breaks down the world into small units in order to understand it) prevailed, Lovelock took the opposite approach, describing Earth as a single, self-regulating entity, whose function can be disturbed by human activities. It became one of the most influential books of the 20th century. In The Revenge of Gaia (Penguin), published in August 2006, the 86-year-old Lovelock concluded that \"we have unknowingly declared war on Gaia\", and that our only hope of rescue lies in a massive deployment of nuclear energy. The book found a wide readership, yet it failed to mobilise humanity to swift action. His nuclear solution instead divided environmentalists, and the bleakness of his vision was difficult to bear. And again his science went against conventional wisdom, for the most widely accepted assessment of future climate change at the time indicated that his bleak outcome was only a remote possibility. Other, more conventional readings of our climatic future became available in 2006, the most influential of which was Al Gore's An Inconvenient Truth. His computer presentation, which became both a successful movie and a bestselling book, opens with dramatic footage of collapsing ice shelves, melting glaciers and hurricane damage, then goes on to catalogue deleterious changes in ecosystems as diverse as tundra and coral reefs. If Lovelock diagnosed Gaia as having a fever, then Gore laid out the symptoms detail by detail. His examples were drawn primarily from refereed scientific publications in the world's leading journals, backed up with personal anecdotes from many of the scientists involved. My own book The Weather Makers (Penguin) draws on the same body of data, as does the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and countless other books and articles written at the time. An Inconvenient Truth was fundamental to the great climatic awakening that occurred late in 2006. I have no doubt that in years to come whole books will be devoted to analysing this shift in global public sentiment, which occurred between mid-August and late September. It is exceedingly rare that a film or book makes such a profound impact, yet An Inconvenient Truth marked the moment when the fossil-fuel industry and its political pawns lost their decades-long grip on public opinion, and perhaps inevitably Gore - who had been Clinton's vice-president and had won the popular vote in the most divisive election in recent US history, only to be denied the presidency by the supreme court - was excoriated in the rightwing press. It was as if the bitter race for the presidency had spilled out into climate science. I was lecturing at universities in middle America in 2007 when Gore and the IPCC were jointly awarded the Nobel peace prize. The naked anger and cynicism - at everything from Gore to peace prizes and Norwegians in general - were frightening. There are dangers in summarising complex science in a 90-minute presentation. Gore was excoriated for explaining that many glaciers are melting - faster indeed than any climatic model predicts - but failing to mention that a very few are growing. Furthermore, his explanation of the causes of climatic change in the geological past was of necessity simple, as was his narrative of contemporary climate change. Both result from a complex interaction of factors, as is well illustrated by the relationship between global warming and hurricane activity. After An Inconvenient Truth was published, researchers discovered that only around half of the increase in global hurricane activity could be directly attributed to an increase in Earth's average temperature. None of this, in my opinion, detracts from the veracity of Gore's exposition. Few books about climate change have been written by the meteorologists and atmospheric physicists that dominate the field. One charming exception is Willi Dansgaard's memoir Frozen Annals (Niels Bohr Institute, 2005). Dansgaard's involvement with climate science goes back to 1947, when he was sent to northwestern Greenland by the Danish weather service. Much of his life has been spent on the Greenland ice cap, drilling, retrieving and analysing the ice cores that provide the key to our understanding of past changes in climate. His book is surprisingly funny and tender, and makes obvious how hard-won is our basic knowledge of climate science. The first attempt at sampling the Greenland ice involved cutting pieces from bergs - an extremely hazardous practice that almost cost Dansgaard his life. While cutting into one, he writes, \"with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off. Fortunately, I fell on to the main part of the chunk, but now it started turning round so I ended up in the water . . . I began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice. There was none . . . I was not afraid of being so close to drowning, but of deserting Inge and our two kids, and I was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance.\" Just \"at that moment a true miracle occurred\" - the arrival of a \"rowboat sent out from Klaushavn\". A critical advance occurred in 1964, when an American-Danish collaboration began at Camp Century, perched high on the Greenland ice cap. The \"camp\" was a massive series of tunnels gouged in the ice, its facilities powered by a nuclear reactor. Spawned of the cold war, the facility had been envisaged as the first stage of a monstrous instrument of conflict, involving the sequestering of 600 nuclear missiles in 4,000km of tunnels. To support it, a city for 11,000 people was to be built inside the mighty ice cap - one of the most hostile and remote environments on Earth. The military planners, however, had failed to remember that ice flows, which means that tunnels and caverns drilled in it soon become hopelessly distorted. Camp Century was destined to play a very different role, for it was here that the first deep drilling into the Greenland ice cap occurred. Dansgaard conveys beautifully what it was like to work in such a bizarre environment, along with the wonders revealed when analysing that core - the discovery of evidence for the little ice age, the medieval warm period, and the great ice age that covered northern Europe and North America. Then, at the very bottom - 1.4km down - the researchers found evidence of a distant time when Earth was slightly warmer than it is today. They had, they realised, pierced right through the 100,000 years of a full glacial cycle - an entire ice age - and had come out the other side into a world that existed 130,000 years ago. It was a triumph they hardly dared hope for. Elucidating the cyclical nature of past changes in climate was the first great achievement of the ice-cap drilling project. One of the more striking cycles they discovered was a rapid warming that occurred every 1,500 years or so throughout the past 100,000 years. These oscillations between warm and cold conditions are now known as Dansgaard-Oeschger events. A sophisticated understanding of the great climatic cycles has permitted a new approach to the climate problem that finds its closest parallel in the \"wiggle matching\" used by stock-market analysis. William Ruddiman is a climatic historian whose book Ploughs, Plagues and Petroleum, published by Princeton in 2005, uses this approach to identify evidence of human impact on the climate system, by identifying precisely where we are in the current cycle and comparing the trend with earlier ones. We are, he explains, 12,000 years into a cooling phase which, judging from previous cycles, should continue for tens of thousands of years more. Instead the world is warming. But what is most remarkable about Ruddiman's work is the evidence it provides for an initial disruption to the climate system that occurred long before the industrial revolution - around 8,000 years ago. It was then, at the dawn of agriculture, that the \"wiggle\" of the current cycle first departed from earlier patterns - for instead of cooling, Earth's average temperature remained remarkably stable. Ruddiman thinks that this was caused by carbon and methane being released into the atmosphere from early agriculture and the destruction of forests. In his account, human activity and the great cycles struck a delicate balance that allowed the flowering of civilisations. He also sees evidence in the ice cores for the consequences of the Black Death (a drop of around two parts per million of CO2 as forests grew over abandoned fields, absorbing carbon from the atmosphere), as well as other historic events. Aspects of his work remain highly contentious, yet I believe that Ruddiman's realisation that the gaseous composition of Earth's atmosphere is an exquisitely sensitive barometer of changes to life itself represents a great breakthrough. Now that the majority of politicians, industry leaders and the public are convinced there is a climate problem, the focus is on what to do. The most influential assessments of the problem's scale are doubtless those of the IPCC, whose projections of various outcomes form the basis of global negotiations and national action plans. One of the most influential of these projections concerns the extent to which Earth's surface will warm over the next century. The lower bound is 1.4°C; the upper bound is 5.8°C. This is an extraordinary range of possible impacts - 1.4°C poses some threat, but 5.8°C is widely recognised as sufficient to induce a Lovelockian Ragnarok. The chance of either outcome, according to the IPCC, is small - less than 10%, and so political dialogue has come to concentrate on the mid-range of the projections. The moment of truth will arrive in December 2009, in Copenhagen, when the world's political leaders will come together to decide the basis of a new global treaty to replace the Kyoto protocol. It's no overstatement to say that the Copenhagen protocol, as it may well come to be known, will play a large role in deciding the fate of humanity. It will come into force in 2012, and if it fails to deliver we'll have to wait until 2020 for a replacement. That will be too late. A number of recent publications assess the costs versus the benefits of action to combat climate change. Among the most influential, and the most hotly contested, is the Stern review on the economics of climate change, a dense 692-page argument, published last year, the most famous finding of which is that \"the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting\". Nicholas Stern's argument was challenged almost immediately in Cool It by the Danish statistician Bjørn Lomborg, author of The Skeptical Environmentalist (Cambridge University Press). Lomborg does not doubt that global warming is occurring, nor that it is caused by humans, but almost alone among commentators he finds reason to welcome it. In Europe, he explains, only 200,000 people die from excess heat each year, while 1.5 million die from cold. His message is simple: more warming, less death. Lomborg's style is marked by glib, misleading associations. Even if the sea rises, Lomborg says, we shouldn't worry - we'll just put up dykes. With dykes, he asserts, some nations might end up with more land than they have today. And so the arguments go on, from rising seas to extreme weather events to malaria and other tropical diseases, the collapse of the Gulf Stream, food shortages and water shortages. In one case after another, Lomborg asserts that it's cheaper and better to do nothing immediate to combat climate change, but to invest in adapting to its consequences. It is in great contrast to Stern's painstaking and detailed analysis, and it entirely fails to dent Stern's case. In A Question of Balance: Weighing the Options on Global Warming Policies (Yale), the respected economist William Nordhaus asks how to deal most cost-effectively with the climate problem. He accepts the projections of the IPCC as a correct basis on which to undertake his analysis, and sets out to examine five policy options, ranging from \"do nothing\" through to \"ambitious\" proposals such as those advocated by Gore and Stern. He concludes that the ambitious proposals are disastrously expensive, and should be avoided. But do the IPCC projections reliably reflect future changes in climate? In 2007, scientists began comparing real-world trends with the panel's projections. They found that for the key performance indicators - the rate of warming, the rise in sea level and CO2 accumulation - real-world changes were at the upper bound or beyond the worst-case scenario presented by the IPCC. Further evidence that climate change is moving faster than we thought can be found at the north pole. The sea ice that covers the Arctic Ocean has glistened brightly into space for at least 3m years, and by reflecting the sun's energy it acts as a refrigerator that cools the entire planet. But where the ice melts, the dark ocean is revealed, and that captures solar energy and turns it into heat. In the summer of 2005, the rate of ice loss accelerated dramatically and has remained high ever since, the summer of 2007 seeing the greatest loss of Arctic ice ever. The scientific community is split on how the melting will turn out this year. A recent survey of Arctic specialists indicated that the majority consider a loss as great as that of 2007 to be unlikely, yet by June 2008 signs of a great melt were emerging and a senior adviser to the Norwegian government was warning that this may be the Arctic's first ice-free year. As I write, the rate of loss, while still well above average, has slowed somewhat. Yet even now it's impossible to predict. We can only project that if this summer's melt trajectory follows recent decades, by September this year the Arctic ice cap will have lost around half of its remaining ice, and be just 2.2m square kilometres. Most of those interested in climate science nowadays access information online, and one of the most significant of such contributions was recently posted by James Hansen, director of Nasa's Goddard Institute, and his colleagues, who have provided a partial explanation for these changes. They revisited a key piece of science underpinning the IPCC's work - the findings about how much warming a given amount of atmospheric CO2 pollution would produce - and discovered that, when viewed over the longer term, Earth's climate system is about twice as sensitive to CO2 pollution as is illustrated in the panel's century-long projections. One conclusion they drew is that there is already enough greenhouse gas pollution in the atmosphere to cause 2°C of warming - bringing about conditions not seen on Earth for 2m to 3m years, and constituting, according to the authors, \"a degree of warming that would surely yield 'dangerous' climate impacts\". Hansen and his colleagues pointed to a new understanding of how long it takes for the full warming consequences of a given amount of greenhouse gas to be felt. They concluded that we could expect to feel a third of any warming in the first few years. As Hansen and his colleagues put it: \"Sea-level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record, in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human-made forcing. This indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed, and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed.\" They also make a useful discrimination between climatic \"tipping points\" and \"the point of no return\". A tipping point is that at which the greenhouse gas concentration reaches a level sufficient to cause catastrophic climate change, while a point of no return is reached when that concentration of greenhouse gas has been in place sufficiently long to begin an irreversible process. Humanity is currently suspended between a tipping point and a point of no return, and the point of no return is likely to be reached within two decades. In summarising their findings, the researchers state that \"if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on Earth is adapted, palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that CO2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm\". This, they believe, can only be achieved by phasing out all conventional coal burning by 2030, and by aggressively reducing the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere by capturing it in growing tropical forests and in agricultural soils. That a rapid phase-out of coal is simply not enough is elegantly illustrated by the fact that the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere would remain above 350ppm for 200 years were a coal phase-out achieved within the next decade or two, and nothing else done. In his analysis, Nordhaus does identify one economically effective strategy worth pursuing. Called the \"low-cost backstop\", it revolves around identifying and developing some as yet unknown technology to combat the problem. Possible candidates include \"low-cost solar power, geothermal energy, some non-intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon-eating trees\". Writing in the New York Review of Books, Freeman Dyson has explored the unappealing option of such trees. The graph that first alerted humanity to the climate problem - drawn up by Charles David Keeling to show the CO2 increase from 1956 to the present - might, Dyson argues, hold the key to the solution. The graph has a generally rising line, with jags, like saw teeth, along it, which indicate a spike in CO2 each autumn in the northern hemisphere and a dip each spring. The difference between the minimum and maximum each year is around six parts per million, and it is due to the growth, then leaf fall, of the forests that grow across North America, Europe and Asia. It turns out, Dyson says, \"that about 8% of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year\". If only a way could be found, he muses, to permanently sequester that carbon, we would go a long way towards solving the climate crisis - hence the genetically modified trees. But the truth is that all trees are carbon eaters. They grow from the air by drawing CO2 into their leaves, and there solidifying it to build their wood, bark and leaf tissues. Trees are congealed CO2. What we need is a way of transforming the carbon they capture into an inert state. It turns out that humanity has had the capacity to do this for thousands of years, and is now on the brink of doing it on a very large scale. The process of charcoal-making is called pyrolysis, and involves the heating of any biological matter in the absence of oxygen. The result is the generation of a synthetic gas, or a crude-oil like material, and charcoal. If the gas or oily matter is captured, it can be used to generate electricity or power transport. The charcoal is largely carbon (representing one-third to half of the carbon in the biomass) and it is inert. Indeed, the tenacity with which charcoal resists rotting, even when buried in the soil, is clear from C14-dating, which uses ancient charcoal from hearths or fires as much as 60,000 years old. Modern pyrolysis involves machinery that captures flue gas or oil, and needs no external inputs to run the machine (some of the gas being used to heat the biomass). It's already being used on a small scale on farms, for urban garbage disposal (where 1,000-tonne units are deployed) and in forestry. On farms it has multiple benefits, for the charcoal can be ploughed back into the soil, where it balances acid soils, aids soil moisture retention, adds nutrients and acts as a habitat for soil fungi and bacteria. A farmer pyrolysing crop waste gains four benefits: 1) as usual, he gets to sell the commercial part of his crop; 2) he gets to generate electricity or transport fuel; 3) where carbon is traded, he can potentially sell the carbon he sequesters; and 4) by adding charcoal to his soil, he will increase the chances of getting a better crop the following year. With so many benefits, why is pyrolysis not more widely used? Because pyrolysis machines are expensive, and farms are mostly still family businesses. If farmers are ever to be able to afford the machines, they'll need to be paid around $37 per tonne for the carbon they create. They'll also need to be living in areas with carbon trading schemes that allow charcoal as a recognised method of carbon sequestration. While the developed world could go it alone with pyrolysis, unless China and India can be induced to take a lower carbon path than the west, there is absolutely no hope for us. While both maintain formidably tough international negotiating positions, there are signs of change, particularly in the energy sectors of both countries. China has a target for renewable energy of 10% by 2020, and is embarking on the largest nuclear power programme currently being developed, while India is pursuing wind and hydro power. Were the leaders of either country seeking a guide to determining a negotiating position in Copenhagen, they could do no better than Oliver Tickell's just-published book Kyoto2 (Zed Books), which provides a big-picture approach to the prevention of climatic catastrophe. In essence, Tickell provides a blueprint for a global climate treaty. He documents the failings of the Kyoto protocol, then goes on to summarise the latest climate science, including the work of Hansen and his colleagues. The replacement to the Kyoto protocol, Tickell writes, must work effectively to achieve a level of atmospheric CO2 below 350ppm. At the heart of the proposal is a global trade in carbon with a series of reducing caps sufficiently rigorous to bring about such an outcome. One of Tickell's most telling criticisms of Kyoto is its neglect of tropical forests as a means of sequestering carbon. The destruction of rainforests causes around 18% of the carbon going into the atmosphere annually, yet only a single project concerning tropical forests has been approved under Kyoto's clean development mechanisms. These allow for polluters to gain credits by investing in a variety of ways that reduce greenhouse gases. Dyson's analysis of the Keeling curve demonstrates just how powerful forests can be as sequesterers of carbon. It's widely acknowledged that Kyoto's successor must develop mechanisms that encourage the protection and regrowing of tropical forests. Tickell's discussion of market mechanisms is densely technical, yet much of it reads as common sense. His emphasis on the urgent need for government regulation is also cogent and refreshing, for he recognises that carbon trading is necessary, but not sufficient to solve the problem. He calls clearly for governments to regulate so as to increase efficiency of energy use, to protect forests and to mandate approaches such as clean coal technologies, as well as discussing the need to limit population. Reading Kyoto2 gives one hope that there is a way forward. But will such recommendations ever be agreed to, and can they be carried out in time? The books to read George Monbiot George Marshall, author of Carbon Detox (Gaia Books), understands the psychology of climate change and our inability to get to grips with it better than anyone else I have read. Mark Lynas's Six Degrees: Our Future on a Hotter Planet (Fourth Estate) is a lucid and deeply researched account of the predicted impacts of climate change, one degree at a time. In Kyoto2: How to Manage the Global Greenhouse (Zed Books) Oliver Tickell presents a global programme for cutting greenhouse gas emissions that is both radical and realistic. Caroline Lucas Seeing Green by Jonathon Porritt (currently out of print) changed my life. After reading it, I marched straight to the office of my local Green party to sign up. George Marshall's Carbon Detox is an upbeat and inspiring guide to lowering your carbon footprint. The Flood (Saqi Books), Maggie Gee's dystopian vision of a flooded future, with its well-drawn characters and lively prose, shows how the poor will always be the first to suffer the effects of climate change. Mark Lynas In Kyoto2, Oliver Tickell makes a radical suggestion: that instead of trying to regulate emissions of carbon dioxide, we should instead go \"upstream\" and regulate the production of carbon-based fossil fuels. Think of a garden sprinkler: if you want to stop the lawn getting wet, you don't try to catch each drop as it falls - you turn off the tap. The World Without Us (Virgin Books) by Alan Weisman contains a disarmingly simple but wonderfully clever idea: what would the planet look like if we all disappeared overnight? The perfect springboard for a much more engaging and fascinating discussion of humanity's environmental impact. Fred Pearce Rachel Carson's Silent Spring (Penguin Modern Classics), published in 1962, was environmentalism's tipping point. Before Silent Spring, we worried about saving wildlife; afterwards we feared our own species would drown in a toxic tide of chemicals. In 1979 came Gaia: A New Look at Life on Earth (OUP) by James Lovelock. Not since Charles Darwin's Origin of Species has any book so shaken science's sense of how our world works. John Reader's Man on Earth (published in 1988 and currently out of print) is an overlooked masterpiece about the ecology of human cultures. Leo Hickman Robert Henson's Rough Guide to Climate Change (Rough Guides) is the best pocketbook primer on the subject. On its publication in late 2006, it was sent to every MP with a short questionnaire, including the question \"How important a concern is climate change?\" Hundreds answered, the majority of whom said it was the most pressing issue of our age. Gordon Brown never responded. Hide Tide by Mark Lynas (Picador) is a journey through the climate change \"hot spots\" of the world. It's the testimonies of the people Lynas meets who are already suffering from the onset of climate change that produce the most persuasive argument for us to urgently face up to the challenge ahead. Laurie David Earth in the Balance (Longman), written by Al Gore 15 years ago, is doubly fascinating to read now. It makes you realise how much he was right. I devoted myself to the issue of climate change after reading Ross Gelbspan's Boiling Point (Basic Books). If you look at Keith Bradsher's High &amp; Mighty (PublicAffairs US), you will never walk past an SUV again without shaking your head. What Al Gore is to awareness of global warming, William McDonough is to the solution. His Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things (Rodale Press) is the only book about the environment that is actually waterproof. Also read anything by Gus Speth or Bill McKibben."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"travel/2007/sep/23/escape.egypt","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2007-09-22T23:07:09Z","webTitle":"Inside the Bedouin's secret garden","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2007/sep/23/escape.egypt","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2007/sep/23/escape.egypt","fields":{"headline":"Inside the Bedouin's secret garden","bodyText":"It's the eve of Ramadan, and the sun is sinking behind Sinai's ragged mountains. After a long day's hike, I'm taking in the view from the summit of Jebel Abbas Pasha, among the ruins of a palace commissioned by a viceroy of Egypt called Abbas Hilmi Pasha. Abbas, the story goes, suffered from tuberculosis and wanted a desert equivalent of a Swiss sanatorium. But he was not popular with his servants: he once had a red-hot horseshoe nailed to the foot of a groom who was slacking on the job. So the underling did him in before the consumption could, and only the first-storey walls of the palace were built. Dressed blocks of stone lie abandoned at the entrance, as though a grateful workforce simply walked off the job when the news broke. If Ozymandias had a home, this would be it. Poor old Abbas is largely forgotten these days. Most tourists who venture inland from Egypt's Red Sea coast visit just two places, and I could see one of them from my perch on Jebel Abbas Pasha: the summit of Jebel Musa or Mount Sinai, where Moses received the 10 commandments. Watching the sun rise from the top of Mount Sinai is wildly popular, with up to a thousand people sleeping out each night. (What happens about toilet facilities doesn't bear thinking about.) At its foot is St Catherine's, the world's oldest continuously inhabited monastery and the second of the area's honeypots, where hundreds of tourists jostle to see the original burning bush. But there is another Sinai, far from resorts like Sharm el-Sheikh or the coach-party hotspots. It's a world of silent canyons, or wadis, and rugged peaks studded with livid patches of green where the desert has been coaxed into life by the local Bedouin tribe, the Jebeliya, or 'mountain people'. Welcome to trekking heaven. The Jebeliya are, the story goes, the descendants of 200 Roman soldiers drafted by the emperor Justinian from Egypt and the Black Sea region to protect St Catherine's, his new monastery, founded in 527. Over the past 14 centuries they intermarried with other Bedouin and converted to Islam, but they are proud of their special status and the way they have survived in these arid mountains. The Bedouin legacy in this beautiful but harsh environment is best understood in the gardens they have cultivated for hundreds of years. The Christian monks they served showed the Jebeliya how to grow food in a dry climate, and they relied for generations on the fruit and grains that their tiny walled enclosures, called karm, could produce. The past few decades have proved difficult for traditional Bedouin culture, however. The construction of resort towns such as Sharm and the influx of Nile Egyptians have left many Bedouin feeling like strangers in their own land. Old fishing rights have been revoked and land sold for knockdown prices. For their part, Egyptians view the once-nomadic Bedouin's cross-border ties with Israel, Jordan and Saudi Arabia with suspicion. The chance to earn money on the coast has tempted many young Bedouin away from their former lives. Flocks of goats have dwindled and some karm have fallen derelict. But the Bedouin are proud and still deeply in love with their landscape. They know their identity is intimately connected to the desert and mountains. Standing beside me on the summit of Jebel Abbas Basha is my guide, Rajab, who has been waiting patiently to start the long descent to that night's campsite in Wadi Zawatiin. Rajab, 32, has two small children and relies heavily on guiding tourists for his living. The going rate is £5 a day. Born in a remote wadi in the mountains, he lives now with his family in the local town of St Catherine. 'You know,' he says as we walk down the dusty zig-zag track Abbas Pasha's workmen carved out of the mountain, 'if there are no tourists for a few weeks, I go to the mountains anyway.' He is certainly fit. The walking around here can get pretty tough, and more than once I found myself scrambling across rocks and pulling myself up with my hands to keep up with him. The landscape is shaped as much by wind as by water, with bizarre shapes sculpted from huge boulders. Some of these strange cavities have been turned into grain stores and dwellings by the Jebeliya and by the Orthodox monks who used to find retreat in Sinai's remoter corners. In the evenings we set up camp in a garden and sleep under the stars around the embers of a fire, after a huge meal. We're more than 2,000m above sea level, and in winter it gets cold, so you need a good sleeping bag. But the beauty of Sinai's mountains is that you can trek here pretty much all year round. Come in spring for the almond blossom, or in the autumn to try the fruit. The highlight of my four days' walking was a swim in the magical pool of Galtal-Azraq - the blue pool. From our camp at a half-ruined garden in a dusty bowl called Farsh Romana (the place of pomegranates), we walked for two hours until, below in a deep-set canyon, we glimpsed the 20ft pool of water. Diving into it, in the wilds of these dry mountains, was extraordinarily beautiful. It would be possible to show up in St Catherine and start trekking on your own, but while Sinai's mountains are compact, they are also fiendishly complex, and people regularly get lost. And anyway, while the landscape is ruggedly beautiful, the most appealing thing about walking here is learning how the Bedouin have survived and prospered. And for that you'll need a guide. Rajab spent the days answering my rush of dumb questions with aristocratic politesse. Every so often he would amble over with a sprig of something in his hand and crush it under my nose, releasing the scent of yet another herb. Thyme, oregano, mint and sage all grow wild here, and brushing against the plants releases the most fabulous smells. It only adds to the harmony of the place. Herbal medicinal lore is a major feature of Bedouin culture. They use the scores of plants available to them as analgesics, astringents, diuretics, emetics, purgatives, poultices, salves and tonics. They even do something really rather disgusting with donkey poo to cure a bad cough. But herbal medicines are also used for more metaphysical ailments, such as bad spirits and the negative effects of sorcery and witchcraft. This heady combination of natural beauty, human resourcefulness and the romance of desert life makes this corner of Egypt very special indeed. It's not much further to fly than Morocco, with a three-hour transfer from Sharm to St Catherine. There aren't many places where you can be exploring such wild mountains in the morning and diving on coral reefs in the afternoon. So it's a bit perplexing that on my entire trek, I didn't meet another tourist. A lot of work has been done over the past 10 years, funded largely by the EU, to build just the sort of infrastructure that is in harmony with the low-impact lives of the Bedouin. In 1996, some 5,750 sq km of southern Sinai was designated the St Catherine's Protectorate to preserve the region's heritage. Trouble is, no one thought to explain all that to the sort of tourists who appreciate the sensitive approach. On my first day in St Catherine I saw a classic example of this. The EU has funded a beautiful visitor centre, housed in a collection of Bedouin-style stone huts, that tells the story of the region's nature and culture. As a primer for trekking through these arid mountains it was invaluable. But the centre is locked up most of the time, with no one to run it. We had to find a local official at his home to open up for us. Coachloads of tourists from the coast drive into the Protectorate each day to see the monastery and have a camel ride. The fees they pay to enter the park don't stay long in Sinai, but are absorbed by central government in Cairo. Local Bedouin feel ignored by the tourist trade, which values numbers above all. A visible police presence following recent terrorist attacks on the Red Sea resorts hasn't helped. It was a similar story at the Al Karm Ecolodge. This stunning refuge three hours' hike from St Catherine is located in Wadi Gharba on the old pilgrims' road to the monastery. It was opened in 2002 with EU funding and is essentially a minimalist boutique hotel - but one with no electricity, and elegant showers heated by solar energy. Al Karm is a stunning place to stay. The accommodation is spread through a cluster of Jebeliya-style houses. Egyptians come down from Cairo to escape the crowds and spend a few days reading or doing yoga. There's a Nabataean village to explore, built by the ancient traders who created Petra, and some excellent local hikes. Even in summer, the heat isn't intolerable, thanks to its altitude of 1,100m. In winter, guests huddle around the sitting-room fire. Jamil Atiya is treasured by his regular customers as a capable cook and an amiable host, representing all that is good about Bedouin hospitality. The inexplicable thing is that even in a good month it is barely occupied at all, despite a night's full board costing only £10. If you had a book to write, and a solar panel to charge your laptop, it would be perfect. I drove out to Al Karm along a bumpy jeep track with a man who could help fire up the lacklustre attention Sinai's remoter corners have received. Mark Knutton fell in love with the region and its people during a short trek and decided to turn his passion into a business. He had a background in telecommunications marketing, so it was quite a career shift, but Knutton thinks he can help provide fresh impetus to sustainable tourism initiatives already in place - like the Al Karm Ecolodge. Bedouin Paths, his new trekking company, which runs its first treks next month, is, he says, all about making ethical tourism pay. A large percentage of his profits will go to social programmes in Bedouin communities. Knutton plans to pay for projects requested by local people, the first of which will be a school. Right now, the classroom is a disused lock-up with a blackboard, but Knutton says the money trekkers pay will allow him to hire good teachers from Cairo. In the long term, he's planning a new classroom and, more ambitiously, simple lodges near the gardens of the Bedouin to provide shelter for trekkers and an income for the community. Just as importantly, it will give the Bedouin a commercial incentive to restore those gardens that have fallen into disrepair. Working with Cairo-based architect Anne-Catherine Escher, Knutton is drawing up plans for inexpensive units for washing, cooking and sleeping that can be added as money allows but are in tune with the existing buildings. I couldn't help feeling, sitting in the garden of an old man called Ouda, in the improbably named Wadi Shagg, that the acid test for the survival of the Jebeliya will be the fate of these beautiful gardens. I was surrounded by trees and shrubs, offering figs, pomegranates, mulberries, walnuts, almonds, apples, pears, oranges, grapes and olives. Despite three years of minimal rainfall, Ouda had maintained the miracle of this green oasis. But will this garden still be here in 20 or even 10 years? For once, tourism could be part of a solution rather than the problem, and Knutton's timing is flawless. After a brief absence when projects have been allowed to drift, the EU is now investing again in St Catherine's sustainable tourism. Unrolling my mattress in Ouda's garden and lying down to sleep next to a pomegranate bush, I flicked on my iPod. By chance, it picked out a track by New York DJ Raz Mesinai, 'The Bedouin Walks Alone'. Hang on, I thought - not today he didn't. Essentials Ed Douglas travelled with Bedouin Paths (020 8744 0474; www.bedouinpaths.com) whose treks start in October. A week's trek costs £350, including transfers, baggage camels, meals, guides and accommodation, but not flights. Of this price, 40 per cent is earmarked for teaching and for rebuilding Bedouin buildings and gardens. GB Airways (0870 850 9 850; www.gbairways.com) has flights London Gatwick to Sharm from £210."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"}]}}
