The report, which was funded by the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, warns that the contamination is being spread by poorly regulated scrap metal dealers, including children. It also documents evidence that DU munitions were fired at light vehicles, buildings and other civilian infrastructure including the Iraqi Ministry of Planning in Baghdad – casting doubt on official assurances that only armoured vehicles were targeted. \"The use of DU in populated areas is alarming,\" it says, adding that many more contaminated sites are likely to be discovered. More than 400 tonnes of DU ammunition are estimated to have been fired by jets and tanks in the two Iraq wars in 1991 and 2003, the vast majority by US forces. The UK government says that British forces fired less than three tonnes. DU is a chemically toxic and radioactive heavy metal produced as waste by the nuclear power industry. It is used in weapons because it is an extremely hard material capable of piercing armour. However, it can contaminate the environment, and has been linked to health problems in civilian populations. Iraqi doctors have reported increases in cancers, and an alleged rise in birth defects is under investigation by the World Health Organisation and the Iraqi Ministry of Health. The health effects are disputed by the US and UK governments, who joined with France and Israel to vote against a resolution calling for \"a precautionary approach\" to the use of DU weapons at the United Nations general assembly in December; 155 countries voted in favour of the resolution. The new report from IKV Pax Christi, an inter-church peace group at Utrecht in the Netherlands, says sensationalist claims that the use of DU was \"equivalent to 100 Chernobyl accidents\" or was an \"act of genocide\" lacks any scientific basis. But it argues that the health concerns of Iraqi civilians are real and should be taken seriously. The report, founded on three investigatory trips to Iraq in 2011 and 2012, quotes the Iraqi government's Radiation Protection Centre (RPC) as having identified between 300 and 365 contaminated sites by 2006. Most of them are in the Basra region in southern Iraq. The report's author, Wim Zwijnenburg from IKV Pax Christi, criticised the US for failing to confirm where it had fired DU weapons. \"It is unclear exactly how many locations may still be contaminated, or the extent of the risks that civilians face,\" he said. \"DU's apparent use in built-up areas against a range of targets in 2003 increased these risks,\" he added. \"The uncertainty means that fear of DU among Iraqi civilians is widespread, yet effectively managing DU's legacy will require international assistance.\" The UK government insisted that it would continue to deploy DU weapons when needed. \"There is no reliable scientific or medical evidence to suggest DU causes ill health and the UK is therefore one of various countries that do not favour adopting a precautionary approach to its use,\" a UK government spokeswoman told the Guardian. \"While UK armed forces have not needed to use DU since 2003, it would be wrong to deny them the potential future use of a legitimate and effective capability.\" Though some cleaning up is meant to have been done, the report says that many sites are still contaminated, and new areas of contamination continue to be found. It quotes one RPC official as saying that each site could cost between $100,000-$150,000 to decontaminate, making a total of between $30m and $45m. The Iraqi government doesn't have the resources to deal with the problem, the report argues. It says it is also failing to control the trade in military scrap metal, which can be lucrative and involve children. The US Department of Defence did not provide a response to questions about the report."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/german-elections-blog-2013/2013/sep/12/german-view-from-abroad","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2013-09-12T10:57:47Z","webTitle":"The German view from abroad","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/german-elections-blog-2013/2013/sep/12/german-view-from-abroad","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/german-elections-blog-2013/2013/sep/12/german-view-from-abroad","fields":{"headline":"The German view from abroad","bodyText":"'In Britain there is sometimes a fear of difficult culture' The thing Peter Boenisch still doesn't understand about Britain is our windows. \"Why on earth would you insist on impractical windows one cannot properly open (to the inside, that is), and which you therefore cannot even really get clean other than from the outside by a window cleaner on a ladder?\" asks the Kent University lecturer, who has spent almost 10 years on our rainy island. \"I no longer come back from visits to Germany with a suitcase full of food (bread, in particular, in the early years). But windows that only open to the outside are truly something I never ever got over here in the UK.\" As professor of European theatre, Boenisch says what he misses most about his Bavarian homeland – apart from the superior fenestration – is the respect afforded to serious art. Bild, Germany's best selling daily tabloid, regularly reviews opera and theatre, and the \"serious\" newspapers such as the Süddeutsche Zeitung have extensive cultural pages called the Feuilleton which eschew pop culture and gossip in favour of dissecting often very challenging art. \"In Britain I think there is sometimes a fear of difficult culture. Generally I think people here haven't discovered the joy in difficult thinking, of philosophy,\" says Boenisch. \"They don't understand that it is part of life to engage with difficult ideas.\" In Germany, says the 42-year-old, there is no outcry about subsidising art forms seen as elitist in the UK. He thinks the high prices of UK theatre deters audiences from taking risks when they book tickets. \"In Germany I often pay as little as €5 for a show in a state subsidised theatre. Even for the best seats at the biggest shows, I never pay more than €40 or €50. And if I don't like it, I leave. In the UK the prices are so high that people are far less willing to experiment.\" But when he goes back Germany these days, he is bored by the media and especially the tame political discourse. \"We don't have an equivalent of the Today programme or Jeremy Paxman on Newsnight,\" he says. As an academic, Boenisch was surprised upon arrival in the UK that his students dared to address him by his first name – a big nein-nein back in Germany where, he says, \"if you forget one of the 'Doctors' in Professor Dr Dr So-and-So it's an offence\". At German universities students and lecturers use the polite \"Sie\" form, never daring to omit the honorific(s). But over time he says he has learned to appreciate the British informality, the less rigid hierarchies – particularly in academia. Some lessons have been less welcome. He has reluctantly accepted the need in Britain to dance around subjects rather than criticise his students head-on. \"I remember at the start I upset a student by telling them that their presentation wasn't very good. They went and complained to another member of staff, but I wasn't trying to offend, merely to offer advice for improvement. Here, direct criticism is often taken as a very personal critique.\" 'We work harder than the Germans think we do' Peter Spieller came to Spain three years ago, enticed by his Spanish girlfriend and the Mediterranean way of life. Things have been going well for him but he knows that his luck could change at any moment, as has happened to other Germans who have been forced to return home. \"I found work straight away in hotels because they were looking for people who spoke German,\" says Spieller, who now works in Auryn, the German bookshop in Madrid. Now that he knows Spain well, Spieller believes that the image that many of his compatriots have of workers in Mediterranean Europe is unjust. \"Germans think that Spaniards don't work because when they come to Andalusia on holiday they find the shops closed. What they don't know is that the same shops reopen in the mid afternoon until night-time,\" he explains. \"We work harder than the Germans think we do. Spaniards spend a huge amount of time at work.\" Spieller, like many other foreigners who end up on these shores, has fallen in love with the Spanish way of life. \"Life is better here. The climate, the food, the lifestyle … it is a very beautiful country with incredible places to discover. The big problem is politics.\" Spieller does not understand how successive revelations about cases of corruption have failed to produce a single resignation. \"In Germany, when a politician does something bad, he has no option but to resign. Here, no. It annoys me that in this country one speaks of democracy, but then it isn't applied and people don't care.\" Why does he think that the streets are not full of people protesting? \"Because they go to the bar, they go out in the sun and overall there are more ways of letting off steam.\" He ends with some advice for the Spaniards who in recent times have been knocking on German doors looking for a way out of the crisis in Spain.\" They have to learn German. If they don't, they'll only find worse quality jobs.\" 'Germany is more open than it was when I left' Petra Kringel says returning to Germany has never crossed her mind. \"Of course, I read the news and stay up to date,\" says the 54-year-old, who moved to Paris in 1982. \"A short while ago, I even used to vote in the German legislative elections. But this time I won't. French politics affects me more these days and German politics is a bit sad as there isn't much difference between the parties. On the other hand, Germany is more open than it was when I left. It has become a multicultural country.\" Kringel has spent more of her life in France than Germany. To start with, she spent six months a year in both countries, but by 1984, her employer – the German bookshop Marissal Bücher – took her on permanently. \"When I arrived the French saw me as a typical German woman, with blue eyes and blond hair,\" she says. \"There was only one person who dared to ask me questions about deeper issues. Towards the end of dinner, this young man said, 'W hat do you think of national socialism?' I ended up marrying him, which has clearly contributed to my decision to stay put. \"Even though I've now been an expat for many years, I don't think my view of Germany has changed. There are still some fundamentally German things in me such as my rejection of nuclear power. This is deep-rooted in me but it doesn't mean I'm happy about all the energy changes made in Germany. I've also remained German when it comes to food: I miss Schwarzbrot (black bread).\" 'The question of returning to Germany does not arise' If it was language that drew Norbert Bickert to Italy, it was family that kept him there. \"The first thing that impressed me about Italy was the language,\" says the 58-year-old. \"All these words with the A large and round and you had to open your mouth to say them: how nice! The Germans can say almost anything with his mouth closed.\" Now he has been in Italy almost 30 years, with a home, a wife and two children and a position as a German teacher at the University of Turin. \"The question of returning to Germany does not arise: I would not find work – even there, age matters a lot and at age 58, I'm too old. If there was a chance, I might be tempted. Because there is a side of Italy that I never liked and that is the management of public life. In Germany, 'welfare state' means that citizens are covered in all situations of fragility, while in Italy I always have the impression that in order to survive you have to know someone, have links with particular individuals.\" And there's a second thing that nags him about his adopted home that he feels Germany manages better: cultural heritage. \"When I go back to Frankfurt and walking the streets, I see and live the fact that half of the city was destroyed in the war: there is a villa, then a barracks, a skyscraper and maybe another villa. See their holes of 1945.\" • This article was amended on 16 September 2013 to correct a subheading which misquoted Peter Boenisch."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/blog/redirect-military-expenditure-sustainable-future","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2013-04-17T12:58:00Z","webTitle":"Redirect military expenditure to ensure a sustainable future","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/blog/redirect-military-expenditure-sustainable-future","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/blog/redirect-military-expenditure-sustainable-future","fields":{"headline":"Redirect military expenditure to ensure a sustainable future","bodyText":"Last year $1.75tn was spent on the world's military, according to new estimates released this Monday by the Stockholm International Peace Institute (SIPRI). Seems like a lot? Let me put this into perspective. This amount is the equivalent of Canada's GDP or twice the GDP of the Netherlands. Nato members together spent a trillion dollars on the military and despite a significant 6% decrease, the US remains firmly in the lead, accounting for about 40% of the global amount. With a considerable percentage of citizens' taxes both in America (where it's up to 47%) and across the globe going towards military expenses, surely people are entitled to question whether this is money well spent to ensure security. And how this spending is more justified than, say, investing in renewable energy, health care and education. Consider this: every day 19,000 children under the age of five die around the world, mainly from preventable causes. The costs of reducing mortality rates by two-thirds, improving maternal health as well as combating Aids, malaria and other major diseases, are estimated to be $60bn (£39bn) a year. Meanwhile, $60bn is approximately the cost of buying and operating two nuclear ballistic missile submarines. The estimated total cost of achieving the six of the UN's millennium development goals related to poverty, education and health – eradicating hunger, universal primary education, child mortality reduction, disease prevention– is $120bn annually in additional resources, a fraction of what is spent every year on militaries. We at Greenpeace join the outcry against excessive military spending. Rather than spending money preparing for conflict, governments must focus their efforts on avoiding conflict and achieving sustainability and equity in their countries. Climate change is a major driver of conflict and threat to international and national peace and security, putting billions of people's future in jeopardy. It is not often the case that we find ourselves in agreement with the military and intelligence communities, but when it comes to the security implications of climate change, it seems we may have some similar concerns. In May 2012, US Secretary of Defence Leon Panetta said: \"Climate change has a dramatic impact on national security: rising sea levels, to severe droughts, to the melting of the polar caps, to more frequent and devastating natural disasters all raise demand for humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.\" These impacts of climate change are already being felt. Climate change and a carbon-intensive economy are already responsible for 5 million deaths each year. By 2030, deaths could total 100 million. This is already costing about $1.2tn a year, which could double by 2030 if global temperatures are allowed to rise. So why is it that governments carry on spending $105bn a year on nuclear weapons, rather than diverting the amounts to mitigating the risks of the true WMD – \"weather of mass destruction\"? Governments intent on spending taxpayers' money are fuelling the problem, rather than the solution. A new report by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) reveals that worldwide subsidies to fossil fuels total $1.9tn annually. Almost 9% of all annual country budgets are spent on supporting oil, natural gas and coal industries. Subsidies result in overconsumption of dirty energy, which fuels climate change. Eliminating subsidies would lead to a 13% decrease in global energy related CO2 emissions. Moving away from fossil fuels and investing in renewable energy is the world's best hope for avoiding the most serious impacts of climate change. In 2011, renewable energy provided more than 30% of new electricity production globally, up from less than 5% in 2005. In 2012, investments in renewable energy approximated $250bn – which employed 5 million people worldwide, a win-win situation. An energy revolution in the power sector – moving away from climate-destroying fossil fuels and dangerous nuclear power – would require additional annual investments of $280bn – investments that would not only pay back financially but would significantly reduce the security threats resulting from climate change. More than $3.5tn is spent annually on the world's military and on subsidising fossil fuels. We can no longer stand by and allow governments to spend recklessly on the wrong things, when so many right things remain neglected. Eradicating poverty and child mortality, and mitigating the destructive impacts of climate change could all be achieved if governments got their priorities right.

The tendency to dehumanise and securitise them is not only deeply disturbing, it is also beset, in part, by a paradox of our parliament’s own making: Australia has imposed sanctions on Iran since 2008. These are autonomous measures, implemented at the total discretion of the Australian government, in addition to the raft of sanctions that have been set by the UN Security Council since July 2006 over Iran’s alleged nuclear weapons programme – penalties that successive Liberal and Labor governments have wholeheartedly supported and implemented. Indeed on 10 January 2013, Australia’s minister for foreign affairs announced a further round of autonomous sanctions. In part, he said: These sanctions further increase pressure on Iran to comply with its nuclear non-proliferation obligations and with UN Security Council resolutions and to engage in serious negotiations on its nuclear program. Notably, this policy pronouncement came a mere three days after Australia had assumed the chair of the Iran Committee on the UN Security Council, which the minister saw as recognition that, “we’re seen as having the commitment and resources to deliver effective oversight of international sanctions regimes which are critical to Middle East and global security”. The signal Canberra is sending Tehran is loud and clear: despite the rhetoric of being a “creative middle power” – in this instance, following the lead of the US – sanctions are the only game in town. Why is Iran being sanctioned? The reasons behind both types of sanctions are complex. They stem from contending views of the nature of Iran’s nuclear-related activities – is it for strictly peaceful purposes, or not? In many ways, however, the origins of the Iran nuclear dispute are less strategic than they are historical, political and cultural. The failure of the international community to respond to the ongoing deployment of chemical weapons use by Hussein during 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war remains a gaping wound that still needs tending – it was, after all, one of few instances such weapons have been used in human history. All told, 5,000 Iranian and Iraqi Kurds were killed as part of a decade-long weapons program in which a dozen states were later to be implicated. To be sure, criticisms of Iran’s nuclear activities and cooperation are difficult to be dismissed out of hand; but at the same time, nor can assurances from Iranian political and religious leaders. Before the explosive missives characteristic of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, president Mohammad Khatami sought a “dialogue among civilisations” with George W Bush. Around the same time, the Bush administration characterised Iran as part of an “axis of evil”. Incoming president Hassan Rouhani will likely be more tempered and moderate in his approach than was Ahmadinejad. Rouhani’s long-time ally Seyed Hossein Mousavian, writing now as an academic at Princeton, believes the new president has five options: enter into new talks, surrender, tolerate the west, get bombs, or withdraw altogether from the nuclear regime in protest. Although what influence Rouhani will have is of course as yet unknown. Crucially, all political leaders must act in concert with Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei. Whilst Khamenei’s response to the dual-track of talks and sanctions has been mixed, he’s remained resolute in Iran’s inalienable right to nuclear power, and in 2005 issued a fatwa on the development, use or possession of nuclear weapons in an effort to reinvigorate earlier statements by his predecessor Imam Khomeini at the founding of the Islamic Republic in 1979. Yet it remains unclear what (if any) significance has been attached to such religious condemnations of nuclear weapons – particularly by the secular states of the west, and the Vienna-based international nuclear watchdog, the IAEA. To what extent can Tehran be trusted? Eroding and building trust Diplomacy has failed thus far to build the requisite trust between negotiating parties. The heavy reliance on sanctions has already eroded it to such an extent that there is already a discernible spike in calls for the pre-emptive and preventative use of force. Such a strategy belies a growing academic literature on the imprecision and inexactness of sanctions in changing state behaviour. For instance, recent scholarship into all of the sanctions levied during the 20th century has found that they caused more deaths than have biological, nuclear and chemical weapons combined throughout their entire history. This is certainly also true of the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Unquestionably, all forms of sanctions have the capacity to cause widespread harm and suffering to the peoples of Iran, as well as to the 35,000-strong diaspora community already resident in Australia. Whilst likely unintended, the imposition of such harm is less than satisfactory – both morally and operationally. Australian sanctions against Iran must therefore be considered as an extreme measure to be taken only if efforts in support of regional as well as Iranian nonproliferation come to fail, or if the imminence of Iranian nuclear weapons acquisition demands an immediate response by the Australian government over and above those taken by the nuclear watchdog and the UN Security Council. Australia’s recent statements respond to neither of these circumstances. Australia’s autonomous sanctions against Iran are in fact a swift “alignment” of Australian policy with that of the US, Britain and EU, as reasoned by senator Carr on 10 January. What would an independent Australian policy look like? The more appropriate way forward for any incoming Australian prime minister is clear: Australia must adopt an independent foreign policy towards Iran on the nuclear issue. Australia could certainly more “creatively” use its position on the UN Security Council, particularly as chair of the Iran Committee, to facilitate and foster a broader commitment to dialogical exchange with Iran than has otherwise been the case. Simultaneously, as I have proposed elsewhere with Joseph Camilleri, Australia should do more to promote regional efforts at biological, nuclear and chemical weapons disarmament, which are at their most critical and advanced stage after more than 40 years of pre-negotiations. Our modest set of proposals included a prime ministerial statement in support of such an initiative, as well as the formal presentation of a progress report “to parliament outlining steps already taken and further steps contemplated as preparations get underway for the 2015 NPT Review Conference”. In all it does, Australia should commit to dialogue with Iran as a process of mutual discovery, based on an exploration of all parties’ commonalities and differences. Such a dialogue will require a level of trust and commitment from all parties, particularly if Australia is to successfully foster the climate of mutual respect necessary for the dispute to be resolved peacefully. Whatever Australia’s leaders decide, both political parties must stop privileging sanctions at the same time as actively politicising Iranian asylum seekers. It beggars belief who they think that’s helping."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2013/jul/14/royal-mail-privatisation-business-investment","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2013-07-14T05:30:04Z","webTitle":"This privatisation of the Royal Mail would be a national disaster | Will Hutton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/14/royal-mail-privatisation-business-investment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/14/royal-mail-privatisation-business-investment","fields":{"headline":"This privatisation of the Royal Mail would be a national disaster","bodyText":"Britain is 159th in the world league table that ranks investment as a share of GDP. This is not new. Owners of British companies have long been permitted a feckless lack of responsibility. Smart countries, from the US to Germany, make sure that they insulate their companies as far as they can from the myopia and short-term greed of stock markets. Instead, the British approach to ownership exposes our companies to stock market thinking: shrivelling investment, cutting back on innovation, minimising training and hoarding cash to please their irresponsible, transactional owners. It is a national disaster that another great British organisation, the Royal Mail, is to be cast into this maelstrom. (As I explain later, a more imaginative \"protected\" private model could work.) The directors of the Royal Mail will be under the same relentless hammer as those in every other British plc. They will put up prices as much as the regulator will allow, cut into universal provision and relentlessly contract out as much of the delivery to the lowest paid, least protected workers; none of this will be enough to satisfy their owners. Eventually, the directors, vastly enriched with share options, incentive plans and 200% bonuses, will run up the white flag. Within a decade, the Royal Mail will be sold overseas, probably to another state-owned postal service, if not to a private equity fund based in a tax haven. Who knows? It could even be the Chinese communist party that ends up owning this great British institution. You don't need to be a great seer to predict this future. It is exactly what has happened with our privatised water and energy companies. Economists will say the mail service is more efficient, rather as they discussed the way financial deregulation promoted banking efficiency up to the financial crash of 2008 without ever anticipating the costs of the crash that overwhelmed those gains. By one yardstick, this \"efficiency\" is guaranteed: the Royal Mail's 150,000 workforce will shrink. But economists' definition of efficiency is pathetically narrow. It will take no account of the lost tax revenues when the Royal Mail is owned offshore, nor the cost of the state guarantees that will be necessary to support crucial investment. (See the demands from the privatised Thames Water and BT are seeking for their investment in, respectively, the super sewer and national broadband.) Neither will it measure the social impact of a diminished, expensive and fractured postal service, part of the glue that holds the country together, nor the need for state support if some unexpected event threatens. In short, any efficiency gains from privatisation have to be qualified by large costs, some of which only become obvious over decades. Thus, although all the big six energy companies are more efficient in the sense they produce more power, with fewer employees, than they did a generation ago, any calculus of gains and losses must include the price guarantees the government offers to secure the investment Britain needs in renewable energy and nuclear. Centrica, withdrawing from its partnership with EDF Energy over building nuclear power stations, acknowledged its shareholders wanted higher returns over a shorter period than any deal the government might offer. If energy provision in Britain were only to be delivered by British privately owned plcs pleasing their tourist stock market owners, they would all build gas-fired power stations, an energy mono-culture that would make the country reliant on one energy source. It would also be environmentally disastrous. The state cannot stand back. We know all this, but somehow there is a political and cultural incapacity to face the reality. State ownership is seen as cumbersome, socialist, bureaucratic and hidebound. Private ownership is seen as none of those things and little mention is made of the acute depredations wreaked in the private sector. Try getting Ukip to promise that it would oppose the Royal Mail being owned by a Cayman Islands private equity fund, an Arab sovereign wealth fund or some plutocrat. There is silence. Ownership does not matter. The Department for Business website talks loftily of ensuring that the Royal Mail has the necessary access to investment through privatisation, \"untying its hands\", as business minister Michael Fallon puts it. But this is the same Department for Business that was so concerned that privately owned plcs were short-termist and anti-investment that it commissioned John Kay to investigate. Even if his report shrank from any meaningful action, it at least dramatised the problem. The model of privately owned postal companies competing in a regulated market is not a priori wrong: it seems to work in Germany with the privatised Deutsche Post. It is just that British private ownership structures maximise every adverse possibility and outcome. We are about to experience a boom in parcel deliveries as online shopping explodes. Universal parcel delivery is going to become an indispensable utility. Any government that consigns this crucial service to British-style private ownership – for a mere £3bn with 10% of shares given free to workers as a blatant bribe – is as short-termist as the stock market. Instead, with ownership configured more imaginatively, the Royal Mail could become a de facto trust, a British postal and logistics group ready to exploit the coming boom. A creative government would transform it into a private trust with its own supervisory board on top of the management board, modelled along the lines of Deutsche Post that pro-privatisers like to cite but without ever doing any homework on the detail. For this model would be charged with ensuring managers protect and improve Britain's universal postal and parcel service, as well as seeking other commercial opportunities. The board would have public interest directors along with directors elected by the workers, enfranchised by the collective ownership of, say, a quarter of the shares in an employee ownership scheme. External investors could thus only buy into an organisation whose constitution, purpose and ownership were permanently shaped to deliver public good. No such template has been floated. It is an opportunity Labour should seize as the embodiment of responsible capitalism. If Ed Miliband and Chuka Umunna were suitably adept, they could even create a parliamentary majority, with dissident Lib Dems and Tories, for it. Apart from ideologues, no one thinks privatisation as it has been practised works and everyone knows that in a decade the Royal Mail will probably be foreign owned. On this, the Communications Workers union and the Labour party are right. But supporting the status quo is insufficient to win the argument. What they need is an alternative prospectus. There is nothing to lose and everything to gain."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2010/dec/28/india-areva-nuclear-power-bouissou","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-12-28T14:00:52Z","webTitle":"France signs deal with India to supply nuclear power stations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/dec/28/india-areva-nuclear-power-bouissou","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2010/dec/28/india-areva-nuclear-power-bouissou","fields":{"headline":"France signs deal with India to supply nuclear power stations","bodyText":"Two years after reaching agreement with India on the supply of six European pressurised reactors (EPRs), Areva has signed a series of contracts with the Nuclear Power Corporation of India (NPCIL) for the construction of two 1,650-MW reactors. \"India has little experience in the field of civilian nuclear power, which entails a large amount of technical preparation and lengthy negotiations,\" an Areva engineer said. The power stations should be in operation by 2020, at a cost of $9.2bn. Until 2008 there was an embargo on sales of civilian nuclear technology to India, but it is now the fourth country to purchase Areva EPRs, after France, Finland and China. India's environment minister, Jairam Ranesh, says that the project, on a 1,000-hectare site at Jaitapur, south of Mumbai, fulfils all the conditions to \"reconcile the objectives of economic growth, fuel-mix diversification, global diplomacy and environmental protection\". India uses coal to produce 70% of its energy, and is handicapped by a 10% shortfall in electricity output. Imports, which cover 80% of energy consumption, weigh heavily on its trade deficit.

In a speech on Tuesday at Georgetown University, delivered outdoors on a sweltering hot day, Obama went further than any previous US president in outlining a comprehensive strategy for dealing with climate change. He also said he would continue to press the issue as a priority of his second term even in the face of implacable opposition from Republicans in Congress. \"I refuse to condemn your generation and future generations to a planet that's beyond fixing,\" Obama said to a gathering of students. Obama outlined a broad range of measures to cut greenhouse gas emissions and promote the development of renewable energy, protect coastlines and cities from flooding and sea-level rise, and encourage efforts to reach a global climate deal. The over-arching goal was to put the US on track to meet its commitment to cut carbon emissions 17% from 2005 levels by the end of the decade. But Obama's boldest move by far was the decision to bypass a deadlocked Congress and issue an executive memo to the Environmental Protection Agency, calling for new rules curbing greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. Such measures were long overdue, Obama said. \"Power plants can still dump limitless carbon pollution into the air for free,\" he said. \"That's not right, that's not safe and it needs to stop.\" Curbing emissions from power plants would be the single-most significant action against climate change in Obama's power. Power plants are responsible for a third of America's greenhouse gas emissions. The decision won Obama widespread praise from fellow Democrats and environmental campaigners. Al Gore said the address was the \"best speech on climate by any president\". Barbara Boxer, the California Democrat who chairs the Senate environment and public works committee, said: \"The president is using all the tools in his tool box and I applaud him for that.\" As anticipated, however, the measure ran into fierce opposition from Republicans and industry, even before Obama had delivered his speech. But the president pushed back on the idea that he was overstepping by ordering the EPA to act. \"The idea of setting higher pollution standards for our power plants is not new. It's just time for Washington to catch up with the rest of the country,\" he said. Obama also said he was willing to work across the political divide but would not tolerate attempts to cast doubt on the science underlying climate change. \"We don't have time for a meeting of the flat earth society,\" Obama said to applause. The president took on another contentious issue – the Keystone tar sands pipeline, which campaigners have cast as the defining environmental issue of the day. Obama gave no indication of how he will decide on the project, which would open up Canada's vast store of carbon. However, he offered campaigners a measure of reassurance, saying climate implications would be critical to making a final determination. \"The net effects of pipeline impact on our climate will be absolutely critical in determining if the project is allowed to go forward,\" he said. Elsewhere, Obama broke with campaigners, and even many of his fellow Democrats, embracing America's natural gas boom, made possible through fracking, as a transition fuel. He also reiterated support for nuclear power. Many of those who praised Obama for regulating power plants, such as boxer, urged him to take the next step and put a price on carbon dioxide emissions. There was no mention of such a measure in his speech. But there was still overwhelmingly strong support among an environmental community that has often been frustrated and disappointed with the president on climate change. \"This is the change Americans have been waiting for on climate. President Obama is finally putting action behind his words,\" said Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club – although he went on to ask the president to stop the Keystone pipeline. Obama claimed climate change as one of his core issues in his inauguration address. He stoked expectations even further in his state of the union address in February, telling Congress to act on climate change – or he would. Since then, there have been mixed signals from the White House on climate change. The White House delayed a range of environmental rules, and Obama told supporters at a number of fundraisers that the politics of climate change were hard. With Tuesday's speech, however, Obama appears to have firmly adopted climate action as his own brand. Administration officials briefing reporters on the climate plan said the White House hoped to propose the rules for existing power plants by June 2014, finalising the rules one year later. They said proposed rules for new plants could be forthcoming as early as September. That timetable could set in place mechanisms to deliver meaningful cuts in greenhouse gas emissions by the time Obama leaves office. But there are bound to be legal and political challenges, and it was not immediately clear how stringent the new power plant rules would be. It was also unclear how the actions promised by Obama would play out in the long term. Most analysts believed at the time that America's original 17% emissions target was too low to avoid serious climate change. There was even greater uncertainty about whether America would be on track for the even more ambitious mid-century target of an 80% cut in emissions. That would depend on the stringency of the EPA measures, and how quickly the new rules could be adopted, The significance of Tuesday's strategy will only become apparent in time, said Van Jones, a co-founder of the activist group Rebuild the Dream and Obama's former White House green jobs advisor. \"Cracking down on carbon pollution is very good and it is long overdue, but it's going to take two years to produce the rules and then probably five years to litigate it so that is a big chunk of time,\" Jones said. \"That is a big chunk of carbon to go after there, but it is going to take a while before there is any effect. So celebrate, but be realistic.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2013/may/01/whatever-you-think-of-fracking","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2013-05-01T17:09:40Z","webTitle":"Whatever you think of fracking, this isn't the way forward | Michael Hanlon","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/may/01/whatever-you-think-of-fracking","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2013/may/01/whatever-you-think-of-fracking","fields":{"headline":"Whatever you think of fracking, this isn't the way forward","bodyText":"Serious countries, with serious governments, have equally serious energy policies to keep the lights on. This means developing long-term strategic plans, making sure that you create as mixed a basket of energy sources as possible. It means taking steps to ensure that if the supply of a particular energy source becomes scarce or prohibitively expensive, then there are alternatives that can be brought on stream quickly. That is the sort of thing a serious country does. What it does not do is come up with a hare-brained scheme to bribe locals into accepting an unproven new technology with \"community benefits\" that may involve new sports clubs and money off the electricity bill. This is not a spoof: it is actually being considered by the coalition, on the advice of the energy and climate change select committee, as a way of getting the people of Lancashire and elsewhere to drop their opposition to fracking, a controversial technology that extracts natural gas by blasting it out of ancient, deeply buried shale strata. A country that led the way with civil coal and nuclear power, and whose efficient national grid was a symbol of the postwar drive to modernise, is now basing energy policy on bribing villagers with badminton courts. This is not an argument against fracking per se. The theoretical potential is there, under the carboniferous rocks of the English north-west and the Scottish central belt, for an energy revolution on the scale of North Sea oil. A recent British Geological Survey report put the amount of shale gas under the UK as 250 times that of previous estimates, enough to make us self-sufficient in gas for centuries. That deserves a big tick. And a big tick for the stuff on green grounds as well. Yes, fracking has triggered minor earthquakes, but so did coal mining, and nobody used that as an excuse to close the pits. Tales of flaming bath taps or groundwater contamination are for the most part hysteria. Yes, gas is a fossil fuel, and burning it generates carbon dioxide: but far less than burning coal. If we could replace all our coal-fired electricity with cheap, locally sourced, shale-gas-fired power tomorrow, our carbon emissions would plummet along with our electricity bills. If this all sounds too good to be true, it's because it quite possibly is. Fracking's fans, led by Lord Browne of drilling firm Cuadrilla (an unfortunate B-movie monster name) point to the US, where a fracking revolution has sent gas prices tumbling. But Lancashire is not the wide-open spaces of the American midwest: our population density is at least 10 times greater. Land ownership and mineral rights issues in the UK are far more complex than in America, as are planning rules. But this is not an argument against fracking. If George Osborne thinks it is the solution to our looming energy crisis he needs to lead the way and move fracking from the theoretical to the real. Sell it to us. Take action. Prove the doubters wrong. But no silly talk about building community halls and bribing villagers. The energy crisis is anything but silly. Britain needs to be generating about 80 gigawatts of electricity to guarantee keeping the lights on, and the fact is that we are about to start losing huge chunks of generating capacity. Three nuclear reactors closed last year. Next year we lose another one, in Anglesey; and by 2019 Dungeness B, Hartlepool and Heysham 1 will go. By 2023 – less than a decade away – we will be down to just one nuclear station, and we will have lost a swath of our coal-fired capacity. If nothing else is done, the lights will start going out as the energy gap widens to about 20GW. Wind and efficiencies may plug some of the gap, but not all of it. The point is that we have known this was about to happen since the 1990s, and successive governments have done nothing about it. It is now looking probable that the first new nuclear station planned for a generation, at Hinkley Point in Somerset, may not be built at all; talks between EDF – the energy firm owned by the French state – and our government over an agreed minimum price for generated power are grinding to a halt. For 30 years our \"energy policy\" has consisted of selling off vast chunks of our generating capacity to foreign, often state-owned, firms. The ironic result of the Thatcher energy privatisation was a massive transfer of strategic assets from the British citizen to the Elysée, the break-up of the Central Electricity Generating Board, and an ill-advised dash for gas that risks leaving consumers at the mercy of Russia and Kazakhstan. And now we want to build sports halls and bet the farm on a technology that to date has not boiled a single British kettle. Not serious at all."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2013/feb/09/snowstorm-knocks-out-power-northeast","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2013-02-09T15:30:00Z","webTitle":"Snowstorm knocks out power for thousands across north-east US","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/09/snowstorm-knocks-out-power-northeast","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/feb/09/snowstorm-knocks-out-power-northeast","fields":{"headline":"Snowstorm knocks out power for thousands across north-east US","bodyText":"A huge winter storm has lashed America's north-east, bringing major snow fall, icy conditions and high winds to a vast swathe of the most populous region of the United States. The powerful weather system created chaos on the region's roads with several states banning motorists from travel and saw more than 650,000 people left without power. Thousands of flights were also cancelled, and governors of six states – New York, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Hampshire and Maine – declared emergencies. The storm packed hurricane force winds at times as it pummelled its way through the area, striking most fiercely in Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island. However, it largely spared New York from any major impact, as the worst of the system passed by just to the north of the city. The storm is believed to have caused at least seven deaths so far, with three people being killed in Canada and four in the US. In southern Ontario, an 80-year-old woman collapsed while shovelling snow from her driveway, and two men died in car crashes. In New York, a 74-year-old pedestrian died after he was struck by a car in Poughkeepsie when the driver lost control in the snowy conditions. Meanwhile in Boston, authorities say an 11-year-old boy died of carbon monoxide poisoning as he sat in a car with the engine running to keep warm. He had been helping his father shovel snow but got into the vehicle to avoid the cold weather. A Boston fire department spokesman said the car's exhaust was covered by a snow bank, causing the fumes to collect inside. The heaviest snow appeared to strike Connecticut where 28in (71cm) had fallen on central parts of the state by early Saturday morning. At its height snow was falling there at a rate of up to five inches an hour. Elsewhere areas of south-eastern Massachusetts, Rhode Island and New Hampshire notched 2ft (60cm) or more of snow – with more still falling on Saturday. High winds built up huge drifts, and major cities like Boston, Hartford and Providence ground to a halt. Falling tree branches and gusts brought down power lines and in Massachusetts alone some 400,000 people were without power. The snow also knocked out electricity to the Pilgrim Nuclear Power Plant in Plymouth which shut down Friday night. Authorities say there is no threat to public safety and backup generators immediately kicked in. Airlines cancelled more than 5,300 flights through Saturday, and Boston's Logan Airport closed completely. As the storm passed by Saturday morning New York's three main airports had re-opened, though with a schedule devastated by changes. Blizzard conditions also brought wreckage to the roads. There was a 19-car pileup in Cumberland, Maine, that caused minor injuries to some of the passengers. Meanwhile on the Long Island Expressway in New York hundreds of cars got stuck on Friday evening, forcing police to work to free them. But in New York City, parts of which got 11in (28cm) of snow, the storm had little major impact. Underground public transport was working smoothly, and many citizens heeded mayor Michael Bloomberg's warnings to stay indoors. By Saturday morning much Manhattan was back to normal, while other boroughs were still digging out. After striking the region the storm was headed mostly out to sea, rather than barrelling inland. That course of direction was seen as sparing much of the region further damage unlike in previous recent big weather systems – such as superstorm Sandy – which had marched inland."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2012/nov/16/iran-uranium-enrichment-red-line","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2012-11-16T19:15:28Z","webTitle":"Iran steps up pace and capacity of uranium enrichment, says IAEA report","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/16/iran-uranium-enrichment-red-line","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/nov/16/iran-uranium-enrichment-red-line","fields":{"headline":"Iran steps up pace and capacity of uranium enrichment, says IAEA report","bodyText":"Iran has expanded its enrichment capacity and is enriching uranium at a pace that would bring it to what Israel has declared an unacceptable red line in just over seven months, according to a report by the UN nuclear watchdog. The International Atomic Energy Agency also found that Iranian technicians had removed the fuel rods from the country's only functioning nuclear power station at Bushehr, suggesting the new reactor has serious problems. Iran did not tell IAEA inspectors what those problems were. The IAEA quarterly report on Iran's nuclear programme was released just days before the expected launch of a new diplomatic initiative to resolve the international impasse over the issue. It also comes soon after Israeli official stated that the red line drawn by Israel's prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, during his UN appearance in September, represented 240kg of 20%-enriched uranium, enough to make a warhead if further enriched to weapons grade. The sensitivity of 20% uranium figure is that it can be turned into weapons grade relatively fast and easily. The last time the IAEA inspectors drew up a report, three months ago, Iran had made 189kg of 20% uranium but had used nearly 100kg for civilian purposes, leaving an outstanding 96kg. In the last three months, that stockpile has grown by 43kg and Iran has not diverted any more of it to civil uses. At the current steady rate of production, that would bring Iran to the Israeli red line by mid-June. But it also installed new centrifuges at its underground enrichment plant in Fordow, with which it could double its rate of production if it chose to do so. However, it could also decide to divert more uranium to civilian uses, or – as western diplomats hope – strike a deal, exchanging 20% uranium for sanctions relief, and thus defuse the crisis. Diplomats from six major powers are due to meet next week to discuss a common negotiating strategy as an expected prelude to restarting high-level talks with Iran at about the end of this month."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2011/mar/24/renewables-nuclear-fukushima-japan-environment","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-24T07:59:01Z","webTitle":"Response: George Monbiot is wrong.

Nuclear power is not the way to fight climate change","bodyText":"George Monbiot argues of nuclear energy that the absence of less harmful alternatives has \"converted me to the cause\" (Why Fukushima made me stop worrying and love nuclear power, 21 March). He says he is driven to his new love by the imperative of battling climate change, and what he sees as the inability of renewable energy to run viable economies. On the climate imperative, I agree. On the other assertions, I profoundly differ. I speak as someone who founded a renewable energy company because of my fears about climate change and the downsides of dependency on conventional energy. Since I did so, I have watched renewables industries become some of the fastest growing in the world. In 2008 and 2009 more renewables came onstream in both Europe and America than did all fossil fuels and nuclear combined. In Europe in 2009, wind and solar PV alone provided more than half all new generation. \"Energy is like medicine,\" Monbiot writes, \"if there are no side-effects, the chances are that it doesn't work.\" Were he to visit the renewables frontlines, he would discover many views to the contrary. German government and companies have run a scaled national experiment showing that the modern economy could be powered by renewables. A sophisticated American modelling exercise has shown the same for the global economy. All it requires is systematic mobilisation, and the imagination to believe what Silicon Valley believes. Ultimately we should be able to provide power far less expensively than new nuclear. As we grow, our costs fall. We do not need to hand open cheques for currently unknowable billions to the taxpayer for things like waste transportation, waste disposal, decommissioning, security at sites, or accident clear-up. But like Spitfires and Lancasters in 1939, we need to be mobilised fast, along with our even more important sister industries in energy-efficiency. And herein lies the main reason why Monbiot contradicts his own objective to counter climate change. The nuclear industry does not want renewable energy to succeed. Indeed, they lobby to kill our chances. The chief executives of EDF and E.ON are both on record as saying that renewables would spoil the chances for nuclear, and only a minor renewables contribution can be tolerated if ministers want a \"nuclear renaissance\". \"I still loathe the liars who run the nuclear industry,\" Monbiot writes. But he now confesses that Fukushima has made him love their technology. He falls in love with the false calculation that it is needed, that it can work economically, and that it can solve its horrific waste, decommissioning and proliferation-security pitfalls. And then there are the safety, health and indeed human psychology issues. \"The impact on people [of the current disaster] has been small,\" Monbiot asserts. My, how I would love him to have to face a roomful of Fukushima citizens with that argument. Or put on a suit and pick up a hosepipe at the plant itself."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"money/2013/apr/27/triodos-green-ethical-funds","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2013-04-27T06:01:19Z","webTitle":"Triodos gives green light to two new ethical funds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/apr/27/triodos-green-ethical-funds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2013/apr/27/triodos-green-ethical-funds","fields":{"headline":"Triodos gives green light to two new ethical funds","bodyText":"Ethical bank Triodos is branching out into green investment with the launch of two funds. People can choose between supporting companies doing innovative work in the field of sustainability – combating climate change, encouraging healthy living and so on – or household-name brands delivering \"superior social and environmental performance\". Both funds can be held within a stocks and shares Isa, and mean more choice for those looking to invest their cash in a socially responsible way. However, Triodos looks set to spark a debate over just how \"ethical\" some of these companies are after it emerged that one of the funds invests in several major names that have been sharply criticised for alleged tax avoidance, including Google and Starbucks. Netherlands-based Triodos Bank has been operating in the UK for 18 years and describes itself as \"a world leader in ethical and sustainable banking\". However, this is the first time it has offered stock market-linked investments to UK small investors. Of Triodos's two new funds, Sustainable Pioneer is the greenest – it is a global fund investing in smaller and medium-sized companies involved in sectors such as sustainable energy and medical technology. Only those companies deriving more than 50% of their revenue from climate protection, healthy people or clean earth themes are eligible. Firms that are way ahead of the pack on corporate social responsibility will also make it in. Companies in its portfolio include beauty products firm L'Occitane, US-based natural and organic food company Annie's and Smith &amp; Nephew – Europe's leading maker of artificial hips and knees. Triodos Sustainable Equity is arguably a more \"mainstream\" fund, investing in companies \"that combine a strong financial position with solid social and environmental performance\". It includes plenty of the sorts of companies you might expect – natural and organic food retailer Whole Foods Market, Japan-based bicycle parts manufacturer Shimano, Canadian National Railway and several solar firms – but also some that might raise eyebrows, such as sportswear brands Adidas and Nike, car manufacturers BMW and Volkswagen, drinks giant Diageo, and a couple of banks, including Dutch group ING and National Bank of Canada. The fund's biggest holding is Google, whose chairman Eric Schmidt was this week defending the search engine's tax avoidance policies after it paid just £6m in corporation tax in the UK in 2011. The second and ninth largest holdings are telecoms giant Vodafone and coffee chain Starbucks, two of the most high-profile companies caught up in the tax avoidance accusations. But Triodos says both funds operate strict minimum standards on a variety of issues, with zero tolerance on arms, nuclear power, hazardous materials and \"unconventional\" oil and gas. The funds have been available in Europe for several years and, performance-wise, the Sustainable Equity fund has done well of late, delivering a return of 14.3% over the past year. It has outperformed its benchmark over one and three years. Sustainable Pioneer delivered a return of 9.2% over the past year, but has underperformed over one, three and five years (these figures relate to a euro share class that won't be available to UK small investors). Until 28 June, Triodos is offering a 1% discount on the funds' initial fee, taking it down to 3%, after which it will revert to 4%. The annual management charge is estimated as 1.25% for Sustainable Pioneer and 1% for Sustainable Equity, and the minimum investment is £1,000 per fund (there is no monthly savings option). However, some may be disappointed to learn that Triodos has decided to launch its funds on a \"direct only\" basis which means that, for the time being at least, they won't be available via online fund supermarkets and platforms operated by companies such as Hargreaves Lansdown, where you can buy and manage funds at low cost. You can go on to the bank's website and request an application pack. The good news, though, is that you can invest tax-free in a Triodos ethical stocks and shares Isa. If you haven't used your Isa allowance for this year, you can invest up to £11,520 in 2013/14. There are dozens of ethical funds to choose from. If you are thinking of taking the plunge you need to decide on your personal priorities. Secondly, do you want to pay a financial adviser to help, or do you feel confident enough to do it yourself? The Ethical Investment Association website (ethicalinvestment.org.uk) allows you to find specialist advisers in your region. Traditional ethical funds typically use a combination of negative screens (to eliminate arms manufacturers etc) and positive screens to favour businesses with a good record on corporate social responsibility or that are involved in environmentally friendly or low-carbon industries. But, as the ongoing tax avoidance debate has shown, some would say it is not always possible to put a company into a simple \"good\" or \"bad\" box."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2013/jun/05/bury-co2-problem-capture-store-carbon","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2013-06-05T21:05:01Z","webTitle":"Climate change: let's bury the CO2 problem | Myles Allen","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/05/bury-co2-problem-capture-store-carbon","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/05/bury-co2-problem-capture-store-carbon","fields":{"headline":"Climate change: let's bury the CO2 problem","bodyText":"How often have you read that we have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to solve the problem of climate change – shortly followed by frustration and disappointment? People might expect me, as a climate scientist, to be disappointed by the failure of the attempt by the MP Tim Yeo to set an ambitious decarbonisation target in Tuesday's debate on the energy bill. But I'm not. Not because I don't think it is possible, or even desirable: get climate policy right, and I believe we will have largely decarbonised the UK power sector by 2030. And the UK, having led the world into this era of venting fossil carbon into the atmosphere, clearly has a duty to lead the world out of it. But ambitious targets backed by micromanagement of energy supply and demand are leading nowhere. What other country is going to attend a seminar on the UK energy bill and think, \"Great idea, let's do that\"? They won't even be able to read the powerpoint slides. The time is right to move forward on climate policy. This may seem a strange claim to environmentalists: the pace of warming is reported to have slowed, and projections are being revised downwards. At the same time, evidence continues to emerge that the world will only stop warming when we stop dumping carbon dioxide in the atmosphere altogether. The conditions for an effective global deal could hardly look worse. But the very fact that so many have come to believe, rightly or wrongly, that the climate response is at the low end of the range of uncertainty provides us with an opportunity. Rather than targets for arbitrary years, we should aim for a policy explicitly linked to rising temperatures. If George Osborne really believes global warming has stopped, he would have no reason to object. Ideas like this have been floated before, but too often they amount to kicking the can down the road. There is no point in \"wait and see\" if – after another decade or two of research into solar and nuclear power, or a modest carbon tax – we find ourselves in exactly the same position as now: fossil fuels dominating global energy supplies and far cheaper than any alternative, only with another couple of hundred billion tonnes of fossil carbon dumped, irreversibly, into the atmosphere. The problem requires a different approach. We started out before the industrial revolution with roughly 4 trillion tonnes of fossil carbon underground. We have dumped about half a trillion tonnes into the atmosphere, and have up to a trillion more tonnes to go before we commit ourselves either to warming substantially greater than two degrees or some form of geoengineering. Given the extraordinary profits that can be made from the extraction and use of fossil fuels, no conceivable carbon tax or cap-and-trade regime is going to prevent a substantial fraction of those 2½ trillion \"excess\" tonnes from being burned somewhere, someday. Nor should it: what right have we today to prevent the citizens of India of the 2080s from touching their coal? So the only thing that really matters for long-term climate is that we deploy the technology – carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) – to bury carbon dioxide at the same rate we dig up fossil carbon before we release too much. Shell, in its latest scenarios, predicts that conventional measures will have only a modest impact on global emissions until about 2040, at which point rising concern about climate change will trigger a crash CCS programme, mopping up over 50% of extracted carbon in only a couple of decades. For the taxpayers and consumers of the 2040s – bearing the full cost, and risks, of such rapid deployment – this is the worst possible outcome. It is revealing that Shell's scenario-builders envisage large-scale deployment of CCS only when it is made mandatory. Two of just a handful of demonstration CCS projects in Europe were recently cancelled, in part because of the collapse of the carbon price. But once you realise that CCS will be needed in the end, it would be far safer, simpler and fairer to mandate gradual deployment, so we can spread the cost over a couple of generations and provide time to evaluate and monitor the storage options. Anyone who extracts or imports fossil fuels should be required to sequester a steadily increasing fraction of their carbon. The maths could not be simpler: we need to increase the fraction of carbon we sequester by, on average, 1% for every 10bn tonnes of carbon dumped in the atmosphere. This is one regulation, affecting a handful of major companies. The policy can adapt to rising temperatures by adjusting the rate. So start at 1% per 10 billion tonnes and plan to adjust the rate when, say, temperatures reach 1.5 degrees above preindustrial. Crucially, this is not asking the impossible of future politicians. If the evolving evidence suggests we need to treble the rate of CCS deployment sometime around 2030, that would be feasible. Adjusting regulations on a single industry is something politicians find easy: as we found with the fuel tax escalator in the UK or the European emission trading scheme, when times get tough, supporting an energy tax or carbon price is not. Mandatory sequestration is transparent, fair, easy to monitor, and above all clearly addresses the problem. If we introduce it, it would be simple to request that our European and broader trading partners to do the same. Having solved the long-term climate problem, we might well need a complex energy bill to ensure security of supply in the 2030s, particularly given the uncertain cost of all that mandatory sequestration. That might well involve subsidies to renewables to ensure we don't become over-dependent on Russian gas. But it would be what it says on the tin: an energy bill. Climate change would have nothing to do with it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/may/07/japan-fukushima-nuclear-power-earthquakes","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2012-05-07T21:16:00Z","webTitle":"The Fukushima nuclear plant's slow recovery offers lessons to the US","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/may/07/japan-fukushima-nuclear-power-earthquakes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/may/07/japan-fukushima-nuclear-power-earthquakes","fields":{"headline":"The Fukushima nuclear plant's slow recovery offers lessons to the US","bodyText":"In December, Japan's prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, declared that \"a cold shutdown\" had been achieved and that the crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant was now over. \"Today, we have reached a great milestone\", Noda told the Japanese people in a televised address. \"The reactors are stable, which should resolve one big cause of concern for us all.\" But Mr Noda's optimistic assessment appears to have been premature. Nuclear engineer and former power company executive Arnie Gunderson compared the prime minister's statement to President George Bush declaring \"mission accomplished\" on the deck of the USS Lincoln in 2003. Gunderson calls the situation at Fukushima \"a long battle, far from over.\" Even Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco), which owns the Fukushima facility, says that it will take another 40 years to fully decommission the reactors there, a project which poses unprecedented engineering challenges. But the company's own tests disclose a more immediate danger. Rising radiation levels within one of the reactors, the highest recorded so far, and evidence of a leak in the critical cooling system demonstrate that the situation is still far from stable. Tepco revealed at the end of March that protective water levels in the containment vessel of Reactor No 2, were far shallower than they had expected, which might mean that the uranium fuel rods there are no longer completely submerged, and are heating up. The Japan Times reported on 29 March that radiation inside the vessel has reached 73 sieverts per hour – high enough to administer a lethal dose to a human in a matter of minutes, even to disable the robotic devices which are sent regularly into the reactor to monitor what is happening there. Conditions elsewhere in the plant are more difficult to assess. Reactors 1 and 3, both of which melted down after the earthquake and tsunami last year, are currently sealed and impossible to enter, even by robots. So we don't know what is going on inside those crippled structures. But nuclear experts say that their biggest concern involves Reactor 4, which sustained severe structural damage during the earthquake and subsequent hydrogen explosions which collapsed its roof. This is where hundreds of tons of spent fuel sits perched 100 feet above the ground in a cooling pool exposed to the open sky. A report released in February by the Independent Investigation Commission on the nuclear accident called this pool \"the weakest link\" at Fukushima. Robert Alvarez, former senior policy adviser at the US department of energy said: \"If an earthquake or other event were to cause this pool to drain it could result in a catastrophic radiological fire involving nearly 10 times the amount of Cs-137 released by the Chernobyl accident.\" How likely is this? While the structure of Reactor 4 is stable for the moment, the Dai-ichi plant lies miles from a big earthquake fault – as large as the one that caused last year's quake, but much closer to Fukushima. According to a study published in February (pdf) in the European Geosciences Union's journal Solid Earth, that fault is now overdue for a quake. Whether or not the critical pool at Reactor 4 would survive another major quake intact, Edwin Lyman, a physicist with the Union of Concerned Scientists, told me in a phone interview that a failure of the jury-rigged inadequate piping installed after the disaster could knock the cooling system out of commission. After visiting Fukushima on a fact finding mission recently, Senator Ron Wyden wrote to Japan's ambassador to the US warning that, \"loss of containment in any of these pools could result in an even greater release than the initial accident. \"Wyden urged Japanese authorities to remove the spent fuel rods from the vulnerable pools to far safer \"dry cask storage\", which would protect them from potential earthquake release. Yet, the technological challenges of such a transfer of highly dangerous materials are formidable. These risks have led two former Japanese diplomats on a crusade to avert what they see as a disaster waiting to happen. UN veteran Akio Matsumura and former Japanese ambassador to Switzerland Mitsuhei Murata attended a conference in Seoul at the end of March \"to inform the participants from 54 nations of the potential global catastrophe of reactor unit 4.\" They called on the international community to set up an independent assessment team of structural engineers and nuclear scientists to study conditions at Reactor 4 and recommend a course of action. What lessons can the nuclear industry in the US draw from the Fukushima accident and its still unresolved aftermath? Edwin Lyman describes it as a wake-up call that we have not yet heeded. He told me in a phone interview that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has failed to fully implement the recommendations of its own post-Fukushima task force. Lyman says that several nuclear plants in the midwest, south and west are located near earthquake faults, including two plants in California – Diablo Canyon in San Luis Obispo county, and San Onofre between Los Angeles and San Diego. Both of the California facilities suffered what the NRC terms \"near misses\" within the last year. At Diablo Canyon, the plant's engineers inadvertently locked a series of emergency valves in the reactor cooling system, an error which was not noticed for 18 months and could have led to a meltdown in the case of an emergency. The problem at San Onofre involved a leak of radioactive steam from a worn generator tube in January. The plant has been shut down indefinitely and is currently undergoing extensive testing. While a Fukushima-type disaster could happen here in the US, Edwin Lyman insists that it doesn't need to. But he says that we have to act now to require new safeguards, demand higher performance standards and expand the roster of accidents that nuclear power plants will need to protect against. Let's hope the NRC is listening."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/oct/07/rwe-uk-nuclear-power","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-10-07T16:17:53Z","webTitle":"RWE reviews involvement in UK nuclear programme","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/oct/07/rwe-uk-nuclear-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/oct/07/rwe-uk-nuclear-power","fields":{"headline":"RWE reviews involvement in UK nuclear programme","bodyText":"The government's energy policy took another blow on Friday as major energy provider RWE reviewed whether to scale down or abandon its UK nuclear programme. The German-owned utility, which owns the npower supply business, has started an internal probe of its plans to construct two possible atomic power stations at Wylfa in Wales and Oldbury in Gloucestershire. The move follows a decision by SSE to pull out of a nuclear newbuild project in Cumbria, and the Guardian's revelation on Thursday that Scottish Power is preparing to shelve the UK's only pilot scheme for carbon capture and storage (CCS). At the Conservative party conference this week, George Osborne questioned the \"affordability\" of the low-carbon agenda at a time of financial hardship, although there are binding commitments to meet European Union CO2 reduction targets. The government has battled to encourage companies to construct a new generation of nuclear power stations with promises of a floor price on carbon. But it is facing a range of difficulties, not least caused by Germany, Japan and other countries abandoning atomic power after the Fukushima disaster. RWE faces huge financial losses as a result of the Berlin decision to close existing nuclear plants early and is already talking of the need for asset disposals and job losses as well as a possible equity tie-up with Russian gas giant, Gazprom. RWE insisted: \"We do not comment on speculation.\" But it has previously denied reports from Germany that its plans could be changed with regard to British nuclear plants. However, well-placed sources told the Guardian that the company was looking at all possible aspects of the Horizon Nuclear Power joint venture it operates with E.ON, that would build at Wylfa and Oldbury. \"There is a strategic review going on and there are a lot of discussions about all aspects of it including whether new partners could be brought in,\" said one of the sources. \"It's not surprising [RWE] scrutiny has intensified given what has happened in Germany and the way the British nuclear projects have been left out on a limb.\" Industry experts point out that any tie-up with Gazprom would only make any British nuclear involvement even more difficult as there would likely be political objections to Russia being involved in UK nuclear power. Meanwhile, news that Scottish Power was close to pulling out of the Longannet CCS project in Fife has alarmed Scotland's first minister. \"It's hugely concerning,\" said Alex Salmond. \"I can tell you I spoke to [energy secretary] Chris Huhne about it yesterday. I'm not going to tell you what was in the phone call, but there are a number of things [at issue]. There's the uncertainty about electricity market reform (EMR) is creating, there's the lack of clarity of decisions in terms of EMR which is having substantial consequences across a range of technologies,\" he added. \"My appeal [is] to the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) and to the Treasury, and incidentally, I'm not certain this is just Decc at work here. I think Decc is reasonably enthusiastic. I detect the dead hand of the Treasury behind it … [my concern] is that this is a project of European significance which is vital for the energy configuration not just of Scotland but for lots of places. Of course, the lessons learned at Longannet would be applicable on a continental basis. If it doesn't go ahead none of these lessons will be learned.\" Longannet was spearheading a CCS drive that was meant to be rolled out across Europe but has also been under consideration worldwide. Oil companies such as BP were originally at the forefront with a plan to build a scheme at Peterhead in Scotland, but this was abandoned and it has since given up on another pilot scheme in the US. Supporters have claimed that CCS involves a relatively simple adaptation of existing techniques but an in-depth study for Longannet undertaken by Scottish Power and its partners Shell and the National Grid have revealed that there are many complex issues to be overcome, not least the tremendous cost. The government has promised £1bn for the 300MW scheme in Fife but the review suggests far more would be required to convince the developers to go ahead with it. Fresh blow to low-carbon economy hopes The possibility that RWE could back out of the British nuclear newbuild programme is just the latest in a series of blows to hopes of a lower carbon economy - inflicted by industry and government. Last week another utility, SSE, said it was abandoning a consortium considering atomic power stations near Sellafield in Cumbria while Scottish Power is on the verge of dropping out of the only real carbon capture and storage project. But ministers have undermined the low-carbon drive themselves by postponing the introduction of a Renewable Heating Incentive subsidy scheme and scaling back the feed-in tariff for solar power. George Osborne promised at the Conservative party conference to move \"no faster\" on green issues that anyone else in Europe on the grounds it could make the UK commercially uncompetitive. Environmentalists were also appalled at other ministers promoting what they saw as populist and anti-green initiatives such as increasing the speed limit on motorways and increasing the frequency of refuse collections in a move which could undermine recycling. A wave of hardline industrialists and backbench politicians have recently raised questions about whether Britain can really afford to subsidise expensive offshore windfarms and proposed a return to a \"dash for gas.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2013/aug/03/inverkip-chimney-gone-im-glad","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2013-08-03T07:00:15Z","webTitle":"The Inverkip chimney is gone, and I'm glad.

Does that make me a philistine?","bodyText":"Only when it was about to be demolished did the Inverkip power station chimney begin to generate any kind of interest beyond those who woke up and saw it every day. News reports began to describe it as Scotland's \"tallest freestanding building\", meaning that only one or two broadcasting masts kept erect by steel wires were taller. It stood 236 metres (774ft) high, a few feet more than the tower at Canary Wharf and about 250ft lower than the Shard. About 1.4m bricks and 20,000 tonnes of concrete went into its construction in the early 1970s when it rose – uselessly, or some might say majestically – on a wooded shore in the Firth of Clyde. To write about it in the past tense is a joy. I never liked it. It stood four or five miles across the firth from the house where we've spent the past nine summers – a presence on the horizon even in the dark, when it would advertise itself with red warning lights. Rumours that it was to come down came up regularly; the chimney had no purpose, and the turbines it served last generated power in the mid-1980s. Some said an Indian company had bought the site – nobody knew why – others that it would become a housing estate. Eventually, the turbine halls were demolished and earlier this year a date and time were announced for the stack: last Sunday at 10pm, which was hardly a time that guaranteed perfect visibility even on Scotland's long July nights, but better than the cover of 4am darkness beneath which a group of tower blocks over the hill in Greenock recently disappeared (as if everything about them – conception, life, death – was shameful and best forgotten). Last Sunday, we walked the hundred yards from our house to the sea to find cars parked along both sides of the coast road and a large crowd waiting in the dusk. It seemed unlikely that this stretch of coast had seen such numbers since the Edwardian era, when it had its own steamer pier, several hotels and boarding houses, and boating stations where elderly fellows smoked clay pipes and hired out rowing boats. All gone – as the chimney was soon to be. At 10pm sharp, the top third of it shivered and leant sideways, and suddenly all of it had vanished. Dust clouds rolled out to sea and then, sound being a slowcoach, the thunder of falling rubble reached us. The crowd turned away, disappointed that it was over so quickly but happy, to judge from the laughter in their conversation, to see the chimney gone. Were we philistines? The chimney had its far-away supporters, and to say that none of them was unlucky enough to live near it is a cheap way to contest their argument. According to several architects and writers, Inverkip power station was one of Scotland's few great modernist buildings, composed by its designer, Sir Robert Matthew, as a tribute to Sir Giles Gilbert Scott's Bankside power station (now the Tate Modern). To them, the chimney is a noble column rising from the sea. The deputy editor of the Architects Journal, Rory Olcayto, described Inverkip last month as \"a doomed masterpiece\". In a piece for the Twentieth Century Society's magazine four years ago, the architect David Reat hoped that it could avoid demolition by finding a different use, such as the \"Bregenzer Festspiele, resplendent with its Seebühne backdropped by Zumthor's glass box and sound of creaking masts in the marina nearby.\" A romantic vision, he conceded, if only to those who knew what he was talking about. Against this aesthetic, I examined my own hatred for the chimney. It went against a common enough instinct, perhaps particularly British, which likes to see handsome or sometimes merely interesting industrial objects preserved. Steamships, locomotives, winding engines, weaving sheds, dockyard cranes: as these are all causes I'm happy to support, why make an exception for Scotland's tallest freestanding structure, designed by an architect distinguished for the \"strict, no-nonsense, platonic purity\" of his work? In fact, his power station had been a failure, an oilburning folly. Begun in 1970, when oil was cheap, it came on stream six years later, when the Yom Kippur war and Opec's new-found bargaining power had quadrupled the price. Consequently, Inverkip never worked at full capacity other than during the miners' strike, and it ceased generation completely in 1988. But none of this could be blamed on the architect, and it wasn't his chimney's uselessness that gave offence. Nor was it a case of nimbyism on my part, because I resented it long before I ever thought of this landscape as my back yard. No, I wanted the chimney to be obliterated because I remembered how the landscape looked before it was built; because the power station's placement represented a political willfulness that over the past 50 years has come close to destroying one of the world's most beautiful estuaries. In 1955, when I picnicked on an Inverkip beach and learned to catch a tennis ball, the Clyde still obeyed its old division. Its east-west stretch, from Glasgow downstream to Greenock, held the factories, the workshops and the shipyards: industrial, everyday life. But when the river broadened out into the firth and turned abruptly south, industry was replaced with sea lochs and mountains, islands and holiday resorts. The way of living the holidaymaker left behind might not be all that far away, but the bend in the river made its smoke and chimneys invisible. Then the difference between the two axes, the east-west of work and the north-south of pleasure, wore away. The first big change came in 1961 when the US Navy established its submarine base in the Holy Loch, followed by a similar base for the Royal Navy in the Gareloch – hugely expanded for the Trident fleet in the 1980s, when hillsides were dug out and moorlands crossed by roads; the Scottish opposition to Trident stems as much from this massive rural despoliation, little-known in the south, as nuclear weapons per se. But by no means all the developments were military. On the southern shore, a nuclear power station and then an iron-ore terminal opened in Hunterston, while large holes were quarried on the Cowal coast as building yards for North Sea oilrigs. Some of these enterprises were as calamitous as Inverkip's power station. None, however, had such a transforming effect on the landscape as Inverkip's chimney, which sent a signal to all of us who saw it from our bedroom windows or from the deck of a ferry that we were not, after all, in some southern branch of the Hebrides, but trapped for ever in the grip of the urban Lowlands, made flesh with a 236 metre monument and no longer invisible beyond the river's bend. Its disappearance could mark a new beginning. The US base in the Holy Loch went 20 years ago; Hunterston's nuclear plant won't last beyond 2023; how long Trident will be there is anybody's guess. There have been, and will be, economic consequences, but on Sunday the heart still lifted as the bricks crashed down and some of the Clyde's ruined beauty was restored."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2012/nov/14/christmas-tv-adverts-awful-john-lewis","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2012-11-14T09:22:08Z","webTitle":"Christmas TV adverts – why are they so awful? | Hadley Freeman","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/nov/14/christmas-tv-adverts-awful-john-lewis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2012/nov/14/christmas-tv-adverts-awful-john-lewis","fields":{"headline":"Christmas TV adverts – why are they so awful?","bodyText":"A Christmas story: many years ago, when my age was still in the single digits, I was watching TV at a friend's house. A Christmas-themed advert came on for a toy that was typical of the offerings foisted upon children in 1980s New York – Barbie's plastic surgeon's office, maybe, or a Cabbage Patch Doll nuclear power station, or perhaps a Monopoly set that came with fake piles of cocaine. My friend turned to me proudly: \"I've already put that on my Christmas list.\" For what would not be the first time in my childhood, I mused that, sometimes, being Jewish sucks. I am happy to say I no longer feel that way (l'chaim!), partly because I am now old enough to buy my own Cabbage Patch Doll nuclear power station (take that, Santa), mainly because I am no longer forced to attend Hebrew school. But there is another reason: just as a Christmas advert awakened me to the benefits of life as an unchosen person, Christmas adverts today make me think that perhaps, really, I dodged a goyish bullet. Like John Lithgow in 3rd Rock from the Sun, desperately studying the people of Ohio in order to understand the human race, I have spent some time watching this year's Christmas adverts to get to grips with Christmas and, I'm not going to lie, I'm a little confused. The first thing I'm confused about is when Christmas adverts became a big deal in this country. I do not remember this from, say, just five years ago, but now the John Lewis Christmas advert has become Britain's equivalent of the adverts shown during the Super Bowl: awaited, unveiled with the fuss of the turkey on Christmas day and then parsed for some kind of cultural meaning. We can draw all kinds of pat conclusions about what this says about the cultural differences between America and Britain that one gets excited about a department store's festive advert and the other is fascinated by parodically expensive adverts shown during breaks in a contact sport that is now proven to cause head injuries. But I prefer to note the differences between the countries' Christmas adverts, with America's focusing on general consumption, Britain's opting for sentimentality and anachronistic depictions of family life. Merry Christmas, everybody! Let's start with the alleged big festive gun, John Lewis, and its annual muzaking of a much-beloved 80s song. This advert is so soppy eyed it makes the Werther's Originals advert look like a gritty Ken Loach film. It has been described as \"classy\" because it doesn't actually show the name John Lewis. Personally, I wouldn't have noticed if it did, as I was too distracted wondering why a snowman would even need gloves, seeing as they are made of snow. Do snowmen make themselves cold? I think deep thoughts, you know. Like its product, Coca-Cola's Christmas adverts remain teeth-rottingly consistent, still taking place in a strange world where cheery-cheeked strangers are united in festive joy by the sight of a bunch of trucks barrelling through their village, bringing brown sugar water to the masses. It's why Jesus was born, people! But let's get to the women – because that's what Christmas is really about, right? Those long-suffering, present-hungry womenfolk. The very.co.uk adverts are, unless you are a devoted fan of Holly Willoughby and Fearne Cotton, not really a joy to watch at the best of times. Their image of Christmas this year is of Holly and Fearne bullying poor old Santa like something out of Mean Girls while wearing nasty red dresses. Dear Santa, can I have a sex change this year? If this vision of festive femininity sounds depressing, ladies, then the Morrisons and Asda adverts will require you to put Prozac on your Christmas list. Both of these adverts labour under an attitude to the genders that will be familiar to the screenwriters of The Hangover or any BBC3 sitcom. This attitude is as following: men are idiots who can't do anything, women are packhorses who have to do everything, the end. \"Behind every Christmas, there's Mum,\" intones the patronising voiceover in Asda's advert. And behind every Asda advert, there's an account director who phones in his ideas from the 1950s. I was briefly excited during the Morrisons advert when the music became distinctly similar to Danny Elfman's soundtrack to Edward Scissorhands. Ooh, is Edward this year's Morrisons' celebrity? And would he slice everyone in the advert to ribbons with his scissorhands? GOOD. Sadly, as I've often been in regards to Christmas promises, I was disappointed. Why are Christmas adverts so miserable and lazy? Of course, Christmas adverts have as much to do with Christmas as reality TV has to do with reality. But British ones, I suspect, unwittingly catch the true spirit of Christmas better than American ones do in that they are an annual event that is long anticipated, full of cliches and adored by some and dreaded by many. But if Christmas itself still makes me a little sorry that I don't get to join in the holiday properly, Christmas adverts make me very, very happy that I'm Jewish. Praise heavens there aren't any Chanukah adverts.

The rod – \"an inanimate carbon rod\", to give it its full name – is fighting for the right of all members of society \"not just meatbags\". Samuel Gaus, a student officer at University College London, has secured a place on behalf of the rod on this year's National Union of Students presidential ballot. Its manifesto calls for the training of 8 million \"death cyborgs\" and the creation of a full NUS nuclear arsenal. Inspiration came from a 1994 episode of The Simpsons, where an inanimate carbon rod is made worker of the week at Springfield nuclear power plant. Aberystwyth computer science student, Andrew Tindall, who helped start the campaign, says it arose out of the frustration of seeing \"candidates with all the usual affiliations declaring their candidacy and launching bland campaigns that offer nothing but another rehash of the same empty slogans and promises we see every year. What started as joke quickly snowballed into a campaign with actual reach, a hilarious amount of supporters, and a real purpose.\" He feels the NUS has lost touch with ordinary students. \"The NUS is alienating and distant from its members, and the leadership is decided by cliques, while locking out regular students..\" To get a place on the presidential ballot, a candidate must be nominated by at least 10 students from 10 separate students' unions. The call for support spread quickly on Twitter using the hashtag #inrodwetrust. Several students' unions will soon be voting on whether to back Gaus officially as their preferred candidate. Gaus will be standing against three other candidates – Toni Pearce, Vicki Baars, and Peter Smallwood. Pearce, a current vice-president (further education) doesn't mind the unusual competition: \"There's a proud tradition of humour and satire in student politics, and in fact I often think that we take ourselves too seriously in the student movement.\" A favourite with Labour students, Pearce says she wants to tackle the problems of postgraduate funding, student finance and unemployment in her bid to become president. \"I think that the state of our education system, and the plight of college-leavers and graduates, are issues that deserve a serious approach,.\" Candidate Peter Smallwood, one of the few Tories in student politics, aims for a tongue-in-cheek response on his blog: \"While it's good to see the rod on the ballot paper, we do have some differences. Employment and employability is something I feel strongly about. However, the creation of jobs through the construction of 8 million death cyborgs is, perhaps, not the best option. Rather, I believe it's time to go back to basics and build an NUS every student can be proud of.\" Vicki Baars, who's focusing on stronger alliances with trade unions and fighting education cuts, is concerned that the rod could muddy the waters. \"I think the campaign was intended to be light-hearted and comical. However, I am worried that it has the potential to undermine the other candidates. It's concerning when the two favourites to win for the first time in many years are women.\" The NUS says it can't comment on individual candidates in the elections. The decision on who will replace the NUS president Liam Burns – and on the prospect of killer robomen on campus – will be made at the NUS annual conference, starting on April 8."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2011/sep/09/nuclear-power-popular-in-uk","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-09-09T06:00:00Z","webTitle":"UK public confidence in nuclear remains steady despite Fukushima","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/sep/09/nuclear-power-popular-in-uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2011/sep/09/nuclear-power-popular-in-uk","fields":{"headline":"UK public confidence in nuclear remains steady despite Fukushima","bodyText":"The accident at Fukushima in Japan in March this year seems to have had little overall impact on the UK public's confidence in nuclear power, according to a poll. The survey, carried out by Populus last month and commissioned by the British Science Association, found that 41% of respondents agreed the benefits of nuclear power outweighed the risks, up from 38% in 2010 and 32% in 2005. Those who said that the risks greatly or slightly outweighed the benefits of nuclear power in 2010 numbered 36%, and in 2011 this dropped to 28% of respondents. The nuclear power plants at Fukushima in northern Japan were damaged during the magnitude 9 earthquake and the resulting tsunami that hit the country in March. Three of the six nuclear reactors suffered meltdowns in the biggest nuclear accident since Chernobyl in 1986. There were concerns that the event would irrevocably damage the case for nuclear power around the world – in the months after the Fukushima accident Germany announced the cancellation of its future programme. And a referendum in Italy in June voted down the government's plan to start a programme of new nuclear reactors. \"It's genuinely surprising to me that views have returned to these early 2010 levels quite so quickly and slightly more positively,\" said Nick Pidgeon of the University of Cardiff, who discussed the findings of the latest poll at a briefing to mark the launch of the British Science Festival, which starts in Bradford on Saturday. \"There's been a lot of speculation about the impacts of Fukushima on public attitudes – this is the first fully independent study we've had in the UK.\" Though overall support was up, there was a striking difference between men and women, with 53% of men in favour of nuclear power but only 21% of women supportive. \"If you dig into the data, you see that men in particular become much more confident about nuclear energy,\" said Pidgeon. Monbiot effect He also said that blanket media coverage and commentary – something he referred to as the \"George Monbiot effect\" – may have had a positive effect on public attitudes because, despite the severity of the crisis, no one has so far died. Populus interviewed 2,050 adults between 26 and 29 August and weighted its results to ensure they were representative of the British population. Overall, the support for nuclear power has been gradually increasing for about 10 years, said Pidgeon, and, in the past five years, the majority of people in Britain has come to support the renewal of the nuclear programme. Pidgeon said that polls in the direct aftermath of the Fukushima accident had showed a dip in support for nuclear in the UK and elsewhere, though confidence did not collapse. \"There were still more people, even immediately afterwards, in favour of nuclear energy than against in Britain,\" he said. The focus of potential concerns has also shifted in the wake of Fukushima. \"If you asked people why they were unhappy about nuclear energy a year ago, they would have brought waste up,\" said Pidgeon. \"What is clear from other polling is that accidents have gone to the top of what people are now concerned about with nuclear energy, the waste has dropped further down.\" Bryony Worthington, a Labour peer and environmental campaigner, said that for the general public the perception of the main cause of the Fukushima problem had not been the design of the reactor but the siting of the power plant. \"Most people said, hang on, why did you put them all on that eastern seaboard, which is a seismically unstable region?\" The withdrawal of support for future nuclear power stations by the German government, she said, was political. \"For Angela Merkel to reverse her decision and phase out the nuclear, Fukushima gave her a good opportunity to do it. She was already under huge political pressure to do that and Fukushima was just the trigger she found politically expedient to do it.\" Thorium reactors are safer Scientists at the briefing discussed the future of nuclear power, arguing that thorium, rather than uranium, was the safer alternative fuel. Bob Cywinski, of the University of Huddersfield, said: \"One tonne of thorium is equivalent to 200 tonnes of uranium and it doesn't need processing or enriching – 57 kilotonnes of thorium would provide the total energy need of the planet for a year, not just electricity but transport.\" Though thorium has been used as a fuel in experimental reactors in the past, it was sidelined in favour of uranium. \"Why did we stop using it? It's the unfortunate fact that civil nuclear power has been so closely linked with the military. And thorium, unfortunately, does not produce plutonium and is useless as far as proliferation is concerned. The linking of civil nuclear with military nuclear has probably done a great disservice not just to thorium but to nuclear energy in general.\" Kirk Sorensen, president of the Weinberg Foundation, a new NGO launched on Thursday to promote the cause of thorium around the world, said the design of thorium reactors had always focused on safety first. The intent was to eliminate the root causes of danger in existing nuclear reactors, such as high-pressure coolants and chemically reactive situations. In addition, thorium reactors only operate as long as there is a source of neutrons being beamed in to split atoms. If this is switched off, the reactor shuts down without any human intervention. \"Reasonable estimates suggest there is no more than 100 years of uranium left, maybe it is time we started turning to thorium,\" said Cywinski. \"Thorium is four times more abundant than uranium. In principle, there is something like 10,000 years of energy left in our thorium reserves.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2014/mar/12/lobbying-10-ways-corprations-influence-government","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2014-03-12T17:45:00Z","webTitle":"The truth about lobbying: 10 ways big business controls government","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/mar/12/lobbying-10-ways-corprations-influence-government","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2014/mar/12/lobbying-10-ways-corprations-influence-government","fields":{"headline":"The truth about lobbying: 10 ways big business controls government","bodyText":"What does a tax-avoiding, polluting, privatising corporation have to do to get its way with the British government? \"We all know how it works,\" said David Cameron of lobbying. But do we? Lobbyists are the paid persuaders whose job it is to influence the decisions of government. Typically, they operate behind closed doors, through quiet negotiation with politicians. And the influence they enjoy is constructed very consciously, using a whole array of tactics. Lobbyists operate in the shadows – deliberately. As one lobbyist notes: \"The influence of lobbyists increases when it goes largely unnoticed by the public.\" But if the reasons why companies lobby are often obscured, it is always a tactical investment. Whether facing down a threat to profits from a corporate tax hike, or pushing for market opportunities – such as government privatisations – lobbying has become another way of making money. Here are the 10 key steps that lobbying businesses will follow to bend government to their will. 1. Control the ground Lobbyists succeed by owning the terms of debate, steering conversations away from those they can't win and on to those they can. If a public discussion on a company's environmental impact is unwelcome, lobbyists will push instead to have a debate with politicians and the media on the hypothetical economic benefits of their ambitions. Once this narrowly framed conversation becomes dominant, dissenting voices will appear marginal and irrelevant. Everybody's doing it, including lobbyists for fracking and nuclear power, public sector reform and bank regulation. It doesn't matter if the new frame relies on fabrication. The referendum on an alternative voting system was not, as anticipated, so much a conversation about the merits of first past the post. No2AV was \"very quick off the mark\" to make it about cost to the public purse, explains Dylan Sharpe, of the No camp's TaxPayers' Alliance. They led with the claim that switching to AV would deny troops badly needed equipment and sick babies incubators. The Yes camp lost the vote two to one. 2. Spin the media The trick is in knowing when to use the press and when to avoid it. The more noise there is, the less control lobbyists have. As a way of talking to government, though, the media is crucial. Messages are carefully crafted. Even if the corporate goal is pure, self-interested profit-making, it will be dressed up to appear synonymous with the wider, national interest. At the moment, that means economic growth and jobs. Get the messaging wrong and you get fiascos such as High Speed 2 (HS2). In early 2011, lobbyist James Bethell of Westbourne Communications was parachuted in to rescue the £43bn project, which had initially been sold by ministers on the marginal benefits to a few commuters. Westbourne reframed the debate to make it about jobs and economic growth. The new messaging focused on a narrative that pitted wealthy people in the Chilterns worried about their hunting rights against the economic benefits to the north. The strategy was \"posh people standing in the way of working-class people getting jobs,\" said Bethell. \"Their lawns or our jobs,\" shouted the ad campaign. Private healthcare also regrouped after the wrong messages went public. As Andrew Lansley embarked on his radical reforms of the NHS, private hospitals and outsourcing firms were talking to investors about the \"clear opportunities\" to profit from the changes. After comments by Mark Britnell, the head of health at accountancy giants KPMG giants and a former adviser of David Cameron, hit the headlines in May 2011 – Britnell told an investors' conference that \"the NHS will be shown no mercy and the best time to take advantage of this will be in the next couple of years\" – the industry got a grip. Lobby group The NHS Partners Network moved quickly to get everyone back on-message and singing from \"common hymn sheets\", as its chief lobbyist David Worskett explained. The reforms were about the survival of the NHS in straitened times. Just nobody mention the bumper profits. 3. Engineer a following It doesn't help if a corporation is the only one making the case to government. That looks like special pleading. What is needed is a critical mass of voices singing to its tune. This can be engineered. The forte of lobbying firm Westbourne is in mobilising voices behind its clients. Thirty economists, for example, signed a letter to the FT in 2011 in support of HS2; 100 businesses endorsed another published in the Daily Telegraph. Westbourne was also hired in 2011 to lobby against the top rate of tax, although who was behind its \"50p tax campaign\" remains a mystery. Ahead of the chancellor's annual Budget announcement in early 2012, letters appeared in the press demanding he scrap it. The FT's was signed by 20 economists. The Telegraph's by the bosses of 573 SMEs, described as the \"bedrock\" of British industry. A quick glance, though, revealed it included five managers from the Switzerland-based banking giant Credit Suisse. The paper's commentary noted the alarm this new call from \"ordinary British business\" would cause inside government. 4. Buy in credibility Corporations are one of the least credible sources of information for the public. What they need, therefore, are authentic, seemingly independent people to carry their message for them. One nuclear lobbyist admitted it spread messages \"via third-party opinion because the public would be suspicious if we started ramming pro-nuclear messages down their throats\". That's it in a nutshell. The tobacco companies are pioneers of this technique. Their recent campaign against plain packaging has seen them fund newsagents to push the economic case against the policy and encourage trading standards officers to lobby their MPs. British American Tobacco also currently funds the Common Sense Alliance, which is fronted by two ex-policemen and campaigns against \"irrational\" regulation. Philip Morris is similarly paying an ex-Met police officer, Will O'Reilly, to front a media campaign linking plain packaging to tobacco smuggling. It is worth noting that a decade ago the tobacco giant coughed up $1.25bn to the European Commission to settle a long-running dispute over its own complicity in the illicit trade. 5. Sponsor a thinktank \"The thinktank route is a very good one,\" said ex-minister Patricia Hewitt to undercover reporters seeking lobbying advice. Some thinktanks will provide companies with a lobbying package: a media-friendly report, a Westminster event, ear-time with politicians. \"The exact same services that a lobbying agency would provide,\" says one lobbyist. \"They're just more expensive.\" In the mid-noughties, a lobbyist for Standard Life Healthcare, now part of PruHealth, worried about how they could get more people to buy private cover without being seen to undermine the NHS. The solution: \"Get some of the thinktanks to say it, so it's not just us calling for reform, it's outside commentators ... it does need others to help us take the debate forward.\" The insurers did turn to thinktanks, including free-market advocates Reform. This has lobbied for more \"insurance-based private funding\" in the health service. Prudential, the insurance giant behind PruHealth, was Reform's most generous sponsor in 2012, investing £67,500 in the thinktank. The BBC has also come under repeated recent criticism for inviting commentators from the leading neo-liberal thinktank, the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA), to talk about its opposition to the plain packaging of cigarettes, without disclosing the Institute's tobacco funding. Although the IEA does not disclose who funds it, BAT concedes it has recently paid the IEA £30,000, with more to come this year. Leaked documents from Philip Morris also reveal the thinktank is one of its \"media messengers\" in its anti- plain-packaging campaign. 6. Consult your critics Companies faced with a development that has drawn the ire of a local community will often engage lobbyists to run a public consultation exercise. Again, not as benign as it sounds. \"Businesses have to be able to predict risk and gain intelligence on potential problems,\" says ex-Tesco lobbyist Bernard Hughes. \"The army used to call it reconnaissance; we call it consultation.\" For some in the business, community consultation – anything from running focus groups, exhibitions, planning exercises and public meetings – is a means of flushing out opposition and providing a managed channel through which would-be opponents can voice concerns. Opportunities to influence the outcome, whether it is preventing an out-of-town supermarket or protecting local health services, are almost always nil. Residents in Barne Barton in Plymouth were asked in 2011 what they thought about a 95-metre, PFI-financed incinerator being sited in their neighbourhood, just 62 metres from the nearest house. Although more than 5,000 people objected, the waste company's planning application was waved through. That's community consultation. 7. Neutralise the opposition Lobbyists see their battles with opposition activists as \"guerilla warfare\". They want government to listen to their message, but ignore counter arguments coming from campaigners, such as environmentalists, who have long been the bane of commercial lobbyists. So, they need to deal with the \"antis\". Lobbyists have developed a sliding scale of tactics to neutralise such a threat. Monitoring of opposition groups is common: one lobbyist from agency Edelman talks of the need for \"360-degree monitoring\" of the internet, complete with online \"listening posts ... so they can pick up the first warning signals\" of activist activity. \"The person making a lot of noise is probably not the influential one, you've got to find the influential one,\" he says. Rebuttal campaigns are frequently employed: \"exhausting, but crucial,\" says Westbourne. Lobbyists have also long employed divide-and-rule tactics. One Shell strategy proposed to \"differentiate interest groups into friends and foes\", building relationships with the former, while making it \"more difficult for hardcore campaigners to sustain their campaigns\". Philip Morris's covert 10-year strategy, codenamed Project Sunrise, intended to \"drive a wedge between various anti groups\" and \"position antis as extremists\". Then there are the more serious activities used primarily when big-money commercial interests are threatened, such as the infiltration of opposition groups, otherwise known as spying. Household names such as Shell, BAE Systems and Nestlé have all been exposed for spying on their critics. Wikileaks' Global Intelligence Files revealed that groups such as Greenpeace, Amnesty International and animal rights organisation Peta were all monitored by global intelligence company Stratfor, once described as a \"shadow CIA\". 8. Control the web Today's world is a digital democracy, say lobbyists. Gone are the old certainties of how decisions were made \"by having lunch with an MP, or taking a journalist out,\" laments one. It presents a challenge, but not an insurmountable one. One key way to control information online is to flood the web with positive information, which is not as benign as it sounds. Lobbying agencies create phoney blogs for clients and press releases that no journalist will read – all positive content that fools search engines into pushing the dummy content above the negative, driving the output of critics down Google rankings. Relying on the fact that few of us regularly click beyond the first page of search results, lobbyists make negative content \"disappear\". Another means of restricting access to information is the doctoring of Wikipedia, \"a ridiculous organisation,\" in veteran lobbyist Tim Bell's words. Accounts associated with his firm, Bell Pottinger, have been caught scrubbing Wikipedia profiles of arms manufacturers, financial firms, a Russian oligarch and the founder of libel specialists Carter-Ruck. \"It's important for Wikipedia to recognise we are a valuable source for accurate information,\" says Bell, a master at killing stories. Other edits by lobbyists range from a computer in the offices of payday lender Wonga deleting references to \"usury\" from its entry, to a computer registered to the American multinational Dow Chemical repeatedly attempting to remove a large section from the company's profile detailing \"controversies\". 9. Open the door Without doubt, lobbyists need access to politicians. This doesn't always equate to influence, but deals can only be cooked up once in the kitchen. And access to politicians can be bought. It is not a cash deal, rather an investment is made in the relationship. Lobbyists build trust, offer help and accept favour. The best way to shortcut the process of relationship-building is to hire politicians' friends, in the form of ex-employees or colleagues. Bill Morgan is a good example. In recent years, he's been backwards and forwards twice between Andrew Lansley's office and health-lobbying specialists MHP. Its clients had \"obviously benefited\" from Morgan's inside knowledge of Conservative health policy, MHP wrote. They could \"look forward to continuing to be at the heart of the major policy debates\". Lobbyists are Westminster and Whitehall insiders, among them many former ministers. \"You may remember me from my time as Minister of State for Transport,\" wrote Stephen Ladyman as he lobbied a potential government client in his new role as a paid adviser to a transport company. \"I do indeed and am delighted to hear from you,\" replied the official. \"We would be interested to hear your proposals.\"He had just opened the door. 10. And finally ... There is the perception, at least, that decisions taken in government could be influenced by the reward of future employment. It's a concern that has been expressed for the best part of a century. Today, however, the number of people moving through the revolving door is off the scale. The top rung of the Department of Health has in recent years experienced huge traffic towards the private sector. The department that sees more movement than any other, though, is still the Ministry of Defence. Since 1996, officials and military officers have taken up more than 3,500 jobs in arms and defence related companies. Two hundred and thirty-one jobs were secured in 2011/12 alone. Government is the arms industry's biggest customer and the MoD's closeness to its suppliers is widely known. It is also gaining a reputation for its disastrously expensive contracts that deliver poor value for taxpayers and often poor performance for the military. More than one commentator has asked whether the two are connected.

At the same time, others in Whitehall – including a worrying number of Conservative ministers – are driving for a new dash for gas and casting doubt on renewable energy. Ironically, those who are keenest on gas and nuclear tend to also promote the argument that governments should not seek to \"pick winners\" in energy policy. According to this world view, technology choices should be left to the market – and the key to tackling climate change is sole, or very strong, reliance on a carbon price set by either taxation or an emissions trading scheme. Such views are gaining traction in debates on the UK energy bill and EU renewable energy targets. So the title of a new WWF report, On Picking Winners: the need for targeted support for renewable energy, is deliberately provocative. The report is written by Rob Gross of Imperial College, one of the UK's leading authorities on energy policy. Gross concludes that the argument: \"that carbon pricing is the only policy we need in order to save the planet … is so simplistic it is absurd. Renewable energy in particular needs policies that are investment grade. Only then will we get costs down and create a cleaner and more secure energy system.\" Putting a price on carbon undoubtedly has an important role to play – but Gross concludes that in no way is it sufficient. One problem is that it is unlikely to be politically feasible to set a carbon price at a high enough level to encourage clean, emerging technologies. Instead, a carbon price is much more likely to encourage gas. This may achieve modest emission reductions in the short term but simply switching all the UK's coal power stations for gas ones would leave power sector emissions at around six times the level that they need to be in 2030. But is it sensible for governments to \"pick winners\" by supporting renewable energy technologies? The reality is that governments have always picked winners whether through research and development funding, repeated subsidies and cost write-offs for the nuclear industry, tax breaks for the North Sea oil and gas industry, or proposed tax breaks for shale gas. Fossil fuels and nuclear power have benefited from subsidies for decades. So the reality is that governments pick winners all of the time. George Osborne's determination to turn UK into \"gas hub\" – and his efforts to undermine renewable energy – is one clear example. The real question is not whether the government should be \"picking winners\". It is about whether it is backing the right horses. If the UK relies excessively on a carbon price, we will end up locked in to a gas-based energy system, which is bad news for the climate, the consumer and for security of supply. And the apparent faith that nuclear – now a very mature technology – will be cheap and reliable this time round flies in the face of historic experience in the UK and globally, and ignores the huge cost over-runs with new nuclear projects under way in Europe. Government forecasts suggest that gas prices are going only one way: up. The UK is becoming increasingly dependent on gas imports, whatever happens with shale gas production. The dramatic increases in consumer bills over the past few years, and again this autumn, have been largely driven by rising wholesale gas prices. Yet the alternative is clear and attractive. The UK has huge renewable energy resources and could be a world leader in the growing global markets for marine renewables, electric vehicles and even carbon capture and storage, bringing in jobs and investment at a time when they are sorely needed. These technologies do not just magically appear fully formed. They need clear policy frameworks to reach a level of maturity where they can compete easily with technologies like gas which, let us not forget, has reaped plenty of subsidies of its own in the past. The cost of technologies such as solar and onshore wind is already falling rapidly, and costs for offshore wind are set to fall dramatically – provided investors can be confident that they have a clear market and that politicians won't pull the rug out from under them. So our government has a choice. It can listen to the siren voices who speak the language of economic efficiency but who are really more interested in shoring up the future market for gas. Or it can provide stable policies to bring forward investment in renewables and energy efficiency. The benefits? A power sector which is not based on imported and increasingly expensive gas, a booming green economy and – not least – we could actually hit our carbon targets. • Jenny Banks and Keith Allott work for WWF UK"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/oct/13/huhne-uk-nuclear-policy-failure","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-10-13T17:45:40Z","webTitle":"Chris Huhne: UK's nuclear policy is most expensive postwar failure","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/oct/13/huhne-uk-nuclear-policy-failure","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/oct/13/huhne-uk-nuclear-policy-failure","fields":{"headline":"Chris Huhne: UK's nuclear policy is most expensive postwar failure","bodyText":"The climate change secretary, Chris Huhne, has described the UK's nuclear policy as the \"most expensive failure of postwar British policy-making\" in a \"crowded and highly-contested field\". Huhne set out five tests for how power plants would be adopted in a cautious new regime, but is under pressure from his party to ensure any new-builds do not receive public subsidy – something the coalition has pledged it will not allow. Speaking at the Royal Society on Thursday, Huhne said: \"If we are to retain public support for nuclear as a key part of our future energy mix then we have to show that we have learned the lessons from our past mistakes.\" Huhne made the speech as doubts gathered regarding the UK's commitment to any energy technologies that could stand in the way of growth. The chancellor, George Osborne, said at his party conference last week that the UK would seek to reduce carbon emissions \"no faster\" than other European countries. Speaking at a green \"business bootcamp\" launch in south-west London on Thursday, the mayor of London, Boris Johnson, set out a different vision. He said: \"London is on target to reach a 60% cut in carbon emissions by 2025, and we intend to do even better than that.\" In contrast to the chancellor's vision, Johnson argued that increased carbon targets were \"the only way to deal with carbon emissions in a big city\". The funding of any new nuclear power plants is another live issue in Huhne's portfolio. A quarter of power plants will close by the end of the decade and by 2023 only one of the current fleet of reactors will remain open, jeopardising 18% of the UK's current electricity supply, and Huhne has to frame the case for their replacement carefully. The energy secretary's speech was emphatically critical of the industry in the UK, with his office describing the speech as \"full and frank\" about the historical failures of British nuclear power. \"Never again. This government is determined not to pay for the present by mortgaging the future. We are determined to do the right thing for the long term. On governance, regulation and financing, we must show that we have learned the lessons of the past. We will make provision for future costs now, and pay down our decommissioning debt.\" However, in the past few weeks Huhne's own party has hardened its position on new nuclear power, putting pressure on the climate change secretary to begin a fresh battle with the Treasury. Liberal Democrat activists believe the coalition's forthcoming carbon floor price – due to come into effect from April 2013 – will give a £50m \"windfall\" to nuclear power. The carbon floor price was designed to penalise those technologies that emit carbon and reward carbon-free ones, but these include nuclear power. Campaigners have argued the nuclear industry – already well remunerated, they think – will receive a windfall and that money will in effect become a subsidy. At their annual party conference three weeks ago, Lib Dems voted tin favour of forcing nuclear operators to hand back any gains they make from the carbon floor price. This is now party policy but a source at the Department of Energy and Climate Change said this would be up to the Treasury and there had been no change in policy. At the time, a Lib Dem source said: \"The aim needs to be to change business behaviour and incentivise new low-carbon electricity generation, not give windfall profits to existing nuclear operators.\" In his speech on Thursday, Huhne said nuclear electricity could and should play a part in our energy future provided that new nuclear was built without public subsidy. His aides said he felt there would be no need for public subsidies, saying it was an \"essential reassurance\" to taxpayers and energy consumers that \"this will never happen again\". He also set out five key tests he will apply to any nuclear power stations built. Huhne noted the UK has enough high-level nuclear waste to fill \"three Olympic-sized swimming pools, and enough intermediate waste to fill a supertanker\". Because of the errors of the past, his department was spending £2bn a year \"cleaning up\" the \"mess\" of nuclear waste which he said would rise two thirds next year. \"Nuclear energy has risks, but we face the greater risk of accelerating climate change if we do not embark on another generation of nuclear power. Time is running out. Nuclear can be a vital and affordable means of providing low carbon electricity,\" he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2013/mar/12/north-korea-tighten-your-seatbelt","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2013-03-12T20:14:31Z","webTitle":"North Korea: tighten your seatbelt","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/mar/12/north-korea-tighten-your-seatbelt","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2013/mar/12/north-korea-tighten-your-seatbelt","fields":{"headline":"North Korea: tighten your seatbelt","bodyText":"In the past two days alone North Korea has torn up an armistice it made with Seoul in 1953, Barack Obama's security adviser has warned Pyongyang that were it to carry out a nuclear attack, it would face \"the full range of our capabilities\", and China has announced it is going to send a team to survey a group of uninhabited islands which Japan claims as its own. While North Korea has abrogated the armistice at least seven times before, and much of drama in north-east Asia is ritually dismissed as rhetorical, there are genuine fears of an outbreak of hostilities. First, it has happened before. The events now could merely be a rerun of tensions four years ago when sanctions over missile and nuclear tests ended in a sea skirmish which Seoul claimed it won. Four months later, North Korea torpedoed and sank a South Korean warship, with the loss of 46 lives, and later that year shelled an island, after South Korea ignored a warning to cancel a live-fire artillery drill. The then South Korean president Lee Myung-bak got hammered for what was seen domestically as a slow and weak response. No such option is available to his successor Park Geun-hye. If the same happens again in disputed Yellow Sea waters, South Korea has vowed to hit back hard. Second, successful nuclear and missile tests may actually have empowered North Korean generals to think that the South would not dare to respond to another provocation. One analyst has compared this to the seatbelt effect. After seatbelts were introduced in cars, a Chicago University economist, Sam Peltzman, noted that many drivers used the additional safety provided by the belts to drive more recklessly. He called it risk substitution. The same might be about to happen now. When the North Korean army supreme command said on 5 March that it will \"make a strike of justice at any target any time as it pleases without limit\", it might just mean it. Before we wander down the road of apocalyptic possibilities, it is worth noting what has not happened. For a country technically in a state of war with its neighbour, it is odd, to say the least, that it continues to allow 123 \"enemy\" companies to operate in a cross-border industrial zone employing over 50,000 of its workers. The hotline may have stopped working on Monday, but the flow of South Koreans trooping across the border to Kaesong was unimpeded on that day. The North has threatened to close the cross-border experiment, but so far it has not. More importantly, China has stopped backing its errant buffer state. It was one of the sponsors of the UN security council resolution that upgraded the sanctions from a request to an obligation. It is both frustrated and angry at North Korea's defiance, and – although China continually tells Japan it lacks leverage over North Korea – there is still much more it could do to make its displeasure felt. If any nuclear power succeeds in turning Kim Jong-un from his current course, it will be China. Which is why even media debates in South Korea and Japan about arming themselves with nuclear weapons are counterproductive. The key to solving the North Korean nuclear crisis remains Beijing. It will not be encouraged to do so by a nuclear arms race on its doorstep. That is also why the real cost of increasingly acerbic island disputes between the key regional powers China, Japan and South Korea is going up all the time. Other than endlessly repeating the historical arguments over sovereignty, which is a zero-sum game, a new UN-backed approach needs to be found which sidesteps the issue of ownership and concentrates instead on sharing and policing conservation of the sea around them.

SOFIA 0069 B. SEPTEL Classified By: Ambassador Nancy McEldowney for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 1. (S) SUMMARY: Bulgaria's highest profile energy project -- the Belene Nuclear Power Plant (BNPP) is dogged by cost overruns, financing woes, construction delays, and now serious safety and quality assurance concerns. Belene may end up costing Bulgaria more than money in the long run. Despite the repeated objections by project experts, END SUMMARY. --------------------------- SAFETY AND QUALITY IGNORED --------------------------- 2. (S) Marred by many technical, political, and financial problems, the Belene NPP project continues to move forward despite strong warnings about project safety and quality by project experts. NEC, which controls 51 percent of the project along with strategic investor Germany's RWE with 49 percent, keeps pressing to start the \"Site Preparation Phase\" in September 2009 even before the \"Demolition Phase\" is completed in August 2009. (Demolition Phase includes the destruction and removal of the existing old site infrastructure.) According to project insiders, 3. (S) Pressed to meet its own self-imposed deadlines, XXXXXXXXXXXX to the \"overnight creation\" of temporary structures, and the lack of a Quality Assurance (QA) Program Plan for the temporary structures. (Construction of temporary structures during the \"Demolition Phase\" and \"Site Preparation Phase\" is a routine process and facilitates the storage of equipment and manufacturing of key construction components such as concrete). XXXXXXXXXXXX 4. (S) Another problem area is the lack of an overall detailed technical and quality assurance plan for BNPP. As of late June 2009, Russia's Atomstroyexport (ASE) -- Belene NPP's main foreign contractor -- has yet to provide NEC with an overall Quality Assurance (QA) Program Plan. A QA Program Plan is required before the Technical Design Approval Order (TDAO) can be issued and certainly well before the Bulgarian Nuclear Regulatory Agency (NRA) can issue a Construction Permit for BNPP, making the targeted start dates of September 2009 and December 2010 virtually impossible. ------------------------------- LESS THAN A GLOWING ENDORSEMENT ------------------------------- 5. (S) NEC is rushing to complete the \"Demolition Phase\" and start the \"Site Preparation Phase\" to make Belene look financially viable, attract additional international funding, SOFIA 00000363 002 OF 002 and keep RWE as a strategic investor. Our contacts told us RWE will not provide funding until \"financial closure\" and it sees the \"first concrete poured,\" which is currently estimated for December 2010. XXXXXXXXXXXX 6. (S) RWE is clearly feeling \"buyer's remorse\" about its participation in Belene. XXXXXXXXXXXX Belene experts said that RWE remains \"in the dark\" on most on-site day-to-day and technical issues. During a late May 2009 Belene project meeting, RWE asked numerous basic questions, indicating that they have not seen any of the on-site safety and environmental reports. XXXXXXXXXXXX Media reports theorize that RWE is trying to pull out of Belene. Some contacts suggest that RWE will wait until after the Bulgarian (July 5) and German (September) elections before announcing the fate of its future participation in BNPP, as GERB officials have expressed strong negative views toward the project. 7. (S) The current BSP-led government has repeatedly pushed for Belene, especially with 700 million euros in sunk costs and priceless political capital invested in the project. The Bulgarians and RWE initially wanted commercial financing for the entire project, but were unable to attract funding from Western banks -- wary of extending a large loan to an increasingly questionable project in the midst of the global financial crisis. In early June, Bulgarian Energy Holding (BEH) CEO Galina Tosheva confirmed Russian approval for a 3.8 billion EUR (5.4 billion USD) loan for Belene. The Bulgarians are still in the dark on actual details. Tosheva told us that she expects Russian PM Putin will dictate the loans terms directly to Bulgarian PM Stanishev. 8. (S) COMMENT: Vested interests -- the current BSP-led government, NEC, well-connected politicians, Bulgarian energy oligarchs, and Russian investors -- keep pushing the project. XXXXXXXXXXXX Since BNPP began, the corresponding technical documentation, the ongoing demolition, and site preparation activities have not been investigated, audited, or approved by the International Atomic Energy Association (IAEA). Bisser Boev, a member of GERB's economic team, told us that as of late June, Belene also has no updated economic or technical feasibility study. We should encourage the next government to quickly begin its due-diligence on the project; stressing the importance of meeting all international safety and quality assurance standards, and bringing in the IAEA and the EU's European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM) to perform an on-site inspection.

It doesn't, of course. Ingenuity is also employed on such things as enticing consumers, as we should more accurately be called, into spending more on tariffs and extras than we want to, and on creating that magical combination of satisfaction and discontent that ensures we keep on buying new products. They work just as well and no better than the manufacturers can get away with. While designers love to imagine the perfect product, in a universe untroubled by the interactions of markets and people, the truth is that anything designed, made and sold is shaped by the power play between them. In the micro-kingdom of the Digitarians, a state in an unspecified future dependent on digital technology and market forces, of which you could imagine Mark Zuckerberg being president for life, this truth still applies. Here, cars have become driverless buggies, their movements efficiently co-ordinated by computers, allowing their occupants leisure to reflect and operate screens. They have become more like phones, in that what you pay for is less the physical object than the services that come with it. According to an opaque system of prices, you can buy different levels of privacy, size and performance. The cars come in childish pastel colours, showing the same infantilising tendencies as the graphics of Google, Apple and Facebook, and, as with those companies, they sugar the fact that you are not offered as much freedom as first appears. What might be a paradise of frictionless movement across an open landscape becomes a zone of status envy, marketing and congestion that is not unfamiliar. This imaginary state is a not wholly unrealistic projection of current technologies – driverless cars are being developed now, along with the idea that the important thing will be the software that manages them rather than the hardware of the vehicle. The purpose of inventing the kingdom of the Digitarians, however, is not to provide a precise prediction of the future, but to offer physical suggestions of what might happen and to show that the causes and effects of technology and design are political, social and economic. This place is one of four United Micro Kingdoms in a fictional future England invented for the purposes of an exhibition at the Design Museum by Anthony Dunne and Fiona Raby. A designer and an architect, respectively, by training, they devote their energies to teaching at the Royal College of Art, and creating speculations about the interaction of design with fantasies and beliefs. Rather than ask: \"What is good design?\" they ask: \"For whom might this design be good?\" The other three kingdoms include that of the Communo-Nuclearists who, possessing unlimited but risky nuclear power, spend their lives on vast communal trains, each powered by a small reactor, which cruise slowly through untouched nature. The Anarcho-Evolutionists use science to modify themselves so that they make better use of the environment, creating, for example, a race of cyclists with extra strong thighs. Bioliberals are mostly farmers, cooks and gardeners, using biotechnology to grow not only plants but also organic machines. Each is depicted in the exhibition by means of transport particular to their way of life, represented with engaging models: the digital cars, the giant train, a genetically engineered mutant that is half horse, half ox, a vehicle grown from a potion of yeast and tea. All are weird but not technically inconceivable. The aim is to show how politics and culture are contained within what might look like a simple practical proposition, the design of things to move us around. The models are presented with sparing quantities of supporting material, the idea being that, like archaeological exhibits in the British Museum, they evoke a society by themselves. There are a few images of the cars and trains in imaginative future landscapes and some baffling photographs of the models in apparently present-day settings. There are also written explanations – the show is text-heavy and it's not helped by redundant blurbs, insisted on by the museum, about the ways in which designers use models and computers. Their aim seems to be to tick some box called \"education and access\", but in a show that depends on economy of means they are brainless. More successful is a mini-library in which you can sit and browse a selection of books on imaginary worlds and visions of the future. They allow you to feast a little more after the esoteric sushi that is the rest of the exhibits. The main purpose of the show is to provoke further thought and the books suggest ways of pursuing this. United Micro Kingdoms: A Design Fiction is on the slight side, but it has a critical intelligence and a wit that nicely illuminate the Design Museum's other displays, where furniture, signage, fashion and digitalia are shown in a more innocent fashion. The strength of Dunne and Raby's futurism is that they show neither heaven nor hell, but something messy and contested, and which casts light on the present."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/julian-borger-global-security-blog/2012/dec/19/us-iran-negotiations-sanctions","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2012-12-19T17:51:23Z","webTitle":"Former generals and diplomats urge Obama to put sanctions on table in Iran talks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/julian-borger-global-security-blog/2012/dec/19/us-iran-negotiations-sanctions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/julian-borger-global-security-blog/2012/dec/19/us-iran-negotiations-sanctions","fields":{"headline":"Former generals and diplomats urge Obama to put sanctions on table in Iran talks","bodyText":"A group of 24 experts on nuclear weapons and Iran, including former generals, diplomats and officials, have sent a letter to President Obama urging him to press ahead with the next round of diplomacy with Iran over its nuclear programme and to improve the international offer on the table. The group includes General Joseph Hoar, a former US Central Command chief, and Lt General Robert Gard, a former president of the National Defence University, as well as many former diplomats from the US and European with experience of the issue. Following reports that the administration does not intend to improve the current international offer to Iran significantly in return for a halt to production of 'medium-enriched' 20% uranium, the letter advocates a bolder strategy, involving a short-term offer of sanctions relief. Here is the meat of the letter: Overall goals for U.S. and P5+1 negotiators should include: halting Iran's accumulation of 20 percent enriched uranium; restricting—not permanently suspending--Iran's enrichment to normal reactor-grade levels; limiting its stockpiles to actual nuclear power and other civilian, peaceful needs; and securing more extensive and effective IAEA inspections including through Iranian adherence to the Additional Protocol to the NPT and other inspection needs of the IAEA. Iran should account for previous weapons-related experiments to ensure that they have been halted. In exchange, there should be an appropriate and proportional paring back of international sanctions on Iran. As a first step, we urge you and your team to pursue a revised proposal calling for a verifiable halt to Iran's accumulation of 20 percent-enriched uranium including export of the material or conversion to metallic form in Iran in exchange for a reciprocal relaxing some of international and financial sanctions imposed on Iran. This would build confidence and momentum for a long-term framework agreement covering nuclear cooperation and security issues as well as a fully transparent future for Iran's civil nuclear program in full and verified accordance with the NPT. There is still no date for the next round of talks between the six-nation negotiating group and Iran, but the most likely scenario is that they will resume in mid-January which may give the Obama administration and its expected nominee for Secretary of State, John Kerry, time to review the US position. In Europe, meanwhile, there is a growing conviction that the six-nation process is not a viable vehicle for delivering a deal. It is too cumbersome and public, officials say, and most importantly, does not provide a direct means of communication between the two power centres that matter: the White House and the office of Iran's Supreme Leader."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/oct/04/green-news-roundup","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-10-04T15:13:12Z","webTitle":"Green news roundup: 50 months, deadly fungus and waste house","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/04/green-news-roundup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/oct/04/green-news-roundup","fields":{"headline":"Green news roundup: 50 months, deadly fungus and waste house","bodyText":"50 months to save the world • 50 months to save the world – interactive • Ignoring global warming is 'reckless' of the government, warn campaigners • Andrew Simms: 50 months to avoid climate disaster – and a change is in the air • 50 months to save the world - Twitter suggestions Environment news • Great Barrier Reef loses more than half its coral cover • Deadly fungus prompts ban on ash tree imports • EU energy chief 'satisfied' with nuclear safety despite critical report • Republican climate sceptics face battle for re-election as green groups hit back • Campaign to push organic cotton as sales rise • New UK nuclear power station plans suffer setback • Government's 'green deal' spurned by major retailers On the blogs • The green deal still has big gaps to plug • Capture the ephemeral spectacle of autumn colours • Riding-hoods: how to beat the rain Multimedia • Great Barrier Reef loses more than half its coral cover - video • UK's first building to be made entirely from waste – video animation • Satellite eye on Earth: September 2012 – in pictures • The week in wildlife – in pictures Features • Kristin Davis: 'Ivory is basically a blood diamond' • The world-leading UK windfarm built with little British involvement • Sainsbury's boss welcomes grilling on green values and ambitions Best of the web • Can we bring back the wilderness? • How GMOs unleashed a pesticide gusher • Green light for power plant that will produce energy from waste ...And finally • Plan to build UK's first building entirely out of waste Grand Designs' model ecohouse to be rebuilt in Brighton city centre using local construction and industrial waste"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/aug/22/green-news-roundup","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-08-22T14:38:00Z","webTitle":"Green news roundup: Green news roundup: India's tigers, smart meters and US drought","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/aug/22/green-news-roundup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/aug/22/green-news-roundup","fields":{"headline":"Green news roundup: India's tigers, smart meters and US drought","bodyText":"Environment news • India's tiger population facing 'total disaster' • Majority of UK unaware of smart meters, research shows • US court overturns coal pollution ruling • US drought will lead to inflation and higher food prices, says report • UN calls on nations to adopt urgent drought policies • Fish demand 'exceeds UK sea supply' • Abandoned Severn tidal power project to be reconsidered On the blogs • Where is Captain Paul Watson? • An unforgettable ride with Bradley Wiggins • If we are to cope with climate change we need a new moral order • The corporate cock-up that's refuelled the Canadian tar sands debate • Can a honey-processing service unite urban beekeepers?

Google's Nexus 7 costs $152 to make, IHS iSuppli teardown finds &gt;&gt; AllThingsD They took a Nexus 7 apart in order to see what components are inside, and to estimate what each of them costs. The early verdict, shared exclusively with AllThingsD, is that the low-end eight gigabyte model of the Nexus 7, which sells for $199, costs $151.75 to build. The higher-end 16GB model, which sells for $249, costs $159.25, the difference being the cost of the memory chips inside. Andrew Rassweiler, who leads the teardown team at IHS iSuppli, reckons that Google will break even on the 8GB model, and will turn a tidy profit on the 16GB model. \"Like Apple, Google realizes it can boost its profit margin by offering more memory at a stair-step price point.

Officials are currently selecting a site for the reactor, which would be the first of its kind, using thorium for the bulk of its fuel instead of uranium – the fuel for conventional reactors. They plan to have the plant up and running by the end of the decade. The development of workable and large-scale thorium reactors has for decades been a dream for nuclear engineers, while for environmentalists it has become a major hope as an alternative to fossil fuels. Proponents say the fuel has considerable advantages over uranium. Thorium is more abundant and exploiting it does not involve release of large quantities of carbon dioxide, making it less dangerous for the climate than fossil fuels like coal and oil. In a rare interview, Ratan Kumar Sinha, the director of the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) in Mumbai, told the Guardian that his team is finalising the site for construction of the new large-scale experimental reactor, while at the same time conducting \"confirmatory tests\" on the design. \"The basic physics and engineering of the thorium-fuelled Advanced Heavy Water Reactor (AHWR) are in place, and the design is ready,\" said Sinha. Once the six-month search for a site is completed – probably next to an existing nuclear power plant – it will take another 18 months to obtain regulatory and environmental impact clearances before building work on the site can begin. \"Construction of the AHWR will begin after that, and it would take another six years for the reactor to become operational,\" Sinha added, meaning that if all goes to plan, the reactor could be operational by the end of the decade. The reactor is designed to generate 300MW of electricity – about a quarter of the output of a typical new nuclear plant in the west. Sinha added that India was in talks with other countries over the export of conventional nuclear plants. He said India was looking for buyers for its 220MW and 540MW Pressurised Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs). Kazakhastan and the Gulf states are known to have expressed an interest, while one source said that negotiations are most advanced with Vietnam, although Sinha refused to confirm this. \"Many countries with small power grids of up to 5,000 MW are looking for 300MW reactors,\" he said. \"Our reactors are smaller, cheaper, and very price competitive.\" Producing a workable thorium reactor would be a massive breakthrough in energy generation. Using thorium – a naturally occurring moderately radioactive element named after the Norse god of thunder – as a source of atomic power is not new technology. Promising early research was carried out in the US in the 1950s and 60s and then abandoned in favour of using uranium. The pro-thorium lobby maintains this was at least partly because national nuclear power programmes in the US and elsewhere were developed with a military purpose in mind: namely access to a source of plutonium for nuclear weapons. Unlike uranium, thorium-fuelled reactors do not result in a proliferation of weapons-grade plutonium. Also, under certain circumstances, the waste from thorium reactors is less dangerous and remains radioactive for hundreds rather than thousands of years. That is a considerable plus for governments now worried about how to deal with nuclear waste and concerned about the possibility of rogue governments or terrorists getting their hands on plutonium. Also, with the world's supply of uranium rapidly depleting, attention has refocused on thorium, which is three to four times more abundant and 200 times more energy dense.. \"Given India's abundant supply of thorium it makes sense for her to develop thorium reactors,\" said Labour peer Baroness Worthington who is patron of the Weinberg Foundation, which promotes thorium-fuelled nuclear power. She added: \"However, many of the advantages of thorium fuel are best realised with totally new reactor designs such as the molten salt reactor developed Alvin Weinberg in the 60s. I hope India will also commit to exploring this option.\" India has the world's largest thorium deposits and with a world hungry for low-carbon energy, it has its eyes on a potentially lucrative export market for the technology. For more than three decades, India's nuclear research programme had been subject to international sanctions since its controversial 1974 nuclear tests. But after losing its pariah status three years ago as a result of the Indo-US nuclear deal, India is keen to export indigenous nuclear technology developed in research centres such as the BARC. There are still restrictions though. One problem is the \"trigger fuel\" the reactor needs to initiate operation. In the original design, this is a small quantity of plutonium. Instead the new reactor's trigger will be low-enriched uranium (LEU) – which India is permitted to import under the 2008 Indo-US deal. \"The AHWR will eventually have design flexibility, using as fuel either plutonium-thorium or LEU-thorium combinations,\" said Sinha. \"The LEU-thorium version will make the AHWR very much marketable abroad, as it would generate very little plutonium ... making it suitable for countries with high proliferation resistance.\" The LEU-thorium design is currently at pilot stage. For the first time last year, the BARC tested the thorium-plutonium combination at its critical facility in Mumbai, but is still some way from doing the same for the thorium-LEU combination."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2012/nov/15/british-gas-profits-centrica-price-rises","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2012-11-15T08:37:20Z","webTitle":"Centrica expects British Gas profits to rise 6%","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/nov/15/british-gas-profits-centrica-price-rises","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2012/nov/15/british-gas-profits-centrica-price-rises","fields":{"headline":"Centrica expects British Gas profits to rise 6%","bodyText":"British Gas-owner Centrica said it is on track to make £1.4bn profits after tax this year, as its customers prepare for a 6% rise in their energy bills on Friday.

Its UK residential services business, which involves fixing people's boilers, is set to deliver double-digit profit growth. But Centrica said the gloomy economic climate meant customers were putting off getting new boilers, with installations down 16% in the first 10 months of the year.

Energy regulator Ofgem recently announced plans to force suppliers to inform householders about their cheapest deals and greatly simplify the number of pricing plans as part of what it is calling the biggest shakeup of the market for domestic energy for more than a decade. Centrica said the \"majority of these proposals are a positive step forward for the industry\" but added that \"it is important to ensure that the proposals on product range do not restrict customer choice and market innovation\". Elsewhere, the company said the weak economy had hit its UK business energy supply division. Centrica's two biggest businesses are the \"upstream\" unit – oil and gas production as well as eight power UK power stations – and the \"downstream\" operation that provides energy to homes and businesses, including British Gas. Upstream, Centrica said it has completed all three of the North sea acquisitions announced between November 2011 and February 2012, and its nuclear power stations continue to perform well. Overall, group profits after tax are expected to rise by 5% this year. The UK gas industry is in the middle of a firestorm, as the Financial Services Authority investigates claims by a whistleblower that the £300bn wholesale gas market has been \"regularly\" manipulated by some of the big power companies. Centrica said in a statement this week that it had \"very robust\" governance and compliance policies, which regulated its market participation and behaviour."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2013/feb/25/south-korea-park-geun-hye","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2013-02-25T16:05:59Z","webTitle":"South Korea's Park Geun-hye issues warning to North in inaugural address","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/25/south-korea-park-geun-hye","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/feb/25/south-korea-park-geun-hye","fields":{"headline":"South Korea's Park Geun-hye issues warning to North in inaugural address","bodyText":"Psy performed a family-friendly version of Gangnam Style, and many in the crowd of 70,000 who had braved a bitterly cold day in Seoul obligingly danced along. Then Park Geun-hye took to the podium for her first official pronouncement as South Korea's new president and addressed the deadly serious threat posed by an uncomfortably close nuclear foe. More than three decades after her father occupied the presidential Blue House as a military dictator, Park used her inaugural address to return to familiar themes: the economy and relations with North Korea. She called on Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear weapons programme. \"North Korea's recent nuclear test is a challenge to the survival and future of the Korean people,\" Park said outside the national assembly building in the South Korean capital. \"Make no mistake, the biggest victim will be North Korea itself.\" Park, 61, was elected on 19 December as South Korea's first female president. Her biggest foreign policy challenge will be to end five years of deteriorating ties with the North under her predecessor and fellow conservative, Lee Myung-bak, and persuade it to return to negotiations. She indicated that she could adopt a softer stance if the North, under its young leader, Kim Jong-un, was willing to make concessions. \"I will not tolerate any action that threatens the lives of our people and the security of our nation,\" she said. \"I urge North Korea to abandon its nuclear ambitions without delay and embark on the path to peace and shared development.\" At home Park has promised sweeping economic reforms to bridge the growing income gap and address youth unemployment and a stagnant economy. She promised to create jobs and build a \"creative\" economy less dependent on the country's dominant chaebol conglomerates. She called on South Koreans to help her repeat the so-called miracle on the Han river, a reference to the rapid economic development under her father, Park Chung-hee, who ruled the country in the 1960s and 70s before he was assassinated by his own spy chief in 1979. Five years earlier his wife, Yuk Young-soo, was shot dead by a North Korean agent, forcing his then 22-year-old daughter to return early from her studies in Paris to act as first lady. His reign continues to divide South Koreans: some credit him with dragging the country out of poverty after the 1950-53 Korean war and laying the foundations for its modern-day status as an export powerhouse; others have never forgotten his brutal suppression of political opponents during 18 years of rule that began with a military coup in 1961. Despite her conservative pedigree, Park Geun-hye has made conciliatory gestures towards the North in the past. In 2002 she met the regime's former leader Kim Jong-il in Pyongyang, and she later noted in her autobiography that he had apologised for a failed raid on the Blue House by 31 North Korean commandos in 1968. North Korean state media marked her inauguration with a warning to the US and the South not to proceed with forthcoming joint military drills. \"The US warmongers should think what consequence will be brought out for getting on the nerves of [North Korea], a dignified nuclear power,\" the Rodong Sinmun newspaper said in a commentary. John Delury, a North Korea experts at Yonsei University, Seoul, said a new era of engagement could be possible despite Pyongyang's nuclear programme and tougher UN security council sanctions. \"I don't think this latest spike in the cycle of provocation and response undermines her whole platform of seeking to somehow re-engage the North,\" he said. But others believe the North has set itself on a path to diplomatic gridlock and more regional tension. \"Normalisation of relations, a peace treaty, access to energy and economic opportunities; those things that come from choosing electricity over bombs and have the potential of lifting the North Korean people out of poverty and hardship will be made much more difficult, if not impossible, for at least the next five years,\" said Siegfried Hecker, a US scientist and regular visitor to North Korea."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2012/oct/01/gunter-grass-poem-praises-mordechai-vanunu","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2012-10-01T13:17:16Z","webTitle":"Günter Grass poem praises nuclear whistleblower Mordechai Vanunu","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/oct/01/gunter-grass-poem-praises-mordechai-vanunu","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2012/oct/01/gunter-grass-poem-praises-mordechai-vanunu","fields":{"headline":"Günter Grass poem praises nuclear whistleblower Mordechai Vanunu","bodyText":"Germany's Nobel literature laureate Günter Grass, who earlier this year was barred from Israel for criticising its nuclear policy, has written a poem praising the nuclear whistleblower Mordechai Vanunu. Vanunu, a former technician at Israel's secret nuclear plant near Dimona, spent 18 years in prison – much of it in solitary confinement – after leaking details of the country's nuclear programme to the Sunday Times in 1986. Grass's new collection of poetry, Eintagsfliegen, published in Germany last week, describes Vanunu as a \"role model and hero of our time\" who \"hoped to serve his country by helping to bring the truth to light\", and calls on Israelis to \"recognise ... as righteous\" the man \"who remained loyal to his country all those years\", according to German reports. In April this year, Grass angered Israel with a poem in which he wrote that \"Israel's nuclear power is endangering / Our already fragile world peace\". He later clarified this, saying that he actually intended to criticise Israel's current government, but the damage was done, with Israel declaring the Nobel laureate persona non grata for his \"attempt to fan the flames of hatred against the state of Israel and its people, and thus to advance the idea to which he publicly affiliated in his past donning of the SS uniform\". Grass, who won the Nobel in 1999, served as a teenager in the Waffen SS during the second world war, a fact he revealed in 2006. Speaking about Grass's new collection, Israel's foreign ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor told German broadcaster Deutsche Welle that \"it is refreshing to note, given Grass's past positions, that there is at least one Israeli who finds grace in his eyes\"."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"technology/appsblog/2013/aug/09/best-iphone-ipad-apps-disney-animated","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2013-08-09T16:20:18Z","webTitle":"20 best iPhone and iPad apps this week","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/appsblog/2013/aug/09/best-iphone-ipad-apps-disney-animated","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/appsblog/2013/aug/09/best-iphone-ipad-apps-disney-animated","fields":{"headline":"20 best iPhone and iPad apps this week","bodyText":"It's time for our weekly roundup of brand new and notable apps for iPhone, iPod touch and iPad devices. It covers apps and games, with the prices referring to the initial download: so (Free) may mean (Freemium) in some cases. There's a separate roundup for Android apps, which was published earlier in the day. For now, read on for this week's iOS selection (and when you've finished, check out previous Best iPhone and iPad apps posts). Disney Animated (£9.99) An enormous treat for Disney fans, this. It's an app covering the animation in all 53 of the studio's movies, starting in 1937 with Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. The app digs deep into concept art, painted backgrounds, storyboards and the transition from hand-drawn to computer-animated scenes, including the chance to animate Wreck-It Ralph's Vanellope yourself. There's also a timeline of every film, plus a \"Color Map\" containing every scene from every movie in thumbnail form. iPad Tube Map Live (Free) There are a fair few London tube-map apps drawing on data from Transport for London, but this one's special. It shows trains making their way around the capital's underground network in real-time (or, at least, as near real-time as the data allows. Useful, but strangely hypnotic too. iPhone / iPad Glow - Conceive With Confidence (Free) This app could be invaluable for anyone trying to conceive: a fertility app with advice and reminders, a calendar tracking the best times to hit the sack, and the ability for both partners in a relationship to enter data from their iPhones. Future updates promise charts, the ability to download and print your data, and communication features between partners. iPhone Radio Alan: The Alan Partridge Player (£0.69) Launching alongside the Alpha Papa film, this app is for playing your own iTunes library, with Alan Partridge providing between-song patter. It's tailored for some artists (\"Keep your clubs away from his young, it's Seal\"), recognising their tracks if they're stored on your phone, and recommending them on the iTunes store if not. The clips come from web-series Mid Morning Matters, with the promise of more material to come. iPhone / iPad Fetch - A Boy and his Dog (Free) Publisher Big Fish Games releases a lot of games, but this one has been generating much more interest than usual among iOS gamers already. It's a beautifully-crafted adventure following a boy's quest to rescue his dog. The game is free to try, with a £1.99 in-app purchase unlocking the full thing. iPhone / iPad Mister Maker – Let's Make It! (£2.99) He's hugely popular on CBeebies (and elsewhere in the world), but now Mister Maker has an official app. It's based on the craft-focused children's TV show, getting kids to create their own digital artworks, complete Minute Make challenges inspired by the show, and share the results with proud family members. iPhone / iPad Worms 3 (£2.99) 17 years ago, I was regularly playing Worms on a PC at 3am with fellow students at university. In 2013, I'm playing Worms 3 on an iPad at a more sensible hour of the day. That's progress for you. This is an all-new game for iOS, with turn-based online multiplayer, a decent single-player campaign, and a clever card mode and class system adding strategic depth. New to Worms? It's worms blowing one another to smithereens, is all you need to know. iPhone / iPad Google AdSense (Free) If you use Google's AdSense advertising network, this is an invaluable app, tracking your key stats on the go including earnings, top custom and URL channels, payment alerts and ad units / site reports. iPhone Wuaki.tv (Free) Wuaki is a streaming TV and films service that's aiming to provide Netflix and LoveFilm with some competition in the UK. Owned by online shopping giant Rakuten, it offers a mixture of purchasing, renting and subscribing to get access to its catalogue of video: the idea being that if shows or movies aren't available as part of the subscription, users can buy or rent them from the same service, rather than having to go elsewhere. iPad MixBit (Free) MixBit is the latest video-sharing app that wants a piece of Vine, and it's the work of a company set up by YouTube co-founders Chad Hurley and Steve Chen, who are hoping to get people creating videos together rather than alone. You shoot clips between one second and one hour long, then edit them together before sharing through social networks, or on MixBit itself. iPhone Breast Self Examination Guide (Free) Coventry University's new app is a mobile guide to Breast Self-Examination (you may have guessed this from the title, of course), helping women examine their breasts for lumps that may be cancerous, discovering them in time to seek a medical opinion early. The University worked with the NHS on the app. iPhone / iPad The Economist Anthology Series: Innovation (£1.99) This latest app from the Economist collects together articles, videos and interactive elements from its technology coverage, including future cars, nuclear power and the frontiers of computing. A good way to quickly dive in to some of the magazine's latest deep-thinking. iPad Amateur Surgeon 3 (Free) Adult Swim certainly knows how to grab people's attention on the App Store. \"Have you ever wanted to operate on a mutant bear with a chainsaw?\" asks this game's listing, albeit in shouty capitals. It's a gruesomely comical surgeon sim that sees you slicing up an array of characters with \"inappropriate tools\". In-app purchases aim to help reduce the death count. iPhone / iPad Shutterfly Photo Story (Free) This iPad app belongs to US photo-printing service Shutterfly, although it's available here in the UK too. It's a way to create a photo book on the device, then order a physical version or share it digitally. Photos can be pulled in from social networks Facebook and Instagram as well as Apple's Photo Stream feature, with the printed books starting at $19.99. iPad Timeline American Civil War (£3.99) Publisher Ballista Media's historical apps with Dan Snow in the UK have been really impressive, but now they're expanding to the US with this American Civil War app. Built around a timeline of the war, it includes maps, photos, text and commentary from various experts on the period, with recordings and sheet music for contemporary songs adding atmosphere. iPad Jim Henson's Chatter Zoo (£1.49) Don't recognise the TV show? That's because there IS no TV show for this, yet. It's the first time the Jim Henson Company has debuted new characters in an app before other media, working with UK startup Mindshapes. The app is aimed at 2-4 year-olds, with four baby animals to play with and care for, plus stories. iPhone / iPad Mikey Hooks (£1.49) Bags of character in this sideways-scrolling action game from developer BeaverTap Games, which sees you running, jumping and hooking your way through 36 levels. It's beautifully put together: comparisons to vintage Mario Bros from happy early-reviewers aren't wide of the mark. iPhone / iPad AGOGO (Free) It's early days for AGOGO, but it's an interesting idea: bringing together music, podcasts, audiobooks and radio-style news and traffic reports, and recommending you different content types depending what you're listening to at the time (for example, artists who are featured in the podcast you're listening to). It's US-centric, although the music – provided via Rdio or Spotify – is global. iPhone PixieDust (Free) Children's drawing apps are ten-a-penny, but few of them are genuinely good. This one is: an app for kids to scribble with digital pencils, crayons and paintbrushes, while customising their creations with virtual stamps and textures. Everything can be saved and shared, with different themes available for parents to buy via in-app purchase. iPad Champ Man (Free) Before I was a Worms-addicted student, I had a pretty serious Championship Manager habit, although as its developers shifted to the Football Manager franchise, I was one of the fans that went with them. Can Champ Man win some of us back in 2013 with a new free-to-play incarnation on iOS? It looks well worth a try, with 21 playable leagues and accurate data for the new season. With Football Manager Handheld also very impressive, the rivalry goes on. iPhone / iPad That's this week's selection, but what do you think?

President Dmitry Medvedev announced the move at the end of a two-day visit to Moscow by Venezuela's president, Hugo Chávez. The Venezuelan economy is overwhelmingly reliant on oil and Chávez has said he wants nuclear power to diversify energy supply. Medvedev has implicitly acknowledged the deal is likely to be unpopular with the US but defended Venezuela's right to seek access to peaceful nuclear technology. The station is likely to be built over the next 10-15 years. Its cost has not yet been revealed. \"An agreement has just been signed on co-operation in the atomic sphere. I don't know who will shudder at this,\" Medvedev told a press conference after his talks with Chávez. \"The president [of Venezuela] said there will be countries in which this will provoke different emotions. But I want to say specially that our intentions are absolutely pure and open.\" Russia wanted Venezuela to have a \"full range of energy choices\". Chávez's visit is his ninth to Moscow and the first stop on a 12-day European tour that includes visits to Belarus and, for the first time, Ukraine – now once again within Moscow's sphere of influence. On previous occasions, Chávez has bought billions of dollars worth of military hardware from Russia including submarines, helicopters and attack aircraft. Both leaders have reaffirmed their plans to continue military-technical co-operation. Viktor Semyonov, an economist at Moscow's Institute of Latin American Studies, said it was logical for Venezuela to seek civilian nuclear technology since its economy was even more dependent on oil than Russia's. Russia was already building a nuclear power station in Iran and holding talks with other Latin American countries, including Brazil and Argentina. \"We are a country that exports nuclear technology around the world. Venezuela's economy is 94 or even 95% made up of oil. Russia's is 65%, which is already a lot. They (the Venezuelans) want to widen their sources of energy so they are less dependent on it,\" Semyonov said. Speaking in Moscow on Thursday night, Chávez offered assurances that Venezuela had no interest in building a nuclear weapon and only wanted peaceful nuclear technology. He described the collapse of the Soviet Union as a \"catastrophe\" and launched a familiar attack on the United States, denigrating it as a \"Yankee empire\". Chávez went for a spin in a Lada car, causing miles of gridlock on Moscow's traffic-clogged streets. Before heading to the airport Chávez handed Medevedev several gifts. They included three bars of chocolate, banana jam and a tin of cocoa."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/jun/12/uk-nuclear-power-david-cameron","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-06-12T16:10:20Z","webTitle":"UK nuclear plans 'need saving by David Cameron and Francois Hollande'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jun/12/uk-nuclear-power-david-cameron","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/jun/12/uk-nuclear-power-david-cameron","fields":{"headline":"UK nuclear plans 'need saving by David Cameron and Francois Hollande'","bodyText":"The prime minister must step in urgently to rescue the UK's nuclear power programme, or risk it failing, a senior Tory has warned after French nuclear company EDF gave a downbeat report on the prospects for a new fleet of reactors in the UK. Chairman of the influential energy and climate change committee and former Tory cabinet minister Tim Yeo said that Cameron must speak to his French counterpart, Francois Hollande, in order to decide what conditions are necessary for the state-owned French utility to fulfil its planned investment. \"This is something that can only be done by the heads of government of Britain and France,\" he told the Guardian. \"There may need to be special arrangements for nuclear [separate from the regulation and subsidy of other forms of power]. Given the size of this investment – billions and billions, with a return on investment coming well into the 2020s – this has to involve the heads of government.\" Yeo was speaking after the committee's MPs questioned EDF Energy chief executive Vincent de Rivaz and several other energy company senior directors. De Rivaz was \"very downbeat\" on the prospects for new nuclear power stations, said Yeo. \"It is a worry for the government that EDF is so downbeat. They are the only horse left in this race and if they falter it might mean the end of the whole [nuclear] programme. The government has got to pay a lot of attention to what EDF is saying,\" he said. De Rivaz told the committee that the company's first planned investment, at Hinkley, was subject to the government putting a framework in place on time. He said: \"I think it's very clear that we will not be able to make our final investment decision, as we expect to make it at the end of the year without a contract for difference, and without a robust legal framework for this contract.\" Contracts for difference are the key plank of the government's plans for electricity market reform. Under the contracts, low-carbon power generators – nuclear and renewable energy – would receive guarantees that the long-term price for their electricity was likely to be higher than the price they could get on the open market. That is supposed to encourage investment, by giving long-term price certainty. However, many of the details – including how the pricing structure will work – have yet to be determined. This may mean a delay, because full details of how the reforms will work will not be in place by the end of this year, the Department of Energy and Climate Change has said. De Rivaz also said the proposed new reactor would need planning permission and consent for the design of the reactors. He said: \"We take our own multibillion-pound final investment decision for our new nuclear project at the end of this year. Ahead of then, we have three clear, concrete priorities for this bill. Firstly, it must move to a 'tangible counterparty' contractual model, which is clearly understood and precedented. Secondly, it must ensure that an early contract for difference, which will be delivered through transitional arrangements, is legally robust for the long-term. And thirdly, we must work to ensure the government keeps to its original timetable of spring next year for royal assent.\" The planned reforms, laid out in the government's recent paper, have come under fire from some energy companies as a veiled subsidy for nuclear power. But De Rivaz said they were needed in order to ensure the long-term certainty over policy that would be needed to make the large investments in nuclear power worthwhile. EDF is now in pole position to influence the government's energy policy, as it is the only remaining major player still showing a strong interest. Yeo's call came as the head of one of the UK's biggest investors in renewable energy, Scottish Power, warned that the UK was increasingly being seen as a risky place to invest in wind power, because of government meddling with established subsidy programmes. He said the problem could result in higher prices for wind projects, putting off investors and imperilling the UK's climate change targets. Keith Anderson, chief corporate officer at Scottish Power, said: \"The current delay in finalising this agreement is resulting in a number of very unhelpful rumours and speculation about last-minute political intervention potentially leading to this evidence based outcome being overridden. \"If correct, this could set an unwelcoming precedent for the UK energy sector and potentially have an adverse effect on investor confidence at a critical time for the UK energy industry. Up until now, we have prided ourselves [in] not having to factor in political risk to our UK investment decisions, but perhaps it is something we may need to consider in the future as we seek to invest billions of pounds in offshore, onshore and marine renewable energy projects. We want to help the UK achieve its carbon reduction targets, and to do this we need certainty and consistency in energy market regulation.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2013/oct/02/peter-higgs-profile-physicist","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-02T20:00:29Z","webTitle":"Peter Higgs profile: the self-deprecating physicist revered by his peers | Ian Sample","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/oct/02/peter-higgs-profile-physicist","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2013/oct/02/peter-higgs-profile-physicist","fields":{"headline":"Peter Higgs profile: the self-deprecating physicist revered by his peers","bodyText":"For scientists of a certain calibre, these early days of October can bring on a bad case of the jitters. The nominations are in. The reports compiled. All that remains is for the Nobel committees to cast their final votes. There are no sure bets on who will win the most prestigious prize in science this year, but there are expectations aplenty. Speak to particle physicists, for example, and one name comes up more than any other. Top of their wishlist of winners – the awards are announced next Tuesday – is the self-deprecating British octagenarian, Peter Higgs. Higgs, 84, is no household name, but he is closer to being one than any Nobel physics laureate since Richard Feynman, the Manhattan project scientist, who accepted the award reluctantly in 1964. But while Feynman was a showman who adored attention, Higgs is happy when eclipsed by the particle that bears his name, the elusive boson that scientists at Cern's Large Hadron Collider triumphantly discovered last year. \"He's modest and actually almost to a fault,\" said Alan Walker, a fellow physicist at Edinburgh University, who sat next to Higgs at Cern when scientists revealed they had found the particle. \"You meet many physicists who will tell you how good they are. Peter doesn't do that.\" Higgs, now professor emeritus at Edinburgh, made his breakthrough the same year Feynman won the Nobel. It was an era when the tools of the trade were pencil and paper. He outlined what came to be known as the Higgs mechanism, an explanation for how elementary particles, which make up all that is around us, gained their masses in the earliest moments after the big bang. Before 1964, the question of why the simplest particles weighed anything at all was met with an embarrassed but honest shrug. Higgs plays down his role in developing the idea, but there is no dismissing the importance of the theory itself. \"He didn't produce a great deal, but what he did produce is actually quite profound and is one of the keystones of what we now understand as the fundamental building blocks of nature,\" Walker said. Higgs was born in Newcastle in 1929. His father, a BBC sound engineer, brought the family south to Birmingham and then onwards to Bristol. There, Higgs enrolled at what is now Cotham School. He got off to a bad start. One of the first things he did was tumble into a crater left by a second world war bomb in the playground and fracture his left arm. But he was a brilliant student. He won prizes in a haul of subjects – although not, as it happens, in physics. To the teenage Higgs, physics lacked excitement. The best teachers were off at war, and that no doubt contributed to his attitude. It changed through a chance encounter. While standing around at the back of morning assembly Higgs noticed a name that appeared more than once on the school's honours board. Higgs wondered who PAM Dirac was and read up on the former pupil. He learned that Paul Dirac was a founding father of quantum theory, and the closest Britain had to an Einstein. Through Dirac, Higgs came to relish the arcane world of theoretical physics. Higgs found that he was not cut out for experiments, a fact driven home by a series of sometimes dramatic mishaps, but at university he proved himself a formidable theorist. He was the first to sit a six-hour theory exam at Kings College London, and for the want of a better idea, his tutors posed him a question that had recently been solved in a leading physics journal. \"Peter sailed ahead, took it seriously, thought about it, and in that six-hour time scale had managed to solve it, had written it up and presented it,\" said Michael Fisher, a friend from Kings. But getting the right answer was only the start. \"In the long run it turned out, when it was actually graded, that Peter had done a better paper than the original they took from the literature.\" Higgs's great discovery came at Edinburgh University, where he was considered an outsider for plugging away at ideas that many physicists had abandoned. But his doggedness paid off. At the time an argument was raging in the field over a way that particles might gain their masses. The theory in question was clearly wrong, but Higgs saw why and how to fix it. He published a short note in September 1964 and swiftly wrote a more expansive follow-up paper. To his dismay the article was rejected, ironically by an editor at Cern. Indignant at the decision, Higgs added two paragraphs to the paper and published it in a rival US journal instead. In the penultimate sentence was the first mention of what became known as the Higgs boson. At first, there was plenty of resistance to Higgs's theory. Before giving a talk at Harvard in 1966, a senior physicist, the late Sidney Coleman, told his class some idiot was coming to see them. \"And you're going to tear him to shreds.\" Higgs stuck to his guns. Eventually he won them over. Ken Peach, an Oxford physics professor who worked with Higgs in Edinburgh, said the determination was classic Peter: \"There is an inner toughness, some steely resolve, which is not quite immediately apparent,\" he said. It was on display again when Stephen Hawking suggested the Higgs boson would never be found. Higgs hit back, saying that Hawking's celebrity status meant he got away with pronouncements that others would not. Higgs was at one time deeply involved in the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, but left when the organisation extended its protests to nuclear power. He felt CND had confused controlled and uncontrolled release of nuclear energy. He also joined Greenpeace but quit that organisation, too, when he felt its ideologies had started to trump its science. \"The one thing you get from Peter is that he is his own person,\" said Walker. Higgs was not the only scientist to come up with the theory of particle masses in 1964. François Englert and Robert Brout at the Free University in Brussels beat him into print by two weeks, but failed to mention the crucial new particle that scientists would need to prove the theory right. Three others, Gerry Guralnik, , Dick Hagen and Tom Kibble, had worked out the theory too, and published a month later. Higgs is not comfortable taking all the credit for the work, and goes to great pains to list all the others whose work he built on. But in the community he is revered. When Higgs walked into the Cern auditorium last year to hear scientists tell the world about the discovery, he was welcomed with a standing ovation. He nodded off during the talks, but was awake at the end, when the crowd erupted as the significance of the achievement became clear. At that moment, he was caught on camera reaching for a handkerchief and dabbing his eyes. \"He was tearful,\" said Walker. \"He was really deeply moved. I think he was absolutely surprised by the atmosphere of the room.\" Higgs did not hang around at Cern to celebrate with the others. He left as soon as he could, to catch an easyJet flight home with Walker. On board, Walker suggested a toast with a glass of prosecco, but Higgs turned the offer down, and opted instead for a can of London Pride. Cern later asked for the can, now deemed a piece of history, but Higgs had dumped it in the rubbish. John Ellis, a particle theorist at Cern and Kings College London, said many in the high energy physics community think Higgs, and some others, will win the Nobel prize this year. But he says it is no done deal. \"There are certainly worthy recipients in other areas of physics, and I could imagine scientific and political roadblocks to an award to Higgs,\" he said. Nobel prizes can be shared by at most three people, but at least five lay claim to the theory (Brout died in 2011). The Cern teams that found the particle deserve credit too, but there are 6,000 of them. And then there are the people who built and run the Large Hadron Collider, the most sophisticated machine in the world. Anders Bárány, a former secretary of the Nobel physics committee, is not convinced this will be Higgs's year. \"Regarding the Higgs particle, it is quite seldom that a discovery is awarded already the year after, even though this what [Nobel's] will states,\" he said. There is one safe bet though. Whatever the Nobel committee decides, they will not make everyone happy. \"This is physics that has been in gestation for 50 years,\" said Peach. \"If they don't give it to Peter and some others it will be a scandal.\" Potted profile Born 29 May 1929 Career Higgs worked in theoretical physics from the 1950s until he retired in 1996 from Edinburgh University. His major contribution came in 1964 when he showed how simple particles gained mass in the first moments after the big bang. The theory came with a signature particle, the Higgs boson. High point Moved to tears in the audience at Cern last year when scientists working on the Large Hadron Collider declared they had finally discovered the Higgs boson that proved his theory right – after nearly 50 years. Low point Higgs separated from his wife Jody some years after the birth of their second child. Higgs blamed his obsession with work.

However, as the treasurer of a smallish athletic club, I would take issue with some of the statements attributed to Chris Jones, the chief executive of England Athletics. The problem of underfunding that he identifies is not as serious for the clubs (they are run largely by volunteers) as for the councils who provide the facilities on which the clubs depend. I foresee a wave of track closures as councils run out of the money needed to maintain them. The article gives England Athletics a platform to trumpet how much it is doing for clubs. This gives the impression that they are part of the solution rather than part of the problem. This is an organisation that has foisted a registration scheme on the sport that is both impractical and unnecessary while expecting volunteers in the clubs to spend hours administering it. If England Athletics were bold enough to give the clubs, who form the bedrock of the sport, any sort of say in how athletics is run, I would expect Mr Jones and many of his colleagues finding themselves looking for new jobs.

This would affect the people in Lydd and the character of the marsh but also the Kent Downs and potentially the High Weald nearby, both nationally important areas of outstanding natural beauty. The whole area offers quiet enjoyment and escape for hundreds of thousands if not millions. This brings jobs and prosperity too.

Graeme Willis Campaign to Protect Rural England London SE1 Protect nursing levels in law I would like to ask readers their views on protecting health staffing levels in law so that understaffing cannot be used as an excuse for poor practice. My mother-in-law was recently on a ward at Reading hospital with 40 very sick, elderly patients, many with dementia, with only one nurse and two assistants to care for them. How can nurses have any chance of offering excellent care with such a low staffing levels? As a community nurse working for the NHS I have been very upset with all the bad press nurses have received. My team work very long days well beyond our contracted hours, every week. I believe that the district nurses in Newbury offer an excellent service with very limited resources, mainly because of the goodwill of staff working many hours for free. Should each area of the NHS have minimum staffing levels set down in law to protect patient care? Each area could be assessed with elderly care and dementia wards given a much higher nurse to patient ratio. Helen Forsey Community nurse Newbury Berkshire A budget for the well-off The budget appears to be calculated to benefit the well-off. (\"We're not all in this together. Ask the poor\", editorial). The £15bn housing package may create a temporary fillip in the housing market but will it actually provide the much-needed help to struggling first-time buyers? Then, there is the plan to tackle the high costs of childcare. Who will this benefit the most? Only those families in which both parents are working and paying income tax. Few poor Britons and their children will qualify. Families earning high salaries do not require assistance; low- to middle-income families, single-parent families, families with special needs children, and families where the mother or father has decided to stay at home to care for the children, these are the cash-starved families upon whom Mr Osborne should have looked considerately.

As east Asia's leading nations talk tensely of war and peace, Abe's critics say it is his brand of unrepentant, rightwing nationalism that has helped push the region to the brink. His supporters say Abe is rightly, finally standing up for Japan. How Abe might react if China's unilaterally imposed \"air defence zone\" over the Senkaku islands in the East China Sea triggers armed clashes is a serious international concern. The US is pledged to come to Japan's aid should it be attacked, while hardliners in China's military leadership would welcome a fight over what they call \"core interests\". There is potential for a head-on superpower collision. Since taking office as prime minister for the second time a year ago, stocky, tousle-haired Abe, 59, has avoided hotheaded actions and kept his political powder dry. But he is no patsy, either. Nobody knows for sure which way he may jump, if push comes to shove. \"Abe is very rightwing by traditional measures,\" said Akio Takahara, professor of international relations and law at Tokyo University, which makes him a potentially dangerous figure. \"He is a historical revisionist at heart … He is a nationalist [pursuing] his 'new nationalism'.\" In this sense, Takahara suggested, Abe was a throwback to Japan's past, and thus an obstacle to the sort of calm dialogue needed in dealing with China. Not so, said Yoshiji Nogami, a former Japanese ambassador to Britain who has known Abe personally for many years. \"He is, first and foremost, a politician and a politician's instinct is to survive. As his first premiership ended in such a disastrous way, he is determined to stay this time. \"In order to stay in power for a long period of time, I believe he can be flexible. He is not an ideologue. He is certainly a conservative, a nationalist and right of centre, but he is not an ideological rightwinger,\" Nogami said. The research director of a leading Tokyo thinktank offered a third perspective: \"I would call him one of a new kind of very conservative, patriotic politicians who are not always happy with postwar Japan's traditional, leftwing internationalists and their strong tendency towards irresponsible pacifism.\" In short, he said, Abe was saying it was time for Japan to stand up for itself, that it was \"OK to be proud\" again. Dangerous militarist or modernising reformer, Abe's career has rarely lacked controversy. Born in September 1954 to an affluent and influential family, he became Japan's youngest-ever prime minister in 2006 and the first to be born after the end of the second world war. Abe's late father, Shintaro Abe, was foreign minister and his grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi, served as prime minister in the 1950s. Kishi was also a cabinet member during the war and was once suspected of war crimes by the allied forces. The case was thrown out. Elected to parliament in 1993, Abe was later selected to work for the popular prime minister Junichiro Koizumi. He gained public notice by taking a tough stance on North Korean abductions of Japanese citizens and took a big political risk when he travelled to meet the North Korean dictator Kim Jong-il in 2002. Abe's old-fashioned, some would say regressive, views on social issues began to take shape when he helped sponsor an education bill initially entitled Love for One's Country. He became deeply involved in the incendiary issue of how Japanese school textbooks talk about recent history, favouring a more benign, sanitised view of imperial Japan's past actions. In 2006 he published what became a patriotic bestseller, Towards a Beautiful Country, which was viewed as his personal testament. Abe argued that \"class-A\" war criminals charged by the Tokyo tribunal after the 1945 capitulation were not criminals under domestic law. From early on, Abe the alpha-male traditionalist appears to have had a woman problem. He frequently became embroiled in rows about the so-called wartime Korean comfort women, who were prostituted by Japanese troops, claiming at one point that coercion was not involved. His remarks caused outrage in South Korea and elsewhere. \"He's passionate about Japanese victims of North Korea – and blind to Japan's own war crimes,\" complained the Washington Post in a 2007 editorial. In October last year Abe courted more region-wide controversy by visiting the Yasukuni shrine in Tokyo, which commemorates Japan's war dead (including some convicted war criminals). He has not visited again since taking office, but has suggested he would like to do so. His continuing interest in reinterpreting article 9 of Japan's pacifist constitution, to allow the country to develop its military might unchecked, is seen as similarly inflammatory by the Chinese and Koreans, and further proof of his revisionist views. So, too, is his creation of a Restoration of Sovereignty Day, an annual event to mark the end of the American occupation. Abe would doubtless like to suggest that, like Japan, he has changed as time has passed. His first term, 2006-7, was marred by Liberal Democratic party scandals, including a ministerial suicide, leading to his forced resignation on health grounds. This time around, he has eschewed social policy controversies and moved cannily to broaden his base support while pursuing a radical economic plan and an ambitious foreign policy agenda. At home, his main focus is on economic recovery upon which, he argues, the success of Japan's other aspirations depend. Labelled \"Abenomics\", his approach comprises the three arrows: monetary easing, fiscal stimulus, and structural reform. In the short term, at least, the policy has boosted economic activity and GDP growth and produced a big lift in the financial markets, enabling Abe to declare in Washington: \"Japan is back.\" The yen is down, inflation is up, and share prices have risen by roughly two-thirds. Growth of 4% in the first half of 2013 easily out-distanced other G7 economies. Predictably, economists in recession-hit Europe and the US have suggested they follow Japan's example. A little modesty might be in order, Nogami said. \"Abe will face a series of difficult issues in coming months, including the negative impact of the planned consumption tax increase and the failure of what we are calling the 'spring offensive' to raise wages … \"Third, there are the nuclear power plants. \"Next July some of the plants are due to restart. There is a strong anti-nuclear sentiment in Japan [following the 2011 Fukushima disaster] but in view of the overall energy mix, those plants are needed. How he can manage this divisive issue definitely affects his tenure.\" For the time being, Abe looks secure. Twelve months in, with the economy improving and his LDP in firm control of both houses of parliament, he remains unusually popular in a country where prime ministers have come and gone with startling rapidity in recent years. \"An opinion poll taken on 3-4 November showed Shinzo's approval rating at 68.5% with very few negative views on his personality. The silent majority's support for Shinzo is still there and it's real,\" the Tokyo research analyst said. Abe's initial success in boosting Japan's economic fortunes after decades in the doldrums, and the enormous damage caused by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, has proven a necessary precondition for advancing his autonomous global agenda. It also underpins his ambition to strengthen political, military and economic alliances with south-east Asia, Australia and India while reinforcing treaty ties with Washington. In a speech to the UN general assembly in September, Abe vowed to make a revitalised Japan \"a force for peace and stability\" in the world, while putting China on notice that coercion would not work. China's threats over the Senkakus, its leadership's continued snubbing of Abe and Beijing's longstanding tendency to whip up anti-Japanese, nationalist sentiment to distract attention from domestic problems had served Abe well, in terms of propelling him into power and keeping him there, analysts and officials said. Abe has also skilfully exploited the China problem to woo less-powerful neighbours. Since taking office Abe has visited all 10 members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean), an unprecedented piece of outreach by a Japanese leader. Last weekend he hosted an Asean summit in Tokyo marking 40 years of diplomatic ties. In a classic soft-power exercise that totally outflanked Beijing, Abe ordered the biggest overseas deployment of Japanese armed forces since 1945, backed by generous donations, to assist the Philippines after last month's super-typhoon disaster. He scored another, personal triumph when he flew to Buenos Aires in September and, Blair-like, helped to secure the 2020 Olympic Games for Tokyo. Abe's expansive agenda, part of his attempt to reassert Japan's leading role in the world, includes strong emphasis on supporting women's rights – an apparent attempt to fix his \"woman problem\". About 40% of his UN speech was devoted to the subject. He wanted to produce a \"society in which women shine\" in Japan, he said. \"Japan respects the activities of UN Women and intends to become one of its leading contributors and thus an exemplary country,\" he said. Scarred by his first experience as prime minister, Abe seems determined to stick to a cautious line, avoid repeating past mistakes and stay the course to 2015. Economic recovery remains his top priority. But for a man of strong and passionate views, this restraint seems unnatural and may not be sustainable. International tensions may yet stir his blood and force his hand. Just how long he can – and wants to – keep a lid on the confrontation with Beijing, as China inexorably ups the ante, is east Asia's big unanswered question of 2014. Potted profile Born: 21 September 1954 (age 59), Nagato, Yamaguchi prefecture, Japan. He later moved to Tokyo. Education: Seikei elementary school and Seikei high school, Tokyo. He studied political science at Seikei University, graduating in 1977and later at the University of Southern California's school of public policy, Los Angeles. Career: Abe began work for Kobe Steel in 1979. In 1982, he left Kobe and held a succession of government positions, including executive assistant to the foreign minister, Shintaro Abe, his father. He moved from there to work for the ruling Liberal Democratic party, and subsequently for the LDP prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi. In 1993, he was elected as an MP for the Yamaguchi prefecture. In 1999, he became director of the social affairs division and deputy chief cabinet secretary in the Yoshiro Mori and Junichiro Koizumi cabinets from 2000 to 2003. In 2002, as chief government negotiator on the issue of Japanese citizens abducted by North Korea, he accompanied Koizumi on a surprise visit to meet the late North Korean dictator Kim Jong-il in Pyongyang. In 2003, Abe was appointed secretary general of the Liberal Democratic party. In 2006, Koizumi was forced to stand down (due to term limits) and was succeeded as prime minister and LDP leader by Abe. In 2007, after a series of scandals, the LDP lost its majority in the upper house, and Abe announced that he was resigning on grounds of ill health. In 2012, apparently fully recovered, he was re-elected LDP leader. Later that year, he was elected prime minister for a second time.

As figures showed the government was scaling down its expectations of new reactors being built, Todd Wright, the managing director of Sellafield, said the new posts would accelerate work on four reactors that were part of Calder Hall, claimed to be the first nuclear plant to produce electricity on a commercial scale. \"This new influx of staff will mean we are able to do more work, more quickly,\" he added. The energy minister, John Hayes, said the new jobs showed the immense contribution of the nuclear sector to the UK economy, in particular that of west Cumbria. He added: \"Just as atoms collide in a nuclear reactor, the economic benefits of our nuclear renaissance will reverberate far and wide across the country.\" The latest figures from the Department of Energy and Climate Change show the government now expects only 3.3 gigawatts of new nuclear plant to be built by 2025 and 9.9GW by 2030. This compares with 4.8GW by 2025 and 12GW by 2030 as recorded in its 2011 energy and emissions projections. The department is more optimistic about wind and solar, however, expecting 42GW of renewable power to be in place by 2030 compared with the 33GW projected in the 2011 statistical survey. Greenpeace nuclear campaigner Richard George said it was refreshing that DECC had finally admitted that new nuclear power stations would only ever be the \"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern\" of the UK's energy future. He added: \"Yet in the energy bill, ministers are still proposing to replace cost-effective support for renewables with complicated feed-in tariffs designed to cover up billions of pounds of public subsidy for new nuclear. The government needs to come clean, admit publicly that nuclear is not feasible, and rule out blank cheques for a technology that has no future.\" The optimism surrounding the extra jobs at Sellafield was tempered by scathing criticism in a recent report from the National Audit Office which showed the costs of decommissioning Sellafield had rocketed from £47bn in 2009 to a current estimate of £67bn. The NAO said \"significant uncertainties and scheduling risks remain\" over clean-up and it was to early to say whether the private firms were delivering value for money. Last week the Commons public accounts committee was highly critical of the spiralling project costs with one of its members – Austin Mitchell, Labour MP for Grimsby – saying Sellafield was a \"cross between science fiction and a nuclear slum, and its probably the biggest nuclear slum in Europe\"."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2013/may/03/imran-khan-pakistan-voters","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2013-05-03T20:07:46Z","webTitle":"Imran Khan reaches out to young voters with 'third-way' in Pakistan's general election","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/03/imran-khan-pakistan-voters","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/may/03/imran-khan-pakistan-voters","fields":{"headline":"Imran Khan reaches out to young voters with 'third-way' in Pakistan's general election","bodyText":"Mohammed Saeed had been waiting all day. Early that morning the 27-year-old bakery worker had cycled from his home on the outskirts of Okara, a rural town in Pakistan's eastern Punjab province, to the scruffy crossroads at its centre. Now, as evening came, the man he had come to see was only 100 metres away, standing on the roof of his campaign bus. \"We want to make a new Pakistan,\" Imran Khan shouted. \"You have to make this new Pakistan for your future.\" Saeed cheered. \"He's right,\" he said, \"We have to make our own future.\" Okara was the third of five stops for the cricketer turned politician that day. The pace of campaigning is accelerating, as the general election in the troubled, strategically situated nuclear power draws nearer. For more than four decades the Pakistan Peoples party (PPP) and the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) have alternated in power between periods of military rule. Now Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), Pakistan Movement for Justice, offers voters a third option. Khan's campaign has triggered a wave of enthusiasm, particularly among younger voters. Nearly 35% of the 85 million people registered to take part in the elections are under 30 and nearly 60% under 40. As Khan's campaign convoy wends its way through the towns of central Punjab it is preceded by a swarm of excited young men on motorbikes – as well as pickup trucks full of armed commandos. \"He will win here because he is new and energetic and people are fed up with previous rulers,\" said Mushtaq Haq, another onlooker in Okara. A stagnant economy, massive power shortages and extremist violence are largely blamed on the PPP, in power at the national level for the past five years. Khan started the day at the home he built for himself and his family in Islamabad, the capital, before his divorce from Jemima Goldsmith in 2004. PTI now has more funds than when Khan paid for his own campaigns in the late 1990s. A helicopter flew the candidate to the day's first rally. Then he moved into the bus – actually a spartan portable building mounted on a truck. At each stop Khan shouted his message: \"Until now, no one has changed anything. The parties take turns but have not changed the system. I will transfer power to the common people.\" The crowd waved cricket bats, some made of wood, others of cardboard. Many Pakistanis are illiterate so parties are designated by symbols. Khan won the Cricket World Cup for his country in 1992 and retired from the sport a national hero. A senior campaign aide of Nawaz Sharif, the PML president and current frontrunner in the coming polls, dismissed him last week as \"a sportsman not a politician\". Khan told the Guardian that such attacks did not bother him. His style of politics, which consciously rejects patronage, tactical alliances and the support of powerful well-known figures with solid \"votebanks\", threatens the established parties, he said. \"Have you seen the energy? The passion? It's huge. There is so much hope,\" he said, over a rapid lunch of flatbread and curried mutton in the moving office. Policies such as forcing the wealthy to pay tax – most currently do not – and making parliamentarians declare all their assets also worried his political opponents, he said, along with his own party's internal democracy. Khan has also pledged to curb crippling power cuts within months and take money from the budget of Pakistan's powerful military to fund health, education and welfare programmes. Both, analysts say, are extremely ambitious objectives. Khan is convinced he can fulfil his promises. Once known as a playboy, the 60-year-old has raised eyebrows in the west with a new faith and conservatism. In an autobiography he describes turning to religion, particularly the mystical sufi strand of Islam, after the death of his mother. \"One lot call you a fundamentalist; the other a so-called secularist,\" he said. Khan has led demonstrations over US drone strikes against Islamists in the west of the country and vehemently opposed Islamabad's decision to allow supplies for international forces in Afghanistan to cross Pakistani territory. Liberals accuse him of being too close to Pakistan's Islamists. Khan said the roots of extremist groups waging an insurgency against the Pakistani state, \"secular elements\" and local opponents from bases in the restive tribal areas along the western border lay not in religion but the historic resistance of the Pashtun tribes there to \"outsiders\". Such groups, however, are making systematic, and often successful, efforts to kill or maim other campaigning politicians from parties seen as insufficiently devout. \"These parties [which are being targeted] were all perceived as pro-war. They all made pro-war statements,\" said Khan, whose mother was Pashtun. Few doubt the wave of enthusiasm Khan has inspired. Rallies over the past 18 months have been among the biggest for many years, and in Lahore he has won over everyone from wealthy young professionals to a 24-year-old tea seller in a rough central neighbourhood. Though Khan speaks of a \"tsunami\", analysts wonder if popular sentiment can be turned into votes without the experienced, well-funded machines of the major parties – and their sometimes ruthless tactics. \"That's been the question for a year or more. No one knows the answer,\" said Cyril Almeida, a political journalist. PTI party workers are, privately, unsure. Some talk of winning either \"30 or 130\" out of a total of 272 directly elected seats. Khan himself says a clear majority is \"conceivable\" but admits nothing is certain. \"As a sportsmen I know the game isn't over until the last ball is bowled,\" he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/georgemonbiot/2012/mar/15/david-cameron-friends-of-the-earth","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-03-15T14:19:29Z","webTitle":"Why I am urging David Cameron to act against Friends of the Earth | George Monbiot","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2012/mar/15/david-cameron-friends-of-the-earth","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2012/mar/15/david-cameron-friends-of-the-earth","fields":{"headline":"Why I am urging David Cameron to act against Friends of the Earth","bodyText":"Had I wondered, 10 years ago, what I would be doing in 2012, signing a letter to the prime minister urging him not to heed four former directors of Friends of the Earth would not have appeared on the list. I still see Friends of the Earth as a force for good. I will remain a member, as I have been for 20 years or more. But the letter that Jonathon Porritt, Tom Burke, Charles Secrett and Tony Juniper have sent to David Cameron with the support of the current director, suggesting he abandons new nuclear power plants, demands a response. If Cameron were to act on it, he would set back the UK's efforts to meet its international commitments on climate change, and help to make runaway global warming a more likely prospect. The four former directors' narrowness of vision, and their readiness to appeal to jingoistic and xenophobic sentiments, appal me. Writing to Cameron this week, they asserted that the UK government is \"handing over the control of Britain's future energy and climate security to the government of France.\" This, a grotesque exaggeration, is a theme they repeated and embellished in the media. Environmentalism has long been internationalist in outlook, recognising the common interests of humankind and emphasising the fact that pollution and environmental destruction does not stop at national boundaries. It often argues that governments should put aside narrow national interests in favour of global concerns. To see this going into reverse is disturbing. But much more alarming is their apparent willingness to downgrade the effort to tackle man-made climate change. In writing to Cameron they suggested that the UK follow the example of Germany, Japan and Italy. These countries, they pointed out, are making extra investments in both energy efficiency and renewables to fill the gap left by their abandonment of nuclear power. But the four signatories forgot to add that these nations are also making extra investments in fossil fuels. In all three cases, dropping atomic energy will raise greenhouse gas emissions and make the global target of preventing more than two degrees of global warming harder to achieve. The signatories of both letters to Cameron – against and for nuclear power – want to see more investment in both energy efficiency and renewables. What divides us is the aim of this investment. Those who wrote the first letter want this investment deployed to replace nuclear generation, which is by far the greatest current source of low-carbon electricity. The signatories to the second letter (Mark Lynas, Fred Pearce, Stephen Tindale, Michael Hanlon and myself) want it used to replace fossil fuels. It is plain that we cannot do both. Reducing carbon emissions to 10% or less of current levels in the rich nations, which is the minimum required to prevent two degrees of warming, is hard enough already. To do so while also abandoning our most reliable and widespread low-carbon technology is even harder. It's like putting on a pair of handcuffs before stepping into the boxing ring. To suggest phasing out nuclear power when the world is faced with a climate change crisis is utter madness. It shows that some people have lost sight of which goal is more important. If there were quick, cheap, easy and effective means of reducing the UK's carbon emissions to 5 or 10% of current levels, I too would continue to oppose nuclear power. But every one of our options entails great difficulty. We do not possess an abundance of good choices, and cannot afford to start throwing options away. It is not a question of nuclear or renewables or efficiency. To prevent very dangerous levels of climate change, we will need all three. This was made clear by the Committee on Climate Change, which showed that the maximum likely contribution to our electricity supply from renewables by 2030 is 45%, and the maximum likely contribution from carbon capture and storage is 15%. If nuclear power does not make up most of the remainder, the gap will be filled by fossil fuel. Some of the concerns the four signatories raise about financing and delivering new nuclear plants in the UK are valid. There is no primrose path to a low-carbon future, and a new generation of nuclear power plants will require compromise on the issue of energy market liberalisation and, probably, subsidies. But take a look at the alternative they propose: gas with carbon capture and storage (CCS). Every issue concerning the financing and delivery of nuclear power is doubled, tripled or quintupled in this case. Unlike atomic energy, gas CCS has not even been proven at scale. If they think nuclear power has problems with investor confidence, the availability of capital, the absence of subsidies and the need for government involvement, they should try talking to financiers about their own preferred option. The likelihood is that if we press for gas with CCS, we'll get gas without CCS. As the difficulties with carbon capture and storage mount up, investors will flee. But the gas plants will still be built and the public won't perceive a great deal of difference between gas with or without abatement. It could scarcely be a better formula for ensuring the abandonment of the UK's carbon targets. The environment movement has a choice. It has to decide whether it wants no new fossil fuels or no new nuclear power. It cannot have both. I know which side I'm on, and I know why. Anyone who believes that the safety, financing and delivery of nuclear power are bigger problems than the threats posed by climate change has lost all sense of proportion. monbiot.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/may/22/energy-nuclear-renewables","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-05-22T05:15:00Z","webTitle":"Only renewables - not nuclear - could be too cheap to meter | Damian Carrington","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/may/22/energy-nuclear-renewables","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/may/22/energy-nuclear-renewables","fields":{"headline":"Only renewables - not nuclear - could be too cheap to meter","bodyText":"\"Too cheap to meter\": that was the infamous boast of the nuclear power industry in its heyday. It has been catastrophically discredited by history. Yet the phrase may yet see a new life - not of course for nuclear power - but for renewable energy. As the UK government publishes its draft energy bill on Tuesday, acknowledged by all but ministers themselves as primarily an arcane way of getting new nuclear power stations built, I am in Germany. Already, on one particularly windy weekend here, the surge of electricity drove the price down to zero. Very soon, due to the 25GW of solar capacity Germany has already installed, hot summer's days will see the same effect: electricity too cheap to meter. Now hang on, I hear you say, free electricity is actually crazy as it means there's no incentive to invest in new, clean generation capacity, which almost every country needs as the world seeks to cut the carbon emissions driving climate change. Germany's renewable energy policy, which began with a feed-in-tariff in 1990, deals with this by continuing to pay the producer, even when the electricity is sold for nothing. Crazy again, right? No, says Andreas Kraemer, director of the Ecologic Institute, an energy research policy centre, because the tax benefit to the Germany, via 400,000 jobs in the €40bn-a-year renewables industry is outweighs than the cost of the subsidy. Furthermore, he says, the contribution of renewable energy in cutting peak prices mean the wholesale cost of electricity is 10% lower than it would be without them. \"The money flowing out in FITs is less than the money saved by the end consumer,\" he says. And all the while a clean, sustainable energy system is built. But real problems do exist, and will intensify as Germany approaches its goal of 100% renewable electricity, from its current 20%. As that comes closer, the policies will have to change. Energy storage, already incentivised in Germany today, will need to be available, as will high-voltage interconnectors to move power around the continent and a smart grid to cleverly match demand to supply. It's an attractive vision: clean energy, securely supplied and coming down in price. Compare all this with the UK, where the nuclear industry is so embedded in government it supplies staff free-of-charge to work within the energy ministry. Perhaps it's no wonder that even when half of the UK's big six energy companies bale out of nuclear on cost grounds, ministers plough on regardless. The news that EDF, the French-state-owned giant that runs many of the UK's nuclear plants, wants to extend the lifetimes of their ageing reactors confirms their attraction to the so-called carbon floor price. This leg of government energy policy puts a minimum price on carbon emissions, delivering large windfalls to existing nuclear plants. New nuclear plants will also have to be subsidised, more than onshore wind and possibly more than offshore wind, according to recent analyses, which is shameful for a 60 year-old technology. \"In general in industry,\" says Kraemer, \"when the production of something doubles, the cost falls by about 15%. The only notable exception is the nuclear industry which gets more expensive the more you build.\" Recent reports, not denied by EDF, put the cost of their new plants in the UK at £7bn each, 40% higher than previously stated. So while mass-produced renewable energy technologies are pushing the costs downwards, nuclear energy is completing the journey from \"too cheap to meter\" to \"too expensive to count\". \"It surprises me that something that is completely obvious to people in Germany is suppressed in the UK,\" says Kraemer. A final note. I am here with half a dozen of the UK's most senior energy policy academics. When I mention the guarantee repeatedly given by the coalition government that new nuclear plants in the UK will get \"no public subsidy\", the only response are roars of incredulous laughter. Energy bill payers, who fund all the energy schemes, are unlikely to be similarly amused."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2013/may/02/prince-charles-not-a-dabbler","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2013-05-02T14:30:02Z","webTitle":"Prince Charles is not a dabbler – he's deeply committed.

But he's naive","bodyText":"Revelations about the Duchy of Cornwall's accounts revive the debate over the scale of Prince Charles's involvement in fields other than waving, opening things, collecting art and accumulating rent. He's often accused of exceeding the prerogatives of a constitutional monarch, most recently in successfully lobbying a fellow royal, the Emir of Qatar, to drop Richard Rogers as architect for a housing scheme in Chelsea. But, even if we accept the argument that he is only intervening in aesthetics and ethics, not politics, what do his interventions really mean? Charles's endeavours are a serious attempt to do things differently to the way they are usually done in capitalist democracy. He has, in short, a dream, and the determination and wherewithal to achieve it, at least in small enclaves. The scale of the Prince's empire is enormous, a property portfolio that makes the public funding of his activities somewhat shocking; but it is in architecture and planning that he has had the greatest effect and influence. This has been the case ever since he gave a new insult to the language – \"carbuncle\", to describe an unpleasant building – during a speech to the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1984. From then on, he would be a high-profile advocate for traditional architecture and traditional towns, writing books, presenting a TV programme, founding a magazine, founding trusts – and, of course, founding and sponsoring the only new town to have been planned since the 60s at Poundbury, just outside Dorchester. The original carbuncle of which he was complaining was proposed, not built – the winning entry for a competition to extend to the National Gallery, proposed by architects Ahrends, Burton and Koralek, who had made their name designing acclaimed modern buildings for universities. Charles's horror at the design helped get it replaced with a building by American postmodernists Robert Venturi and Denise Scott-Brown – who, astutely, provided a building that from a distance looked like just another neoclassical edifice, with an apparatus of allegedly subversive formal ironies that were revealed close-up. It's doubtful these bothered the Prince – what was important was that an outward appearance of order and continuity was maintained. Regardless, the public reception of what he did in publicly insulting architects (to their face) was interesting. A hereditary monarch was accepted as expressing the voice of the people, his intervention chiming perfectly with an already existing reaction at Britain's brief, 25-year experiment with modernism. \"Planners and architects,\" he said, \"have consistently ignored the feelings and wishes of the mass of ordinary people in this country.\" Those feelings and wishes he evidently knew intimately. In A Vision of Britain, Charles had a hitlist of buildings, with accompanying insults-as-similes. Birmingham Central Library was a place where books were burned, not read; the National Theatre a nuclear power station; the British Library looked like a secret police academy. These words could perhaps have been spoken by any lay person alarmed by the unusual building that had just emerged on his doorstep. But they weren't – they were said by one of the most expensively and extensively educated people in the country, someone who had been exposed from the earliest age to a major art collection, and who should, in theory, have developed the ability to patiently evaluate artworks and architecture, a luxury denied to most. The ignorance of his remarks – especially on the British Library, a structure whose adherence to tradition and deference to its surroundings are scrupulous – were especially insulting and facile in that context. But as a nonprofessional, he was accepted by other nonprofessionals. Aristocrat he may have been; at least he wasn't arty. The traditionalist new town of Poundbury was similarly an attempt to take towns out of the hands of modernist-inclined professionals, to create what, apparently, everyone wants – a version of the smaller towns of the 18th and early 19th century. It would be a laboratory of doing things differently, free from the pressures of the market as much as of modernity. However, taking things out of the hands of professionals didn't mean taking them out of the hands of the volume housebuilders, and the new town has been criticised for being shoddily built. The significance of Poundbury is deeper than this. Charles is not a dabbler – he has a very distinctive vision. His disdain for modern architecture is of a piece with his dislikes for factory farming, atheism, materialism, industrialised medicine and technology in general. Anyone who has been the beneficiary of, say, diverse cheap foodstuffs, antibiotics and good modern housing, when the options were previously gruel, death and cellars, should ponder that for Charles, none of these have ever been of relevance. His fantasies are of a different nature to those of the \"ordinary people\" he purports to speak for. The town planner of Poundbury, Léon Krier, is a former modernist who had a road-to-Damascus conversion in the 70s, when he suddenly began to write advocacy in the architectural press for Albert Speer, both architectural and, gradually, political. Krier-via-Speer's philosophy entails a rejection of the modern world and the aesthetics of commercialism in favour of a recreation of the world as it existed just before the industrial revolution, where the majority lived shorter, sicker, but much more picturesque lives. Krier criticises modern cities because they would not survive if industrial civilisation does not survive; traditional ones, on the other hand, will hold out when technological society collapses. It's a project to which our future monarch is evidently deeply and sincerely committed, to the degree that he will take money from the dead to fund it. The astonishing thing is that he has managed to convince many others."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/mar/30/nuclear-energy-gas-climate","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-03-30T12:25:00Z","webTitle":"Nuclear and gas blow outs show where the dumb money is | Damian Carrington","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/mar/30/nuclear-energy-gas-climate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/mar/30/nuclear-energy-gas-climate","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear and gas blow outs show where the dumb money is","bodyText":"Follow the money: in the billion-dollar world of the energy business that is good advice. So what do the collapse of a quarter of the UK's new nuclear power plans and the gas still billowing dangerously from Total's Elgin rig in the North Sea tell us about keeping the lights on and tackling climate change at a price we can afford? It tells us first that, despite decades of lavish public subsidy, nuclear power remains uninvestable without heavy state backing. And second it tells us that even \"safe\" gas and oil fields pose serious risks, making the race to the ends of the Earth and the depths of the oceans for new fields a true fool's errand. E.on and RWE are huge, blue-chip multinationals, yet see nuclear as too big a gamble and that's despite the substantial subsidy it would enjoy in the UK, alongside other low-carbon energy projects. When the free-marketeers at the Economist damn nuclear power as the \"dream that failed\", you know you're in trouble. But that trouble may not just afflict the companies, but all of us who pay for energy. The French state-controlled giant, EDF, looks well-placed for a nuclear monopoly in the UK, and don't forget it already has its own employees working right in the heart of government. As ministers found with the bungled attempt to get carbon capture and storage (CCS) off the ground, having one bidder for a contract leads either to failure or a fleecing. Energy minister Charles Hendry sought to blame the German government's abandoning of nuclear power, given that E.on and RWE are German companies. He was perhaps half-right: RWE mentioned that reason, E.on did not. In any case, as ministers point out on other occasions, the UK is competing internationally for the capital needed to build an energy system fit for the 21st century. The brutal truth is no nuclear power station has yet been built without state subsidy, and it remains a mystery to me why the UK should be the place to break that ignominious record. Like nuclear, oil and gas has been showered with taxpayers money for many decades and still is. Even a conservative estimate by the International Energy Agency shows fossil fuels got $409bn subsidy in 2010, compared to $66bn for renewables. In the UK, fossil fuels get five times the subsidy of wind power. Yet despite this, the inherent dangers of pumping highly explosive materials from under the oceans means accidents happen, from the gigantic blowouts like the Deepwater disaster in the Gulf of Mexico, to the weekly leaks that foul the North Sea. These cost money - lots of money - that you and I will end up paying through energy bills and petrol pump prices. Even the worrying, but relatively minor, Elgin gas leak knocked about £5bn off Total's share price and may cost billions to resolve. E.on and RWE said they would focus on gas and renewables, not nuclear. This and the government's recent \"dash for gas\" makes it vital for the new £1bn CCS competition to succeed. But don't buy the shale gas hype: the money men at Deutsche bank are clear it will not crash gas prices in the UK as it has in the US. Contrast all this with energy efficiency and renewables. The former makes sense by definition. The latter is where costs are coming down, even with the relatively limited subsidies they receive. And neither involve the Faustian pacts of nuclear power or oil and gas: they are as safe as the houses they power. The UK government says nuclear power is essential to cutting our carbon emissions - although it has developed non-nuclear scenarios - yet plants that are never built are nothing but hot air. The goverment is also throwing money at oil companies to plumb the depths of the sea to the west of Shetland and to subsidise the clean-up of their own broken-down rigs. Meanwhile, the major energy efficiency programme - the Green deal - employs an unsubsidised market mechanism that even the government's official advisors say will fail. None of oil's billions there to get the national refurb going. And renewable energy, booming around the world, has its support cut sharply at short notice or delayed. The government of course abhors the idea of \"backing winners\" but appears happy to back the nuclear, oil and gas losers. If you want to rely on markets to deliver clean, secure and affordable energy, then you really do need to follow the money."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2012/dec/07/nuclear-edf-hinkley-point","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2012-12-07T19:37:22Z","webTitle":"Nuclear giant EDF postpones decision on new Hinkley Point reactor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/dec/07/nuclear-edf-hinkley-point","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2012/dec/07/nuclear-edf-hinkley-point","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear giant EDF postpones decision on new Hinkley Point reactor","bodyText":"The troubled French nuclear giant EDF has postponed its decision on whether to build a new power station at Hinkley Point in Somerset. The delay puts the nuclear renaissance at the heart of the UK government's energy plans into further doubt after a difficult week in which EDF was hit by cost overruns and the exit of its partner from a key French project. The new reactors at Hinkley were to be the first of a new generation of atomic plants in the UK and EDF had repeatedly pledged to make a final investment decision by the end of 2012. But the decision to plough billions of pounds into the project is now unlikely to be taken before April 2013, according to sources close to the project, although EDF declined to comment. \"This is another broken promise from EDF on a policy that has always been failing,\" said Tom Burke, the founding director of the green thinktank E3G. \"To spend at least £14bn on a pair of reactors at Hinkley is very, very high risk.\" The latest projections from the Department of Energy and Climate Change have reduced the amount of nuclear power expected in future, with only Hinkley expected to be up and running by 2025, he added. The energy secretary, Ed Davey, fast-tracked negotiations over the guaranteed price EDF would be paid for electricity from Hinkley to help the end-of-year deadline to be met. However, amid concerns that consumers would end up paying a high price, the energy minister John Hayes recently warned that the government could walk away from the talks. EDF is also awaiting planning permission to build the reactors and does not expect that decision before March 2013. A failure to secure the building of the Hinkley reactors would be a serious blow for both the government and EDF, which is majority owned by the French state. But it also comes in a week that EDF admitted that the cost of building its prototype European pressurised reactor (EPR) at Flamanville in Normandy had risen by €2bn (£1.6bn) to €8.5bn. The following day EDF's partner in the Flamanville 3 scheme, Enel of Italy, announced that it was pulling out. EDF said in 2005 that it would construct the EPR, which is similar to the ones planned for Somerset, for €3.3bn. The cost overruns – and delays – have partly been blamed on changes required after the Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan but they have also been put down to engineers discovering the project was more difficult than they had foreseen. New statistics just released by Decc show the British government expects only 3.3 gigawatts of new nuclear capacity to be built by 2025 and 9.9GW by 2030. This compares with 4.8GW by 2025 and 12GW by 2030 as recorded in Decc's energy and emissions projections 12 months ago."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2011/aug/16/editorial-fukushima-nuclear-dirty-tricks","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2011-08-15T23:05:00Z","webTitle":"After Fukushima: nuclear dirty tricks | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/aug/16/editorial-fukushima-nuclear-dirty-tricks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2011/aug/16/editorial-fukushima-nuclear-dirty-tricks","fields":{"headline":"After Fukushima: nuclear dirty tricks","bodyText":"The Japanese cabinet decided this week to transfer the country's nuclear safety agency from the trade ministry, where it nestled in a department also dedicated to the expansion of nuclear power, to the environment ministry, where, at least in theory, there is some chance that its operations will not be subverted or manipulated by Japanese energy firms. After nearly half a century of producing nuclear power, Japan has finally separated regulation from promotion, but the move may well have come too late to restore public trust. In a country where people have to use their own detectors to check on local radiation levels which the government failed to release, where information about threats to life and health after Fukushima dribbled out so haphazardly, and where a nuclear industry apparently unabashed by that disaster has been resorting to dirty tricks to influence public debate, mere bureaucratic rearrangement will hardly suffice. The latest blow to confidence came when it was reported last month that workers at the Kyushu Electric Power Company had been asked to pose as ordinary citizens with no connection to the industry and send emails calling for the resumption of operations at two nuclear reactors in southern Japan to a televised public hearing. Investigations showed this was standard behaviour long before Fukushima, with other power companies admitting that they had sent employees to make up as many as half of the participants in similar forums as far back as 2005. As if this were not bad enough, two of the utilities said they were urged to do so by the nuclear agency itself. It was this revelation which appears to have led to the decision to fire three top officials, including the head of the agency, and then to reorganise and move it. Japan's polarised industrial culture, which veers between the heedless pursuit of short- term interest, on the one hand, and confessions, tears, and apparently heartfelt apologies when things go wrong, on the other, makes it an extreme case. But the same factors are at work in every country that has a nuclear industry. The impulse to minimise the inherent risks of the most dangerous technology man has ever tried to master, the tendency to conceal or downplay accidents, the assertion that each succeeding generation of plants is foolproof and super safe, and the presumption, so often proved wrong by events, that every contingency has been provided for, all these have been evident again and again. Angela Merkel, one of the few leading politicians who is also a scientist, saw the writing on the wall. Her decision to phase out nuclear power has revived a global debate which has been dormant for far too long."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2013/feb/08/coalition-candidates-losers-eastleigh","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2013-02-08T21:45:01Z","webTitle":"Whoever wins in Eastleigh, the coalition will lose | Vernon Bogdanor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/feb/08/coalition-candidates-losers-eastleigh","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2013/feb/08/coalition-candidates-losers-eastleigh","fields":{"headline":"Whoever wins in Eastleigh, the coalition will lose","bodyText":"The Eastleigh byelection will be the first since the 1930s in which two governing parties in a coalition will be fighting each other with a realistic chance of winning. The battle will be yet further evidence that the elite manoeuvrings of coalition politics have hardly affected grassroots party allegiances. But even at Westminster coalition ties are being loosened. The coalition agreement of 2010 provided for disagreements between the two parties. They could agree to suspend collective cabinet responsibility on matters such as nuclear power, student fees and the alternative vote. Last month, however, Liberal Democrat ministers took matters further by unilaterally voting against a government proposal on the redrawing of constituency boundaries, an issue on which collective responsibility had not been suspended. Yet they remain in office. The coalition enjoys a comfortable Commons majority, but there is no way of knowing whether it has support in the country. It is the first peacetime coalition since the mid-19th century to be formed after, rather than before, a general election. The 1895 Conservative/Liberal Unionist coalition was formed before a general election and fought the election as a coalition; so did the Conservative/Lloyd George Liberal coalition in 1918 and the National Government in 1931. The 2010 coalition, by contrast, was formed after the votes had been counted. The coalition has therefore opened a gap between the principle of parliamentary government, according to which government is responsible to parliament, and that of democratic government, where it is responsible to the voters. Normally, of course, the two principles coincide. But, as David Cameron presciently predicted in an interview in the Independent on the day before the 2010 election, with a hung parliament \"instead of the people choosing the government, the politicians do\". No voter had the opportunity either of supporting or opposing the coalition; nor was the coalition agreement ever put before voters. A single-party government might claim, with varying degrees of plausibility, that it has a mandate for policies in its election manifesto. No such claim can be made by the coalition. Not only was the government decided after the votes had been counted, so also were the policies. Before the 2010 election, Lord Owen, the former SDP leader, declared: \"The electors are entitled to ask that party leaders and candidates are straight with them about a hung parliament before they cast their votes.\" But in 2010 that did not happen. The formation of the coalition and the doctrine of the supremacy of the coalition agreement have important consequences for the quality of democracy in Britain. We hear much of the democratic deficit in the European Union; the coalition has brought about a democratic deficit in Britain. With another hung parliament in 2015 a distinct possibility, that deficit will only be filled if the party leaders indicate to the voters before the election which parties they would be willing to enter a coalition with, and on what terms. Otherwise the gap between the political class and the people will become a chasm. Eastleigh will widen that gap, since the strains of coalition at cabinet and parliamentary level will be replicated and indeed magnified at the grassroots. There will be no coalition candidate, and there is therefore no way a voter who favours the coalition can endorse it. Under alternative voting, rejected in the referendum of 2011, or under some systems of proportional representation, voters would have been able to endorse the coalition by distributing their preferences between the two competing coalition parties. Under first past the post, that is not an option. The byelection, therefore, will be for or against the Lib Dems and the Conservatives, not for or against the coalition. Whoever wins, the coalition will lose. This could indeed be its moment of truth, since it will be revealed as the artefact of a Westminster elite, with little resonance at the grassroots. The Eastleigh byelection could well confirm Disraeli's famous aphorism that England does not love coalitions. • For legal reasons comments on this article are closed"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2013/jun/30/carney-bonds-and-booms-bank-of-england","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2013-06-30T08:11:00Z","webTitle":"Can Carney keep a lid on booms and bonds at the Bank of England?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jun/30/carney-bonds-and-booms-bank-of-england","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2013/jun/30/carney-bonds-and-booms-bank-of-england","fields":{"headline":"Can Carney keep a lid on booms and bonds at the Bank of England?","bodyText":"Most people are happy to keep a low profile on their first day in a new job while they work out where the photocopier is and how the phones work. Mark Carney, however, is inviting in a television crew. It won't be an easy induction. With financial markets in a funk, and the economy in an even deeper hole than we thought, judging by the statisticians' latest pronouncements, Carney will need to roll his sleeves up. The new governor may hope to deploy his favoured tool, of \"forward guidance\" – telling the public where interest rates are headed – sooner rather than later. After the sell-off in bond markets over the past two weeks, prompted by Ben Bernanke's musings about \"tapering\" QE, investors are predicting a first rate rise from the Bank by the second half of next year. In that environment, with investors recalibrating their expectations of how monetary policy is likely to evolve over the next 12 months, a clear signal from the Bank that it has no intention of dashing for the exit any time soon could, at the margin, help to bring borrowing costs down. But the 319-year-old Bank of England is a different beast from the Bank of Canada, where Carney got used to being very much in charge. While Sir Mervyn was derided by Alistair Darling as the \"Sun King\", whose power in Threadneedle Street was absolute, he hasn't been able to exercise such a firm grip over monetary policy. Gordon Brown and Ed Balls carefully devised a monetary policy decision-making regime that would prevent a hawkish governor from overruling his colleagues to clobber the economy with painfully high interest rates. But King has recently been on the dovish side of the argument, in the face of scepticism from other on the monetary policy committee, including the Bank's chief economist, Spencer Dale, who is more concerned about risks to the Bank's inflation-fighting reputation than the sickly state of the economy. And even beyond the ranks of the MPC, the Bank is hardly a monolithic place, despite its rigid hierarchy. For instance, the director of financial stability, Andy Haldane, has expressed concerns that central banks have \"intentionally blown the biggest government bond bubble in history\" – prompting the Bank to issue a statement defending its ultra-loose monetary policy. King wryly remarked at his valedictory treasury select committee appearance last week that: \"I am sure that Mark Carney is very much more persuasive than me.\" But with the Bank for International Settlements, the central bankers' club, joining the chorus of warnings that more QE may do more harm than good, the doubters in Threadneedle Street may feel emboldened to stick to their guns. And however persuasive Carney may be with his colleagues, the turbulence of recent weeks has underscored the likelihood that events far beyond his control will take over. Stephen King, chief economist at HSBC, remarked as he cut the bank's growth forecasts for many major economies last week that the combination of China's apparent fragility, and the Fed's vocal desire to start reversing QE, has \"exposed the soft underbelly of the global economy\". And Britain can ill afford to withstand a renewed deterioration in the international environment. The picture painted by the latest revised data from the ONS last week was of an economy still a long way from normality, despite the chancellor's line that it is \"out of intensive care\". GDP remains almost 4% below its pre-crisis peak, while many of our rivals, including the US and Germany – and Canada – have made up the ground lost during the great recession. One of the few areas where green shoots are visible is the housing market, at least in London and the south-east, but many economists view rising prices as a reason to fret about the risks of a new bubble and the increasing burdens on over-indebted borrowers rather than cheer for recovery. And the Bank itself is starting to fret about the potential risks to mortgage-holders if interest rates start to rise. And if that's not enough to disturb Carney's sleep, Threadneedle Street has just taken on overseeing the recession-scarred banking sector. So not much time to smile for the cameras. We could have seen this blackout coming There is little doubt that a warning from the energy watchdog last week that Britain is facing blackouts within 18 months was no empty threat, and one that should embarrass the government. But it also helps ministers as they try to swing public opinion behind subsiding nuclear power stations and providing incentives for shale gas explorers. Conveniently, the warning from Ofgem – that the buffer of spare electricity in the system will fall from 4% to 2% by 2015 – came alongside important announcements on shale and nuclear. The government revealed that France's EDF would be able to receive a £10bn public guarantee on the financing needed to help build its proposed new reactors at Hinkley Point in Somerset. Second, the British Geological Survey unveiled a new assessment of fracking potential, showing that the north of England alone could have 1,300 trillion cubic feet of shale gas resources. Energy minister Michael Fallon said it would be \"irresponsible\" not to press ahead with new tax and planning rules that would help Britain exploit deposits that could provide all of our gas needs for 40 years. But there are significant caveats. Hinkley Point will not be built until after 2020 at the very earliest, even if EDF and the government can agree on further concessions. Shale could, in theory, come earlier, but neither is going to save the country from its potential blackouts in the meantime. That will come from encouraging power companies – yes, some of those same Big Six firms that have been mis-selling and jacking up household bills at every opportunity. They need to bring their mothballed plants back into service or look on as business customers cut energy use between 4pm and 8pm, as the National Grid has suggested. The bill will always come back to us, but we might ask why ministers left it all so long, and entirely to a flawed market regime, to deliver us from a real energy security threat that has been on the horizon for years. Business as usual for Barclays – threaten the regulator It is a year since Bob Diamond was forced out of Barclays in the wake of the Libor scandal, an event that led Andrew Bailey, the chief banking regulator, to say that Barclays had a \"culture of gaming – and gaming us\" about the bank's relationship with its regulator. Today it would be easy to see why Bailey might want to utter the same words again. Faced with a demand by the new bank regulator to reduce the risks Barclays is taking, the bank is playing hardball. Diamond's replacement, the mind-mannered but hard-nosed Antony Jenkins, warned last week that the bank could cut its lending to the economy if it was forced to meet requirements for a new leverage ratio. This is a measure of the risks banks run. At 3% – a target which Barclays cannot hit yet – banks can have assets 33 times their capital. Barclays has more than that. Jenkins, appointed to reform the bank and its culture, is playing a dangerous game in fronting up his regulator. If he wants to show Barclays has changed for the better, he should stop right now."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global/2013/apr/23/guardian-weekly-letters-26-april","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2013-04-23T12:59:00Z","webTitle":"Guardian Weekly Letters, 26 April 2013","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2013/apr/23/guardian-weekly-letters-26-april","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global/2013/apr/23/guardian-weekly-letters-26-april","fields":{"headline":"Guardian Weekly Letters, 26 April 2013","bodyText":"Margaret Thatcher's legacy Your editorial is correct: Margaret Thatcher's legacy is a very mixed one with some positives, but with a very dark side as well (12 April). In 1982 I was teaching modern history to senior secondary students in Adelaide. Just as we were reaching our course conclusion that, post-Vietnam, old-style aggressive European imperialism was largely a thing of the past and for the most part civilised values had been restored in the world, Thatcher embarked upon another colonial war in the Falklands, reviving memories of the brutal excesses of our imperialist past. It was a reminder that the might-is-right approach to international affairs was very much alive and kicking after all, notwithstanding the lessons of yesteryear. From an educational standpoint her decade or so of rule reminded us that beneath the liberal atmosphere that had been developing in Britain in the 19th and 20th centuries lurked the potential, never very far beneath the surface, for the Orwellian dark side of the collective British psyche to come to the fore. It now remains for the powers-that-be to rescue, as best they can, the sceptred isle from the great damage done to its body politic and society in the Thatcher years. Terry Hewton Adelaide, South Australia • In all the many assessments of the personality and political life of Margaret Thatcher, no one has drawn the historical analogy to the English ruler who was her pattern, Elizabeth Tudor. Forget that they look rather alike: the key is they both had non-patrician, commoner – as in commonsense – genes (on the maternal line in Elizabeth's case). Both were highly educated, highly committed political professionals. And both had a mix of admirers and haters – Elizabeth lived in fear of her life from Catholic terrorists. The Stuart successors to Elizabeth were also a poor lot by comparison. History will show that both women had a similar, very English determination and style. The whole world took note. Colin Lendon Canberra, Australia • Steve Bell has excelled himself in offensiveness with his cartoon of Margaret Thatcher (12 April). Does he have no respect for the dead? It's time for Guardian Weekly to ring the changes with your cartoonist. Mike Payne High Wycombe, UK There is only one world What the Human Development Report does not show is where the worldwide growing middle class spends its money. Nor does it speak to the focus of worldwide education programmes (World is making very clear progress, 5 April). A growing population living longer and spending more will have devastating consequences if the raping of the world's resources continues unabated to feed an insatiable global consumer society. Democracy in its many forms may flourish, and the market economy may swell the ranks of the middle classes, but we are ignoring Karl Polanyi's reminder that land is finite, there is only one world and what we have is all there is. We would be well advised to adjust our education curriculums to pay greater attention to that reality, for if we do not learn to adapt to the reality of a finite world, the generations of the next century will suffer the consequences. André Carrel Terrace, British Columbia, Canada More balance needed on GM Regarding the article about Mark Lynas: where is the science to back up Lynas's retraction of his opposition to GM crops (Betrayal, truth and the GM contradiction, 12 April)? What about Monsanto's alleged domination of the seed supplies? What about the termination technology, meaning farmers cannot save seed to replant next year? What about unjustified prosecutions by biotech firms of small farmers for unintended infringements? What about the effects on health of altered food and the reduction in choice? Why no mention of the experiments proving that small-scale organic sustainable farming is more productive and better for the environment than any large-scale agriculture? The article was all about Lynas's feelings of guilt but had no hard facts to reinforce his change of attitude. Please, Guardian, we expect a harder and more balanced approach to a vital subject. Carol Binnie Ockham, UK • The interview with Mark Lynas was not interesting because of its refutation of the anti-GM arguments but because of the description of his experience of \"widespread denial\", resistance to criticism and hypocrisy about being open-minded and tolerant within campaigning and protest groups. Perhaps this is most obvious at the extreme end of politics, where the refusal to engage in debate with the other side, the failure to listen to other voices and, of course, the feeling of relative powerlessness lead to entrenchment of positions and the inevitable lashing out with both angry words and actions. But this syndrome of \"I am right\" is everywhere and has been for some time. In some public-sector organisations there is an acceptable view of the world and a politically correct way of speaking, and if you vary from it you feel the glare of disapproval. In the corporate world, particularly where there are strong charismatic leaders, \"groupthink\" prevails and perfectly sensible people start making illogical decisions – take Enron, for example. In politics to challenge the idea of growth, and financing it from debt, is certainly swimming against the tide. Consequently we struggle to explore alternative approaches because to do so is to invite invective and accusations of going back to the old way of doing things. Lynas is not immune. His insistence that the only way of deciding on issues such as GMOs or nuclear power is to prove matters one way or another by means of science brings problems. Are we to eliminate emotions and value judgment? For example, if a company controls the distribution of a variety of seeds and uses its dominant position in a market against the interests of farmers, and consequently people generally, can we not criticise that? And if we suspect that a GM approach undermines sustainable agriculture and changes the chemical balance within the environment, then surely it is fair to raise questions. But we must do so by questioning and listening, by challenging and being open to being wrong, not by shouting and fighting. I recognise that sometimes the questioning and challenging has to be sustained and robust where bastions of power exert undue influence or stubbornly refuse to listen, but disagreeing in this way is surely more likely to lead to a common good. Nick Coates Bath, UK Make better food choices Suzanne Moore's essay, Food is the ultimate class signifier (5 April), appears naive. It also misses the real factors that influence our food purchases. She suggests that giving cash instead of food stamps affords poor people freedom of choice. Next time she finds herself in a checkout line she might take a moment to observe the contents of her fellow shoppers' carts. Though these individuals may be of a very diverse socio-economic mix, most of their food purchases will probably contain approximately 75% processed foods. How often does one see a bag of dried beans or legumes in the cart? These foods are nutritious, low in fat, versatile and delicious. To state, as Moore does, that \"protein and fresh vegetables are beyond a food-stamp budget\" is perhaps assuming that the protein source is animal and the vegetables are out of season and imported. No one is immune to the seductive lure of the advertising industry; its main aim is to entice with its packaging and convenience. The food choices are there and for everyone, even if some of them require a bit of effort and a small degree of common sense in their preparation. So whether it be cash or food stamps, I recall the adage: \"Give a man a fish and he will eat for a day. Teach a man to fish and he'll eat for ever,\" as partial solution. Annie Thompson Hobart, Tasmania, Australia Iran impasse is predictable Little wonder that the negotiations over Iran's nuclear ambitions make little progress (US hints at Iran nuclear negotiations deadline, 12 April). For the six world powers in dialogue include none of Iran's Middle Eastern neighbours that are most directly affected. A nuclear arms-free region, which I suppose is what the world wants to see, would require the agreement of its only nuclear power, Israel, to decommission and renounce reliably its nuclear weapons, and also of ambitious Arab states like Saudi Arabia and the UAE to confirm their accession to the non-proliferation treaty, and of the US not to introduce nuclear-armed submarines. Of the six world powers in dialogue, two can give Iran little cause for confidence – the US and the UK, who conspired to overthrow the democratically elected Mossadegh in 1953. Ren Kempthorne Nelson, New Zealand Let's change our beliefs I felt grateful for Andrew Brown's article about the clash between Muslim and atheist fundamentalists (Atheists need Alpha course of their own, 5 April). He shines a light into a dark corner. Fundamentalists are always trying to defend traditions that maintain the existing power structure, which they believe is the natural order of things. But the test of beliefs is not whether they are true but whether or not they work for you. Fundamentalists think in black and white (George Bush: \"If you're not with us you're against us!\"). They take the written word literally as opposed to symbolically. They are always right because if they are not right they are wrong and they can't identify with being wrong. This is a manifestation of imbalance: extreme left-brain thinking. As our education system is almost all left-brain training, I am not surprised we have this problem. In this light Richard Dawkins is just as much a fundamentalist as any religious fanatic, even though he is more scientific. He points to the specks in their eyes, blind to the plank in his own. Do the beliefs supported by science really work for us? That we live in a dead, mechanical universe in ecosystems devoid of consciousness? In pagan, pre-Roman Britain it was taboo to cut a live oak. The moors, which I, in my youth, assumed were natural, were oak forests. Each tree had a spirit: a fairy. Once all the trees were gone the people were dis-spirited, our culture impoverished. Our impoverished consciousness sees nature as a mine of resources or as a dump and is busy clear-cutting the last of the world's forests. Can we stop pointing out the dysfunctions of Muslims' beliefs and examine our own? It is hard to change others but it is possible to change our own beliefs. Edward Butterworth Victoria, British Columbia, Canada Preserve the Olympic ideal I agree with Paul Cartledge when he said: \"An end to Olympic wrestling would be a brutal break with ancient games\" (Sports blog, 22 February). It was Plutarch who said that wrestling was the most \"artistic\" event of the games. It's also been said that, for some years now, the true spirit of the Olympic games has been about technological competition among nations, and not the pursuit of medals by individuals. Further, it has become impossible for many smaller nations to host the games, given the current up to $15bn costs as reported in these pages. The first of the modern Olympic games, on the recommendation of Baron Pierre de Coubertin, were in Athens in 1896, and had only nine sports, all for individuals; but the 1904 games in St Louis had team sports, including football, lacrosse and rowing eights. The time has come to return to the original Greek ideal, and to drop all team sports from the games. There already exist other venues for team sports. This smaller version would make it easier for smaller countries to host, would reduce competition among the largest nations and would emphasise the Olympic ideal, which is the pursuit of individual excellence. Dan A Morrison Ottawa, Canada Let's cut carbon emissions Annie March's letter pointing out that we are driving ourselves to extinction is as perceptive as usual (Reply, 5 April). It is only through legislation that governments have stopped cigarette smokers polluting public spaces; the same approach must be taken with car drivers. I live in a university town and the streets are filled with student cars. I question whether it is necessary or desirable for 17- to 21-year-olds to drive. Raising the driving age to 21 would not only reduce the number of cars but also save many lives since the accident rate is eight times higher among this age group. It would also help to establish walking, cycling and public transport use. I am guilty of choosing to drive to Manchester not because I dislike trains but because they are more expensive. The return journey costs me $53 in diesel, but $166 by rail. Governments must make public transport cheaper and fund this by increasing fuel tax on private cars. Unless governments make a sincere commitment to reducing carbon emissions, our planet is doomed. Angela Smith Norwich, UK Briefly • According to Pascal Quignard in Le Sexe et l'Effroi, a sense of sin in sexual matters stemmed from the puritanism of Augustus and was exploited by Christian parties (12 April). So what you say may be true only up to 18BC, and like us, Caligula just took delight in being bad.

Just three garden placards are visible, all of them orange and endorsing Sarah Yong, one of the Lib Dem candidates fighting to recapture county hall in distant Taunton. Neighbouring Bruton boasts several Tory placards, but in the ancient wool town of Shepton Mallet it is hard to find any at all. Yet there are unruly stirrings in tranquil rural Somerset. As elsewhere in England's mainly county elections on 2 May, the public mood is unpredictable. But in areas such Somerset where traditionally the Tories and Lib Dems have fought each other for control of the council, coalition politics are being put to the electoral test. County Hall is 35 miles across the flooded wetlands of the Somerset Levels – in wet winters like this one, local roads can be impassable for weeks – and gets its share of stick. Batcombe (population 400) lost its shops and school long ago (the Three Horseshoes pub survives), and last year its twice-weekly bus service succumbed to economies imposed by the Conservative-controlled county council, which is struggling with £80m worth of coalition cuts to its budget. \"Some people have to rely on neighbours to get to Shepton or Frome,\" says Yong, who has been sending voters handwritten letters in her energetic uphill struggle to beat the district councillor Nigel Woollcombe-Adams. Across the 18 villages that make up the new Mendip South division, all boundaries were redrawn after a cash-saving cut in councillor numbers from 58 to 55, making 28 the target for control of the council. Somerset Tories currently have 33 seats, Lib Dems 23 and Labour two. County Hall has changed hands six times since the 1970s. Lately there have been library cuts (modified after judicial review) and reduced access to the council's 16 tips, plus charges that critics claim generate more costly fly-tipping. In Batcombe's cottages and grand houses behind high hedges it irritates some voters almost as much as the money \"wasted\" on county hall restructuring or those rich incomers (\"he's from Frome\") with their fancy plans for eco-homes. But the Tory counter-blast may win over waverers too: before the Lib Dems lost control in 2009 they had doubled council tax and left £360m worth of debt that costs £100,000 a day to service, say the leaflets. Yong's election fliers talk of a two-horse race between Tories and the Lib Dems in a county where there are five Tory MPs and four Lib Dems, but Tories dominate at district level except in the Paddy Ashdown-created stronghold around Yeovil. Life is getting more complicated in 2013. For one thing Somerset (which long since lost Bath and suburban south Bristol to North Avon, later replaced by two unitary councils) retains a fondness for independents over party politicians. As Tory county councillor for wild and wonderful Exmoor (15% of the county's area, 2% of its voters), Frances Nicholson worries more about independents, with their complicated views on hunting and badger culls, than she does about her Labour and Ukip challengers from down on the Bristol Channel coast. Only last November Somerset elected the independent Sue Mountstevens as its police commissioner over a Tory, Ken Maddock, who stepped down as county council leader expecting to get the job. Even worse for the status quo, this year Labour is fighting almost every seat and so is Ukip. The Greens are not far behind in candidates, so Yong is part of a five-horse race. Dorothy Baker, a retired teacher and Ukip's local chairman, echoes rivals complaints about flood protection and too much new housing development in the villages, and raises some of Ukip's own: the impact of Polish immigration on local schools and hospitals, and wind farms – though these are not a county responsibility. \"People tell us we're fed up with the lot of them,\" she reports. Much of Somerset's problems can be traced to the EU or those Lib Dems, the coalition's \"tail wagging the dog\", she says. In Shepton Mallet's hard-pressed town centre (victim of the out-of-town Tesco supermarket, voters say) it is easy to pick up disgruntlement and a sense of neglect. \"It takes me two weeks to get a doctor's appointment,\" complains semi-retired John Bailey, who is switching from Tory to Lib Dem because the candidate (he's never heard of him before) talks well about regenerating the town. But Labour activists are fired up too, reports Andrew Govier, fighting to retain his county seat at Wellington. In 2009 Labour gave Lib Dems their tactical anti-Tory support. The coalition put paid to that. \" A lot of people were keen to stand this time,\" he says. With low unemployment and a diverse economy – high-tech helicopters at Yeovil as well as its famous cider and Cheddar's cheese – Somerset is relatively affluent, though marked by evident pockets of poverty and rough estates. But concern about job creation as well as energy diversity unites the parties in support for the proposed EDF-built nuclear power station on Hinkley Point. What will happen on 2 May? \"Ukip could split the Tory vote quite badly,\" admits one Tory councillor. \"We want to get the soft Labour vote back from the Lib Dems,\" says Labour. \"It's going to be a knife-edge result,\" says the Lib Dem Yong. And the Ukip leader, Nigel Farage, says his candidates will take votes from them all. • This article was amended on 29 April 2013 to correct the number of seats held by the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats in Somerset. The original said Somerset Tories had 34 seats and Lib Dems 22. This has been corrected to say that the Tories have 33 seats, and Lib Dems 23."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/blog/2013/jun/27/spending-review-reaction-infrastructure-live-blog","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2013-06-27T07:09:00Z","webTitle":"Spending review reaction and Alexander's infrastructure statement: Politics live blog","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2013/jun/27/spending-review-reaction-infrastructure-live-blog","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/2013/jun/27/spending-review-reaction-infrastructure-live-blog","fields":{"headline":"Spending review reaction and Alexander's infrastructure statement: Politics live blog","bodyText":"• Lord Justice Leveson is to appear before MPs for the first time to discuss his report on press regulation and the ensuing impasse over setting up a new industry watchdog – but not before the autumn. • Lord Deighton, the government's infrastructure minister, has defended the government's decision to raise the estimated cost of the HS2 high speed rail project by £10bn. \"Anybody who’s been involved in these kinds of big projects would absolutely understand that having real definition to a final budget this early in the design is a very, very hard thing to do, so it’s not surprising that it moves about a little in these early days,\" he told the World at One. • David Cameron has said he will defend the British EU budget rebate.

That's all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. The best blog I know about infrastructure is René Lavanchy's Infrastructure Punk. Admittedly, it's also the only blog about infrastructure I know, but I don't want to sound disparaging because it's good. Lavanchy has not written about today's announcement yet. But two days ago he did, quite correctly, predict that there would be a lot of repeats in the Treasury statement. If yesterday’s preview by Andrew Sparrow in The Guardian is anything to go by, Osborne is going to put the Mersey Gateway bridge at the heart of his capital spending showcase. This is a project he announced back in 2010, as part of his spending review. It had already been approved by the previous government (in 2006!) but needed a nod from the coalition. Fair enough. But then he re-announcedthe project in 2011, forcing procurement of the contract to wait until he had dropped his official blessing into his speech at the Conservative Party conference. Now he is going to announce it yet again, even though it already has a preferred bidder (picked in May, one month before the official announcement) and a slightly puzzling offer of a government loan guarantee. Other reheated projects to look out for include: High Speed 2 (planned by previous Labour govt, promised by Conservatives before 2010 election, green-lighted in October 2010 and again in January 2012) Widening and tolling of the A14 Rugby-Felixstowe highway (promised by previous government, project scrapped and replacement sought by government in 2011; expansion with tolling confirmed July 2012) Electrification of railway lines (Great Western, Midland Main Line, Transpennine Line) announced on March 2011, July 2012 and November 2011 respectively (see links) Eric Pickles is using Twitter to have a dig at George Osborne. I think it counts as retaliation. In his speech yesterday, Osborne made a \"fat-ist\" joke about Pickles' weight, by saying he was \"a model of lean government\". I suppose the Sun will want to know whether that's a Waitrose salad, or a cheapo one from Asda. Here is some more reaction to the infrastructure announcement. From Andrew Adonis, the Labour former transport secretary, on his blog The National Infrastructure Plan is the longest fairy tale since Snow White. Of the 576 projects in the last version of the plan, 80% haven’t even been started. Only 7 have been completed, five of them started under the last government. On housing, The Home Buy scheme, which the Chancellor said would support 100,000 home purchases and stimulate house building, has so far supported only 2,000 purchases, suggesting it will take half a century to meet its goal. On energy, the government’s hype about shale, investment in energy infrastructure has decreased in this parliament. There still isn’t a real contract between the government and EDF to build Hinkley Point, as the first of the proposed new nuclear power stations. On transport, Crossrail 2, highlighted today, does not even yet have an agreed route, let alone a funding plan, and construction could not start until the 2020s or even the 2030s. From Katja Hall, the CBI's chief policy director This is the kind of bold, ambitious package which businesses have wanted for years - but the time for grand announcements is over. Ministers now need to follow through urgently on their promises or they risk the private sector growing even more frustrated. It’s clear the coalition now sees it was wrong to cut capital spending so deeply in 2010. Long-term growth needs long-term investment – an extra £15 billion over the next Parliament will go someway to redress the shortfall. From Corin Taylor, senior economic adviser at the Institute of Directors British business has been crying out for increased spending on infrastructure, so today’s announcements are welcome if not game-changing. Improvements to the UK’s broadband infrastructure and to the road network need to happen as quickly as possible. The money is there – the delivery needs to follow. From Richard Abadie, global head of infrastructure and partner at accountants PwC Although there were no major surprises, we do now have a lot more detail and clarity over what spend is coming up over the next few years, which is very positive. However, some of the projects announced are projects that have been underway for several years such as CrossRail, Royal Liverpool Hospital and Mersey gateway bridge, so don't provide any new opportunity for the infrastructure industry. From Jon Hart, infrastructure partner at the law firm Pinsent Masons The chief secretary’s announcement has provided some good headlines in respect of new commitments to rail and road in particular. Some schemes may even enter procurement before next parliament. However, in terms of a real boost for the sector, most of the commitments are likely to be post 2015, which for jobs and investments is very disappointing. From Frances O'Grady, TUC general secretary If the UK is to secure strong growth we need significant investment and while today’s news of how previously-announced budgets will be spent brings much-needed capital expenditure a step closer, it is still too little too late. Although setting out major infrastructure projects in advance may give industry more confidence to begin to invest in training and research so that they are ready when the time comes for contracts to be awarded, our economic problems are huge and require far more immediate attention. The UK needs policies to boost growth and jobs now rather than in two years time. For all the talk of grand projects, the reality is that capital spending has been cut by almost half since 2010. Not only has this made life incredibly tough for construction firms, it has also added to our economic stagnation and the huge squeeze on living standards. From Stephen Joseph, chief executive at Campaign for Better Transport The government’s £28bn of road-building plans are a colossal transport policy error. Particularly worrying is the new aim of dualling a large proportion of the Highways Agency network, to look again at environmentally disastrous schemes around Stonehenge and along the south coast, and the decision to end any guaranteed funding for green transport outside London. From Andrew Pendleton, head of campaigns at Friends of the Earth Today’s deluge of announcements can’t wash away the fact that the government is failing to deliver the clean energy transformation we need for our economy and environment. Instead George Osborne is betting the farm on fracking - over-hyping its potential and lavishing it with tax breaks, whilst slashing environmental regulations.\" Meanwhile, the Government is breaking the terms of its coalition agreement by offering yet another public subsidy for over-priced nuclear power. From Centrepoint chief executive Seyi Obakin By linking rent increases to CPI rather than RPI and funding new homes that few will be able to afford, the government has missed yet another opportunity to tackle the housing crisis. Enough new homes will simply not be built fast enough, at a price genuinely within reach, to meet the massive level of need. Sadly today’s announcement is a drop in the ocean. More on burger-gate. Gordon Brown's former spin doctor, Damian McBride, says Brown didn't splash out on a posh burger while putting the finishing touches to his spending reviews. And this is form Juliette Garside on broadband. Bad news for broadband. It looks like UK homes in hard to reach rural areas will be stuck in digital limbo for four more years. There are 5m homes that can't get a basic 2 megabits per second at the moment. That's the minimum needed to watch video, like the taxpayer funded BBC iPlayer. A third of the country can't get superfast broadband (anything over 24 megabits per second). The plan was to give 90% of premises access to superfast by the next general election in 2015, but Danny Alexander has now scrapped that. The new plan is for superfast internet to reach 95% of the population by 2017 – 1.4m more homes than originally intended, but two years later than promised. That means the rural broadband project, first announced in December 2010, will have taken up to seven years to complete. For the final 5%, Alexander said government would “work closely with industry to ensure that at least 99% have access to superfast broadband” by 2018, whether through fixed or wireless networks, or 4G mobile phone masts. It also looks like the final tranche of money for rural broadband - some £300m - promised in 2010 has now been cut by £50m, although officials say the missing money is still in the pot, it just hasn't been allocated. This is from my colleague Patrick Butler. There are some sighs of relief that the coalition - at last - appears to be taking affordable housing seriously, and that public investment is needed to tackle the UK’s chronic housing shortage. Treasury secretary Danny Alexander’s announcement of £3bn capital investment in 165k new affordable homes over the three years from 2015-16 was greeted by the Chartered Institute of Housing as a sign that housing had been “recognised as a national priority”. Alexander made it clear that housing was a key part of the the national infrastructure plan, a vital generator of jobs, growth, and labour market flexibility. There’s an implicit admission too, that the coalition has done little better than Labour in failing to address the problem. So in addition to the affordable housing £3bn, there’s a fresh attempt to sell-off under-used public sector land, to build, in theory, as many as 100,000 homes; loan finance for homes built for private sector rent; and support for home ownership through the Help to Buy policy, which has delivered 4,000 homes in its first two months. Social rents would be set for the next decade at Consumer Prices Index plus 1%, a stable formula designed to attract and reassure private financiers to invest in social housing. But will it build enough homes to ease the pressure? The coalition may have recognised that the State has a role to play, but it is still instinctively seeking privately financed solutions. Local authorities are disappointed that the government refused to listen to their calls to be allowed to borrow money to build homes. Councils are building 15,000 homes already; lift centrally-imposed borrowing limits, they argue, and they could leverage £7bn against their assets, enabling them to build an extra 60,000 affordable homes. • Labour has dismissed a £100bn infrastructure spending programme described by Danny Alexander, the chief secretary to the Treasury, as \"the most comprehensive, ambitious and long-lasting capital investment [plan] this county has every known\". Chris Leslie, a shadow Treasury minister, said it was just \"hot air\". Under the plan, the government will unlock investment in nuclear power by offering £10bn of guarantees to investors in a new power station at Hinkley Point. The Department for Education said the school building plans would create 500,000 extra school places between 2015 and 2021. Chris Grayling, the justice secretary, said the announcement would allow him to build a £250m super-prison in north Wales, holding up to 2,000 inmates. Osborne also said the student loan book would be privatised before 2020. (See 12.17pm.) • The Institute for Fiscal Studies has said that George Osborne was wrong to say that the coalition's record on investment was better than Labour's. At a briefing, it also suggested that taxes might have to rise by £6bn after the general election. (See 1.57pm.) • The Office for National Statistics has revealed that Britain avoided a double-dip recession in 2011 but suffered a deeper than first estimated collapse in output following the financial crash. • Doreen Lawrence has called for a public inquiry into revelations that the police wanted undercover officers to collect \"dirt\" on her family after the murder of her son Stephen. She said a meeting she had with Theresa May, the home secretary, today was \"promising, very promising\". • A survey has discovered that the UK's reserves of shale gas are much larger than previously thought. • Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, has refused to condemn the coalition's plan to make people wait seven days before they can claim jobseeker's allowance. In an interview, he said Labour would have to study the idea before deciding whether to support or oppose it. (See 10.20am.) But one Labour MP, Barry Sheerman, criticised his stance on Twitter. •The Department for Work and Pensions has released figures showing that the work programme is failing to meet its targets. Its report (pdf) says: In this second financial year (April 2012 – March 2013) the contractual performance level for the JSA 18 to 24, JSA 25 and over and ESA new customers Payment Groups were 31.9%, 27.3% and 5.3% respectively. This was against a Minimum Performance Level of 33%, 27.5% and 16.5% for each group respectively. Liam Byrne, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said: The work programme is still failing and failing badly. Three years into the parliament it’s failed over a million people. That’s nearly nine out of ten people on this flagship programme. Worse of all, the government missed every single one of its minimum targets and in nearly half the country, the work programme is literally worse than doing nothing. No wonder the benefits bill is £20bn higher than planned and no wonder the chancellor himself was forced to attack 'under-performing' back to work programmes. • Nick Clegg has said he does not knowingly give his children GM food. • Len McCluskey, the Unite general secretary, has complained that his union is the victim of a \"behind-the-scenes smear campaign\" run by Labour in relation to the selection of a parliamentary candidate in Falkirk. He also said the union might take legal action to challenge Labour's decision to stop new members of the constitutency party voting in the selection. • Representatives of Britain's doctors have backed calls for hospitals to stop selling junk food anywhere on their premises, including in shops, cafes and vending machines. • George Osborne has defended his decision to order a £10 burger when working late on his spending review instead of a cheaper one from McDonald's. • Thousands of teachers have been staging a one-day walkout in the first of a new wave of strikes over pay, pensions and conditions. The Press Association has now filed a story on the IFS briefing.] Here's how it starts. The government could be forced to raise £6 billion in new taxes after the general election in 2015 despite Chancellor George Osborne's latest round of spending cuts, experts have warned. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said that, despite the £11.5 billion worth of reductions for 2015/16 set out yesterday by Osborne, savings of a similar magnitude had already been pencilled in for the following two years. IFS director Paul Johnson said there would have to be a \"serious debate\" on whether fiscal retrenchment on such a scale could be achieved through more spending cuts alone or whether taxes would have to rise as well. He said ministers had previously said that 80% of the savings needed would come from spending cuts and from 20% tax cuts, but the measures set out in the spending review had shifted the balance to an 85/15 split. He said the public sector was already on course to have shed one million jobs by 2017-18 compared with 2010 when the coalition came to power. \"At almost any other moment in the past 60 years, announcements of spending cuts of this scale would have created a storm,\" he said. \"At some point we are going to have to have a serious debate about whether all the rest of the fiscal consolidation is really going to happen through spending cuts alone. \"Returning to an 80/20 split for the consolidation as a whole would mean a £6 billion tax increase in the next parliament. Coincidentally this is pretty close to the average tax increase seen in post-election budgets in recent decades.\" The IFS says George Osborne was wrong to claim that the coalition's record on investment was better than Labour's. From Kaye Wiggins, a correspondent for LGCplus More from the IFS. From the Daily Telegraph's Steven Swinford From John Morgan, from Times Higher Education This is from Channel 4 News' economics editor Faisal Islam. The IFS is holding a briefing on the spending review. I'm not there but, thanks to the wonders of Twitter, I hope to bring you the highlights. As soon as their documents are on their website, I'll post a link. From Mark Broad, a BBC economics producer My colleague Gwyn Topham has sent me a note about the transports plans in Danny Alexander's announcement. As far as transport goes, this was very much one for the motorists. Danny Alexander might have stressed the massive investment in road and rail but on the latter there was virtually nothing new bar a couple of small electrification projects (although both very welcome in London and the Lake District) - most of the improvements are in Network Rail's current plan. The really striking numbers in the detail is how much of the money will be sucked up by HS2 - spending which will outstrip that of each of Network Rail and the Highways Agency by 2020, and of local authority and London spend combined. With £4bn plus a year being committed 13 years before the route is finished, you wonder whether even yesterday's shocking budget hike will eventually quite do it. Much of the enhanced road budget - £28bn over six years - has still not been committed, bar perhaps the A14's £1.5bn, a scheme the coalition canned in 2010 to revamp the key arterial route from the ports in the east to central motorways and freight depots. And the spend is again weighted to the back end, disappointing those who want the economic stimulus now. In fairness, new road projects take time to plan - but road lobbyists groaned to discover Alexander was only promising further feasibility studies on the endlessly discussed A303 and other routes he mentioned. The pothole fund appears to be a big cash injection, and will please drivers. But the real key will be the promised legislation to make the Highways Agency an independent publicly-owned corporation - a kind of Network Rail for the roads, with long-term goals and funding settlements that won't be chopped by chancellors at will. That would make new roads, for better or worse, definitely happen. And here's the formal response from Labour. It's a statement from Chris Leslie, the shadow Treasury minister. This government is totally failing to deliver on infrastructure. Just 7 out of 576 projects in the government’s last plan have been completed and 80 per cent haven’t even started construction. No infrastructure investment has been brought forward this year or next year, as the IMF has demanded. And for all the hype, the government is actually cutting investment in real terms by 1.7 per cent in 2015. If the government is finally recognising that long-term investment in infrastructure is good for our economy, they should bring it forward this year and next. We should be building more affordable homes, improving transport links and repairing Britain’s broken roads right now to create jobs, strengthen our economy and get a long-term return. We need diggers in the ground right now, not more empty promises. Here's some reaction to the infrastructure announcement. It's most from business, and some of it is a bit sceptical. From Adam Marshall, director of policy at the British Chambers of Commerce Infrastructure projects are too often promised and too rarely delivered in this country, and that cycle must be broken. If these announcements are to translate into short-term confidence, medium-term construction jobs and long-term competitiveness, the Whitehall machine must be judged by the number of diggers on the ground, not strategies and press notices. Business is pleased that the chancellor and his team have given ‘forward guidance’ on infrastructure spending. While the numbers are nowhere near enough to overcome Britain’s infrastructure deficit, the fact that they are set out over a longer period helps. Now, ministers must focus on de-risking infrastructure investment for private money, to bring institutional investors and pension funds from across the world to the table. From David Orr, chief executive of the National Housing Federation The Government has recognised that public investment is required if we are to build more of the affordable homes which are so desperately needed by the millions of people struggling to afford a home of their own. But the £3bn over three years announced today is in reality a further disappointing cut in subsidy and won’t deliver the ambitious house building programme we need. The lack of investment in housing is now acting as a brake to growth in other parts of the economy. We welcome the plans to sell-off £5bn-worth of publicly owned land which could be used potentially for housing and look forward to hearing more as to how this will be distributed. The Government’s confirmation that rents will rise by CPI +1% for 10 years is welcome, but we need to discuss the fine detail of how this will operate in practice if it is to enable housing associations to plan with confidence. From Nick Prior, head of infrastructure for the businss consultants Deloitte The chief secretary’s announcements, particularly around energy and investment in the road network, are broadly positive. The visibility over investment in road and rail projects is welcome and will allow for better economic planning. There is little here that we hadn’t heard already and there may be scepticism in the sector about turning this rhetoric into reality. Most of the measures and money announced will not take effect until 2015 or beyond. The construction industry and the broader economy will be disappointed in today’s announcement as we will only see an economic boost when the shovels hit the ground on these projects. From Ian Shrubsall, head of infrastructure at the property consultants GL Hearn Potentially significant sums are available for new infrastructure, and changes to the administration of funding may help, but to replicate the Olympic infrastructure success there needs to be a sea change in approach to set the same kind of immovable deadlines for delivery – there needs to be an end to the culture of programme ‘slippage’ on major projects. The proposals for a multi-billion pound guarantee to advance the new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point could help get this vital new energy project over the line on its financial investment Decision, but this and other new nuclear projects still hinge on the electricity ‘strike price’ being agreed with government. From Dana Tobak, managing director of the broadband Hyperoptic The announcement of a renewed government effort to propel the UK into the future by investing in broadband infrastructure is welcome news. Given the particular importance of TMT [technology, media and telecommunications] businesses in driving future economic growth, it is absolutely critical that the UK future proof its infrastructure beyond just roads and rail. The UK is, in fact, significantly lagging when it comes to fibre-to-the-home access, with Spain, Italy and France all boasting greater penetration and availability of fibre connections, according to the FTTH Council Europe. It is also a widespread misconception that cities have the greatest universal access to the fastest broadband, when the reality is that long line lengths, exchange-only lines, and reliance on poor quality aluminium-based cabling frequently create ‘not spots’ and other serious connectivity issues. From Colin Stanbridge, chief executive at the London Chamber of Commerce It is disappointing for businesses and residents in east London that the Chief Secretary to the Treasury failed to address the desperate need for a new bridge in east London as part of his announcement on infrastructure spending today. Economic growth in east London will help drive growth across the city and it is vital that we get on and build the bridge in order to truly realise the potential of this part of the capital. From Ian Brinkley, director of the Work Foundation The infrastructure statement is a welcome announcement of the government’s long-term commitment to public investment. However, there is a disconnect between the figures for planned public sector gross investment published yesterday (which show a small real terms fall of just under 2% comparing 2014-15 and 2015-2016) and these longer term ambitions. If there is a sound economic argument to invest more in social housing and road maintenance from 2016-2017 onwards, it must make just as much sense to invest in these projects from 2014-2015 onwards. Giving local authorities the means to tackle the poor repair of our roads now will create many “shovel ready” projects, generating much needed jobs in construction and related sectors, and help save future maintenance bills. This was an extraordinary statement. Until today Gordon Brown was seen as Westminster's champion hyperbole merchant - the politician most skilled at producing impressive-sounding claims - but Danny Alexander has surely surpassed him. I don't think I've ever heard so many bold boasts in a statement. You could be forgiven for thinking that he's just announce the Tory/Lib Dem version of Roosevelt's New Deal. Here's an example. Today I announce the most comprehensive, ambitious and long-lasting capital investment plans this country has ever known ... So we can guarantee £300 billion of capital spending by the end of the decade. Today I can set out our plans for over £100 billion of this for the infrastructure of our country. The biggest public housing programme for over twenty years. The largest programme of rail investment since Victorian times. The greatest investment in our roads since the 1970s. Fast online access for the whole country. From this, it sounds as if the entire UK is going to be transformed into a north European version of Shanghai. Yes, as Labour MPs get pointing out in the statement, the actual figures on capital spending are less impressive. In the Guardian Heather Stewart explains that infrastructure spending for 2015-16 has not gone up at all. Alexander has managed to produce some dramatic headline figures because he is looking far beyond the normal spending horizon and describing plans going up to 2020 and beyond. No wonder it all sounds so good. Given the long timescale, there must be a doubt about how much of this will actually be delivered. Still, some of it probably will be. Here's a summary of what Alexander announced. Energy • Alexander said the government was issuing guarantees that would allow the new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point to go ahead. • He said strike prices for renewable energy were being published. • He said the green investment bank was getting an extra £800m in funding. And from 2015-16 it would be allowed to borrow £500m, he said. Rail • He said the total budget for high speed rail was £50bn. We want a High Speed Line that connects 8 of the UK’s 10 biggest cities, making daily commuting between them possible for the first time. And so today we provide the long term financial certainty for High Speed 2, setting a funding envelope of £42.6 billion for construction costs and £7.5 billion for rolling stock [in 2011 prices]. And we are setting a clear budget for the scheme of £16 billion for the next Parliament. • He said 850 miles of railway were being electrified. Roads • He said £10bn would be spent on road repairs between 2015-16 and 2020-21. We will take action to fix the backlog of maintenance, which has left road surfaces in communities up and down the country crumbling. We are committing £10 billion of investment in road repairs between 2015-16 and 2020-21. More than £4 billion of that money will be spent on national road maintenance – enough to resurface over 21,000 miles of road; the equivalent of London to Beijing and back. The other £6 billion of that money will be spent at a local level – allowing Local Authorities to fill the equivalent of 19 million pot holes a year. • He said an extra two lanes were being added to busy motorways - bringing another 221 lane miles into use. • He said work on the A14 scheme between Huntingdon and Cambridge would start two years early, in 2016. Other road scheme were going ahead too, he said. I can confirm today that there is more: *The A19 between Newcastle and South Shields; *The A63 in Hull; *The M6 junctions between Birmingham and Manchester; *The M5 junctions Bromsgrove to Worcester; *The A38 Derby Junctions *The M1 junction near Long Eaton and south of Rugby; *The A21 Tonbridge to Pembury *Junctions on the M4 *The M23 Gatwick junctions; and *The A27 Chichester bypass. Thirdly, this money will pay for us to identify and deliver solutions for the most notorious problem spots across the country. Any Honourable Member – from the Prime Minister down – who lives in Cornwall, or has driven there for their holidays will want to see a better A303. Any Honourable Member planning a future trip to Scotland – a Scotland as part of a strong United Kingdom – will want to see a better A1 north of Newcastle. And we will also look at the A27 corridor, the trans-Pennine route, and connectivity to Leeds Airport. Flood protection • He said £370m would be spent on flood defences in 2015. That would increase in real terms every year to 2020. Some 400,000 homes would be protected. • He said the government had discussed a deal with the insurance industry to ensure they limit insurance prices for homes in high risk areas. Up to 500,000 homes would benefit from the scheme, called Flood Re. Those on lower incomes would get extra help. This would be funded by a levy on insurers, and the industry says costs will not generally be passed on to customers. But details have not been finalised. Alexander also said the government was taking reserve powers to regulate for affordable flood insurance if that proves necessary. These powers will be in the water bill. Regional growth fund • He said an extra £600m was being put into the regional growth fund. Asset sales • He said the government wanted to sell assets worth £15bn by 2020. Some £10bn would come from corporate and financial assets like the student loan book. Another £5bn would come from land and property. Broadband • He said £250m would be spent ensuring fixed superfast broadband reaches 95% of the population by 2017. Housing • He said £3bn would be set aside over three years from 2015 to fund 165,000 affordable homes. • He said social rents would be set at CPI plus 1% until 2025. This was the longest period ever, and would give certainty to housing associations. Efficiency measures • He announced plans for 2015-16 to make the public sector more efficent. £25m will be invested in the best digital equipment for our police. £100m will be invested in a new prison in North Wales – a scheme which will eventually save £20m every year. And more than £200m is being invested over three years to increase the digitisation of HMRC’s customer services – a move that will save over £50m every year in administrative costs. • He said there would be a further \"efficiency review\" of all Whitehall departments and that he would \"strengthen financial management capability\" in government. Here is the full text of Danny Alexander's speech. And here is the Treasury news release. The policy paper, Investing in the Future, is listed on the website, but the link does not seem to be working yet. I'll post a summary shortly. Responding to Leslie, Alexander says he should have apologised for the fact that today's ONS figures (see 9.56am) show that the hole Labour left in the economy was even bigger than thought. In 2008 the economy shrank by 7.2%, not 6.3% as thought. Leslie asks if the government regrets scrapping Labour's Building Schools for the Future programme. Why won't the government follow the advice of the IMF? Why won't the government admit it is cutting capital spending? Look at table 2 on page 11 of the spending review document, Leslie says. Leslie moves on to questions. Can Alexander confirm that housing completions are at their lowest level since the 1920s? What is the government doing to stop planning permission times lengthening? Leslie says Alexander is announcing the Mersey Gateway project again. And George Osborne announced the A14 project years ago. Chris Leslie, the shadow Treasury minister, is replying. \"What a lot of hot air,\" he says. All the evidence shows that they are failing to deliver. As John Cridland, the director general of the CBI said yesterday, the government needs to go further and faster. Even Nick Clegg made the same point, Leslie says. Leslie says this is the slowest recovery for a century. The Treasury's perfomance on capital infrastructure is \"lamentable\", he says. Leslie says 18 months ago David Cameron said he would unblock the system. But that did not happen. Alexander says this is an ambitious plan to build an infrastructure of which Britain can be proud. Alexander says the government is putting an extra £800m into the green investment bank. It is also giving the green investment bank the right to borrow £500m from the government in 2015-16. Alexander says \"strike prices\" for renewable energy are being published today. There are broadly similar to the prices that would be paid under the renewables obligation. Alexander says he was brought up on a Hebridean island where there was no mains electricity. The government wants to improve energy supply, he says. He mentions the Shale gas reserves report. It shows Britain could produce almost as much hot air in a year as the shadow chancellor. Alexander says the government is developing the cars of the future. Fixed, super-fast broadband is being extended, he says. A further £250m is being spend to ensure that fixed, super-fast broadband reaches 95% of the population by 2017. Labour left the road network \"on the hard shoulder\", he says. The coalition is moving it into the fast line, he says. Alexander says he is announcing the biggest programme of investment in roads for 14 years. More than £4bn will be spent on road maintenance. That will pay for improvements to 21,000 miles of road - the equivalent of London to Beijing and back. He also announces a string of improvements, including to parts of the A19, the A63, the M6, the M5, the A38, the A21, the M4 and the Chichester bypass. Back to Alexander, who says he is setting a budget of £16bn for high speed rail within the next parliament. This will \"change the economic geography of this country\", he says. The coalition is the most pro-rail government in history, he says. Matt Chorley has a cruel sense of humour. More people are using rail than at any time since 1927, he says. Investment announced today will bring new life to the rail network. Some 850 miles of railway are being electrified. Labour managed nine miles in 13 years. Alexander says at least £20bn will be under the control of local enterprise partnerships by 2020. An extra £600m is being put into the regional growth fund, he says. Alexander says social rents will be set at CPI plus 1% until 2025. That will give the social housing sector certainty, he says. The coalition's approach will get twice as many homes built for the amount of money put in as Labour's, he says. There will be money for flood insurance, he says. The government has reached an agreement with the insurance industry on a scheme for people living in areas prone to flooding. Some 500,000 homes will be helped. The industry has said that costs will not be passed on to general customers. Alexander says the government many need to give this legislative backing. It is taking powers in the water bill. Alexander says many schools need repairing. The Labour government stopped even checking which governments needed repair, he says. A further £150m will be spend on health research infrastructure, he says. Alexander says the Olympic Games were a success. Lord Deighton, who oversaw that, is now working for the government on infrastructure. Today the government will accept his recommendation that the private sector should have a greater role in these projects. He says he can today announce guarantees that will allow the Mersey Bridge and the Hinkley Point nuclear power station to go ahead. Alexander says the government should not be hoarding land. He will invited community groups to identify unused bits of land. Unless the government can come up with a good reason why the land should stay in public ownership, it will be sold at a fair price, he says. Danny Alexander, the chief secretary to the Treasury, is making his statement about infrastructure spending. Past governments have prioritised short-term needs over the long-term interests of the country, he says. He says he is turning that around. He is announcing the most comprehensive, long-lasting investment programme the country has seen. The government will spend £300bn on capital spending by the end of the decade, he says. He will give details of programmes worth £100bn. This will be the biggest programme of public housing for 20 years, the biggest rail programme since Victorian times, the biggest road building programme since the 1970s and a vast expansion of online access. And here are the main points from the Ed Balls' interviews. I've taken the quotes from the Press Association and from PoliticsHome. • Balls said Labour would study the case for making claimants wait seven days before being allowed to claim jobseeker's allowance before the party made up its mind about whether or not to support it. He was not opposed in principle, Balls said. We will need to look very carefully at what this means. We'd supported when we were in government a three-day wait, so the principle of a wait is fine. With the move from three to seven days we need to know how much money will be saved, who from and how it would work. If this is a blank cheque to Wonga and other payday loan companies, that would be a very bad thing. If, on the other hand, it's a sensible way to focus on job search, it might not be ... Who would end up paying, if anybody? Would it raise any money? This needs to be investigated. • He criticised David Cameron and George Osborne for using \"nasty, divisive rhetoric\" on welfare. He said it was wrong for them to describe claimants as \"feckless workshy people hiding behind the curtains\" when many claimants are employed or pensioners. And he described Cameron's decision to link the case of Karen Matthews - who was convicted of kidnapping her own daughter - with the welfare bill as \"possibly the most depressing and shameful moment of all my time in politics\". • Balls said that Labour would be fairer on welfare than the coalition - but also tougher too in some respects. Labour would be tougher because it would force the long-term unemployed to take a job, he said. We've had a whole series of announcements from the government over the last three years which claimed to save money but ended up not working and being ineffective. The welfare and social security bill has been rising. I think it's important that we find ways of saving money if we can, but in a fair way. I would have a compulsory jobs guarantee which would mean that every young person at 12 months unemployment would have to take a job, and there would be a job for the long-term unemployed at two years. We would pay for that by a tax on bank bonuses. I think that would be tougher than the government but it would also get people back to work and save money. • He said that in some areas of welfare policy the coalition was trying to catch up with Labour. Labour has already backed an overall welfare cap, he said. And Balls called for wealthy pensioners to lose their winter fuel payments before Osborne suggested he was interested in the idea, he said. • He suggested that police cuts should not go any further. It’s a good thing that crime is coming down, and I think there’s a real issue about it going onto the internet. But do your viewers really think, having lost 15,000 police officers already this parliament, we’d lose another 10,000 constables, is that a good thing? I’m not sure. • He said the £100bn infrastracture programme being announced today was starting too late. The problem is none of it starts for four years. They should do an immediate boost for housing and transport this year and next. George Osborne talks about capital spending but he's not actually acting. The Danny Alexander infrastructure statement is at 10.30am, not 11.30am as I thought earlier. The double-dip recession never happened, the Office for National Statistics is saying today. The Press Association has filed this. Britain's double-dip recession was erased from history today after widespread revisions to official data. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the nine-month contraction at the end of 2011 and beginning of 2012 never happened thanks to a stronger-than-reported performance from the construction sector in the first quarter of last year. But the ONS revealed the initial recession following the financial crisis was far worse than first feared, with gross domestic product (GDP) now estimated to have plunged by 7.2% from peak to trough, against a 6.3% fall previously recorded. Here's the Office for National Statistics news release. And here's the statistical bulletin with the full details (pdf). Here are the main points from the various interviews that George Osborne has given this morning. I've taken some of the quotes from the Press Association and PoliticsHome. • Osborne defended the decision to make claimants wait seven days before they can claim jobseeker's allowance. “There are lots of other countries in the world – compassionate countries – who do this,\" he said. He also said that the money saved would be reinvested so that job centres provide a better service. \"So, net, I think it’s going to help people looking for work,\" he said. • He said there would be more \"difficult choices\" after 2015. Whoever is elected, and obviously I hope it’s the Conservatives, of course we’re going to face more difficult choices – we’re not out of the period of our history where we have to confront difficult choices on spending, and I think we will have to undertake further reforms. • He did not rule out putting up taxes after 2015 if the Tories won the election - but he strongly suggested that he would want to avoid doing so. It would be \"very silly\" making a firm guarantee, he said. But he also said that he expected this to be an issue at the general election. This will be an issue, I suspect, eventually when people come to choose their next government because my political opponents would probably want to put taxes up, my instinct is let’s try and control welfare bills, let’s try and control the cost of what we’re doing. Just putting more and more taxes on people is not really the right answer. • He said there was scope for more reform in the criminal justice system. He cited this as an example of an area where there could be further changes beyond 2015. Let me give you one example - the criminal justice system. We are starting to reform that now, but it is still hugely inefficient. I think you can get a better service for victims, you could actually do such a thing as a better service for those on trial, and you could do it at less cost. • He defended his decision to buy a burger from the upmarket chain Byron. The Sun has splashed on the story, saying Osborne was was \"ridiculed last night for trying to appear a man of the people — eating a posh hamburger costing nearly a TENNER\". Osborne said that he could not get a burger from McDonald's, which is nearer to the Treasury than Byron, because he was working late in the office and \"McDonalds' doesn't deliver\". And he explained why he posted the picture of him eating the burger on Twitter. As a politician you've got this dilemma, which is the only thing people see of you is you're in the House of Commons, in a TV studio. The point about Twitter is to try and tell people more about what you're doing every day, and there I am working late on my speech, and I've got a takeaway hamburger, but it puts you on the front page of the Sun. It's an occupational hazard. • He said that his spending review was \"not an election pitch\". (This line has been greeted with some scepticism - see 8.25am and 8.43am.) • He said there would be a \"real economic crisis\" if Britain abandoned the economic plan set out by the government. • He confirmed that the announcement about capital spending in the spending review was a reannouncement It was a reannouncement, but I reject the characterisation of it as Gordon Brown-esque because I was very clear that we’d set this out in the budget. • He said that he wanted fracking to develop \"as quickly as possible\" and that he wanted local communities to benefit. He was commenting on the report out today showing that Britain's shale gas reserves are much bigger than people thought. It is about cheaper energy for this country for many, many years to come. It's not happening right now, so we have got to get the right planning permission and make sure that communities benefit from it. There is already work going on in Lancashire. I want this to happen as quickly as possible, provided we are clear that it is environmentally safe - and I think we are clear about that - and we have got to get planning permission. We are saying local communities must benefit from this new form of energy and should get at least £100,000 for every fracking well created. We are making sure communities feel part of it. Ultimately, what it means is their gas bill is cheaper, the cost of heating their home is cheaper. That's why it is so important. Nick Clegg gets burgers from Byron too. Asked when he last bought a burger, he says it was a posh burger from Byron in Fulham. He went there with his children after going to the cinema, he says. But they really went there for the Oreo Milkshake, he says. On Call Clegg, Nick Clegg says he does not knowingly feed his children GM food. You should be cautious, he says, but you should be led by the science. There is no commercial growing of GM good in the UK, so it is not an issue, he says. He takes a \"science-based, precautionary approach\". But he would not say no to GM food forever. On Call Clegg Nick Clegg has just said that he will be meeting Duwayne Brooks, the friend who was with Stephen Lawrence when he was murdered, to discuss the way the police bugged a meeting they had with Brooks and his lawyer. Brooks (who is now a Lib Dem councillor) just wants to find out the truth about what happened quickly, Clegg said. Clegg also said he had \"an open mind\" on whether there should be a judicial inquiry. The existing inquiries could \"accelerate\" their work, and publish interim reports, he said. The truth should come out quickly. It was bad to let things \"fester\", he said. The Conservative MP Nadine Dorries says she is going to stop claiming parliamentary expenses, Sky reports. Here's some Twitter reaction to George Osborne's Today interview. From Chuka Umunna, the shadow business secretary From Stewart Wood, Ed Miliband's adviser and a shadow minister without portfolio From the Guardian's Nicholas Watt From the New Statesman's George Eaton From Sunder Katwala, director of British Future The cuts announced yesterday will not be enough to balance the budget after 2015. At least, that's what experts like the Institute for Fiscal Studies (see here) and the Resolution Foundation (see here) say. So where will the money come from if the Tories win the election? Evan Davis made a spirited attempt to find out - but George Osborne wasn't saying. I'll post some Twitter reaction, before putting up a full summary of everything Osborne and Ed Balls have been saying in their early morning interviews. Nick Robinson is now doing the post-match commentary. He says his \"eyebrow twitched\" when he heard Osborne say this was not an election pitch. (That's a polite way of saying that Osborne was fibbing.) Robinson says Davis did not give a clear answer about where the savings would come from after 2015. But the \"signals\" are there, he says. Welfare will be hit, and the winter fuel payment faces a squeeze. Q: Were you eating a \"posh\" burger [as the Sun reports] in the picture you posted on Twitter? Osborne says he uses Twitter to show people what he is doing. He was eating a burger. Davis says he is not going to get an answer on where the money will come from after 2015. Q: Was your announcement on capital spending yesterday a Brownesque announcement? Osborne says it was a reannouncement [ie, the capital spending totals had been announced before]. But he rejects the idea that he was copying Gordon Brown. And the details announced today will be new. Q: And the package will be £10bn lower than planned? Osborne says he is spending more than planned by Labour. Q: Can you see yourself raising taxes after the election? Or could you guarantee that you won't put them up after 2015? Osborne says he never makes guarantees about taxes. While some taxes went up after 2010, most of the savings came through cuts. Tax changes came early because they were easy to do. Spending cuts are harder. Q: If you don't raise the money from taxes, it will have to be from welfare. You have \"run out of road\" on savings from defence. Osborne says he is not just taking money from the vulnerable. Q: But the poorest have lost the second most. So shouldn't people worried about the poor vote Labour? Osborne says the government wants to help people at the bottom aspire to a better job and a better career. Labour just thought the best way to help these people was through tax credits. That did not help social mobility. On most measures, social mobility got worse. Anyone in politics wants to improve people's lives, says Osborne. But how you do it is an important question. Q: You are not going to be able to repeat this spending review, with similar cuts, two more times. How would you get borrowing down if you won the election? Osborne says whoever wins the election will have to take difficult decisions. There is scope for more reform, he says. For example, in criminal justice, you could provide a better service for victims at lower cost, he says. Britain should not have to choose between good services that are unaffordable and bad services. The government should be able to provide good services at an affordable price. Evan Davis is interviewing George Osborne on the Today programme. Q: You've made this about welfare. Have the papers interpreted your spending review properly? Osborne says he is not responsible for headlines. But he did not just want to talk about spending. He introduced a welfare cap, and new conditions for jobseekers. Q: Anyone who wants to help those at the bottom should vote Labour, shouldn't they? Osborne says this is not an election pitch. He wants to reform the state in a progressive way. He talks about the pupil premium, more money for troubled families and help for social care. The rich have lost the most proportionally, he says. Often the day after a budget, or a spending review, is more interesting than the day of the announcement itself. People have had the chance to look at the detail, and now the heavy analysis emerges. It's also the day when we get interviews with the chancellor, and the verdict from the Institute for Fiscal Studies. We are getting all this today. George Osborne and Ed Balls are doing a range of interviews, and Osborne is about to be interviewed on the Today programme. We've also got a big statement from Danny Alexander, the chief secretary to the Treasury, about infrastructure investment. Here's the Guardian's story about the spending review. You can read all our coverage of it here, and yesterday's live blog here. Here's the agenda for the day. 8.10am: George Osborne is interviewed on the Today programme. 9am: Nick Clegg holds his Call Clegg LBC phone in. 10am: Sir Bernard-Hogan Howe, commissioner of the Metropolitan police, faces questions from the London assembly's policing committtee. Around 11.30am: Danny Alexander makes a statement in the Commons on infrastructure investment. 1pm: The Institute for Fiscal Studies holds a briefing on the spending review. As usual, I’ll also be covering all the breaking political news as well as looking at the papers and bringing you the best politics from the web. I’ll post a lunchtime summary before 1pm and another in the afternoon.

Onshore wind refers to turbines located on land, while offshore turbines are located out at sea or in freshwater. In the UK, the pros and cons of onshore wind energy, in comparison with other low-carbon and fossil fuel energy sources, have recently been the subject of debate in the press and among politicians. Onshore wind already plays a leading role in the generation of renewable electricity in the UK. In 2010, it generated around 7TWh – more than a quarter of the electricity provided by British renewables at that time and enough to save six million tonnes of CO2, according to government estimates. By 2020, onshore wind is expected to generate up to 30TWh. Onshore wind can therefore play a key role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions created by the UK's power sector – which will be crucial to meeting the UK's legally binding carbon budgets. Onshore wind has the advantage of being one of the most affordable renewable energy sources. Generating electricity from onshore wind turbines typically costs around 7–9p per kWh, which is around half the cost of offshore wind and a quarter of the costs of solar photovoltaic panels. It is also slightly cheaper, on average, than nuclear power. Onshore wind generation is still slightly more expensive than fossil fuels (generating electricity from gas power plants currently costs between 4.1 and 7.5 p/kWh), but its price is expected to fall in the coming years. Some emissions are created by the manufacture, transportation and installation of wind turbines, but these are considered fairly low. Additional emissions are attributed to the fact that wind energy (like solar and wave power) is intermittent, generating electricity only when the wind is blowing, and at sufficient strength. When wind strength is insufficient for turbines to operate, fossil-fuel-based power supply is needed as \"backup\". The current small proportion of renewable electricity in the UK market requires very little backup, but as the share increases additional backup will be needed. However, other technologies, such as inter-linkages with other countries' grids, energy storage and electricity demand management, are expected to help tackle intermittency in the future, so the overall future impact on emissions is considered relatively low. Onshore wind has been criticised for its visual impact. Although other power infrastructure, like fossil fuel and nuclear power stations, can also modify landscapes and habitats, onshore wind turbines are typically more spread out than other large-scale energy infrastructure projects and so can affect a larger area. Another criticism is that species such as birds and bats may also be affected by wind turbines – though bird fatalities due to turbine collisions are relatively low compared to other fatality causes, such as traffic and domestic cats. Impacts on wildlife can be minimised by careful site selection and by avoiding areas of high conservation or habitat value. A third potential issue is that turbines can contribute to noise pollution, but government studies find noise levels are comparatively low and should not significantly impact on nearby residents. New guidance is being drafted to inform future planning policy on noise issues. Environmental Impact Assessments review these kinds of potential impacts on a case-by-case basis and seek to protect unsuitable areas, such as those of high conservation or heritage value. In some cases, undesirable local impacts may make more expensive renewable technologies, such as offshore wind or solar, more attractive. The extra cost of offshore wind can be seen as the premium society is willing to pay in order to avoid the local environmental cost of onshore turbines. The choice between more affordable electricity (which would favour onshore wind) and local environmental protection (which may favour other low-carbon technologies) is ultimately a societal and political one. Given the economic and environmental trade-offs, technological uncertainty and the absence of one clear winner when it comes to energy sources, many economists suggest (pdf) the best approach is a portfolio of different technologies to balance the cost to consumers and environmental concerns. Onshore wind has a role to play in this energy mix and in helping the UK achieve its emission reduction targets. • This article was written by Samuela Bassi and Naomi Hicks of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at LSE in collaboration with the Guardian The ultimate climate change FAQ • This answer last updated: 10.07.12 • Read about the project and suggest a question • Report an error in this answer Related questions • What is the economic cost of climate change? • What is the Stern review? • Which nations are most responsible for climate change?

EnergySolutions will be charged with decontaminating the seawater that was used to cool the reactor as it went into meltdown, in the world's worst nuclear disaster since the Chernobyl accident in 1986. About 125,000 cubic metres of seawater – enough to fill 60 Olympic swimming pools – was used in an attempt to cool the reactor during the accident, and is now in storage. The clean-up contract is thought to be worth between £20m and £30m. The contaminated water contains as many as 60 different types of radioactive nuclides, which must be removed before the water can be returned to the sea. When processed, the level of nuclides in the water will be undetectable. EnergySolutions is in charge of decommissioning the UK's Magnox reactors, an early generation form of nuclear power that is now obsolete. The Fukushima nuclear incident, which occurred just over a year ago, followed the flooding of the plant after the devastating earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan and killed nearly 20,000 people, did not result in any direct fatalities. However, the meltdown prompted several governments – including Japan, Germany, Switzerland and Italy – to reconsider their commitment to nuclear power."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2013/feb/25/park-geun-hye-korean-president","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2013-02-25T06:32:53Z","webTitle":"Park Geun-hye takes office as South Korean president","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/25/park-geun-hye-korean-president","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/feb/25/park-geun-hye-korean-president","fields":{"headline":"Park Geun-hye takes office as South Korean president","bodyText":"South Korea's new president, Park Geun-hye, has called on North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons programme, as Pyongyang edges closer towards membership of the global club of nuclear states. Park, who was sworn in on Monday as South Korea's first female president, said she would not tolerate provocations from the North, which conducted its third nuclear test this month. \"North Korea's recent nuclear test is a challenge to the survival and future of the Korean people,\" Park, who was elected on 19 December, told a crowd of 70,000 people outside the national assembly building in Seoul. \"Make no mistake, the biggest victim will be none other than North Korea itself.\" Park's biggest foreign policy challenge will be to end five years of worsening ties with the North under her predecessor and fellow conservative, Lee Myung-bak, and persuade the regime to return to nuclear negotiations. She indicated that she could soften her predecessor's hardline stance if the North, under its young leader, Kim Jong-un, was willing to make concessions on its nuclear programme. \"I will not tolerate any action that threatens the lives of our people and the security of our nation,\" she said. \"I urge North Korea to abandon its nuclear ambitions without delay and embark on the path to peace and shared development.\" At home Park has promised sweeping economic reforms to bridge the growing income gap and address youth unemployment and a stagnant economy. The 61-year-old, who represents the conservative Saenuri party, promised to create jobs and build a \"creative\" economy that is less dependent on South Korea's dominant chaebol conglomerates. Park said she would bring about \"economic democratisation\" by prioritising job creation in IT and science and technology. She called on South Koreans to help her repeat the Miracle on the Han River – a reference to the rapid economic development seen under her father, Park Chung-hee, a military dictator who ruled the country in the 1960s and 70s before he was assassinated by his own spy chief in 1979. Five years earlier Park's mother, Yuk Young-soo, was shot dead by a North Korean agent, forcing her to return early from her studies in Paris to act as first lady at the age of 22. Her father continues to divide South Koreans to this day. Some credit him with dragging the country out of poverty after the 1950-53 Korean war and laying the foundations for its modern-day status as an export powerhouse. But others have never forgotten his brutal suppression of political opponents during 18 years of rule that began with a military coup in 1961. Park apologised to victims of her father's rule during last year's election campaign and benefited from generally warm feelings towards her mother, a popular first lady. Despite her conservative roots Park has made conciliatory gestures towards the North. She met the regime's former leader, Kim Jong-il, in Pyongyang in 2002 and noted in her 2007 autobiography that Kim had apologised for a failed raid on the South Korean presidential Blue House by 31 North Korean commandoes in 1968. North Korean state media marked her inauguration with a warning to the US and South Korea not to proceed with annual joint military drills. \"The US warmongers should think what consequence will be brought out for getting on the nerves of [North Korea], a dignified nuclear power,\" the North's Rodong Sinmun newspaper said in a commentary, adding that the allies would \"die in flames\" if they prepared to launched an invasion. John Delury, a North Korea experts at Yonsei University in Seoul, said a new era of engagement could be possible despite Pyongyang's nuclear programme and tougher sanctions from the UN security council. \"I don't think this latest spike in the cycle of provocation and response undermines her whole platform of seeking to somehow re-engage the North,\" Delury told Associated Press. Other experts, however, believe the North has set itself on the path to diplomatic gridlock and more regional tension. \"Normalisation of relations, a peace treaty, access to energy and economic opportunities those things that come from choosing electricity over bombs and have the potential of lifting the North Korean people out of poverty and hardship will be made much more difficult, if not impossible, for at least the next five years,\" Siegfried Hecker, a US scientist and regular visitor to North Korea, wrote on the website of Centre for International Security and Co-operation at Stanford University."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2013/sep/19/hassan-rouhani-vision-iran-free","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2013-09-19T18:59:16Z","webTitle":"Hassan Rouhani sets out his vision for a new and free Iran","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/19/hassan-rouhani-vision-iran-free","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/sep/19/hassan-rouhani-vision-iran-free","fields":{"headline":"Hassan Rouhani sets out his vision for a new and free Iran","bodyText":"President Hassan Rouhani has signalled his intention to lead a new Iran on to the international stage at the United Nations next week, laying out a manifesto for personal freedom at home and compromise abroad. \"We want the people in their private life to be completely free,\" the newly elected president told NBC News, after a string of prisoner releases. He also pledged to create a citizens' rights commission \"in the near future\". \"In today's world, having access to information and the right of free dialogue and the right to think freely is the right of all people, including the people of Iran,\" Rouhani said. Rouhani also vowed that Iran would never seek nuclear weapons and insisted his government had \"complete authority\" to resolve the 11-year international impasse over Iran's nuclear aspirations. The bold rhetoric, backed up by a series of concrete steps taken with the apparent backing of Iran's supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, has raised hopes of major diplomatic breakthroughs in the coming months, affecting the long-stalled nuclear negotiations and perhaps the Syrian conflict too. Optimism before Rouhani's debut on the world stage at the UN general assembly on Tuesday is tempered among western diplomats by uncertainty over the readiness of Khamenei to accept significant limits on the nuclear programme, long cherished by the regime as central to national prestige and dignity. Observers of the long deadlock between Iran and international community over Iran's uranium enrichment voiced concern over the west's ability to respond to Rouhani's overtures quickly enough to bolster his still-fragile control over the machinery of government \"I think he has significant leeway to reach a deal, but that this window of opportunity is limited. The approach must be step-by-step, but we need to see tangible progress in the months to come, otherwise hardliners will undercut Rouhani,\" said Mohammad Ali Shabani, a Tehran-based analyst. Rouhani, a Glasgow-educated pragmatist and former nuclear negotiator who decisively won presidential elections in June, has orchestrated a charm offensive before the general assembly, which his government clearly views as a critical moment for escaping the isolation exacerbated by his mercurial predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The new foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, is due to meet the British foreign secretary, William Hague, and the EU foreign policy chief, Lady Ashton, on Monday, to lay the groundwork for Rouhani's general assembly speech the next day. But Zarif arrived in New York five days early to network with diplomatic contacts largely made when he was ambassador to the UN a decade ago, under Iran's last moderate government. At a banquet on Wednesday, the deputy UN secretary general, Jan Eliason, reportedly hailed his quarter-century friendship with Zarif and welcomed Iranian willingness to cooperate. Over the past few weeks, Iranian officials have sent signals that they would be open to significant compromises on the nuclear programme that could pave the way to a deal. The head of the Iranian atomic organisation, Ali Akbar Salehi, suggested recently the country could accept the \"additional protocol\" of the International Atomic Energy Agency, which allows inspectors to visit sites other than those declared by the government as nuclear-related. That step is seen as essential by the IAEA in strengthened international confidence that there is no covert weapons programme running in parallel with the civil nuclear project. Diplomats and observers said the contours of a potential breakthrough nuclear deal were increasingly clear. Iran would agree to limit enrichment of uranium to 5% purity (good enough for nuclear power stations, but far short of weapons grade), get rid of its stockpile of 20%-enriched uranium, and agree to the additional protocol. In return, the west would lift a significant part of its sanctions regime and recognise Iran's right to enrich uranium as part of a complete nuclear fuel cycle. Shabani said he thought such a package would be acceptable to Tehran. However, it could still be extremely difficult to reach a deal given a long history of mutual distrust. The sequencing of mutual concessions would be subject of delicate negotiations as would be their irreversibility. In such talks, the White House would be hamstrung by the fact that most US sanctions are in the gift of Congress over which President Obama has limited sway. \"In Washington there is a question of who is in charge of Iran policy,\" said Jim Walsh, an expert on the Iranian nuclear programme at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Obama could use presidential waivers to suspend sanctions, but those waivers could subsequently be overridden by Congress, and would be consequently be of limited value to Tehran. \"This is going to question worth watching. If we go down this path and we can't deliver we are going to confirm all of Iran's worst suspicions about double-dealing,\" Walsh said.For the time being, Rouhani appears to have the supreme leader's backing. Earlier this week, Khamenei, talked about the virtues of \"heroic leniency\" in diplomacy in a speech to the revolutionary guard that was widely seen as providing Rouhani the political space to make a nuclear deal. Rouhani stressed the point in his NBC interview, saying: \"In its nuclear programme, this government enters with full power and has complete authority. We have sufficient political latitude to solve this problem.\"Observers fear that backing could evaporate if Rouhani is unable to deliver swift economic improvements in the form of loosening the sanctions which straitjacket on Iran. There are clear signs on the domestic stage at least that the supreme leader has delegated real power to the new president which Rouhani is rapidly putting into effect. Iranians have seen an almost daily series of changes that add up to a steady transformation of society since Rouhani's inauguration last month. A new pro-reform and pragmatic cabinet has restructured the senior management levels of major ministries, especially in the oil ministry, an important lever of power in a hydrocarbon-dependent economy. Last week, the ministry for culture and Islamic guidance ordered the re-opening of House of Cinema, home of the country's independent film industry, which was shut down under Ahmadinejad. Web users in Iran report a significant improvement in the internet speeds and availability as several new ministers like Zarif have embraced Facebook and Twitter, triggering speculation that the authorities will lift the filtering of social media. The release this week of a number of prominent activists – including the human rights lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh – has followed Rouhani's appointment of Seyed Mahmoud Alavi as intelligence minister. He has pledged to stay out Iranians private lives, and invited Iranians who left the country after the 2009 disputed elections to return provided they had not committed a criminal offence. Restrictions on local news agencies and newspapers seem to have eased recently with a few going as far as breaking the taboo on reporting the plight of political prisoners or the house arrests of opposition leaders. Thursday's headline in Tehran reflected the current feel-good atmosphere in Tehran. Etemaad, a reformist newspaper, carried a headline saying: \"Dismissal, freedom and championship,\" referring accordingly to the dismissal of the hardline head of Iran's Azad University, the release of prisoners and a victory of Iran's national freestyle wrestlers in world championship. Jafar Tofighi, the new acting minister of science, research and technology, has also replaced hardliners at the top of Iran's major universities and signalled that students previously ejected from universities as a result of political activism can now re-register. Ali Alizadeh, an Iranian political analyst based in London, said the governments reform were rooted in a new spirit of pragmatism forged by sanctions, deep social and political discontent and the weakening of Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria. \"The supreme leader … has implicitly restrained the Iranian hardliners and has given theological licence to retreat from what previously held the ideological edifice of the regime together: nuclear programme and lack of relations with the US,\" Alizadeh said. \"Unlike the last three governments, for the first time, the supreme leader, the government, major political factions of the regime and significant parts of the Iranian people are in temporary unison over a few important issues.\" Mohammad-Taghi Karroubi, son of the opposition leader under house arrest, Mehdi Karroubi, said the prisoner releases would strengthen Rouhani's position at the UN and give him more credibility. He did not think his father or fellow opposition leader, Mir Hossein Mousavi, would be released immediately but thought the steps taken by the government so far paved the way for their freedom. Rouhani's coups Softened diplomacy He heralds improved diplomatic relations with the west by an exchange of letters with Barack Obama and David Cameron in early August. Both Iran's supreme leader and Rouhani subsequently strike a newly conciliatory tone, seeming to signal Iran's readiness for a fresh chapter in diplomacy. Moderates promoted Rouhani appoints a new cabinet consisting of pro-reform moderates and pragmatists, naming the veteran US-educated Iranian diplomat Mohammad Javad Zarif as foreign minister. Several key officials belonging to Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's era are dismissed from posts in major ministries. Censorship eased On 12 September Iran's independent House of Cinema – the main film guild, shut down under Ahmadinejad – is reopened. Students previously banned from universities because of political activity are allowed to continue their education. Formerly tight restrictions on the media are eased, with some journalists reporting on the situation of political prisoners. Women's rights advanced Following the appointment of Marzieh Afkham as Iran's first female foreign ministry spokesperson and two women as deputies to the prime minister, 24-year-old Shirin Gerami this week became the first Iranian woman to race in triathlon under the Islamic republic's flag. Political prisoners released On Wednesday leading human rights lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh is released from jail, along with a number of other prominent political activists. This follows the easing of the terms of the house arrest of opposition leaders Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi, allowing them more frequent family visits."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2013/feb/24/moodys-downgrade-britain-credit-change-course","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2013-02-24T00:06:05Z","webTitle":"Britain's downgraded credit rating: Moody's wake-up call must trigger a change of course | Observer editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/feb/24/moodys-downgrade-britain-credit-change-course","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2013/feb/24/moodys-downgrade-britain-credit-change-course","fields":{"headline":"Britain's downgraded credit rating: Moody's wake-up call must trigger a change of course","bodyText":"For more than three years, the maintenance of Britain's AAA credit rating has been the explicit and totemic aim of economic policy. All the privations that Britain is suffering – its reduced armed forces, its roll-back of support for the needy, the cancelled projects to build roads, schools and hospitals, with much more to come – were all vital sacrifices, we were told, to sustain the low interest rates that come with a AAA credit rating. The shrinking of the \"bloated\" state and thus our debts would be the catalyst for recovery. This has been the mantra of not only George Osborne and the Conservatives, but their coalition partners and a whole gallery of cheerleaders including the Bank of England, the CBI, prominent business leaders, the bulk of the City and mainstream economic opinion. Now the credit rating agency Moody's has said that Britain no longer has AAA status. Britain's debts are too high and the prospect is for a prolonged period of subdued growth. The chancellor and his cheerleaders have led the country up a blind alley. There will be a concerted effort to argue it does not matter much: after all, both the US and France have suffered a similar downgrading. But those downgrades were well-deserved. Despite the US being the largest economy in the world, the credit rating agencies correctly diagnosed its unyielding political gridlock as a serious menace to its ability to solve its fiscal problems. They were surely right. Equally, France is in a worrying economic position. Its economy stagnates while its external and internal debts explode. Some regard it as a basket case. A downgrade cannot be so simply shrugged off. It matters – spelling out how international economic opinion rates an economy. It is not often wrong. This should be the trigger for a reassessment of economic policy, if not by the chancellor then certainly by everyone else. Osborne's reaction – that the downgrade only reinforces the necessity for not changing course – is the cry of the embattled but soon to be engulfed British chancellor over the decades. To insist there is no change of course is the precursor to loss of office. That is not to argue that a change of course is easy. There is no simple way to fix the banks, reduce the overhang of private debt, create genuine entrepreneurialism, unleash vitally needed investment and innovation, create a dynamic export sector and lift demand. We do know that the simple Osborne strategy – to try to eliminate the public structural deficit in four years as the catalyst to a private sector revival – is wholly misconceived. It has meant three years of stagnation, little inroad in lowering public borrowing because of the induced economic weakness and the loss of the very credit rating it was meant to preserve. But that does not mean the deficit can be ignored or that a misunderstood bastard Keynesianism of \"pump priming\" will offer a simple magic bullet alternative. What is required is a multi-pronged approach. The precondition is a much more flexible strategy to lowering the public deficit than that signalled by Osborne – matching the flexible approach to lowering inflation now adopted by the Bank of England. There should be a multibillion, multi-year programme of capital spending increases aimed at boosting demand. The government should adopt a target that combines both growth and inflation and work closely with the Bank of England to achieve it. There also needs to be wholesale reform of company structures. Last week, BAE Systems returned £1bn to its shareholders following Centrica's decision to return £600m to its shareholders. It is incredible that neither firm believes they can invest this money to support growth and employment. If Centrica believed in British energy policy, it would surely have committed those funds to building new nuclear power stations rather than pulling out of its joint venture with EDF, an energy policy compromised by Osborne's refusal to offer the framework necessary for long-term investment. That needs fixing, along with reform of the public limited company, so that directors have more committed shareholders as the platform for private long-term investment and innovation. Banks have to be offered the carrot of guarantees and the stick of public ownership to raise their lending game. There needs to be a skills mobilisation. There needs to be a clear identification of sectors that will lead to growth – life sciences, transport, space, value-added cars and aircraft – and public money put behind them. Above all, there needs to be energy, ambition and ideas. Moody's downgrade dramatises the urgent need for change."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2013/feb/04/sellafield-management-criticised-commons-committee","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-02-04T06:30:00Z","webTitle":"Sellafield management sharply criticised by Commons committee","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/feb/04/sellafield-management-criticised-commons-committee","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2013/feb/04/sellafield-management-criticised-commons-committee","fields":{"headline":"Sellafield management sharply criticised by Commons committee","bodyText":"The reputation of the nuclear industry faces further damage this week with the publication of a highly critical report on Monday on the management of the Sellafield plant in Cumbria, days before a court action over the illegal dumping of nuclear waste. The moves follow Cumbria county council's refusal last week to pursue plans to build a storage facility for radioactive materials needed, many believe, if Britain is to build new atomic power stations. The Commons public accounts committee report claims that Nuclear Management Partners (NMP), the private consortium managing Sellafield, has failed to stem rising costs and delays in dealing with waste and the decommissioning of facilities. Margaret Hodge MP, the committee's chair, said: \"Taxpayers are not getting a good deal from the [Nuclear Decommissioning] Authority [NDA] arrangement with Nuclear Management Partners. \"Last year the consortium was rewarded with £54m in fees despite only two out of 14 major projects being on track. \"It is unclear how long it will take to deal with hazardous radioactive waste at Sellafield or how much it will cost the taxpayer. Of the 14 current major projects, 12 were behind schedule in the last year and five of those were over budget. \"Furthermore, now that Cumbria county council has ruled out West Cumbria as the site of the proposed geological disposal facility, a solution to the problem of long-term storage of the waste is as far away as ever.\" The report, Nuclear Decommissioning Authority: Managing Risk at Sellafield, points out that about £1.6bn is being spent annually at the site, where a variety of hazardous materials – including 82 tonnes of plutonium – are kept. The total lifetime cost of dealing with this has continued to rise each year and has now reached £67.5bn. \"It is essential that the authority brings a real sense of urgency to its oversight of Sellafield so that the timetable for reducing risk does not slip further and costs do not continue to escalate year on year,\" says the report, from which some findings were released last November. The MPs' committee is suspicious that the NDA, a public sector body established to oversee the safe dismantling of the UK's old nuclear power stations and deal with waste, does not have a tight enough rein on NMP – a consortium made up of Amec of Britain, Areva of France and the US firm URS – to properly control costs. The report urges the NDA to work out how to better transfer more risk of failure to the private sector providers. The NDA said great progress had been made in what was one of the most complex nuclear sites to decommission. \"Of course, not everything has gone smoothly on such a complex and highly technical programme, and the report has rightly pointed to areas where we and the site need to do better,\" it said in a statement. \"We have a programme of improvements in place and continue to work with Sellafield Ltd and NMP to make continued progress across a broad front of safe operations and project delivery.\" Further criticism will be heaped on those managing Sellafield when a court case opens on Thursday that will look into claims the nuclear operator breached environmental permits in 2010 by dumping four bags of radioactive waste in a landfill at nearby Lillyhall without authorisation. Workington magistrates court, Cumbria, will consider nine charges, although the law has since changed to make it easier for Sellafield to dispose of certain low-level waste materials at Lilyhall. Management at Sellafield said they did not want to comment before the case, which has been brought by the Environment Agency and the Office for Nuclear Regulation. The government is currently trying to strike a deal with the French company EDF on a power pricing formula that would convince the company to proceed with new reactors at Hinkley Point in Somerset and elsewhere. But EDF and other companies interested in building atomic power stations know that any bad publicity around the industry will undermine already-shaky public confidence."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/dec/27/fukushima-radiation-child-obesity-fears","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-12-27T18:48:12Z","webTitle":"Fukushima radiation fears are linked to increase in obesity among children","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/dec/27/fukushima-radiation-child-obesity-fears","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/dec/27/fukushima-radiation-child-obesity-fears","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima radiation fears are linked to increase in obesity among children","bodyText":"Lingering fears of radiation have turned children from Fukushima into the most obese in Japan, according to a government study, as parents and schools continue to restrict the amount of time they spend outdoors. In a preliminary report released this week, the education ministry found that children from Fukushima prefecture aged five to nine, as well as those aged 14 and 17, toppped the nationwide obesity rankings. The report defined as obese children who were at least 20% heavier than the standard weight for their age. The report, released almost two years after the triple meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, linked the rise in obesity to lack of exercise, amid concern among teachers and parents over the possible health effects of prolonged exposure to low-level radiation. The study used data from almost 700,000 children nationwide aged five to 17 between April and June this year. Schools across Fukushima prefecture imposed restrictions on outdoor activities after the disaster, which also forced the evacuation of more than 150,000 people living within a 12-mile radius of the plant. After the crisis, 449 of the prefecture's state schools set limits on the time pupils were permitted to spend outside; last September, restrictions were still in place at 71 primary and junior high schools. The obesity trend was most marked among younger children, the study found, with rates among six-year-old boys in Fukushima rising to 11.4% from 6.3% in 2010, the last time the survey was conducted there. The obesity rate among eight-year-old girls in the prefecture nearly doubled in the same period to 14.6%. The Fukushima prefectural board of education said the results reflected \"stress caused by restrictions imposed on outdoor activities last fiscal year and changes in living environments in the process of evacuation\". A local education official told the Asahi Shimbun that fear of radiation \"may be one cause. Children cannot play outdoors, so they now engage in less physical exercise.\" Many children, even those living in areas where radiation levels are below government safety limits, are spending more time at home after school and during weekends and holidays than they did before the disaster. Mie Sawamura, who lives in Koriyama, a city 40 miles west of Fukushima Daiichi, said her eight-year-old son had gained several kilograms over the past 18 months. \"He was skinny before the earthquake, maybe because he played around outside all day long,\" she told the Mainichi Shimbun. \"But he was found to be slightly obese in a medical checkup at school.\" In response, indoor playgrounds have been built in dozens of locations throughout the prefecture. But Shintaro Kikuchi, who runs a playground in Koriyama, said travelling time and limited opening hours meant they were no substitute for playing outdoors. \"The environment for children to do exercise is a far cry from what it was before the nuclear accident,\" he told the newspaper. Children from the Tohoku region of north-east Japan, in which Fukushima is located, have traditionally been among the country's fattest because they are forced to spend long periods inside during the bitterly cold winters. Education officials pointed out that this was the time children from Fukushima had topped the nationwide obesity charts in so many age groups. Fukushima and the two other tsunami-hit prefectures of Miyagi and Iwate were not included in the 2011 national survey."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/jul/29/nuclearpower-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-07-29T15:31:00Z","webTitle":"How Germany plans to succeed in a nuclear free, low-carbon economy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jul/29/nuclearpower-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/jul/29/nuclearpower-energy","fields":{"headline":"How Germany plans to succeed in a nuclear free, low-carbon economy","bodyText":"Germany has taken some fundamental energy decisions in recent months, ones that are interesting for other countries to study and learn from. The most \"famous\" decision recently has been to phase out nuclear power in the next ten years. This move builds on years of debate and a societal decision after Japan's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident to move away from nuclear energy. There has been much less focus, however, on the phasing in of other sources of energy. Nor has there been much focus on how Germany can remain the economic powerhouse of Europe, and the world's second largest exporting country, while removing a significant source of energy from its grid. This phase-in story is vital to understand, especially taking into account that Germany plans to meet ambitious greenhouse gas reduction targets while it phases out nuclear power. So, how will this work? A bit of history The coalition that governed Germany from 1998 to 2005, led by the Social Democrats and the Greens, put in place a series of policies to scale up renewables and phase out nuclear energy. Just last year the new and current government coalition (a more conservative mix) decided on a new energy concept that consisted of two main elements. 1. Agreement to phase out nuclear energy, but on a slower timeframe. To do so they decided to extend the lifetimes of the 17 German nuclear power plants by eight to twelve years. 2. Agreement to an ambitious set of short and long-term energy and climate policy goals including: * a 40% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 coupled with a longer term 80 to 95% target by 2050 (compared to 1990 levels), * a massive expansion of renewable energy in all sectors, e.g. an increase of renewable power in power generation from 17% in 2010 to 35% in 2020 and 80% in 2050 * a target to reduce energy consumption from buildings by 20% by 2020 and 80% by 2050. * A target to reduce energy consumption from transportation by 10% in 2020 and 25% in 2050. After the Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan, however, there was a decision to go back to the original phase-out schedule of 2000, while keeping in place the climate and energy targets the government had set the year before. This approach was backed by a large majority, with eighty-five percent of parliamentarians voting for both a more rapid phase-out and a number of measures (see below) on the phase-in of clean energy. Three strategic approaches Germany's energy transition is based on three strategic approaches. First, energy efficiency Although efforts will focus on improving energy efficiency in all sectors, there is a strong focus on the building sector. This is important due to its long-living capital stocks and long renovation cycles in Germany. In other words, windows of opportunity to change buildings that stay around for decades don't come along very regularly, so you have to grasp them when they do. If you miss that window energy efficiency measures at buildings will be much more costly or even infeasible. The approach is two-pronged. First of all, there is the European Union directive on Energy Performance of Buildings, which states that all new buildings must consume nearly zero energy from 2020 onwards. Germany of course must follow this regulation as well. In addition, Germany has put in place new incentive programs to support the renovation of buildings. In addition to using the auction revenue from the European Emissions Trading Scheme (Europe's \"cap-and-trade\" system) for renovation programs, Germany has also put in place special tax reductions for the renovation of buildings. Together 3.4 billion euros will go towards a lower energy consuming, modernized building sector in Germany. Second, carbon free energy in all sectors In order to achieve the long-term decarbonisation target, all sectors must transform their fuel basis to carbon-free energies. In the power sector, the focus is on renewable energies, linked with the ambitious targets noted above. For some sectors, electricity and district heating will play a significant role if produced by renewable or low-carbon energy sources. In the interim period new highly efficient and flexible gas power plants will likely be built as back-up power. New coal fired power plants are highly unlikely. With the significant increase of renewable energies and fact that there will be full auctioning of emission allowances under the European Union Emissions trading Scheme, the economics just don't add up. Given the significant role of electricity for the decarbonization for many sectors, the fast and early transition of the power sector to renewable energies is a key pillar of the transition of the energy system. As noted above, the new renewables targets are being implemented with regular revisions. In the transport sector, Germany must implement the EU auto efficiency standards. In addition, Germany has put in place a strong innovation program for electric mobility with the goal to have one million electric cars on the market by 2020 and six million by 2030. There are currently 42 million traditional cars on the road. Third, strategic focus on the long-term goals As noted above, policy is focused on reducing emissions in the sectors with long-living capital stocks, e.g. buildings and power plants. These sectors structure energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions for long periods of time. However, one must ensure that the infrastructure for such a transition is in place. Therefore, Germany has started a new legal process to develop the \"target grid 2050\" which includes all infrastructure roll out and adjustments needed for a renewable-energy dominated electricity system. This planning process creates the basis for regulators to license related investments and thus provides certainty around the future of the grid. Special efforts will be made to adjust and roll-out the necessary infrastructure, including the transmission networks which will transport wind power from the northern parts of the country to the South, smart distribution networks which can manage large shares of electric cars and power production from decentralized sources as well as sufficient storage options to deal with large shares of variable power sources. A lesson for other countries? This package of proposals forms the basis for Germany's confidence that it can phase out one source of energy and phase in renewable energy and energy efficiency. The combination of a mix of policies (emissions trading, standards, regulations, incentives) with planning and investments in the longer-term infrastructure is the pathway Germany has chosen. While this mix will not necessarily be the same in every country, other countries can learn from the different pieces of the German package to transition to an economically strong, low carbon economy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2011/jan/23/nuclear-power-accident-clean-up-costs","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2011-01-23T00:04:22Z","webTitle":"Nuclear power generators will face £1bn in clean-up costs after an accident","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/jan/23/nuclear-power-accident-clean-up-costs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2011/jan/23/nuclear-power-accident-clean-up-costs","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear power generators will face £1bn in clean-up costs after an accident","bodyText":"Nuclear operators will have to pay the first £1bn towards the cost of any accident in the UK – seven times more than the current cap on their liabilities – the government will propose tomorrow. Energy secretary Chris Huhne told the Observer that he wanted to introduce the new rule to ensure that there would be no public subsidy for nuclear power. Currently, any operator of a nuclear site only has to pay the first £140m towards clean-up costs, with the taxpayer contributing the rest. The cap, enshrined in European treaties, was introduced because no company can obtain insurance against a nuclear accident – or would want to shoulder the risk themselves – because the costs could potentially be limitless. Many environmentalists argue that agreeing to cover any costs above £140m amounts to a public subsidy, which the Conservative and Liberal Democrats have promised not to provide to the industry. Huhne said: \"The government is determined to provide certainty to low carbon investors, but there will be no public subsidy for nuclear power which is a mature technology. We are taking steps to reduce any risk of the taxpayer having to pick up the tab for new nuclear [power] further down the track. We've already set out how operators will be required to put aside money from day one for their eventual clean-up and waste storage, and now we're increasing substantially the liability to be taken on by operators.\" The government will consult with the industry on the proposed new £1bn threshold expected to be introduced this year at the same time as other European countries change their cap. Under the European proposals, in future nuclear operators must pay a minimum of the first €700m (£590m) for any accident. Governments have the option of adding a maximum of an extra €500m towards companies' liabilities. Huhne is proposing to load the maximum liability onto companies that is allowed under the new treaties. The cost of constructing nuclear reactors has soared, and companies have threatened to build them elsewhere if the UK government does not introduce the right regulatory breaks to make them economic. Many environmentalists believe the support on offer – guarantees of a minimum carbon price, caps on nuclear waste liabilities and a possible new \"low-carbon obligation\" which would guarantee a higher price for the electricity reactors generate – are forms of public subsidies. Huhne argues that the nuclear industry will not benefit from extra or specific subsidies, saying that renewables will also benefit from a minimum carbon price guarantee or low-carbon obligation.In an interview with the Guardian last month, Huhne said: \"The economic rationale for providing extra subsidy for something relies on it being an infant technology which has not come yet to commercial scale.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2013/mar/11/japan-marks-tsunami-anniversary","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2013-03-11T09:37:48Z","webTitle":"Japan marks tsunami anniversary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/11/japan-marks-tsunami-anniversary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/mar/11/japan-marks-tsunami-anniversary","fields":{"headline":"Japan marks tsunami anniversary","bodyText":"Exactly two years after its north-east coast was wrecked by a deadly tsunami, Japan marked the moment that the most powerful earthquake in its recorded history triggered deadly waves that killed almost 19,000 people, while the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, promised to speed up reconstruction of flattened communities. In Tokyo and along the tsunami-battered coastline people gathered at memorial services to remember those who died after a magnitude earthquake struck offshore at 2:46pm on 11 March 2011. Millions across the country stopped work or paused on the street to observe a moment's silence, while the emperor, Abe and relatives of the dead were among 1,200 who attended a ceremony at the capital's national theatre. \"I pray that the peaceful lives of those affected can resume as soon as possible,\" Emperor Akihito said. Rin Yamane, 18, who lost her mother in the tsunami, said: \"Young people from the disaster-hit areas will act so that the disaster will not be a painful memory but a memory that leads to the future.\" Almost all of the 26m tonnes of debris left behind by the tsunami has been removed from the three worst-hit prefectures of Iwate, Miyagi and Fukushima, but Monday's remembrance events were tinged with frustration at the slow pace of reconstruction. In an address, Abe promised to speed up the reconstruction effort, which has been delayed by bureaucratic bungling, labour shortages and a lack of land on higher ground to accommodate residents crammed into tiny temporary shelters. \"Japan will never experience a true spring if spring does not come to north-eastern Japan,\" he said. \"I promise never to forget the weight of each day and to speed up the reconstruction of the region.\" Abe, who has made several visits to Fukushima and the tsunami zone since taking office last December, said he planned to increase the budget for rebuilding from 19tn yen (£133bn) to 25tn yen. \"I pledge to achieve reconstruction of the disaster-hit areas and restore the lives of affected people as soon as possible. I will make Japan a country resilient to disasters and stand with the people who were affected,\" he said. Two years on, more than 300,000 people are still living in temporary accommodation, and practically no rebuilding has taken place near areas where whole communities once stood, now flattened swaths of land blanketed in grass and weeds. The earthquake, so powerful it was \"heard\" by an orbiting satellite 162 miles above Earth, destroyed or damaged 400,000 homes and other buildings. So far, only 10% of permanent homes for displaced survivors have been built. Among the displaced are 160,000 people from Fukushima prefecture, where radiation levels near the crippled Fukushima Daiichi power plant are still too high for them to return home. Decontamination work is behind schedule, while some residents have accepted they may never return to neighbourhoods that were irradiated when three reactors went into meltdown, sparking the world's worst nuclear crisis for a quarter of a century. Tsunami survivors are attempting to put the events of 11 March behind them as they struggle to regain some semblance of normal civic life. \"It's scary living here when there is an earthquake … but I don't plan to go anywhere else. I want to give my very best, somehow, towards rebuilding this city,\" Kenichi Oi, 75, a fisherman in the city of Kesennuma, told Associated Press. As the country marked the anniversary, the search continued for 2,668 people still missing. More than 2,300 of the recorded deaths have been attributed to the stress of living in evacuation shelters after the disaster or temporary housing. In Fukushima, frustration is mounting over the lack of progress decontaminating communities at the outer edges of the 12-mile exclusion zone established around the crippled nuclear power plant. A partial, phased return to some neighbourhoods is under way, but most people who were forced to flee radiation at the height of the crisis have no idea when, or if, their former homes will be fit for human inhabitation. The mayor of Kawauchi, Yuko Endo, said further delays in work to reduce radiation levels could deter residents from ever returning and put his village's future in doubt. \"If I were told to wait for two more years, I might explode,\" Endo said. \"After spending a huge amount of money, with the vegetable patches all cleaned up and ready for farming, we may end up with nobody willing to return.\" Expert opinion is inconclusive on the impact long-term exposure to low-level radiation could have on human health. In a recent report, the World Health Organisation said Fukushima residents faced only a tiny increased risk of developing cancer during their lifetimes. A more immediate threat to health comes from the stress caused by life in small temporary shelters, few job opportunities and the long, complicated process of applying for compensation from the plant's operator, Tokyo Electric Power. On Monday, 800 evacuees said they were suing the utility, demanding 50,000 yen a month each until radiation levels are brought down to normal levels – a process that authorities conceded could take decades."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/blog/2013/aug/20/fracking-balcombe-sussex-gas","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2013-08-20T12:17:00Z","webTitle":"Fracking: the Battle of Balcombe is far from over","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2013/aug/20/fracking-balcombe-sussex-gas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/2013/aug/20/fracking-balcombe-sussex-gas","fields":{"headline":"Fracking: the Battle of Balcombe is far from over","bodyText":"What do bloody clashes on the streets of Cairo have in common with anti-fracking protests against the Cuadrilla exploration rig in rural West Sussex? At a stretch, what links the Battle of Balcombe, which so outrages Tory Fleet Street, with harassment of the Guardian over Edward Snowden's data-mining disclosures? In terms of substance, not a lot connects a constitutional battle for the Egyptian presidency, an environmental tussle in a prosperous corner of Britain and a debate over national security, how best to protect it and at what cost to the privacy of citizens. But in another sense, all three issues are about security and the role of the state in arbitrating sharply conflicting visions and values, in each of which it is not a neutral nightwatchman but an active player. The Guardian's national security reporters – Team Greenwald – need no help from me, certainly not when the British and American governments are inadvertently doing so much to promote the case the whistleblower Snowden first made in June: that the law provides inadequate protection against fast-evolving intercept technologies, which are in any case being abused in Maryland and Gloucestershire, by the NSA and GCHQ. But what about Balcombe and its symbolic role as the village that may hold the key – if fracking's champions are to be believed – to releasing Britain from the looming energy gap, from higher energy prices and from over-reliance on fuel imports from countries whose police make those who detained David Miranda at Heathrow look like Quakers? It's easy to make fun of the protesters who have gathered in ever-larger numbers at Balcombe for this week's protest. A combination of Bianca Jagger, Dame Vivienne Westwood, the former Playboy model Marina Pepper and the confrontational No Dash for Gas crowd (a bit more macho and frightening) has allowed the Telegraph and Mail to thunder against the police caving in to \"mob rule\". Though from 50 miles away, where I type, it sounds a bit Ealing comedy too. Protests are spreading – check the live blog. On the question of principle, those who would deny the protesters the right to challenge Cuadrilla and its kind risk aligning themselves with the sort of attitude that – in extremity – justifies the military government of Egypt's violent response when confronted with a noisy and uncompromising street demonstration by a minority, the Muslim Brotherhood's militant tendency. Ditto those – read the Tory MP Ben Wallace on Twitter – who are happy to assert that Snowden's revelations threaten our security, and the authorities are therefore right to harass him, Greenwald and their friends and contacts. Yet authority's reassurances have been exposed as less-than watertight since June. Heavy-handed and disprortionate response, at which the Obama administration is so good, doesn't help its case. Public opinion is shifting the Guardian's way – and that's not something I feel able to write every week. But protesters and whistleblowers have wider obligations, too. I happen to think Snowden has discharged his obligations with more wisdom and grace than did Julian Assange. I also think that Mohamed Morsi, who only narrowly won last year's election against an unattractive rival, governed Egypt unwisely, though I can see his problem. Egyptians on both sides of the secular/Islamist chasm, so Middle East veterans like the Guardian's Ian Black report, still see politics as a zero-sum, winner-take-all game (as do some here), rather than as the truly heroic art of the possible. Compromise and accommodation are needed, but are not remotely in view. In Balcombe it is all but certain that Cuadrilla's decision to suspend drilling while the protest is on is merely a tactical retreat, as is the soft policing that outrages armchair coppers in Fleet Street. So \"we're winning\" talk by protesters is both premature and foolish. Surely veterans of the Occupy movement's camp outside St Paul's, or of the Travellers' battle at Dale Farm in Essex, and now those in Balcombe must realise that this will now become a tactical battle for public opinion. Fiona Harvey detects a shift in public opinion, so the Mail and Telegraph may be on the wrong foot with their readers. They HATE that. Neither should protesters overplay their hand, as some young men will be keen to do. Monday's arrests will not be the last. How both sides behave matters. As successive court cases confirm, the police have infiltrated, targeted and abused protest groups. Balcombe's residents, understandably alarmed at the prospect of living with oil or gas wells, seem to be against Cuadrilla. But the parish council chairman wrote to the newly arriving protesters last week asking them to behave or go home (and to glue themselves to the doors of the PR firm Bell Pottinger?) So much for tactics. With the tantalising prospect of vast sums of (relatively) clean gas to be fracked from beneath Britain's energy-hungry feet, the issue is not going to go away. Nor should it. After a slow start, America has revolutionised its energy prices and needs via fracking. But the US is a very big country – Britain is smaller than Idaho – and famously careless of its use-it-and-throw-it-away environment. Canada's tar-sands oil extraction has proved a lucrative but scary business. Under François Hollande, whose instincts are far from deft, France (just twice the size of Britain and the same size as Texas) has swung the other way, banning fracking exploration. It has been hobbled by a relative lack of fossil fuel since the industrial revolution, hence its rapid move to nuclear power, the option that Germany's Angela Merkel, normally so cautious, is now abandoning at speed. Tricky, isn't it? Today's Guardian G2 carries a stimulating examination of the case for and against fracking by the paper's John Vidal. Though it is weighted against fracking, as you would expect from an environmental reporter (to dismiss the science writer Matt Ridley as a mere viscount and failed banker is a little mean), it touches all relevant bases. They include earthquakes, clean water, water shortages (fracking needs lots of the stuff), rural despoilation, energy security (even the Greens don't trust Mr Putin or the Saudis), climate change, wildlife, jobs and the wider economic benefits, which the frackers dangle before suspicious rural communities rich and poor. MPs on all sides – and councils, too – want their constituents to be bought off with cash grants and percentage shares. Wise or shortsighted? Perhaps Orkney islanders can advise us. In his weekly column, George Monbiot has a crack at Balcombe's existential crisis – and emerges with a characteristically ingenious explanation. Among other worries, he frets (quite rightly) that biogas/methane options will be neglected as fracked gas becomes the easy, magic-wand solution for policymakers; likewise wind power. David Cameron and George Osborne are cheerleaders for the frackers in ways they do not employ for renewables, so the state is a partisan player. Why do they do it, asks Monbiot. Not because it's primarily about money (that's progress, George) or even energy security, but because politicians and business leaders, especially in the extractive industries, love macho solutions to problems. Oil/gas drilling is one such (\"like war, the real deal\"), he suggests. It's a good point, though you could also plausibly make it against the HS2 rail project, which I imagine G Monbiot supports, as he nowadays supports nuclear as a necessary part of a diversified energy mix. Don't forget, Britain has a projected energy gap out there somewhere. If we shiver in 2025, don't expect green campaigners to put their hands up and say, \"Whoops, we were wrong, too. \"They'll be busy fundraising for some other campaign. That's how campaigns are. I've read many articles making the case for and against fracking. All sorts of official bodies, ranging from the Environment Agency to the Commons select committee and (with anti-cowboy reservations) the Church of England, have declared fracking safe and of great potential benefit; so does the industry. And climate-change sceptics including the ex-editors Charles Moore and Dominic Lawson routinely write in its favour (they live in Sussex, too!) It's a very old technology being subjected to new scare stories, some add. That's my hunch, too. There is often something both reactionary and nostaglic about green thinking. But persuasive doubts persist, and voters feel they have been let down or confused too often by the potent mix of science, politics and quasi-religious fervour on both sides. That's the bottom line, really. On issues like fracking, data-mining and HS2, for instance, people no longer trust experts, even when – MMR jabs or the perils of smoking – they should. Both sides will have to work a lot harder to make their case. Honestly and peacefully is best. No scare stories, broken heads or riots, please. The battle isn't won in Balcombe, but its TV pictures will become part of the debate we should all engage with."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/blog/live/2014/sep/09/clegg-questioned-by-mps-about-scotland-and-constitutional-reform-politics-live-blog","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2014-09-09T13:43:44Z","webTitle":"Clegg questioned by MPs about Scotland and constitutional reform: Politics live blog","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2014/sep/09/clegg-questioned-by-mps-about-scotland-and-constitutional-reform-politics-live-blog","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/live/2014/sep/09/clegg-questioned-by-mps-about-scotland-and-constitutional-reform-politics-live-blog","fields":{"headline":"Clegg questioned by MPs about Scotland and constitutional reform: Politics live blog","bodyText":"The three Westminster party leaders have made the drastic decision to miss PMQs tomorrow so that they can instead travel to Scotland to campaign against independence. The three largest UK political parties have pledged a fast-track deal on new tax and welfare powers for the Scottish parliament. Nick Clegg has told MPs that giving more powers to Scotland, as the Conservatives, Labour and Lib Dems promise in the event of a no vote, will trigger much wider constitutional reform after 2015. In evidence to the political and constitutional reform committee he said: My own view is that we shouldn’t do anything that will stop [Scottish devolution] from proceeding along the timetable that the three main parties have set out over the last 24 hours, but equally we mustn’t imagine that that’s the only major bit of constitutional change which will occur, in that case, in the early stages of the next parliament. I think it will signal a much wider rewiring of the governance and constitutional arrangements in the country as a whole, particularly governance within England which remains an unusually over-centralised country ... The next Parliament will be of huge constitutional significance, starting of course with this significant transfer of very considerable further powers to Holyrood. But I think that will signal a wider debate about how we can rewire and decentralise the British state.” Graham Allen, the committee chairman, has said England should get the same powers being devolved to Scotland. David Cameron has started flying the Saltire over Downing Street in an attempt to show England’s commitment to Scotland. Alarmingly for superstitious unionists, the first time they tried to hoist it it fell down.

Rona Fairhead, the government’s preferred choice to be the next chair of the BBC Trust has said she would be “very surprised” if the body survived in its current form beyond the renewal of the corporation’s charter in 2016. Theresa Villiers, the Northern Ireland secretary, has said former IRA fugitives in receipt of official letters saying they are not wanted by the police will not be able to rely on them to avoid possible future prosecution. In a statement to MPs she said: [On the runs] now have fair and clear warning that such comfort as they may have derived from the statements can no longer be taken. There is no continuing basis for any reliance on the past statements. This scheme is at an end. All those who sought or received statements through the administrative scheme should take note of this statement today. I have deliberately made it in the public setting of Parliament, recognising and intending that it should be widely publicised as a result. I will take further steps to disseminate it. That’s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Graham Allen goes next. Q: Are you aware of the work done by Ron Johnston saying that, if you introduced 8% boundary flexibility instead of 5% (ie, variation from the average), there would be far less need for a widescale overhaul? Clegg says he is aware of this theory. It represents a “pragmatic” approach, he says. Another boundary review is due in 2018. He does not want to see communities arbitrarily split up. This might be one way forward, he says. And that’s it. The hearing is over. I’ll post a summary soon. Labour’s Chris Ruane goes next. Q: In July the Electoral Commission said 7.5m voters were not registered. Has the government been too complacent about this? Greg Clark says he wants as many as possible of those people registered. He does not have a target. He wants as many as possible registered. Q: Should that be an aim of the commission? Clark says the commission should try to get as many people as possible registered. Nick Clegg agrees. Individual voter registration was designed in a way to increase the number of voters registered, he says. Q: How do you assess how well the Fixed-term Parliaments Act has gone? Clegg says it has gone well. During this parliament the government need stability. The Act provided the space that allowed the government to take steps to repair the economy. There has not been political instability. Other countries affected by the recession were “blighted” by instability, and this stood in the way of the economic repair job needed. It also allows governments and parliaments to act more sensibly, he says. Q: What would you think if a future government repealed it? Clegg says that would be “a very retrograde step”. Andrew Turner, a Conservative, goes next. Q: When can places like the Isle of Wight share the benefits of city deals? They can now, says Greg Clark. The Isle of Wight is part of the Solent local enterprise partnership, he says. Q: But they can disregard the Isle of Wight. That should not be possible, Clark says. He offers to meet Turner (MP for the Isle of Wight) to discuss this. Graham Allen goes next. Q: There is considerable support for more devolution to local government, for people like the mayor of London, the Core Cities group, the RSA’s Jim O’Neill report, this committee and the communities committee. Is there now an opportunity to go further? Greg Clark says he has been banging on about this for years. Fabian Hamilton goes next. Q: Do you see city deals as the way forward for devolution? Greg Clark says he wants to go further with city deals. Q: But that is still this parliament giving powers to cities like Leeds and Birmingham. In other countries, cities have these powers by right. Isn’t that the next stage? Clark says this is a good point. The government has acted city by city. He thinks that has been better than having an overarching new framework. In the past, when people have proposed one model for everyone, people say it will work in one place, but not in another. That has led to a “timidity” in decision making. Greater Manchester is a very capable city, he says. He wants to give more powers to it. And he wants other cities to follow it, and other cities, and realise that they can follow. He has proceeded in a “pragmatic” way, he says. Q: Lord Heseltine said local councils should have access to a pot of money worth £49bn over five years. Clark says Heseltine has been advising him and Clegg on this. In the summer the government allocated £6bn. It wants to go further, he says. In Whitehall the sceptics were converted when they saw the ambition of what councils were proposing. Greg Clark says putting this in the Cabinet Office manual will be a significant step forward. Graham Allen says some MPs have been asked to give the whips details of the travel plans during the recess in case there needs to be a vote on military action. Q: Will the government agree rules for when the Commons votes on military action? Clegg says it would be “unimaginable” for the government to take a deliberate decision to enter military conflict without a vote in parliament. But there may be exceptions, when something needs to be done in an emergency. Everyone accepts that, he says. But there is a debate about how you codify that, he says. The former foreign secretary proposed legislation. Others have said it should be codified. But a Lords committee has said it should not be written down as a rule. Q: When will this happen? Clegg says he is “on the more formal end” of this debate. He thinks it should be written down. The government has already committed to reflect this convention in the Cabinet Office manual when it is next revised. But some people, for perfectly sincere reasons, think it would be unwise to formalise the rule. No one is disputing the principle. That is a huge difference on the situation that applied before the Iraq war, he says. Q: Why did the government agree in 2012 not to put a question about “devo max” on the ballot paper? Now it seems this consolation prize, that the government rejected originally, is now very much on offer. Clegg says the government wanted to give voters a binary choice. You cannot have the debate about extra powers until Scotland has decided if it is staying. Q: Have you and Cameron been far too complacent about all of this? You told a Lords committee you were not planning for a yes vote. Presumably at the Nato summit they did not work on the basis that there was no point planning for a Russian invasion of the Baltics. Clegg says during a campaign you should campaign. You should not spend time planning other matters. That is what the government has been doing. If there was evidence ministers were planning for defeat, they would be criticised for not focusing on their campaign. Q: So there are no contingency plans for a yes vote? No, says Clegg. Chope says he hopes, despite the “shambolic” way the government has handled this, the no camp win. Q: Why is there not a Commons statement on the agreement offering Scotland more devolution? Because that’s an agreement between three parties, he says. It is not a government announcement. That’s because the election purdah rules apply. Q: So why didn’t you make an announcment before purdah was applied? We did, says Clegg. It was in August. Q: But Alistair Darling could not answer a question about what new powers Scotland would get? (It was about the new job-creation powers. He did have an answer, but it was not one that Alex Salmond found satisfactory.) Clegg repeats the point about the parties setting out their views long before the TV debates. Christopher Chope, a Conservative, is asking the questions now. Q: Why are you rushing up to Scotland tomorrow? Or was it planned years ago? Clegg says there is nothing last minute about him, Cameron and Miliband wanting to preserve the union. He says “unity through diversity” makes Britain a tolerant country. That would not be possible if one part of the UK breaks away. It would be a dereliction of duty if political leaders did not speak out. Q: Will the government respond to the McKay report (about the impact of devolution on the Commons, and whether there should be English votes for English laws)? Clegg says it is an important contribution to an ongoing debate. Q: But the government promised a response in the autumn of 2013. Clegg says these are complicated issue. Q: Isn’t that a betrayal of trust? You promised a response. Clegg says these questions aren’t easy to address. When the government is in the midst of a debate about Scotland’s future, it is not the best time to propose a solution to the Englishness problem, he suggests. Q: Will the recall bill be published soon? Clegg diverts this to Sam Gyimah, the minister for the constitution in the Cabinet Office, who is giving evidence with him. Gyimah says it will be published soon. Q: What would trigger recall? Either conviction in a court, or a finding of wrongdoing by the Commons, says Gyimah. Q: Will collective responsibility get harder as we get closer to the election? Clegg says the parties know what the remaining government business is. That is agreed; it was in the Queen’s speech. Some people suggest the government should “bifurcate” before the election. But, he says, normal people in his constituency are quite comfortable with the idea that the two coalition parties do not always agree. Labour’s Fabian Hamilton goes next. Q: You said recently the coalition has rejuvenated collective decision making. Clegg says he does think that. Because the two parties have to agree, you have to have more collective dicussion. He hopes future governments will maintain this. Q: Do you think there should be a clearer set of rules for setting aside collective responsibility. I’m thinking about the bedroom tax vote on Friday. Has collective responsibility gone? Clegg says on the EU referendum private member’s bill, Conservative MPs voted differently from the government’s position. The two parties have to be open about that, he says. He says there have been very few occasions when the parties have agreed to disagree. Others are: boundaries, Leveson and penalties for knife crime. It is remarkable how much they have been able to agree, he says. Clegg says the coalition agreement anticipated the fact that the two parties would not agree on some things, like nuclear power. Mark Durkan, the SDLP MP, goes next. Q: Isn’t it bad if reform is only put through in a crisis, as with MPs’ expenses? Clegg says he does not accept that. The announcement over the last 24 hours is about the means to delivering a commitment made in August. And that commitment was made after considerable work by the parties. I don’t think anyone can remotely suggest that this is a panic move. Durkan says it does seem as if parliament is only reforming on “a scrambled basis”. It is like your mobile phone operator only offering you a better deal with you are about to leave. Clegg says he does not accept this. But sometimes reform does happen like this. He says party funding reform “will happen”. The two main parties have blocked it, although no party is unblemished. He says the current situation is “unsustainable”. And House of Lords reform will have to happen too, he says. He says the increasing “federalisation” of the UK will make it more likely. It will happen when there is some great scandal. He wishes it could happen in a more considered way. But, in relation to Scotland, what is being proposed is more considered than Durkan recognises. Graham Allen says the next week will provide a chance to do things that won’t be available later. Q: Our committee published a report proposing a constitutional convention two years ago. Will you revisit that idea now? Clegg says there are different vehicles by which you can pursue the same end. That is the direction of travel that everybody supports, he says. Greg Clark, the cities minister, says he thinks Allen has underplayed the importance of measures taken by the government. He mentions the city deals. They have transformed relations between local and central government. He has had no difficulties negotiating city deals with Labour authorities. Q: There will be damage after the Scottish vote. Would one solution be to start a debate on a written constitution, as this committee has recommended? Clegg says he has been a lifelong supporter of a written constitution. But he does not think there will be a “eureka moment” before the election when parties embrace a written constitution. The end should be a “radically decentralised state across the UK”, he says. Q: The establishment has a habit of resisting change. Unless we seize the moment this week, isn’t there a danger that, after the referendum (if there’s a no vote), people will say the problem has been fixed. Clegg says we are “way beyond that” now. You should judge the government by its actions, he says. We have not been slouches in terms of decentralisation. Q: But this is of a completely different magnitude. I congratulate you on the work you’ve done. But this opportunity is much bigger. Today I saw Johann Lamont, Ruth Davidson and Willie Rennie literally shoulder to shoulder promising more devolution. Will you, Cameron and Miliband do the same. Clegg says he is not sure a photo opportunity is being discussed. Q: But that’s highly symbolic. Clegg says that commitment is there. It does not need to be illustrated by a photograph. Firstly, two of those three parties have done significant things in government. He says Allen has devalued some of the government’s measures. The Scotland Act was the biggest act of devolution in 300 years. The referendum in Wales on more powers for the parliament was unprecedented. Graham Allen, the committee chairman, is asking the question. Q: What extra powers would Scotland get under the deal offered by the three main UK parties? Clegg says the Conservative report, from the Strathclyde commission, was hugely significant, because it marked a significant shift for them. Labour has its own plans, and the Lib Dems have published two reports from Sir Menzies Campbell, he says. But, Clegg says, it is not just for the parties; there should be input from wider civil society. Q: But doesn’t there need to be a bottom line? Clegg says all the main parties have offered Scotland more powers over tax, welfare and borrowing. Q: And could England get those powers? Clegg says there is no point decentralising without transferring power over money. That is why he thinks decentralising business rates is one of the government’s most significant measures. Q: But these powers for Scotland are in a different league. They are being published at the last minute. Clegg says there is nothing last-minute about this. He, David Cameron and Ed Miliband issued a joint statement in August. These ideas have been in the pipeline for some time. Clegg says he does not think the same blueprint should apply to every part of the UK. Proposals for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are different. We should “welcome this cornucopia of ideas” about devolution, he says. Clegg says he thinks giving more powers to Scotland would lead to a “much wider re-wiring” of the constitutional settlement in the UK. He says he believes that power is best adminstered at the most local level. So the next parliament is going to present a huge opportunity, he says. Nick Clegg is starting his evidence to the Commons political and constitutional reform committee. He will be appearing alongside Greg Clark, the science and cities minister, and Sam Gyimah, the minister for the constitution in the Cabinet Office. My colleague Patrick Wintour has more on David Cameron’s decision to abandon PMQs tomorrow. Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, is addressing the TUC conference now. I’ll post a summary after I’ve read the text of the speech (pdf). To clarify: the statement that David Cameron has put on his Facebook page (see 12.02pm) is a joint statement from Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg. David Cameron has cancelled PMQs tomorrow to go to Scotland. This is what he’s put on Facebook. There is a lot that divides us - but there’s one thing on which we agree passionately: the United Kingdom is better together. That’s why all of us are agreed the right place for us to be tomorrow is in Scotland, not at Prime Minister’s Questions in Westminster. We want to be listening and talking to voters about the huge choices they face. Our message to the Scottish people will be simple: ‘We want you to stay.’ David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg. You can read all today’s Guardian politics stories here. And all the politics stories filed yesterday, including some in today’s paper, are here. As for the rest of the papers, here is the PoliticsHome round-up of the top 10 politics articles, and here is the ConservativeHome round-up of today’s politics stories. And here are three articles I found particularly interesting. Robert Hardman in the Daily Mail says the Queen has been worrying about Scottish independence ever since Labour introduced devolution. While researching my book, Our Queen, ahead of the Diamond Jubilee, I interviewed Mr Blair. On the subject of Scottish devolution, he said that there had been ‘a lot of discussions’ not only with the Queen but with her private secretary and the Prince of Wales. At no stage had the Palace challenged the Government’s plans, he explained, but they had given it a lot of thought. ‘They weren’t saying, “We don’t agree with you.” They were simply reflecting on it,’ he told me. ‘I found that not only proper but also very helpful. There was a concern, which I shared, that devolution was one step on the path to independence. For the Queen, it wouldn’t be great to be the Queen presiding over the break-up of the United Kingdom. And so it came to pass. That royal ‘concern’ turns out to have been extremely prescient. Now that it is a live political issue, of course, there is not the remotest chance that the Queen will voice any sort of opinion. We should, though, recall her 1977 Silver Jubilee speech, in which she spoke up for the Union. Acknowledging the feeling that ‘Metropolitan Government’ was ‘too remote’ and had revived ‘an awareness of historic national identities’ and ‘understandable aspirations’ for devolution, she went on: ‘I cannot forget that I was crowned Queen of the United Kingdom. Perhaps this Jubilee is a time to remind ourselves of the benefits which union has conferred on the inhabitants of all parts of this United Kingdom.’ The Daily Telegraph says David Cameron is being urged to get the Queen to intervene in the Scottish debate. One senior Tory MP told The Telegraph: “Now would be a great moment for the Queen to say again and underline those inspiring words that she gave in 1977 at her Silver Jubilee. The referendum looks extremely close and her intervention could make all the difference.” Simon Danczuk, a Labour MP, agreed, saying: “It would mean something to the people of England and Scotland. It would be welcomed — I don’t think it would be improper.” Henry Bellingham MP, a former Conservative Coalition minister, said: “We are talking about the possible dismemberment of the United Kingdom. It is legitimate for people to take notice of her views.” Steve Richards in the Independent says the no campaign may be doing too little too late. More widely there is a risk for the No campaign that its every move is viewed solely through the prism of suddenly dramatic polls. Labour is hiring a train on Thursday to send up an army of Westminster-based MPs to Scotland. A timetable for greater powers for Scotland will be published. Miliband and Gordon Brown will address a rally, a unique joint appearance. The election expert John Curtice told me months ago that Brown was by far the most effective campaigner at framing messages in ways that would appeal to “Don’t knows”. He becomes even more important in the final days. But each time the No campaign raises its game Salmond will pop up to declare the other side is panicking, and he will be right. Ed Miliband is urging town halls in England to fly the Saltire to show their support for Scotland staying in the union. This is what he said this morning. [I am calling on] cities, towns, villages right across the United Kingdom to fly the Saltire in the coming days because we want to send a very clear message to the people of Scotland: please stay with us because we believe we are stronger together. He was in Liverpool, where he said the initiative was starting. Does anyone know anywhere else where the Saltire is flying in England? Liz Truss, the environment secretary, has announced the resumption of badger culling. The news comes in a written ministerial statement (pdf). Here’s an extract. Last week I launched the Badger Edge Vaccination Scheme to support badger vaccination projects in those areas next to the high risk area. Vaccinating healthy badgers in this way is intended to create a buffer zone to help prevent the spread of bovine TB to new parts of the country where the incidence of the disease is currently very low. Vaccination cannot, however, replace culling in TB hotspots such as Gloucestershire and Somerset as it doesn’t cure infected badgers who will continue to spread disease. This year’s culls incorporate improvements learned from last year’s culls and those set out in the Independent Expert Panel’s report. We have made changes to improve the humaneness and effectiveness, including better training and monitoring. The Commons political and constitutional reform committee is chaired by the Labour MP Graham Allan. Allan told BBC News just now that he favoured further devolution not just for Scotland, but for England too, and that his committee would be investigating this idea. This is what he told the Today programme. What I’d like to see is devolution throughout the United Kingdom. If we believe in devolution, it has to be a principle, not an expedient we allow when we’ve got a problem. We’ve all got to apply devolution to all the nations of the Union if we’re to be credible. What’s happened in Scotland is that the Scottish Government now has the power to keep a certain amount of income tax in Scotland. I think that’s good enough for Scotland, good luck to them, they deserve that and should have that. But it also should apply to England. England should also have income tax assignment, so that where you live, in London or Nottingham, can be clear about how much money is coming to our locality. And here he is making the same point on News 24. One of the more interesting side issues in the Scottish referendum campaign has been watching the competition for the title of the person who saved the union. Alistair Darling, David Cameron, Jim Murphy, George Galloway, George Osborne and JK Rowling have all, at various times, to various extents, been contenders, but in the light of yesterday’s dramatic developments, it now seems that Gordon Brown is well in the lead. From tomorrow morning I’ll be in Edinburgh blogging exclusively about the referendum campaign. Today my colleague Ben Quinn is leading our coverage with his live blog. But there will be an interesting Scotland-related hearing in Westminster which I’ll be covering in detail. Here’s the agenda for the day. 9.15am: Johann Lamont, the Scottish Labour leader, Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Conservative leader, and Willie Rennie, the Scottish Lib Dem leader, hold a press conference to confirm their commitment to giving Scotland more powers if it votes no in the referendum. 10.30am: Rona Fairhead, the government’s choice as new chair of the BBC Trust, appears before the Commons culture committee in a pre-appointment hearing. My Guardian media colleagues will be covering it live. Morning: Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor, addresses the TUC conference. 12.30pm: Nick Clegg gives evidence to the Commons political and constitutional reform committee. It is one of the committee’s regular hearings with Clegg, who is responsible in government for constitutional reform, and, according to the committee, the subjects covered will include “devolution and the referendum in Scotland, the government’s programme of political and constitutional reform, the coalition government and collective responsibility, the recall of MPs, Parliament’s role in conflict decisions, local government, and fixed-term parliaments”. I will be finishing slightly early today because I’ve got to travel to Scotland.

Alistair Buchanan, chief executive of the energy regulator, said that ageing power stations were being taken out of service faster than expected, causing a \"tight situation\" with electricity supplies. Gas prices are still rising across most of the world, as demand from Asia continues to soar. The UK's North Sea reserves are rapidly dwindling, exposing consumers to higher prices. According to Ofgem, the average duel fuel bill in the UK is £1,420 a year, an increase of 18% since 2009. But the UK's reliance on gas is set to intensify. Building more gas-fired power stations is the government's favoured way of filling the electricity generation gap as coal, oil-fired and nuclear power plants are retired. According to Ofgem, gas is likely to account for 60% to 70% of power generation by the end of this decade, compared with the current level of about 33%. Consumer groups and green campaigners have called on ministers to take measures to protect households and diversify the energy supply. Richard Lloyd, executive director of Which?, warned that the UK's energy market was \"broken\", because of too little competition among the big six suppliers. He said the government should not be writing a blank cheque to the industry. Lloyd added: \"Consumers will be alarmed at Ofgem's prediction that they will pay an even higher price for our increasing reliance on imported gas. After another winter of inflation-busting price hikes, the rising cost of energy is already one of the top financial concerns for hard-pressed households … We want ministers to do more to help people improve their home energy efficiency, to make the energy market more competitive and to guarantee every consumer gets the cheapest possible deal.\" Buchanan said reserve margins for generation capacity were set to fall from 14% to just 5% within three years, though he played down the threat of power cuts to consumers: households are less likely to be affected by capacity shortages than energy-intensive businesses, many of which have contracts that stipulate their supply can be cut at times of peak demand to free up generating capacity elsewhere. Ofgem's analysis follows repeated warnings from the Committee on Climate Change, the statutory body established to advise ministers on how to meet the UK's carbon targets, that rising gas prices would hurt the UK. The CCC has suggested that diversifying the UK's energy mix, rather than increasing the focus on gas, could help lessen the impact of the higher bills. Buchanan's warnings are a challenge to the chancellor, George Osborne, who has promoted a \"dash for gas\" as the way of keeping the lights on and keeping energy bills low for consumers and businesses. The Treasury has also attacked subsidies for renewable energy, which energy experts and green campaigners maintain would provide a lower-cost alternative to the overweening dependence on fossil fuel. The Treasury is understood to be predicting lower gas prices, owing to increasing supplies globally, arising from shale gas. But this analysis is at odds with that of the International Energy Agency, the gold standard for energy and emissions research, which notes that the low price of gas in the US – about $2 a unit, compared with about five times as much in Europe – will not translate into lower global prices for many years. The shale gas supply is being soaked up by demand within the US, where it is displacing coal for power generation, and the excess coal, a high-carbon fuel, is being exported to international markets instead. Shale gas will not make any big impact on prices in the UK, says Buchanan. Shale reserves here are likely to be much smaller than those in the US and harder to exploit. In the UK there are about 6m households in fuel poverty, which is set to rise to 9m by 2016, though the government is likely to alter the definition to reduce the headline numbers. Mike O'Connor, chief executive of Consumer Focus, who said ministers should find ways to protect poorer households, questioned the mechanism governing the cost of investment. O'Connor said: \"The trend is for bill payers, rather than taxpayers or shareholders, to take the burden and risk. We must question whether that is right … As always, those who can least afford to pay will suffer the most. Millions of homes face their own security of supply crisis every day, and many have to respond by staying cold.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"environment/georgemonbiot/2013/jun/21/solar-power-wind-nuclear-carbon-electricity","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-06-21T06:00:00Z","webTitle":"On summer solstice, my £100 bet against solar power ends - who won?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2013/jun/21/solar-power-wind-nuclear-carbon-electricity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2013/jun/21/solar-power-wind-nuclear-carbon-electricity","fields":{"headline":"On summer solstice, my £100 bet against solar power ends - who won?","bodyText":"Summer solstice. At dawn. What better time could there be for resolving a duel, albeit one not fought with flintlocks? The time is of my choosing, as the other party, though he accepted the challenge, would not agree terms. It is appropriate in another sense too, as this is the day with the longest hours of sunlight and therefore – for I honour the sporting tradition – it offers my opponent the best shot. Three years ago, in the course of our debate about the best means of generating electricity, I bet £100 against a claim made by Jeremy Leggett, chairman of the company SolarCentury. He had asserted that domestic solar power in Britain would achieve grid parity by 2013. This means that it would cost householders no more than conventional electricity. I'm interested in this question because I want to see carbon emissions cut as quickly and effectively as possible. If public money is used to back the wrong technologies, that represents a wasted opportunity. It is easy to become enthusiastic about domestic solar power, because it is produced on a small scale, gives people a satisfying sense of self-reliance, and is unobtrusive, unlike most other forms of generation. In fact it's arguably the only form of electricity production which has widespread public support. The fact that it has been exceedingly lucrative for homeowners who installed their panels when state subsidies (the feed-in tariff) were high has contributed to that enthusiasm. But those of us who want carbon emissions to be greatly reduced should ask questions that are wider than only self-interest and aesthetics. We also have to ask whether a technology works. Solar power works well at low latitudes, especially in places where peak electricity demand coincides with peak sunlight, which is often the case where air conditioning is widely used. In terms of replacing conventional electricity, it works less well in places like the UK, which are far from the equator and have different patterns of use. Here, peak demand occurs between 5pm and 7pm on winter evenings. I was sceptical of Jeremy's claim. So I bet that his prediction would not come to pass: grid parity would not be achieved by 2013. He accepted. I undertook to write an article in 2013 revealing the results, whether I won or lost. Here it is. To discover who had won, I first contacted the energy regulator, Ofgem, but it turned down my request. So I tried the Department for Energy and Climate Change. I asked two questions: • How should the outcome best be measured? • Who will have to pay out £100? This is what it told me: \"Grid parity can be defined as the point at which government support for a technology is no longer required.\" That seems like a reasonable definition to me, and one I'm prepared to accept. I hope Jeremy feels the same way: in 2010 I wrote to him several times to try to reach an agreement about how the outcome would be determined, but did not receive a reply. Here is Decc's answer to my second question: \"Grid parity for domestic scale solar power has not been reached. The feed-in tariff scheme currently provides generation tariff of 15.44p per kWh, plus an export tariff of 4.64p per kWh for domestic scale installations.\" Here is the source (pdf) it gave me. In other words, though the subsidy has come down sharply from 2010, which partly reflects a real decline in the price of solar power and partly reflects the extraordinary generosity of the initial tariff, we're a long way from grid parity. This, I think, highlights the danger of believing what we want to believe. Climate change is too serious to mess about with. We should be hard-headed in addressing it, and should subject the technologies which attract us to as much scrutiny and rigour as the technologies which repel us. It was this process which, after my initial enthusiasm, turned me away from solar power in the UK and led to my reluctant endorsement of large-scale wind and (later) nuclear power as the UK's most viable sources of low-carbon electricity. I wish it were otherwise. But what counts for me is achieving the steepest and fastest possible cut in greenhouse gases. None of our options are great, but these are the best of a bad bunch. (We should of course simultaneously pursue sharp reductions in energy demand). Though the costs will keep falling, solar power is unlikely to make a large contribution to electricity supply in the UK, unless a radically different technology becomes viable. This is because of the inherent constraints I mentioned earlier. It has some potential for mitigating carbon emissions in the summer, especially with the use of smart grids, but it seems to me that for a long time to come there are likely to be cheaper and simpler means of achieving the same aim. I would like to be proved wrong on this, but I don't think it will happen. For all that, looking back across the past three years it seems to me that there is something of the circular firing squad about our duel. Two months after we struck our bet, the government changed. I don't think either of us would have guessed just how bad it would be. In fact it wasn't until the Any Questions programme two weeks ago that we were able to see how far the madness has gone. Owen Paterson, the environment secretary, revealed that he rejects the science of climate change, and trotted out a series of discredited factoids and myths. This is what he said: \"The climate's always been changing, er, Peter [Hain] mentioned the Arctic and I think in the Holocene the Arctic melted completely and you can see there were beaches there - when Greenland was occupied, you know, people growing crops. We then had a little ice age, we had a middle age warming. The climate's been going up and down, but the real question which I think everyone's trying to address is, is this influenced by man-made activity in recent years and James [Delingpole] is actually correct. The climate has not changed - the temperature has not changed in the last 17 years …\" You can read a powerful deconstruction of these claims on the Skeptical Science website. Alongside an environment secretary in denial about climate change, we have a chancellor who seems to be attempting to sabotage every green initiative. We see constant efforts by both the press and MPs to prevent the deployment of wind farms. There is a widespread belief in government that the best substitute for natural gas is, er, natural gas, ideally extracted by the most damaging means. We've witnessed the abandonment of the energy-saving schemes launched by the last government and their replacement with a useless green deal. The European emissions trading scheme has collapsed, international negotiations have ground to a halt, CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere have already passed 400 parts per million and there are no serious global efforts to prevent their rise, let alone bring them down. Far from leaving most fossil fuels in the ground – without which no progress on climate change can be made – energy companies and nation states are making unprecedented efforts to extract them from ever more remote and hazardous places. In other words, Jeremy and I have both lost. And so has everyone, except the fossil fuel companies. So I fire my shot into the air. We differ profoundly on which technologies are best deployed to address climate change. But we confront a government which appears to want none of them, and in this respect we are united.

He also added that Germany's decision was irresponsible. Economic considerations and the threat represented by greenhouse gases meant that we simply could not renounce nuclear energy. George Monbiot and Mark Lynas have argued along similar lines. Having been a member of the special expert commission appointed by the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, in the wake of Fukushima, I disagree. Ultimately, the rejection of nuclear is not a result of German angst but of economic thinking. In the long run, nuclear power will become more expensive, while renewable energy will become cheaper. But the key point is that those who continue to leave all options open will not invest. A hesitant Germany would fail to achieve the push of self-fulfilling prophecy in energy change that is required. Supporters of nuclear energy block their own access to the markets of the future because they are not investing in energy-saving products and in renewable energy – not even in \"green\" professional training and research institutes. The situation we are facing at the dawn of the 21st century is comparable to other turning points in energy generation. Just imagine what would have happened 250 years ago if people had brushed aside the suggestion that they should invest in coal and steel, steam engines, power looms and, later on, railways. Or what the world would be like now if 50 years ago people had seen the Americans suddenly investing in microprocessors, computers, the internet and the new markets that those technologies opened up and dismissed it all as the product of American angst. If we could open up just a part of the world's deserts for solar energy, we could satisfy the energy needs of the whole of civilisation. No one can take possession of sunlight; no one can privatise or nationalise it. Everyone can open up this source of energy for himself or herself and profit from it. Users of energy produced by a nuclear power plant have their electricity cut off if they fail to pay their bills. This cannot happen to people using electricity generated by the solar panels installed on the roofs of their houses. Why, of all nations, do the Americans, the French and the British – nations that value freedom so highly – persist in remaining blind to these emancipatory consequences of the coming change in power generation? People everywhere are proclaiming and mourning the death of politics. Paradoxically, the cultural perception of the danger may well usher in the very opposite: the end of the end of politics. To understand this, we need to go back to John Dewey's insight, formulated as early as 1927, in The Public and its Problems. According to Dewey, a transnational public sphere powerful enough to create a community arises not from political decisions, but from the consequences of decisions that have come to seem problematic in the lives of citizens. Thus a publicly perceived risk triggers communication between people who would otherwise prefer to have nothing to do with one another. It imposes obligations and costs on people who resist – and who often have the prevailing law on their side. In other words, what is denounced by many as a hysterical over-reaction to the \"risks\" of nuclear energy is in fact a vital step towards ensuring that a turning point in energy generation becomes a step towards greater democracy. The novel coalition between the state and social movements of the kind we currently see at work in Germany now has a historic opportunity. Even in terms of power politics, this change of policy makes sense. Only a conservative government close to industry is capable of pulling off such a shift in energy policy. It could well be that those who criticise Germany's decision to opt out of nuclear energy have fallen victim to the caterpillar's mistake: as it emerges from the chrysalis, it laments the disappearance of the cocoon because it has no premonition of the butterfly of renewable energy it is destined to become."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/julian-borger-global-security-blog/2010/may/24/israel-nuclear-southafrica","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2010-05-24T11:20:26Z","webTitle":"A responsible nuclear power?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/julian-borger-global-security-blog/2010/may/24/israel-nuclear-southafrica","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/julian-borger-global-security-blog/2010/may/24/israel-nuclear-southafrica","fields":{"headline":"A responsible nuclear power?","bodyText":"Today's revelations about Shimon Peres' meetings with PW Botha to discuss missiles and warheads come at an extremely delicate moment at the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) Review Conference in New York. As the conference, aimed at repairing and updating the global arms control regime, the vexed issue of a nuclear-free zone in the Middle East. At its heart, this is a matter of double standards. Egypt is leading a chorus of Arab and other non-nuclear states who want Israel to feel some of the pressure that Iran is undergoing, for its lack of transparency over its nuclear arsenal, and its efforts to maintain that nuclear monopoly in the region. As Chris points out in his piece, Israel's tacit defence, pursued on its behalf by its allies, has been that it - unlike Iran - is a 'responsible' nuclear power. Yet here you have Shimon Peres talking nukes with a nutcase white supremacist government. Avner Cohen, the author of Israel and the Bomb, and the forthcoming The Worst-Kept Secret: Israel's Bargain with the Bomb, has taken issue with the headline of the piece. While there is no doubt (as the documents point out) that there was a SA probe to Israel for nuclear weapons, which stimulates a certain opaque Israeli response made by the Israeli Minister of Defense, Shimon Peres, there is no proof whatsoever that Israel ultimately officially OFFERED those weapons to SA. In fact, I know that Israel did not: Israel neither offered and passed along nuclear weapons (and materials) nor weapons designs to the South Africans. Whatever the SA discussed among themselves in memos, and regardless of what Minister Peres told them, Prime Minister Rabin and the people in charge of the Israeli nuclear program (Mr. Shaleheveth Freier) were never willing to pass along weapons components and/or designs to the SA. Nothing like that ever formally offered to SA, regardless of Peres' reference to the \"correct warhead.\" At the end of the day South Africa did not ask and Israel did not offer the \"correct payloads.\". Israel did behave as a responsible nuclear state. Chris points out in his piece that it was not clear whether Rabin would have signed off the deal, but it seems to me if you have the defence minister telling PW Botha that \"the correct payload was available in three sizes\" that amounts to an informal offer, a preliminary offer, whether or not it was finally consummated as \"an official offer'. We are talking about a defence minister here, not some deniable intermediary. If I walked to buy a car from a company salesman and was told it was \"available in three sizes\", I would take it that it was for sale. Meanwhile, back at the NPT, Rebecca Johnson of the Acronym Institute reports on the state of play at the NPT conference. Here is her section on the draft resolution on the Middle East zone. This draft recognises the critical importance of the 1995 Resolution on the Middle East, notes the P-5 statement's commitment to its full implementation, and regrets there has been so little progress. The following practical steps are endorsed: an \"initial conference\" in 2012 convened by the UN Secretary-General and involving all states in the Middle East, and a Special Coordinator with a mandate to facilitate implementation of the 1995 Resolution, conduct consultations and undertake preparations for the Conference and, importantly, \"follow-on steps\", with reports to be provided to NPT states parties at the 2012, 2013 and 2014 PrepComs. The draft seeks a middle way between the Arab states' desire for a negotiating conference and the US view that this would be premature, by describing the purpose of the Conference as \"leading to the establishment of a Middle East zone free of nuclear weapons and all other weapons of mass destruction, on the basis of arrangements freely arrived at by the States of the region...\" In addition to recognising the importance of the draft proposed \"complementary steps\" such as an EU-hosted event and background documentation regarding verification. It also emphasises the importance of \"parallel progress, in substance and timing\" relating to achieving total and complete elimination of all nuclear, chemical and biological weapons from the region."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/blog/german-bioenergy-villages-energy-supply","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2012-12-18T09:49:00Z","webTitle":"German energy consumers transform into local energy providers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/blog/german-bioenergy-villages-energy-supply","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/blog/german-bioenergy-villages-energy-supply","fields":{"headline":"German energy consumers transform into local energy providers","bodyText":"Across Germany, an energy revolution is underway. Dotting across the landscape are hundreds of wind rotors – but even if they look like the giant wind turbines you might see off the coast of the UK or the Netherlands, more than half of them have not been installed by the big energy incumbents. These are financed by private individuals, local energy associations or nearby communities. Especially in the rural areas of the southern German states of Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg, you'll frequently see solar panels on residential buildings, barns and converted acres of agricultural land. Almost two-thirds of them are owned by private individuals and farmers. More than one million households and small-scale investors in Germany have turned into producers of energy. This is the start of a movement that began long before Germany announced it was to decommission its nuclear power plants by the year 2022. The stated goal of Chancellor Angela Merkel is to make renewable energy the main source of electricity output for the future. Renewable energy already accounts for more than 20% of Germany's combined electricity supply, so the wheels are in motion. Germany's ongoing energy transformation is accelerated by multiple disparate agents who contribute to a snowball effect that will overhaul the existing supply structure and permanently alter the competitive landscape in the energy system. Currently there are more than 130 so-called bioenergy villages across the country, which aim to secure heat and power supply by local resources and may, once adequate storage technologies become commercially viable, form the nucleus of largely autonomous island energy systems. To add to this, many companies from outside the energy industry – Volkswagen is a good example – have begun to develop their own technologies for decentralised energy supply on a mass-production level, like combined heat and power plants for residential buildings. While corporations – whether it is the likes of Volkswagen from outside the energy sphere or E.ON from within – have an important role to play, it is the groups of local interested individuals that will be the real drivers of the transformation of energy towards towards decentralised supply. Now more than ever people have a desire to reclaim their sovereignty over how they produce and consume energy and we are seeing communities convinced that this is the only way forward. Energy ceases to be a commodity defined by its price alone and becomes a way for ordinary people to become real agents of change. Much like the food market, there is a growing desire for locally produced and sustainable energy. Having spoken to key players, stakeholders and entrepreneurs who are all involved in the process of decentralising energy supply, it has become clear that whatever is happening in Germany could feasibly be used as a template for other European countries – including the UK. We all have our energy challenges, but it is clear that the traditional model of a strict separation between supply and demand is something that may get overthrown across Europe sooner than we can imagine.

Though the venue is now in cyberspace, the spirit of the Reality Club lives on in the lively back-and-forth discussions on the hot-button ideas driving the discussion today. The online salon at edge.org is a living document of millions of words charting the Edge conversation over the past 15 years. It is available, gratis, to the general public. As the late artist James Lee Byars and I once wrote: \"To accomplish the extraordinary, you must seek extraordinary people.\" At the centre of every Edge project are remarkable people and remarkable minds – scientists, artists, philosophers, technologists and entrepreneurs. Through the years, edge.org has had a simple criterion for choosing contributors. We look for people whose creative work has expanded our notion of who and what we are. A few are bestselling authors or are famous in the mass culture. Most are not. Rather, we encourage work on the cutting edge of the culture, and the investigation of ideas that have not been generally exposed. We are interested in \"thinking smart\"; we are not interested in received \"wisdom\". In the words of the novelist Ian McEwan, edge.org is \"open-minded, free-ranging, intellectually playful… an unadorned pleasure in curiosity, a collective expression of wonder at the living and inanimate world… an ongoing and thrilling colloquium.\" At the end of the year in 1999, for the first anniversary edition of Edge, I asked a number of thinkers to use the interrogative. I asked \"the most subtle sensibilities in the world what question they are asking themselves\". We've been doing it annually ever since. It's not easy coming up with a question. James Lee, whose 1971 conceptual art piece The World Question Centre inspired the annual Edge question, used to say: \"I can answer the question, but am I bright enough to ask it?\" We are looking for questions that inspire answers we can't possibly predict. My goal is to provoke people into thinking thoughts that they normally might not have. We pay a lot of attention to framing the question and soliciting early responses from individuals who can set a high bar. This is critical. These responses seed the site and challenge and encourage the wider group to think in surprising ways. The online publication of the annual question occurs in mid-January, and in recent years it is followed by a printed book. Last year we worried about worrying. This year's question comes from HeadCon 13, a two-day Edge seminar that took place in September last year. At one point, Yale psychologist Laurie Santos mentioned to the group that she was interested in why there was no mechanism in social science for retiring ideas in order to make room for new initiatives. A lively discussion followed and I quickly picked up on it as an indication that Santos was on to a possible Edge question. After two weeks of often intense conversations, several Edgies expressed concern that the responses would go negative and that people would use it as an opportunity to trash their rivals. Others pointed out that every year, no matter what question is asked, people try to do this in any case. We decided to go with it after one Edgie commented: \"Science is argument, not advertising.\" Thus I am pleased to present the Edge question 2014, asked by Laurie Santos. MOUSE MODELS AZRA RAZA Professor of medicine and director of the MDS Centre, Columbia University, New York An obvious truth that is either being ignored or going unaddressed in cancer research is that mouse models do not mimic human disease well and are essentially worthless for drug development. We cured acute leukaemia in mice in 1977 with drugs that we are still using in exactly the same dose and duration today in humans with dreadful results. Imagine the artificiality of taking human tumour cells, growing them in lab dishes, then transferring them to mice whose immune systems have been compromised so they cannot reject the implanted tumours, and then exposing these \"xenografts\" to drugs whose killing efficiency and toxicity profiles will then be applied to treat human cancers. The pitfalls of such an entirely synthesized non-natural model system have also plagued other disciplines. A recent scientific paper showed that all 150 drugs tested at the cost of billions of dollars in human trials of sepsis failed because the drugs had been developed using mice. Unfortunately, what looks like sepsis in mice turned out to be very different than what sepsis is in humans. Coverage of this study by Gina Kolata in the New York Times incited a heated response from within the biomedical research community. One blogger said: \"There is no basis for leveraging a niche piece of research to imply that mice are useless models for all human diseases.\" In an article for the Jackson Laboratory, three leading physician scientists concluded: \"The key is to construct the appropriate mouse models and design the experimental conditions that mirror the human situation.\" The problem is there are no appropriate mouse models that can mimic the human situation. So why is the cancer research community continuing to be dominated by the dysfunctional tradition of employing mouse models to test hypotheses for development of new drugs? Robert Weinberg of the Whitehead Institute at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] has provided the best answer. He was quoted in the press, noting: \"[There are] two reasons. First, there's no other model with which to replace that poor mouse. Second, the FDA [the US Food and Drugs Administration] has created inertia because it continues to recognise these models as the gold standard for predicting the utility of drugs.\" There is a third reason related more to the frailties of human nature. Too many eminent laboratories and illustrious researchers have devoted entire lives to studying malignant diseases in mouse models and they are the ones reviewing one another's grants and deciding where the NIH money [US government medical research funding] gets spent. They are not prepared to accept that mouse models are basically valueless for most of cancer therapeutics. In the final analysis then, one of the main reasons we continue to stick to this archaic ethos is to obtain funding. Here is one example. I decided to study a bone marrow malignant disease called myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), which frequently evolves into acute leukaemia, back in the early 1980s. One decision I made very early on was to concentrate my research on freshly obtained human cells and not to rely on mice or petri dishes alone. In the past three decades, I have collected more than 50,000 bone marrow biopsies, blood, normal control buccal smear cells [cells taken from inside the cheek], serum and plasma samples in a well-annotated tissue repository backed by a computerised bank of clinical, pathologic and morphologic data. By using these samples, we have identified novel genes involved in causing certain types of MDS, as well as sets of genes related to survival, natural history of the disease and response to therapy. But when I used bone marrow cells from treated MDS patients to develop a genomic expression profile which was startlingly predictive of response and applied for an NIH grant to validate the signature, the main criticism was that before confirming it through a prospective trial in humans, I should first reproduce it in mice! The time is here to let go of the mouse models at least as surrogates for bringing drugs to the bedside. Remember what Mark Twain said. \"What gets us into trouble is not what we don't know; it's what we know for sure that just ain't so.\" THERE CAN BE NO SCIENCE OF ART JONATHAN GOTTSCHALL US academic and author who specialises in literature and evolution and teaches at Washington &amp; Jefferson College, Pennsylvania Fifteen thousand years ago in France, a sculptor swam and slithered almost a kilometre down into a mountain cave. Using clay, the artist shaped a big bull rearing up to mount a cow, and then left his creation in the bowels of the earth. The two bison of the Tuc D'Audoubert caves sat undisturbed for many thousands of years until they were rediscovered by spelunking boys [cavers] in 1912. The discovery of the clay bison was one of many shocking 20th-century discoveries of sophisticated cave art stretching back tens of thousands of years. The discoveries overturned our sense of what our caveman ancestors were like. They were not furry, grunting troglodytes. They had artistic souls. They showed us that humans are – by nature, not just by culture – art-making, art-consuming, art-addicted apes. But why? Why did the sculptor burrow into the earth, make art, and leave it there in the dark? And why does art exist in the first place? Scholars have spun a lot of stories in answer to such questions, but the truth is that we really don't know. And here's one reason why: science is lying down on the job. A long time ago someone proclaimed that art could not be studied scientifically, and for some reason almost everyone believed it. The humanities and sciences constituted, as Stephen Jay Gould might have proclaimed, separate, non-overlapping magisteria – that the tools of the one are radically unsuited to the other. Science has mostly bought into this. How else can we explain its neglect of the arts? People live in art. We read stories, and watch them on TV, and listen to them in song. We make paintings and gaze at them on walls. We beautify our homes like bowerbirds adorning nests. We demand beauty in the products we buy, which explains the gleam of our automobiles and the sleek modernist aesthetic of our iPhones. We make art out of our own bodies: sculpting them through diet and exercise; festooning them with jewellery and colourful garments; using our skins as living canvas for the display of tattoos. And so it is the world over. As the late Denis Dutton argued in The Art Instinct, underneath the cultural variations, \"all human beings have essentially the same art\". Our curious love affair with art sets our species apart as much as our sapience or our language or our use of tools. And yet we understand so little about art. We don't know why art exists in the first place. We don't know why we crave beauty. We don't know how art produces its effects in our brains – why one arrangement of sound or colour pleases while another cloys. We don't know very much about the precursors of art in other species, and we don't know when humans became creatures of art. (According to one influential theory, art arrived 50,000 years ago with a kind of creative big bang. If that's true, how did that happen?) We don't even have a good definition, in truth, of what art is. In short, there is nothing so central to human life that is so incompletely understood. Recent years have seen more use of scientific tools and methods in humanities subjects. Neuroscientists can show us what's happening in the brain when we enjoy a song or study a painting. Psychologists are studying the ways novels and TV shows shape our politics and our morality. Evolutionary psychologists and literary scholars are teaming up to explore narrative's Darwinian origins. And other literary scholars are developing a \"digital humanities\" using algorithms to extract big data from digitised literature. But scientific work in the humanities has mainly been scattered, preliminary, and desultory. It does not constitute a research programme. If we want better answers to fundamental questions about art, science must jump in the game with both feet. Going it alone, humanities scholars can tell intriguing stories about the origins and significance of art, but they don't have the tools to patiently winnow the field of competing ideas. That's what the scientific method is for: separating the stories that are more accurate, from the stories that are less accurate. But make no mistake, a strong science of art will require both the thick, granular expertise of humanities scholars and the clever hypothesis testing of scientists. I'm not calling for a scientific takeover of the arts. I'm calling for a partnership. This partnership faces great obstacles. There's the unexamined assumption that something in art makes it science-proof. There's a widespread, if usually unspoken, belief that art is just a frill in human life – relatively unimportant compared with the weighty stuff of science. And there's the weird idea that science necessarily destroys the beauty it seeks to explain (as though a learned astronomer really could dull the star shine). But the Delphic admonition \"know thyself\" still rings out as the great prime directive of intellectual inquiry, and there will always be a gaping hole in human self-knowledge until we develop a science of art. ADDICTION HELEN FISHER Biological anthropologist at Rutgers University, New Jersey and author of Why Him? Why Her? How to Find and Keep Lasting Love \"If an idea is not absurd, there is no hope for it,\" Einstein reportedly said. I would like to broaden the definition of addiction and retire the scientific idea that all addictions are pathological and harmful. Since the beginning of formal diagnostics more than 50 years ago, the compulsive pursuit of gambling, food, and sex (known as non-substance rewards) have not been regarded as addictions; only abuse of alcohol, opioids, cocaine, amphetamines, cannabis, heroin and nicotine have been formally regarded as addictions. This categorisation rests largely on the fact that substances activate basic \"reward pathways\" in the brain associated with craving and obsession, and produce pathological behaviours. Psychiatrists work within this world of psychopathology – that which is abnormal and makes you ill. As an anthropologist, they appear limited by this view. Scientists have now shown that food, sex and gambling compulsions employ many of the same brain pathways activated by substance abuse. Indeed, the 2013 edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (the DSM) has finally acknowledged that at least one form of non-substance abuse can be regarded as an addiction: gambling. The abuse of sex and food were not included. Neither was romantic love. I shall propose that love addiction is just as real as any other addiction, in terms of its behaviour patterns and brain mechanisms. Moreover, it's often a positive addiction. Scientists and laymen have long regarded romantic love as part of the supernatural, or as a social invention of the troubadours in 12th-century France. Evidence does not support these notions. Love songs, poems, stories, operas, ballets, novels, myths and legends, love magic, love charms, love suicides and homicides: evidence of romantic love has now been found in more than 200 societies ranging over thousands of years. Around the world men and women pine for love, live for love, kill for love and die for love. Human romantic love, also known as passionate love or \"being in love\" is regularly regarded as a human universal. Moreover, love-besotted men and women show all of the basic symptoms of addiction. Foremost, the lover is stiletto-focused on his/her drug of choice: the love object. They think obsessively about \"him\" or \"her\" (intrusive thinking), and often compulsively call, write, or appear, to stay in touch. Paramount to this experience is intense motivation to win their sweetheart, not unlike the substance abuser fixated on his/her drug. Impassioned lovers also distort reality, change their priorities and daily habits to accommodate the beloved, experience personality changes (affect disturbance), and sometimes do inappropriate or risky things to impress this special other. Many are willing to sacrifice, even die for \"him\" or \"her\". The lover craves emotional and physical union with their beloved too (dependence). And like the addict who suffers when they can't get their drug, the lover suffers when apart from the beloved (separation anxiety). Adversity and social barriers even heighten this longing (frustration attraction). In fact, besotted lovers express all four of the basic traits of addiction: craving; tolerance; withdrawal; and relapse. They feel a \"rush\" of exhilaration when with their beloved (intoxication). As their tolerance builds, the lover seeks to interact with the beloved more and more (intensification). If the love object breaks off the relationship, the lover experiences signs of drug withdrawal, including protest, crying spells, lethargy, anxiety, insomnia or hypersomnia, loss of appetite or binge eating, irritability and loneliness. Lovers, like addicts, also often go to extremes, sometimes doing degrading or physically dangerous things to win back the beloved. And lovers relapse the way drug addicts do: long after the relationship is over, events, people, places, songs or other external cues associated with their abandoning sweetheart can trigger memories and renewed craving. Of the many indications that romantic love is an addiction, however, perhaps none is more convincing than the growing data from neuroscience. Using brain scanning (functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI), several scientists have now shown that feelings of intense romantic love engage regions of the brain's \"reward system,\" specifically dopamine pathways associated with energy, focus, motivation, ecstasy, despair and craving – including primary regions associated with substance (and non-substance) addictions. In fact, our group has found activity in the nucleus accumbens – the core brain factory associated with all addictions – in our rejected lovers. Moreover, some of our newest (unpublished) results suggest correlations between activities of the nucleus accumbens and feelings of romantic passion among lovers who were wildly, happily in love. Nobel laureate Eric Kandel recently said: \"Brain studies will ultimately tell us what it is like to be human.\" Knowing what we now know about the brain, my brain-scanning partner, Lucy Brown, has suggested that romantic love is a natural addiction; and I have maintained that this natural addiction evolved from mammalian antecedents some 4.4m years ago among our first hominid ancestors, in conjunction with the evolution of (serial, social) monogamy – a hallmark of humankind. Its purpose: to motivate our forebears to focus their mating time and metabolic energy on a single partner at a time, thus initiating the formation of a pair-bond to rear their young (at least through infancy) together as a team. The sooner we embrace what brain science is telling us – and use this information to upgrade the concept of addiction – the better we will understand ourselves and all the billions of others on this planet who revel in the ecstasy and struggle with the sorrow of this profoundly powerful, natural, often positive addiction: romantic love. THE LINEAR NO-THRESHOLD RADIATION DOSE HYPOTHESIS STEWART BRAND Author and founder of The Whole Earth Catalog; co-founder of The Well and The Long Now Foundation In his 1976 book, A Scientist at the White House, George Kistiakowsky, President Eisenhower's science adviser, told us what he wrote in his diary in 1960 on being exposed to the idea by the Federal Radiation Council: It is a rather appalling document that takes 140 pages to state the simple fact that, since we know virtually nothing about the dangers of low-intensity radiation, we might as well agree that the average population dose from manmade radiation should be no greater than that which the population already receives from natural causes; and that any individual in that population shouldn't be exposed to more than three times that amount, the latter figure being, of course, totally arbitrary. Later in the book, Kistiakowsky, who was a nuclear expert and veteran of the Manhattan Project, wrote: \"… a linear relation between dose and effect… I still believe is entirely unnecessary for the definition of the current radiation guidelines, since they are pulled out of thin air without any knowledge on which to base them.\" Sixty-three years of research on radiation effects have gone by, and Kistiakowsky's critique still holds. The linear no-threshold (LNT) radiation dose hypothesis, which surreally influences every regulation and public fear about nuclear power, is based on no knowledge whatever. At stake are the hundreds of billions spent on meaningless levels of \"safety\" around nuclear power plants and waste storage, the projected costs of next-generation nuclear plant designs to reduce greenhouse gases worldwide, and the extremely harmful episodes of public panic that accompany rare radiation-release events such as Fukushima and Chernobyl. (No birth defects whatever were caused by Chernobyl, but fear of them led to 100,000 panic abortions in the Soviet Union and Europe. What people remember about Fukushima is that nuclear opponents predicted that hundreds or thousands would die or become ill from the radiation. In fact nobody died, nobody became ill, and nobody is expected to.) The \"linear\" part of the LNT is true and well documented. Based on long-term studies of survivors of the atomic bombs in Japan and of nuclear industry workers, the incidence of eventual cancer increases with increasing exposure to radiation at levels above 100 millisieverts per year. The effect is linear. Below 100 millisieverts per year, however, no increased cancer incidence has been detected, either because it doesn't exist or because the numbers are so low that any signal gets lost in the epidemiological noise. We all die. Nearly a half of us die of cancer (38% of females, 45% of males). If the \"no-threshold\" part of the LNT is taken seriously, and an exposed population experiences as much as a 0.5% increase in cancer risk, it simply cannot be detected. The LNT operates on the unprovable assumption that the cancer deaths exist, even if the increase is too small to detect, and that therefore \"no level of radiation is safe\" and every extra millisievert is a public health hazard. Some evidence against the \"no-threshold\" hypothesis draws on studies of background radiation. In the US we are all exposed to 6.2 millisieverts a year on average, but it varies regionally. New England has lower background radiation, Colorado is much higher, yet cancer rates in New England are higher than in Colorado – an inverse effect. Some places in the world, such as Ramsar in Iran, have a tenfold higher background radiation, but no higher cancer rates have been discovered there. These results suggest that there is indeed a threshold below which radiation is not harmful. Furthermore, recent research at the cell level shows a number of mechanisms for repair of damaged DNA and for ejection of damaged cells up to significant radiation levels. This is not surprising given that life evolved amid high radiation and other threats to DNA. The DNA repair mechanisms that have existed in yeast for 800m years are also present in humans. The actual threat of low-dose radiation to humans is so low that the LNT hypothesis can neither be proven true nor proven false, yet it continues to dominate and misguide policies concerning radiation exposure, making them grotesquely conservative and expensive. Once the LNT is explicitly discarded, we can move on to regulations that reflect only discernible, measurable medical effects, and that respond mainly to the much larger considerations of whole-system benefits and harms. The most crucial decisions about nuclear power are at the category level of world urban prosperity and climate change, not imaginary cancers per millisievert. HUMANIQUENESS IRENE PEPPERBERG Research associate and lecturer at Harvard specialising in animal thought processes, and author of Alex &amp; Me Yes, humans do some things that other species do not – we are indeed the only species to send probes to outer space to find other forms of life – but the converse is certainly equally true. Other species do things humans find impossible, and many non-human species are indeed unique in their abilities. No human can detect temperature changes of a few hundredths of a degree as can some pit vipers, nor can humans best a dog at following faint scents. Dolphins hear at ranges impossible for humans and, along with bats, can use natural sonar. Bees and many birds see in the ultraviolet, and many birds migrate thousands of miles yearly under their own power, with what seems to be some kind of internal GPS. Humans, of course, can and will invent machines to accomplish such feats of nature, unlike our non-human brethren – but non-humans had these abilities first. Clearly I don't contest data that show that humans are unique in many ways, and I certainly favour studying the similarities and differences across species, but think it is time to retire the notion that human uniqueness is a pinnacle of some sort, denied in any shape, way, or form to other creatures. Another reason for retiring the idea of humaniqueness as the ideal endpoint of some evolutionary process is, of course, that our criteria for uniqueness inevitably need redefinition. Remember when \"man, the tool-user\" was our definition? At least until along came species like cactus-spike-using Galapagos finches, sponge-wielding dolphins, and now even crocodiles that use sticks to lure birds to their demise. Then it was \"man, the tool-maker\"… but that fell out of favour when such behaviour was seen in a number of other creatures, including species so evolutionary-distant from humans as New Caledonian crows. Learning through imitation? Almost all songbirds do it to some extent vocally, and minor evidence exists for physical aspects in parrots and apes. I realise that current research does demonstrate that apes, for example, are lacking in certain aspects of collaborative abilities seen in humans, but have to wonder if different experimental protocols might provide different data in the future. The comparative study of behaviour needs to be expanded and supported, but not merely to find more data enshrining humans as \"special\". Finding out what makes us different from other species is a worthy enterprise, but it can also lead us to find out what is \"special\" about other beings, what incredible things we may need to learn from them. So, for example, we need more studies to determine the extent to which non-humans show empathy or exhibit various aspects of 'theory of mind\", to learn what is needed for survival in both their natural environment and what they can acquire when enculturated into ours. Maybe they have other means of accomplishing the social networking we take as at least a partial requisite for humanness. We need to find out what aspects of human communication skills they can acquire – but we also can't lose sight of the need to uncover the complexities that exist in their own communication systems. Nota Bene lest my point be misunderstood: my argument is a different one from that of bestowing personhood on various non-human species, and is separate from other arguments for animal rights and even animal welfare – although I can see the possible implications of what I am proposing. All told, it seems to me that it is time to continue to study all the complexities of behaviour in all species, human and non-human, to concentrate on similarities as well as differences, and – in many cases – to appreciate the inspiration that our non-human compatriots provide in order to develop tools and skills that enhance our own abilities, rather than simply to consign non-humans to a second-class status. THINGS ARE EITHER TRUE OR FALSE ALAN ALDA American actor, writer, director and author of Things I Overheard While Talking to Myself The idea that things are either true or false should possibly take a rest. I'm not a scientist, just a lover of science, so I might be speaking out of turn – but like all lovers I think about my beloved a lot. I want her to be free and productive, and not misunderstood. For me, the trouble with truth is that not only is the notion of eternal, universal truth highly questionable, but simple, local truths are subject to refinement as well. Up is up and down is down, of course. Except under special circumstances. Is the north pole up and the south pole down? Is someone standing at one of the poles right-side up or upside-down? Kind of depends on your perspective. When I studied how to think in school I was taught that the first rule of logic was that a thing cannot both be and not be at the same time and in the same respect. That last note, \"in the same respect,\" says a lot. As soon as you change the frame of reference, you've changed the truthiness of a once immutable fact. Death seems pretty definite. The body is just a lump. Life is gone. But if you step back a bit, the body is actually in a transitional phase while it slowly turns into compost – capable of living in another way. This is not to say that nothing is true or that everything is possible – just that it might not be so helpful for things to be known as true for all time, without a disclaimer. At the moment, the way it's presented to us, astrology is highly unlikely to be true. But if it turns out that organic stuff once bounced off Mars and hit Earth with a dose of life, we might have to revise some statements that planets do not influence our lives here on Earth. I wonder, and this is just a modest proposal, if scientific truth should be identified in a way that acknowledges that it's something we know and understand for now – and in a certain way. One of the major ways the public comes to mistrust science is when they feel that scientists can't make up their minds. One says red wine is good for you, and another says even in small amounts it can be harmful. In turn, some people think science is just another belief system. Scientists and science writers make a real effort to deal with this all the time. The phrase \"current research suggests\" warns us that it's not a fact yet. But, from time to time the full-blown factualness of something is declared, even though further work could place it within a new frame of reference. And then the public might wonder if the scientists are just arguing for their pet ideas. Facts, it seems to me, are workable units, useful in a given frame or context. They should be as exact and irrefutable as possible, tested by experiment to the fullest extent. When the frame changes, they don't need to be discarded as untrue, but respected as still useful within their domain. I think most people who work with facts accept this, but I don't think the public fully gets it. That's why I hope for more wariness about implying we know something to be true or false for all time and for everywhere in the cosmos. Especially if we happen to be upside down when we say it. BEWARE OF ARROGANCE: RETIRE NOTHING! IAN McEWAN Novelist; author of many books including Sweet Tooth; Solar; On Chesil Beach and Amsterdam (winner of the Man Booker prize for fiction) A great and rich scientific tradition should hang on to everything it has. Truth is not the only measure. There are ways of being wrong that help others to be right. Some are wrong, but brilliantly so. Some are wrong but contribute to method. Some are wrong but help found a discipline. Aristotle ranged over the whole of human knowledge and was wrong about much. But his invention of zoology alone was priceless. Would you cast him aside? You never know when you might need an old idea. It could rise again one day to enhance a perspective the present cannot imagine. It would not be available to us if it were fully retired. Even Darwin in the early 20th century experienced some neglect, until the modern [evolutionary] synthesis. The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals took longer to be current. William James also languished, as did psychology, once consciousness as a subject was retired from it. Look at the revived fortunes of Thomas Bayes and Adam Smith (especially The Theory of Moral Sentiments). We may need to take another look at the long-maligned Descartes. Epigenetics might even restore the reputation of Lamarck. Freud may yet have something to tell us about the unconscious. Every last serious and systematic speculation about the world deserves to be preserved. We need to remember how we got to where we are, and we'd like the future not to retire us. Science should look to literature and maintain a vibrant living history as a monument to ingenuity and persistence. We won't retire Shakespeare. Nor should we Bacon. ESSENTIALISM RICHARD DAWKINS Evolutionary biologist; professor of the public understanding of science, Oxford; author of The Magic of Reality Essentialism – what I've called \"the tyranny of the discontinuous mind\" – stems from Plato, with his characteristically Greek geometer's view of things. For Plato, a circle or a right-angled triangle were ideal forms, definable mathematically but never realised in practice. A circle drawn in the sand was an imperfect approximation to the ideal Platonic circle hanging in some abstract space. That works for geometric shapes like circles, but essentialism has been applied to living things and Ernst Mayr blamed this for humanity's late discovery of evolution – as late as the 19th century. If, like Aristotle, you treat all flesh-and-blood rabbits as imperfect approximations to an ideal Platonic rabbit, it won't occur to you that rabbits might have evolved from a non-rabbit ancestor, and might evolve into a non-rabbit descendant. If you think, following the dictionary definition of essentialism, that the essence of rabbitness is \"prior to\" the existence of rabbits (whatever \"prior to\" might mean, and that's a nonsense in itself) evolution is not an idea that will spring readily to your mind, and you may resist when somebody else suggests it. Paleontologists will argue passionately about whether a particular fossil is, say, Australopithecus or Homo. But any evolutionist knows there must have existed individuals who were exactly intermediate. It's essentialist folly to insist on the necessity of shoehorning your fossil into one genus or the other. There never was an Australopithecus mother who gave birth to a Homo child, for every child ever born belonged to the same species as its mother. The whole system of labelling species with discontinuous names is geared to a time slice, the present, in which ancestors have been conveniently expunged from our awareness (and \"ring species\" tactfully ignored). If by some miracle every ancestor were preserved as a fossil, discontinuous naming would be impossible. Creationists are misguidedly fond of citing \"gaps\" as embarrassing for evolutionists, but gaps are a fortuitous boon for taxonomists who, with good reason, want to give species discrete names. Quarrelling about whether a fossil is \"really\" Australopithecus or Homo is like quarrelling over whether George should be called \"tall\". He's 5ft 10, doesn't that tell you what you need to know? Essentialism rears its ugly head in racial terminology. The majority of \"African Americans\" are of mixed race. Yet so entrenched is our essentialist mindset that American official forms require everyone to tick one race/ethnicity box or another: no room for intermediates. A different but also pernicious point is that a person will be called \"African American\" even if only, say, one of his eight great grandparents was of African descent. As Lionel Tiger put it to me, we have here a reprehensible \"contamination metaphor\". But I mainly want to call attention to our society's essentialist determination to dragoon a person into one discrete category or another. We seem ill-equipped to deal mentally with a continuous spectrum of intermediates. We are still infected with the plague of Plato's essentialism. Moral controversies such as those over abortion and euthanasia are riddled with the same infection. At what point is a brain-dead accident-victim defined as \"dead\"? At what moment during development does an embryo become a \"person\"? Only a mind infected with essentialism would ask such questions. An embryo develops gradually from single-celled zygote to newborn baby, and there's no one instant when \"personhood\" should be deemed to have arrived. The world is divided into those who get this truth and those who wail: \"But there has to be some moment when the foetus becomes human.\" No, there really doesn't, any more than there has to be a day when a middle-aged person becomes old. It would be better – though still not ideal – to say the embryo goes through stages of being a quarter human, half human, three quarters human… The essentialist mind will recoil from such language and accuse me of all manner of horrors for denying the essence of humanness. Evolution too, like embryonic development, is gradual. Every one of our ancestors, back to the common root we share with chimpanzees and beyond, belonged to the same species as its own parents and its own children. And likewise for the ancestors of a chimpanzee, back to the same shared progenitor. We are linked to modern chimpanzees by a V-shaped chain of individuals who once lived and breathed and reproduced, each link in the chain being a member of the same species as its neighbours in the chain, no matter that taxonomists insist on dividing them at convenient points and thrusting discontinuous labels upon them. If all the intermediates, down both forks of the V from the shared ancestor, had happened to survive, moralists would have to abandon their essentialist, \"speciesist\" habit of placing Homo sapiens on a sacred plinth, infinitely separate from all other species. Abortion would no more be \"murder\" than killing a chimpanzee – or, by extension, any animal. Indeed an early-stage human embryo, with no nervous system and presumably lacking pain and fear, might defensibly be afforded less moral protection than an adult pig, which is clearly well equipped to suffer. Our essentialist urge toward rigid definitions of \"human\" (in debates over abortion and animal rights) and \"alive\" (in debates over euthanasia and end-of-life decisions) makes no sense in the light of evolution and other gradualistic phenomena. We define a poverty \"line\": you are either \"above\" or \"below\" it. But poverty is a continuum. Why not say, in dollar equivalents, how poor you actually are? The preposterous electoral college system in US presidential elections is another, and especially grievous, manifestation of essentialist thinking. Florida must go either wholly Republican or wholly Democrat – all 25 electoral college votes – even though the popular vote is a dead heat. But states should not be seen as essentially red or blue: they are mixtures in various proportions. You can surely think of many other examples of \"the dead hand of Plato\" – essentialism. It is scientifically confused and morally pernicious. It needs to be retired. INFINITY MAX TEGMARK Physicist, researcher, precision cosmology; scientific director of the Foundational Questions Institute; author of Our Mathematical Universe I was seduced by infinity at an early age. Cantor's diagonality proof that some infinities are bigger than others mesmerised me, and his infinite hierarchy of infinities blew my mind. The assumption that something truly infinite exists in nature underlies every physics course I've ever taught at MIT and indeed all of modern physics. But it's an untested assumption, which raises the question: is it actually true? There are in fact two separate assumptions: \"infinitely big\" and \"infinitely small\". By infinitely big, I mean the idea that space can have infinite volume, that time can continue for ever, and that there can be infinitely many physical objects. By infinitely small, I mean the continuum: the idea that even a litre of space contains an infinite number of points, that space can be stretched out indefinitely without anything bad happening, and that there are quantities in nature that can vary continuously. The two are closely related because inflation, the most popular explanation of our big bang, can create an infinite volume by stretching continuous space indefinitely. The theory of inflation has been spectacularly successful, and is a leading contender for a Nobel prize. It explained how a subatomic speck of matter transformed into a massive big bang, creating a huge, flat and uniform universe with tiny density fluctuations that eventually grew into today's galaxies and cosmic large-scale structure, all in beautiful agreement with precision measurements from experiments such as the Planck satellite. But by generically predicting that space isn't just big, but truly infinite, inflation has also brought about the so-called measure problem, which I view as the greatest crisis facing modern physics. Physics is all about predicting the future from the past, but inflation seems to sabotage this: when we try to predict the probability that something particular will happen, inflation always gives the same useless answer: infinity divided by infinity. The problem is that whatever experiment you make, inflation predicts that there will be infinitely many copies of you far away in our infinite space, obtaining each physically possible outcome, and despite years of tooth-grinding in the cosmology community, no consensus has emerged on how to extract sensible answers from these infinities. So strictly speaking, we physicists are no longer able to predict anything at all! This means that today's best theories similarly need a major shakeup, by retiring an incorrect assumption. Which one? Here's my prime suspect: infinity. A rubber band can't be stretched indefinitely, because although it seems smooth and continuous, that's merely a convenient approximation: it's really made of atoms, and if you stretch it too much, it snaps. If we similarly retire the idea that space itself is an infinitely stretchy continuum, then a big snap of sorts stops inflation from producing an infinitely big space, and the measure problem goes away. Without the infinitely small, inflation can't make the infinitely big, so you get rid of both infinities in one fell swoop – together with many other problems plaguing modern physics, such as infinitely dense black hole singularities and infinities popping up when we try to quantize gravity. In the past, many venerable mathematicians expressed scepticism towards infinity and the continuum. The legendary Carl Friedrich Gauss denied that anything infinite really existed, saying \"infinity is merely a way of speaking\" and \"I protest against the use of infinite magnitude as something completed, which is never permissible in mathematics\". In the past century, however, infinity has become mathematically mainstream, and most physicists and mathematicians have become so enamoured of infinity that they rarely question it. Why? Basically, because infinity is an extremely convenient approximation for which we haven't discovered convenient alternatives. Consider, for example, the air in front of you. Keeping track of the positions and speeds of octillions of atoms would be hopelessly complicated. But if you ignore the fact that air is made of atoms and instead approximate it as a continuum, a smooth substance that has a density, pressure and velocity at each point, you find that this idealised air obeys a beautifully simple equation that explains almost everything we care about: how to build airplanes, how we hear them with soundwaves, how to make weather forecasts, etc. Yet despite all that convenience, air of course isn't truly continuous. I think it's the same way for space, time and all the other building blocks of our physical word. Let's face it: despite their seductive allure, we have no direct observational evidence for either the infinitely big or the infinitely small. We speak of infinite volumes with infinitely many planets, but our observable universe contains only about 10 to the power of 89 objects (mostly photons). If space is a true continuum, then to describe even something as simple as the distance between two points requires an infinite amount of information, specified by a number with infinitely many decimal places. In practice, we physicists have never managed to measure anything to more than about 17 decimal places. Yet real numbers with their infinitely many decimals have infested almost every nook and cranny of physics, from the strengths of electromagnetic fields to the wave functions of quantum mechanics: we describe even a single bit of quantum information (qubit) using two real numbers involving infinitely many decimals. Not only do we lack evidence for the infinite, but we don't actually need the infinite to do physics: our best computer simulations, accurately describing everything from the formation of galaxies to tomorrow's weather to the masses of elementary particles, use only finite computer resources by treating everything as finite. So if we can do without infinity to figure out what happens next, surely nature can too – in a way that's more deep and elegant than the hacks we use for our computer simulations. Our challenge as physicists is to discover this elegant way and the infinity-free equations describing it – the true laws of physics. To start this search in earnest, we need to question infinity. I'm betting that we also need to let go of it.

Members of several anti-nuclear groups that are part of the Stop New Nuclear alliance say they are barring access to Hinkley Point power station near Bridgwater, Somerset, in protest at EDF Energy's plans to renew the site with two new reactors. The new reactors at Hinkley would be the first of eight new nuclear power stations to be built in the UK. Stop New Nuclear spokesman Andreas Speck said: \"This is the start of a new movement. We intend this day to be a celebration of resistance against the government and EDF Energy's plans to spearhead the construction of eight new nuclear power plants around the UK. \"This blockade shows that people who understand the true dangers of nuclear power are prepared to use civil disobedience to get their voice heard. \"The government has hoodwinked the public into believing that we need nuclear power to keep the lights on. But this is totally untrue.\" The protesters said they began their blockade at about 7am, with a theatrical troupe who \"enacted a nuclear disaster scenario similar to Fukushima\", the power plant that was badly damaged during the earthquake that struck Japan on 11 March this year. Most are local people but demonstrators have also come from Belgium and Germany, a spokesman said. Hinkley was one of eight sites the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) confirmed in June as suitable for new nuclear power stations to be built. The others are Bradwell, Essex; Hartlepool; Heysham, Lancashire; Oldbury, Gloucestershire; Sellafield, Cumbria; Sizewell, Suffolk; and Wylfa, Anglesey. A spokesman for EDF Energy said the number of protesters was closer to 100 and they had not chained themselves to any structures at the entrance to the site. Mike Harrison, station director of Hinkley Point B, the current power station, said the company respected the right to peaceful protest but that nuclear power was a vital part of the UK's future energy production. \"We believe strongly that low-carbon nuclear has a vital role in maintaining UK electricity supplies in the future,\" he said. \"As the government has said, the UK continues to need new nuclear power. \"We also appreciate greatly the support of the large majority of local residents, who recognise the contribution we make to the area and the benefits that a new power station would bring to Somerset. \"The UK's chief nuclear inspector's interim report concluded that the UK nuclear power industry had reacted 'responsibly and appropriately' to events in Japan, 'displaying a leadership for safety and a strong safety culture'. Protesters plan to launch 206 helium balloons – to represent the number of days since trouble began at Fukushima – from Hinkley at noon.

France 2 said it regretted using the image, which had been intended to complement Eiji Kawashima's impressive performance in Japan's 1-0 victory over France in a friendly last week. In a statement to the Japanese embassy in Paris, France 2's director, Jean Reveillon, apologised to the Japanese people but said the image had not meant to cause offence to them or those affected by last year's triple meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. \"We are deeply sorry for having hurt your fellow citizens. [The presenter] Laurent Ruquier did not want to be disrespectful to Japan and the Fukushima victims,\" Reveillon said. \"In this humorous or satirical programme, our presenter was mostly trying to mock the French football team. In any case, given the emotions that this has sparked, France 2 presents its regrets and reaffirms our friendship to the Japanese people.\" Japan had lodged a protest over the image, which appeared as Ruquier, the host of a variety show, attributed a string of saves by Kawashima to the \"Fukushima effect\", prompting laughter and applause in the studio.

Radiation leaks forced the evacuation of 150,000 people living near the nuclear plant, most of whom are still unable to return home. The French foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, repeated the apology during a meeting with his Japanese counterpart, Koichiro Gemba, in Paris on Tuesday. Kawashima, who plays for the Belgian club Standard Liege, was targeted for abuse while playing for Lierse SK during a league fixture last year, when opposition fans chanted \"Kawashima, Fukushima!\" The referee temporarily halted play following protests from the player, who was reportedly in tears after the match."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2012/nov/11/coalition-energy-battle","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2012-11-11T22:57:03Z","webTitle":"Energy: a charged debate | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/nov/11/coalition-energy-battle","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2012/nov/11/coalition-energy-battle","fields":{"headline":"Energy: a charged debate","bodyText":"Over the past few weeks, a whole string of big pronouncements have been made on energy policy – very few of them from the secretary of state for energy. At prime minister's questions last month, David Cameron vowed to force energy firms to give customers \"the lowest tariff\". Since his appointment as environment secretary, Owen Paterson's statements on energy have been scrutinised – such as his proposal this spring that fracking for shale gas should be fast-tracked. Then there is junior energy minister John Hayes, who said of onshore windfarms a couple of weeks ago that \"enough is enough\". All these statements have two things in common: they were made by the Conservative end of the coalition; and they have all been disavowed or shouted down by colleagues. Before the end of this month, the man formally in charge of energy policy, the Liberal Democrat Ed Davey, will set out what the government actually plans to do. After all the chopping and changing and copious hot air from his colleagues, he will have a tough job. The politics of this are not incidental; they are fundamental. The Conservatives and the Lib Dems face in two different directions, as ministers on the respective sides freely admit. These gusts of uncertainty would make setting policy in any area difficult; in energy, it makes it almost impossible. Investors in a costly nuclear power station or offshore gas field expect repayment over the coming decades, not the next few years: the prospect of big changes to regulation means they are unlikely even to part with their cash. No wonder then that last month seven of the biggest nuclear and electricity firms in the world threatened to change their British investment plans because of heightened \"political risk\". Tory MPs have two big worries: they don't want their rural constituencies plastered with windmills, and they don't want higher fuel bills. The latter point is perfectly fair – except one excellent way to keep costs down would be for Britain to have more of its own energy supply, and one of the cheapest forms is onshore wind. At best, the energy secretary may win the Tories over to a general agreement that investing in energy provides a boost to construction, engineering firms and jobs – with much of the money coming first from the private sector, then from bill-payers (after 2017). But businesses want actual targets for, say, taking carbon out of power generation by 2030 – an \"inflexible target\" abhorred by George Osborne. If Mr Davey secures that in the energy bill, he will have scored a distinct win for his department – and for the Lib Dems. And that makes this month's battle over energy policy a vital test of coalition relations."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2011/aug/07/bayer-quit-germany-nuclear-shutdown","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-08-07T17:36:19Z","webTitle":"Bayer threatens to quit Germany over nuclear shutdown","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/07/bayer-quit-germany-nuclear-shutdown","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/aug/07/bayer-quit-germany-nuclear-shutdown","fields":{"headline":"Bayer threatens to quit Germany over nuclear shutdown","bodyText":"Germany's decision to phase out nuclear power after the Fukushima catastrophe in Japan could lead to some of the country's major companies relocating elsewhere in search of cheaper energy. Marijn Dekkers, head of Bayer, the pharmaceuticals group, said: \"It is important that we remain competitive compared with other countries. Otherwise, a global company like Bayer will have to consider relocating its production to countries with lower energy costs.\" Under a package of energy bills passed last month by the German government, all nuclear power facilities in the country will be taken offline by 2022. Analysts say that the move will hit energy companies hard and contribute to an increase in electricity prices. Dekkers told the business magazine WirtschaftsWoche that Germany's electricity costs were already the highest in the EU, making the country \"unattractive\" for the chemicals industry. Bayer, which developed the first aspirin in 1897, employs more than 35,000 people in Germany. Dekkers said that his company was planning 4,500 job cuts worldwide – including 1,700 in Germany – but that it was already investing in emerging markets. \"Overall, we will create over 2,500 new jobs in countries like Brazil, India, Russia or China,\" he told WirtschaftsWoche. The report also quoted Robert Hoffmann, head of the communications company 1&amp;1, saying that taxes to subsidise renewable energy sources were too high in Germany. Hoffmann said that his company drew energy from Norwegian hydropower plants, but that it still had to pay a contribution to German renewable energy costs. \"Essentially, we're subsidising the construction of solar-powered roofs... So we end up paying double,\" he said. Hoffmann said that his company was looking at locations where \"green electricity exists without the extra costs\". In a report released last week, the Swedish energy company Vattenfall attributed a fall of 10.2bn Swedish krona (£1bn) in operating profit for the second quarter of 2011 to \"a one-off effect of the German parliament's decision to phase out the country's nuclear power\". The move has also prompted concerns about disrupted power supplies. German transmission systems operators have warned there could be a risk of power outages this winter, and have questioned the reliability of renewable energy sources, saying there is still a need for base power sources to ensure the stability of the grid."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/jul/11/uk-offshore-wind-power","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2011-07-11T17:58:12Z","webTitle":"Bold target set for offshore wind power but sceptics see hidden nuclear subsidy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jul/11/uk-offshore-wind-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/jul/11/uk-offshore-wind-power","fields":{"headline":"Bold target set for offshore wind power but sceptics see hidden nuclear subsidy","bodyText":"The government will lay out plans on Tuesday to create a huge offshore wind industry in the UK, with new targets going far further than even its own advisers have recommended. Instead of the 13GW of offshore wind power by 2020 called for by the Committee on Climate Change – the statutory body that advises ministers on carbon emissions targets and how to meet them – the government wants the UK to have as much as 18GW by the same date. An industry taskforce will be set up to drive forward the plans, with the aim of bringing down the cost of offshore wind from about £140 to £170 per megawatt hour produced today to about £100 a megawatt hour by 2020. That would make offshore wind competitive with other forms of production, which should reduce the need for subsidies in the long term. The plans will call for subsidies funded by increases in the electricity bills of homes and businesses, billions of pounds of investments from overseas turbine manufacturers, potentially creating tens of thousands of jobs, and an overhaul of port infrastructure. Chris Huhne, the climate change and energy secretary, will set out the renewable energy overhaul alongside proposals for other far-reaching reforms of the electricity market, to be announced to parliament on Tuesday . The reforms – the biggest shakeup of the energy market since privatisation two decades ago – are intended to encourage energy companies to make long-term investments in low-carbon energy while keeping down the costs to electricity consumers. They will include reforms to the subsidy regime and new contracts for electricity providers to ensure they keep the lights on while stimulating energy efficiency improvements. But business groups and green campaigners have attacked the plans, saying they could be costly and may not go far enough respectively. There are fears, in both the industry and environmental pressure groups, that the plans are a way of subsidising nuclear energy without appearing to do so directly, because some of the reforms will benefit all forms of \"low-carbon electricity\", which will be taken to include nuclear reactors. The coalition has pledged not to subsidise the nuclear industry \"directly\" but by including it with renewable forms of generation, it can get round this stipulation. Neil Bentley, deputy director general of the CBI, criticised the complexity of some reforms, which include complex mechanisms such as \"contracts for difference\" and \"capacity payments\". He said: \"We're looking for absolute clarity on how the costs [of the £200bn overhaul of the UK's energy infrastructure] will be paid for.\" Andy Atkins, director of Friends of the Earth, accused the government of creating the right conditions for a new \"dash for gas\", which would leave the UK more dependent than ever on gas-fired power generation. He warned this was not a long-term solution for decarbonising the electricity supply, which the Committee on Climate Change has said must be achieved by 2030 if the UK's legally binding climate targets are to be met. Louise Hutchins, of Greenpeace, said that recent price rises in domestic energy bills were due in part to the import of fossil fuels, such as gas. She said: \"Consumers are bearing the brunt of colossal price hikes in domestic energy bills because of the over reliance of the big six energy suppliers on importing expensive fossil fuels while at the same time ignoring clean energy sources around our shores.\" She said the white paper should address the \"stranglehold\" of the big six energy companies, which supply 99% of the UK's energy, over the bills of ordinary people."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2012/oct/22/jane-and-louise-wilson-exhibition","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2012-10-22T16:39:00Z","webTitle":"Post-atrocity exhibition: Jane and Louise Wilson's disturbing films","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/oct/22/jane-and-louise-wilson-exhibition","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2012/oct/22/jane-and-louise-wilson-exhibition","fields":{"headline":"Post-atrocity exhibition: Jane and Louise Wilson's disturbing films","bodyText":"Reading this on mobile? Click here to view On 29 April 1986, three days after Reactor Unit 4 at the Chernobyl nuclear power station went into meltdown and exploded, Vladimir Shevchenko gained access to the site and filmed the ongoing disaster. He shot some of his film from a helicopter, passing directly over the burning reactor. Viewing his footage later, Shevchenko discovered that portions of it were seriously degraded. At first he thought the film stock was faulty; it turned out that the aberrant flashes and blips, and the static on the soundtrack, were the invisible crackles of radiation itself, made visible on the photographic emulsion. Those who were at Chernobyl at the time said that they could feel the radiation, like pins and needles on their skin. Shevchenko, along with the film and the 35mm Konvas Avtomat camera he used, had all been irradiated. The Ukrainian film-maker died a year later, and his camera is now sealed in a lead-lined casket at a storage facility outside Kiev. Chernobyl's reactor is itself entombed in its own sarcophagus. Shevchenko's film, Chernobyl: A Chronicle of Difficult Weeks, has since been described as the most dangerous roll of film in the world. It is now showing on a monitor at the Whitworth Art Gallery in Manchester, alongside Jane and Louise Wilson's most recent film installation, The Toxic Camera. This focuses on Shevchenko's story, and takes us to the exclusion zone around Chernobyl, as well as to the strange, brutal, abandoned military structures that stand on Orford Ness in Suffolk, where, during the 1950s and 60s, Britain's H-bombs, minus their atomic payloads, were tested to ensure they wouldn't go off or shake themselves to pieces before they reached their intended targets. The Toxic Camera features interviews with Shevchenko's surviving colleagues, as well as a great deal of atmospheric and sometimes moving incident. The camera glides, rises and falls. It is a witness and guide, leading you on and detaining you. It rises over a structure that once contained a cyclotron at Orford; it skates over dead mud and pebbles. It gets sidetracked, stopping at a snail's shell, at the torn end of a pipe, a boy's face, a curl of rusted razorwire, apples falling to the ground to rot in an orchard in the Chernobyl exclusion zone. A man buries his head in a tangle of bright foliage. He might be crying. The Wilsons' work is more than just a film. Here is a black, bronze-cast replica of Shevchenko's camera, pointing blindly from its concrete plinth at a measuring stick which, reaching like an antenna towards the ceiling, disappears into the gallery's double-height gloom. More measuring sticks appear in and among the Wilsons' photographs, like divining rods calibrated with chequerboard markings and stripes. They measure nothing, just as the bronze camera sees nothing. Earlier this summer, I visited Orford Ness with the artists. It is one of the strangest, most haunting places I have ever been. Bunkers and concrete pagodas dot this island of shingle and wetland on the Suffolk coast. Radar was developed here during the second world war, and other secret, experimental work went on in the now decaying buildings. The Wilsons had installed their yardsticks in various places, in sub-basements and buildings without roofs, open to the weather, and amplified the ambient sounds of wind and metal that echo through the buildings. Orford feels like the end of the world, a place of grim grandeur and melancholy. The cranes of Felixstowe docks rise to the south. Sizewell nuclear power station dominates the horizon to the north. One place leads to another, Orford to Chernobyl. Journeys to forgotten spaces and liminal zones have been the subject of the Wilsons' work since the beginnings of their joint career, in the early 1990s. The sisters have taken us from Kings Cross bedsits to the abandoned Stasi headquarters in Berlin, from a Russian cosmonaut training centre to a graffitied modernist folly in Peterlee new town. At the Whitworth, they also show us the abandoned Soviet city of Pripyat, near Chernobyl. Here is a ruined classroom and an abandoned, rotting library. Here is civilisation in ruins. In a second, 2011 film installation, with text by Eyal Weizman (and Shumon Basar), Face Scripting: What Did the Building See, the Wilsons' camera tours the sleek anonymity of a modern hotel in Dubai, where a Hamas operative was assassinated by Mossad agents. The camera sweeps the carpet, captures the light on louvred blinds, searches for room 230 where the deed was done. It is just another hotel room. It could be anywhere. Opposite the screen, a dangling TV monitor replays real CCTV footage of the incident. This, too, seems anonymous and generic, with its surveillance footage of corridors, parking zones and lobbies, and captured images of the blurry hit squad, looking like tourists or business guests, come to do their wet work. These two film installations are displayed in large, partially enclosed rooms-within-rooms with translucent walls, with mirrors at right angles to the screens. They feel as much like diagrams as real spaces. The light leaks in and the images thrown on the screen are reflected and multiplied by the mirrors. Get up close and you see yourself there, too, your repeated image bending away into infinity. The effect is like watching the bright windows of a train passing in the night. This sense of duplication and reflection is integral to the artists' work. It feels like metaphor – and it feels like a trap. The Wilsons' film installations haven't always been so effectively staged. Here, they have made great use of the difficult architecture of the Whitworth's complicated spaces.The exhibition design, as much as the things in it, feels like a kind of fiction. We could be in a story by JG Ballard or a novel by Don DeLillo, a movie by Tarkovsky or by Kubrick, a conspiracy thriller or a drama-documentary. What the Wilsons document, they also twist. There is no objective view. Nowadays, instead of featuring on-screen themselves, we are made aware of their overriding subjectivity, an implacable and sometimes merciless view. It is hard not to feel the sadness of the world here, the misery of the modern age, in these rooms of photographs and measuring rods, the dead bronze camera and the filmed trails of murder, nuclear disaster, cold wars and hidden wars. You get lost in it all: there is no end to its bleak and unremitting architecture. • This article was amended on 24 October 2012 to credit Eyal Weizman and Shumon Basar, along with Jane and Louise Wilson, for the film installation Face Scripting: What Did the Building See."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2012/aug/16/germany-delays-windfarm-porpoises","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-08-16T17:21:01Z","webTitle":"Germany delays windfarm because it's not fit for porpoise, yet","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/aug/16/germany-delays-windfarm-porpoises","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/aug/16/germany-delays-windfarm-porpoises","fields":{"headline":"Germany delays windfarm because it's not fit for porpoise, yet","bodyText":"Germany's plan to wean itself off nuclear power has suffered a submarine setback. Utility companies have had to delay construction of a 25,000 megawatt windfarm off the coast because of fears the noise may kill thousands of porpoises. E.ON and RWE are spending millions on developing technology to reduce the noise caused by driving turbines into the seabed after environmental groups warned of the threat to porpoises' hearing. \"A porpoise is doomed to die if its hearing is shattered,\" Kim Detloff, a marine expert at German nature conservation group NABU, told Bloomberg. Berlin is planning to build the windfarm – which would cover an area eight times greater than New York city – by 2030. The installation of noise-reduction technology accounts for 0.5% of the total budget, according to industry specialist Hydrotechnik Lübeck. German utility EWE plans to reduce the noise by creating a stream of bubbles around the drilling area to absorb the sound. There are about 230,000 porpoises in the North and Baltic seas. Noise is a particular threat to porpoises and dolphins because they use sound to navigate, locate prey and find partners. Concern for the porpoises' welfare is one of the factors that make it much more expensive to a build a windfarm in Germany than the UK. It is expected to cost €4.2-€4.4m per MW to develop the German windfarm, compared to €3.7-€4m in the UK."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/nov/01/homi-bhabha-india-thorium-nuclear","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-11-01T16:41:00Z","webTitle":"How Homi Bhabha's vision turned India into a nuclear R&D leader","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/nov/01/homi-bhabha-india-thorium-nuclear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/nov/01/homi-bhabha-india-thorium-nuclear","fields":{"headline":"How Homi Bhabha's vision turned India into a nuclear R&D leader","bodyText":"Despite decades of relative neglect compared with conventional nuclear power, research into thorium is now forging ahead around the world. But it is thanks to the vision of Homi Bhabha, the architect of India's atomic energy programme, that India is a world leader in thorium research and development. He died in a plane crash in 1966 aged 56, but had already laid the foundations for a research programme that is now beginning to bear fruit. India's government-controlled nuclear power industry has been criticised in the past for lack of transparency and inadequate safety oversight. But it has its admirers around the world. \"India has the most technically ambitious and innovative nuclear energy program in the world,\" Siegfried Hecker, a former director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory in the US, wrote in a recent issue of Physics Today. \"The extent and functionality of its nuclear experimental facilities are matched only by those in Russia and are far ahead of what is left in the US.\" Canada, Russia, Japan, the US and the EU all have active thorium research programmes. And China too is now sinking considerable resources into the field. It officially launched its thorium-based reactor project, led by the son of a former Chinese president, at a meeting of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Shanghai earlier this year. \"The commonly used (uranium-based) nuclear reactor isn't a 'perfect stove', and burns only a small proportion of the highest quality fuel, leaving a lot of 'cinder',\" a lead researcher told a Shanghai newspaper. \"We need a better stove that can burn more fuel.\" The Chinese have chosen a different technology path from India in the quest for a thorium reactor – liquid-fluoride instead of heavy water. The International Atomic Energy Agency lists other technologies that are being explored in international thorium research projects. All have yet to prove that thorium reactors can be commercially viable. As far back as 1983, for instance, a high temperature 300MW thorium power reactor was commissioned in Germany, but shut down six years later as it was not found economically feasible."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/live/2014/dec/03/scottish-labour-leadership-live-questions-candidates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2014-12-04T14:30:31Z","webTitle":"Scottish Labour leadership: candidates answer readers' questions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2014/dec/03/scottish-labour-leadership-live-questions-candidates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/live/2014/dec/03/scottish-labour-leadership-live-questions-candidates","fields":{"headline":"Scottish Labour leadership: candidates answer readers' questions","bodyText":"That’s it – all answers have been posted below now. You can refresh the page to see updated posts with answers from all the leadership candidates. Thanks to the three candidates – Neil Findlay, Jim Murphy and Sarah Boyack – for taking part. The new leader of the Scottish Labour party will be unveiled on 13 December. Thanks especially to all of you who posted questions here and on @GdnScotland. Apologies to those whose questions we couldn’t get round to; we did try our best to cover a wide range of subjects. Thank you for reading. Time for one final question: Jim Murphy Sean, I’m guessing you already know the answer to that. I spent the referendum standing on two Irn Bru crates on 100 street corners often with a bottle of the stuff in my hand. I think Scotland is one of just two countries where Coke isn’t the top selling soft drink and I’m one of the Scots who helps make that the case. Neil Findlay Irn Bru – but to be frank I prefer a cold pint of another iconic Scottish refreshment. Sarah Boyack Water. I don’t really do soft drinks, except occasionally. Water is low-cal, generally free and is good for you. The live hustings is coming to a close – I’m filling in the missing answers below as they are filed to me, so do refresh the page to see them appear. There will be one final question after all those below are updated. Neil Findlay Well, I was opposed to the Iraq war then and my view hasn’t changed. I was very proud last year when Ed Miliband kept the UK out of a war on Syria. It is vital that we tackle the mistrust that developed over Iraq and an approach that often seemed overly friendly to the rich and powerful compared to working people. This obscured a lot of the really good work done by the last Labour government. For me, the clue is in the name “Labour”. We need to be, and be seen to be, the party that stands up for working people; the party of more and better jobs; 50,000 more social houses (and it’s good to see Jim supporting my initiative on how we could deliver more social housing). Jim Murphy Good question. I know that a lot of people have drifted away from the party, either in recent years or during the referendum. But I am confident we can win people like you back. I have three priorities that I hope you agree are right for Scotland. First, I want to unite Scotland after the referendum. Second, I want to increase prosperity so that we have the taxes we need to improve our schools and hospitals. And thirdly, I want to reduce poverty, especially the scandal of in-work poverty. Practical steps to do that would be by campaigning for a living wage to give a pay rise to up to half a million Scots and asking the wealthiest to pay a little bit more so that we can support small businesses and tackle poverty. But it’s also about a different way of doing politics. I want to convince people that Scottish Labour has a confident, positive vision for what Scotland can achieve, not by shouting at them or our opponents, but by showing how we can create the better and fairer county that we all want to live in. Sarah Boyack We’re in a new era in Scottish politics. The Smith commission gives us what most people want – a stronger, more accountable Scottish parliament within the UK. We get the benefits of pooling and sharing our resources with communities in England, Wales and Northern Ireland and we get a modernised devolution settlement. For me that’s a good result following on from the referendum campaign and discussions we had. The issue now is how are those powers used. That’s why I’ve put social, environmental and economic justice at the heart of my leadership campaign. We had an 85% turnout in the referendum and well attended debates and discussions across the country. There’s a real debate and energy in the Labour party about how we move forward again. Now would be a good time to join us again. Neil Findlay Well, I wouldn’t have formed Better Together … Having addressed 60-odd meetings the length and breadth of Scotland arguing for a no vote and along the way debating Nicola Sturgeon, Jim Sillars, Tommy Sheridan, etc (all the fun gigs) on the basis of solidarity and our common interests with working people in the rest of the UK, it was this message that had some resonance, rather than the assertion of British identity which was all BT could offer. Also “you’re in bed with the Tories” was an easy – and, from our point of view, avoidable – hit. That has done us damage that will take significant work to repair. We should have started a much more upfront Labour campaign much earlier on. Jim Murphy We should have been more confident in our arguments. We allowed ourselves to be portrayed as the status quo party and I’m not interested in defending things as they are. It was also wrong to allow the SNP to capture the flag and symbols of patriotism. The politics of identity and pride in our country belong to no single party. I don’t believe it was a mistake to get involved in Better Together. I know some people feel differently. But in a country with over 4 million voters we needed to reach out beyond our base and involve people who weren’t involved in party politics. For me that was the success and importance of Better Together – it gave a space to people who were unaligned to get involved and to work with the Labour party. A lot of those volunteers have since joined the Labour party. That’s a good thing. Sarah Boyack Benefit of hindsight is always good … I’d have wanted a stronger United With Labour campaign to sit alongside Better Together. We should have made more of our devolution commission proposals, Power for a Purpose, which set out our case for a stronger Scottish Parliament within the UK and powers to communities. Neil Findlay The party has a federal structure: I very much value our links with the trade unions and the role played by other affiliates such as the Coop and the likes of the Fabians. Our democracy reflects that and I have no plans to change it. I’d encourage all LP members – in fact, every worker – to be in a trade union. Jim Murphy I believe in one person one vote, where everyone’s vote is equal. If it’s good enough for a general election it’s good enough for a Labour leadership election. Some people try to misrepresent this as negative about unions. It’s not. I want rid of the parliamentarian’s golden vote. I want a stronger relationship with trade unionists based upon important policy ideas and I want more individual union members as party members. If I am elected leader I will move to the system that we will use in future UK leadership elections, which will mean that everybody’s vote is equal. Sarah Boyack We should have one member one vote. Neil Findlay Inequalities in health are, to a large extent, an expression of the wider inequalities in society, so if we are serious about tackling Scotland’s poor health we’ll need to tackle those. I’ve set up a health inequalities review – it’s taken evidence from a wide range of bodies – and as leader and in government, I’ll make sure that the focus of what we do is dealing with those inequalities of health and wealth that scar our society. Important as it is – its not just about the NHS – investing in early years provision would be an investment in health. Sarah Boyack We’ve made progress on smoking reduction through leadership and legislation. We need to prioritise healthy lifestyles as a priority. I’d want to make healthier lifestyles part of an overall anti-poverty mission for government. There are lots of good initiatives locally, but they need to be implemented across the country. Promoting walking and cycling is essential – see my comments to Pedal On Parliament’s Q&amp;A. Jim Murphy This is such an important question and reducing health inequalities will be a priority if I am first minister. We do need to tackle the unacceptable friendship that our culture has with alcohol. I can’t be the only one whose friends sometimes say to them: “I had such a great night last night. Got pretty drunk … no idea how I got home.” That can’t surely be a measure of a great night. The problem is clear, but the solutions aren’t as simple. Average healthy life expectancy is lower here in Scotland than the UK averages for both men and women. Heart disease, smoking, alcohol and suicide are also greater challenges here than other parts of the UK. My approach will be to focus on reducing wider inequalities which affect our health – this means action on education, jobs and housing. Health inequality is a product of wider poverty. It also requires equipping our NHS to deal with the challenges of an ageing population at the same time as preventative measures to encourage and support people to live healthier lives. None of this comes on the cheap, which is why it’s important that Labour is the only party in Scotland committed to a 50p tax rate for those earning over £150,000. Neil Findlay Because I was right last time. Jim Murphy Good question. The Scottish Labour party hasn’t been good enough in the past. We haven’t always put forward a confident, positive vision of what Scotland can be. We’ve sometimes given the impression of being pessimists – a party looking forward to a rainy day. I want change that if I am elected leader. I’m an optimist about Scotland. I live in Glasgow and don’t own an umbrella. But judge me by what I’ll do not what I say. I also want to rebuild a coalition of voters. I don’t believe in habitual or tribal voting. I’ve won and defended my constituency (which now has the highest election turnout of any seat in the UK) by reaching out beyond a core vote. I’ll do that again as Scottish leader by reaching out to referendum Yes voters. Many of them aren’t SNP supporters and share Labour’s passion for fairness. Sarah Boyack A wise person recently commented to me that the people most disappointed by a Labour government are those who voted for it! Government is tough. Even during my time as a minister, when we had record levels of spending, we had to choose between good things that deserved support and investment. For what it’s worth, my insight is that for Labour a clear manifesto which makes promises which are deliverable and come from our principles of social, environmental and economic justice has to be our starting point. But it’s also about engagement with people so that we keep listening to people and keep in touch with people’s day to day experiences. That’s hard to do but we need to make a higher priority for all our elected representatives to campaign in their local communities. Some of the most rewarding campaigns I’ve been involved in have led to change in the law or change in decisions: changing the law so we can stop the disruption caused by party flats in residential areas; keeping our local fire control centre open and ensuring we have local knowledge underpinning our fire and rescue services. Social media has opened up the chance for us to be more in touch and to be more engaged – that has to be a good thing. Neil Findlay Not desperately fussed with the idea of elected mayors (provosts, surely?). But do want to see stronger local government able to take its own decisions and set own budgets. Jim Murphy I enjoyed our hustings in Aberdeen on Monday night. I would definitely devolve greater powers across Scotland, particularly welfare powers. It makes no sense to transfer power from one capital city (London) to another (Edinburgh). I want Scottish Labour to win power so we can then give it away again to the different parts of Scotland. I’ll be talking a little bit more about this tomorrow. Sarah Boyack It’s one of the ironies that although we’ve had an SNP government campaigning for more powers to be transferred from the UK government to Scotland that they have been a hugely centralising force since coming to power. Local government in Scotland has been tied into a financial straightjacket and we’ve seen police and fire services centralised with local influence reduced and services centralised. I’ve used my time as Labour’s shadow cabinet member for local government to campaign for double devolution, so that power is transferred from the Scottish government to local authorities and on to local communities. Now that we have new powers being transferred as a result of the Smith commission it’s time for devolution from the Scottish government to local authorities and communities. See my blog. Jim Murphy I support greater devolution to other parts of the UK, including to the great cities and regions of England. But English Votes for English Laws (Evel) is a kneejerk reaction from David Cameron. London MPs vote on transport issues, even though responsibility for this area of policy is devolved to the London Assembly. What we need is a full constitutional convention to look at these issues in-depth, and in a calm and rational manner, not in an attempt to score a few party political points. Sarah Boyack There is a need for give and take as we strike a new balance across the country to bring power closer to the people. There are already English anomalies with London MPs being able to vote on issues across the UK that are devolved to the London mayor, such as transport. Decisions made in Westminster on budgets for England have a direct impact on spending across the UK, and Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish views must be included – there can only be one type of Member of Parliament. In the long run how England and English regions choose to take decisions on the future of services for communities needs a proper debate and wider civic involvement as we had when the Constitutional Convention in Scotland was set up in 1988. A constitutional convention as proposed by Ed Miliband is required, and will let us debate properly how we strengthen accountability across the UK. It’s time to sort out the House of Lords and make it democratic too. Neil Findlay The idea that you have different classes of MPs – some able to vote only on Tuesday or Thursday – is I think, a bit daft. Very little business in the House of Commons only really impacts on England. If there is a democratic deficit, it’s the lack of devolution to regions of England. The rational solution to the WLQ is devolution for the regions of England; until they choose to adopt that, then they must live with the anomalies. I don’t support Evel – it’s been an idea that has been being rejected since Gladstone’s time (when it was known as the “in and out principle” – there we go, one for the constitutional historians there). Apart from anything else, the amount of legislation in the House of Commons that is purely English with no bearing on the rest of the UK is minimal. Neil Findlay The problem isn’t the free tuition, it’s the refusal to resource the policy properly. We need to make the argument that services are free at the point of need – they do come at a cost. I believe we do that through the tax system, making the argument that if we want quality public services , including universities, we as a society must bear that cost. I’m equally clear that the biggest burdens should be borne by those with the biggest shoulders. Jim Murphy Scottish Labour will maintain free tuition in Scotland. But we need to do much more to help kids from poorer backgrounds get on. Too many just don’t get the qualifications they need from school, and the SNP’s cuts to college places means people from working-class backgrounds are being locked out of further education. So I will focus on tackling the inequalities in our education system as a whole. The academic disadvantage builds up from day one of primary school – if not before. Sarah Boyack We need fairness and equality to drive our education policy. That’s not currently happening with too many young people from low income and disadvantaged backgrounds missing out. We’ve lost 140,000 places in Scottish colleges at a time when businesses are crying out for young people with skills and knowledge. It’s a scandal that students from disadvantaged backgrounds are most likely to drop out of university. For me the issue is about targeted support for young people so that they don’t miss out at any stage in life. In our leadership hustings all of us have said we don’t support the introduction of fees for universities and it will be an issue we will provide detail on when we come to develop our manifesto for 2016. Some background here. Jim Murphy We need to give local communities more power over where they live. So I support extending rights for the community to buy land across Scotland. We should go further than the SNP propose. If it is in the public interest for communities to own their land, then they should have the right to buy it. I also want this to be part of a wider effort of ensuring financing is available to local community projects. This should go alongside reform of the crofter housing grant to ensure our rural villages have a sustainable future. Neil Findlay I’ll wait and see. At face value it looked quite good, but we’ve been here before. I remember Alex Salmond announcing, to great fanfare, the birth of the “Hydro nation” . But when it came to parliament it was (ahem) a bit of a damp squib. Similarly they promised great things re extending Freedom of Information, but ended up doing nothing of any significance. So I’ll wait and see what they bring forward, as opposed to what they announce. Sarah Boyack Land reform was one of the big achievements of the first Scottish Labour government in the first term of the Scottish Parliament. It’s transformed people’s lives and created jobs and economic activity in communities that had been held back for years. But we’ve still got around 500 people owning half of our land so for me there’s unfinished business. I’ll support the proposals for a new land reform bill and think a lot of thinking has already gone into shaping what legislation we need. We should be thinking now about where we want to go over the next 10-20 years. There a big opportunities to bring about economic development, housing and renewable energy. Lessons need to be learned from previous legislation: we need the law to be as straightforward as possible so it can be used by communities; we need to enable urban communities to benefit, too; and crucially for me, it has to be tied to an empowerment agenda. We need to give disadvantaged communities a real chance to take the lead and to ensure they have the skills and money to make the transformational changes they want in their communities. Jim Murphy Yes, I would repeal the Football Act. I am a football fan and a season ticket holder for one of Glasgow’s football teams (I’ll leave it to you to guess which one). It’s a poor piece of legislation that was more an attempt to get a few headlines than properly deal with sectarianism in Scotland. Here’s a bit more of what I have said on this. Neil Findlay Repealing the offensive behaviour at footie act has been party policy for a good long while – two years? – and I fully support that. Sarah Boyack Yes, the Act is flawed and should be repealed. I supported the motion which my Labour colleague Elaine Murray MSP moved in our debate on sectarianism on 4 November: That the Parliament notes that, in December 2013, the Advisory Group on Tackling Sectarianism in Scotland published its report, Independent Advice to Scottish Ministers and Report on Activity 9 August 2012 – 15 November 2013; considers that the report’s recommendations require action from groups and organisations across civic Scotland; regrets that neither this report nor the Scottish Government’s response of February 2014 has been debated in the Parliament or scrutinised in depth by a parliamentary committee; agrees that education and prevention are the best ways of tackling sectarianism, and believes that the Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications (Scotland) Act 2012, which was railroaded through the Parliament by the Scottish Government, is flawed and should be repealed. Sarah Boyack I’ve made my views clear – I don’t support the renewal of Trident. I’m proud of the work of the last Labour government to negotiate a reduction in nuclear warheads across the globe. Spending billions on acquiring a new weapons system would be going in the wrong direction. We need to play our part by investing in our own UK defence and peacekeeping capabilities, supporting conflict resolution and using economic sanctions where appropriate. Neil Findlay I’m against the UK having nuclear weapons – I want the Scottish Labour party to be campaigning for the UK to cancel Trident. Jim Murphy I want a world free of nuclear weapons. There are two entirely legitimate views on what is the best way to achieve that – multilateralism or unilateralism. I’m not a unilateralist and want the UK to be part of negotiations to make the world nuclear-free. I know that that is tougher at the moment when the likes of North Korea are trying to acquire nuclear weapons. But I don’t believe in unilaterally stopping being a nuclear power. I’m pretty proud of all the work the previous Labour government did to reduce our warhead numbers. Neil Findlay We certainly need a local control – I also want to see us regaining the capacity to express opinions and take positions on issues going further than Scotland. We lost most of our capacity to do that near the start of the Blair era. Trident is an obvious example. It is and has to be a reserved issue. But I want the Scottish Labour party to be able to state our view that the UK shouldn’t have nuclear weapons and make that position clear and argue for it throughout the UK (as we should in government in Scotland). At the moment Auchenshuggle branch Labour party can have a view – but Scottish Labour can’t. That has to change Sarah Boyack No, we have shared values so I don’t believe in separation. However, there is unfinished business from the review of Scottish Labour that Jim Murphy and I carried out in 2011. I’m clear that the next leader needs to have authority over our staff and resources. If elected as leader, putting in place the resources to support our work would be a top priority. We’re in a new era in Scottish politics and we need to modernise our party and support our local campaign teams across the country. Jim Murphy I have been very clear on this – if I am elected leader, decisions about the Scottish Labour party will be taken here and nowhere else. I don’t favour separation of our party. Two months ago Scotland voted for devolution and against separation – and that’s what Scottish Labour should do. We need to devolve our party as well as our parliament. I value being part of something bigger, but we need to devolve the Scottish Labour party in the way we have devolved the Scottish parliament. I talked about this a few weeks ago. Here’s a link to a fuller answer. Neil Findlay We use the Smith commission borrowing powers and take advantage of historic low interest rates, buy out existing contracts and save billions. Jim Murphy I will take a new approach. We need to look at what delivers the best value, especially at a time when vital capital spending budgets are under increasing pressure. What we need to do is look at innovative new models of finance to deliver capital projects, such as using public sector pensions as bond finance to build social housing. Sarah Boyack When contracts come up for negotiation there are always opportunities to get better value. Using procurement more effectively is something I argued for when we were debating the new procurement legislation earlier this year. A big missed opportunity was the fact that the SNP wouldn’t include the living wage in procurement contracts. The first question is from kristinezkochanski – for background, you can read more about the Smith commission proposals here. The key points are here. Neil Findlay The Smith commission’s report has not pleased everyone. It wasn’t going to – no one gets everything they want out of a negotiation. Indeed there are areas within it that I could quibble at; for example I would have liked to have seen more reference to public ownership and advancing that agenda. I believe in progressive taxation, but there’s more to life than income tax. The increased borrowing powers are vitally important. These new powers offer the Scottish parliament scope to raise money that can be invested in capital projects. For example, it can assist in building more homes, thus meeting a pressing social need while also creating demand in our economy and in turn increasing our tax yield. We can also use that borrowing power to build schools and hospitals and other public assets without the need to rely on the costly and unaccountable PFI and NPD methods. Sarah Boyack I believe the Smith commission recommendations will strengthen the powers and accountability of the Scottish parliament. The fact that five parties sat down to negotiate a powerful package of measures to strengthen devolution and Scotland’s place within the UK is something that I welcomed. The recommendation that there should be publicity to highlight the powers that the Scottish parliament has and will have is important in the interests of transparency and accountability. We will have a powerhouse parliament; the challenge now is to ensure those new powers are used to get people back to work and use the new powers on benefits to support people with disabilities, older people and those on low incomes. I commented before the commission published its report that there we needed guarantees put in place to ensure Scotland got a fair deal. See my blog. There is now significant devolution of taxation proposed, which will see the Scottish parliament responsible for around 60% of the funds it spends, £20bn more in tax, including all personal income tax on earned income. That would let us reintroduce a 50p tax rate on top earners and a 10p rate to help lower earners. Jim Murphy ‘The vow’ has not only been met – it has been exceeded. Over two million Scots voted for a stronger Scottish parliament within the UK. That’s what the Smith commission has delivered and it’s what the Scottish people clearly want. The devolution of major powers like income tax, borrowing and almost £3bn of welfare powers, means the buck will stop with the Scottish parliament. Parties who talk about social justice but fail to act won’t be able to blame anybody else. That’s a good thing, and it’s an exciting time in Scottish politics. Last week I set out how I would use the new powers, which you can read about in more detail here. Tomorrow I will be making a speech on what I would do with the welfare powers. Look out for details on my website or twitter feed. Welcome to the live hustings and here’s a brief run-through of how it will work. Thank you to all those who have submitted questions below and via @GdnScotland. We have selected some of the questions to send to the candidates in advance to allow more time for them to concentrate on other questions as they come in during the live period, as well as more of those already posted. Please do continue to post questions below this liveblog or on @GdnScotland. We will attempt to get through as many questions as we can, and to cover as broad a reach of topics as possible, but it is unlikely that we will be able to get through them all. Every question selected will be put to all three candidates; questions posed to just one candidate are not likely to be picked, sorry. This is to make it fair to all the candidates. Please note: the candidates will answer questions at different speeds and so some answers will be posted ahead of others. We will group their answers under question headings so you will be able to see how all three have responded, but you might need to refresh the page as answers are added. The live hustings will begin at 12.30pm GMT. Across Scotland this week, ballots are being returned for the election of a new leader of the Scottish Labour party. The result will be announced on 13 December. Three candidates have put themselves forward to replace Johann Lamont, who resigned in October after accusing colleagues of trying to run Scotland “like a branch office of London”. Jim Murphy, who has pledged to give up his Westminster seat for Holyrood if he wins, has emerged as frontrunner in the contest. But critics say his New Labour outlook and previous backing for Trident and the Iraq war could prove disastrous in Labour’s urban heartlands. Neil Findlay, currently Holyrood’s shadow health secretary and a member of the Campaign for Socialism group, is popular on the left of the party, and enjoys strong trade union backing. Sarah Boyack, a former transport minister who has been at Holyrood since its formation in 1999, has been a significant figure in the party’s internal policy reforms, working alongside Murphy on restructuring the party organisation and advising Lamont on her proposals for greater devolution. The independence referendum campaign was a gruelling experience for Scottish Labour, already struggling after the party’s bruising defeat by the SNP in the 2011 Holyrood elections. Despite being on the winning side in September’s referendum, Labour has since slumped in the polls in the face of a surge in support for the SNP. The new leader will face a huge challenge ahead of next May’s general election, which Ed Miliband described as “the most important election for a generation” in a speech in Glasgow last Friday. Today, Thursday 4 December, at 12.30pm GMT, all three candidates will be live online to answer your questions about their politics and policies. Please post initial questions for them in the thread below. We’re especially keen to hear from readers who are able to vote in the leadership election, so let us know where you’re based if that is the case. You can also tweet questions via @GdnScotland. Please note that we will be putting the questions to all three candidates."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2012/may/05/japan-shuts-down-last-nuclear-reactor","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2012-05-05T11:35:36Z","webTitle":"Japan shuts down last working nuclear reactor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/05/japan-shuts-down-last-nuclear-reactor","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/may/05/japan-shuts-down-last-nuclear-reactor","fields":{"headline":"Japan shuts down last working nuclear reactor","bodyText":"Japan is shutting down its last working nuclear reactor as part of the safety drive imposed after the March 2011 tsunami triggered a meltdown at the Fukushima plant. The closure of the third reactor at the Tomari plant in Hokkaido prefecture, northern Japan, means all of the country's 50 nuclear reactors have been taken offline, leaving the country with no nuclear-derived electricity for the first time since 1970. Hokkaido Electric said it started lowering output from the reactor at 5pm (8am GMT). The unit should be shut down completely by the early hours of Sunday. Hundreds of people marched through Tokyo waving banners to celebrate what they hope will be the end of nuclear power in Japan. Until last year's earthquake and tsunami triggered radiation leaks at Tokyo Electric Power's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, Japan was the world's third-biggest user of atomic energy. All the reactors have been shut down for routine maintenance. They must withstand tests against earthquakes and tsunamis, and local authorities must give their consent in order for plants to restart. The trade minister, Yukio Edano, and three other ministers have been trying to win public backing to restart two reactors taken offline at Kansai Electric Power's Ohi nuclear plant to help ease expected power shortages of nearly 20% in the summer. The reactors are the first to be considered for reactivation by the government, but it faces an uphill battle to win public support.

In the absence (sadly) of a clear reply, here is a summary of what I think has emerged today: Serious voices including the Royal Academy of Engineering believe that there is a shortfall in current plans for energy generation compared to future demand. It is entirely plausible that energy companies will be more reluctant to invest in expensive new generation projects if there is a risk they will be restructured following the review. They are owned by shareholders whose purpose is to make money, not deliver public goods. Even before this review there was not sufficient evidence of other investors filling this gap (viz the RAE report only a few months ago), and there is no evidence that during the review this would change. However there are other options: some nuclear power stations have had their \"life\" extended already; this could be done with other power stations, while gas generators could be put back to work, and customers could be helped to save energy. The main problem with the competition-inquiry-causes-blackouts argument, though, is timescales. The inquiry is expected to last two years: no investment shelved by power companies during that time would make any difference in that time, nor in the immediate years afterwards, certainly no more than could be handled by the alternative measures outlined above. Even if there are further delays due to political wrangling over any recommended shake-up, it is still a short time scale, and if there were a more serious looming energy crisis both politicians and companies would have big incentives (popularity and profits) to act more quickly on any restructuring and investment. So while an emergency blackout is never something that can be dismissed, indeed they occasionally happen already in exceptional circumstances such as the recent flooding in south west England, I haven't yet seen any good evidence that the proposed competition inquiry would cause a systemic problem. Technically, given a hiatus in investment, Laidlaw could be correct to say that the probe creates an \"increased risk\" of blackouts. But given all the many long term problems and short term alternatives, and the very different time frames for the two events, it is hard to see that being proved in practice. Thanks so much for such helpful input today, especially the pointers (okay, corrections!) on California. I really do appreciate people taking time to read, comment and best of all provide links. Following from the last post, also in October the Royal Academy of Engineering prepared a report on the issue for the prime minister's Council for Science and Technology. This said while power outages were unlikely, they were not inconceivable, and electricity companies needed greater (my italics) incentives to build new generation capacity. Here is an excerpt from the Guardian's report: Blackouts are still unlikely, and could only occur if there are sudden threats to the system, such as the unplanned shutdown of a power station, problems with the interconnectors that bring gas and electricity to the UK, and a prolonged cold snap. But the report, which was prepared for the prime minister's Council for Science and Technology, found that these events have all occurred in recent years – though not at the same time – and could easily happen again. John Roberts, the former chairman of United Utilities who led the work, told the Guardian that electricity generators may need to be given fresh financial incentives paid via energy bills to encourage them to avoid power cuts... \"Energy companies have no legal obligation to keep the lights on. There will need to be incentives.\" A couple of contrary points stand out from this story, however. Firstly, mothballed gas plants would take two to three months to come back on line. This would be a problem in an emergency such as a sudden unplanned shutdown of a power station, however most blackout threats would loom more gradually, presumably with plenty of time for prices to rise and generators to un-mothball (is this a word?) their gas plants. Secondly, the \"critical danger point\" is reported to be \"during the winter of 2014-15\". This is far too soon to be affected by any generation building which might - or not - be affected by the decision to have a competition review of the electricity industry. Which makes me think the whole issue of timing of blackouts and new capacity investment are probably so badly aligned it will be hard to pinpoint this single decision by Ofgem as the cause of any outages in future. Sam Laidlaw is not alone in worrying about blackouts, or at least thinking they are possible. In January, Sir John Armitt, the man credited with delivering the successful London 2012 Olympic Games and now advising Labour about future infrastructure needs, said in an interview with Building magazine (reported in the Guardian) that blackouts could be a good way to jolt ministers into taking action: In harsh political terms [blackouts] would be the best possible thing that could happen because this country is extremely good in a crisis. We are very close to being in a crisis when it comes to energy … the Central Electricity Generating Board used to say that a resilient network operated on a 25% capacity surplus. We're down to 4% because we've gone slower than we should have done on nuclear. The same story quoted Dieter Helm, professor of energy policy at Oxford University,who in turn cited calculations by the Aurora Energy Consultancy, which show surplus energy capacity in 2015-16 could be close to zero – leaving the nation on the cusp of blackouts: We know what the calculations are on the supply side because no new kit [power plants] will be built before 2015-16, but on the supply side all official estimates have underestimated GDP [gross domestic product] growth and therefore energy demand. Last autumn the Daily Telegraph quoted Steve Holliday, chief executive of National Grid, saying they were developing emergency plans to avoid blackouts. Among the ideas discussed, the Telegraph reported, were: Users will be financially incentivised to turn their power off for short periods at peak times, easing the burden on the national system, while energy companies that had planned to decommission power plants will be paid to “bring them back up and running at times of stress. My summary so far is: There is a plausible argument that big energy companies which dominate UK supply and retail will be less willing to invest during a competition inquiry because of the uncertainty over their futures. There is a need for investment as nuclear and coal power stations are expected to be taken off line. But this presupposes that other changes would not close any gap between supply and demand, for example closures could be delayed, other investors could enter the market (as often happens with renewables), or customers - especially big energy using businesses - could find ways to use less energy. Those final points - the alternatives to blackouts - will be my focus for the rest of this afternoon. Back to California. It has been pointed out below the line that the Congressional Budget Office report (see 11:51am) came out before the Enron scandal erupted, which revealed the company's role in the problems. I hold my hands up, I'd forgotten they were linked. Here is a taste: The California example was always a bit of a tangent: on reflection I will ignore it in my summing-up unless somebody finds any further evidence of links. Elsewhere on the Guardian my colleague Damian Carrington has written a feisty blog arguing the very opposite of what Laidlaw has warned: that shaking up the Big 6 energy suppliers should improve generation and security of supply. Here is just one of the points he makes: Energy companies are always quick to raise the spectre of the lights going out and it's easy to understand why: it's scary way of reminding politicians to do what the big six tell them. But energy prices are highest when supply is most stretched. If the lights ever did get close to going out, the big six would rake it in. The reason why the margin between capacity and peak demand is getting so narrow is because the big six have mothballed or postponed power stations until the prospective profits get juicy enough.﻿ Here is the full blog. Worries about the gap between demand and supply - and the willingness of privatised utilities to fill it - are not new. This paper from the House of Commons Library in 2010 is prescient. The Library is highly regarded by all parties for its a-political and rigorous work. Here is their summary of how generation needs to change: And here is a timely warning about market uncertainty and investment: The current liberalised market is unlikely to deliver the new electricity generating capacity and infrastructure that the UK urgently requires by the middle of the decade. Private companies are reluctant to make major investments in generation and transmission without greater certainty about the payback. Centrica has sent me some analysts' reaction to today's Ofgem announcement. Morgan Stanley: This will likely stop almost all generation investments from the Big 6. Liberum: It is likely in our view that the hiatus in power generation investment we have seen in recent years will continue and probably deepen. I have not verified them, but I would be surprised if they were not accurate. I'm not vouching for the analysis, before you ask. I would not presume. But these are the views of people not paid to say what the company wants, but to advise their colleagues and clients who have shares or might invest in the companies. The first response I had to this subject on Twitter this morning was Following a little research I found this paper by the US Congressional Budget Office: 'Causes and lessons of the California electricity crisis', published in September 2001. It is clear that California's problems arose from historic demand and supply issues, a restructuring plan in 2000 CHECK which imposed a price freeze, and the state government's response when problems began to emerge. There seems little doubt though that the price freezes contributed significantly in two ways: On the supply side, the plan's freeze on retail prices left the three big utilities in a financial shambles when wholesale prices in the spot market—where those utilities were acquiring nearly half of their power—rose above the freeze level. The plan made the utilities particularly dependent on that market in two ways: it encouraged them to sell their fossil-fuel generating capacity, and it discouraged them from signing new long-term supply contracts that could have protected them from adverse movements in prices. Faced with a universal-service requirement (they could not unilaterally drop customers) and with a negative cash flow on nearly half of their sales, the utilities saw their losses mount. Lenders downgraded their creditworthiness, thus raising their costs for new borrowing. Moreover, independent power generators were able to push up wholesale prices further and even withdrew supplies when it looked as though the utilities might not be able to pay for their purchases... And, ﻿On the demand side two problems coincided. Extreme weather and strong economic growth put stress on the market by increasing the use of power. At the same time, the freeze on retail prices magnified the impact of that stress on wholesale prices by eliminating incentives for consumers to conserve power. Even a small drop in electricity use—like the decline that occurred in San Diego when the price freeze there was temporarily lifted—would have been enough to let the state avoid some of the disruptions it has faced.﻿ Under the sub-heading Lessons for the future, the message is clear: California responded to its immediate concerns about the availability of electricity and the volatility of prices by directly intervening in the market—a response that could prove costly to electricity consumers and taxpayers. Long-term solutions to California’ s electricity problems will most likely require three changes: removing barriers to the addition of generating capacity, eliminating bottlenecks in the elec- tricity transmission system, and removing regulatory restrictions on the sale of power throughout the broad western market. Those actions would help make the supply of electricity more responsive to changes in prices. On the demand side, the prospects for successful restructuring would also improve if consumers faced the full costs of electricity and were better able to adjust their use of power in response to changing prices.﻿ The above is more relevant to the growing pressure from Labour for a price freeze than the Ofgem recommendation to the Competition and Markets Authority for a wider investigation into prices and market structure. It is interesting though for two reasons: one of the richest and technologically advanced places in the world (California) was not protected from blackouts when outside interference affected the market, and because the CMA referral feels like an attempt to head off more direct intervention like that advocated by Labour. A video interview with Sam Laidlaw on the Centrica website (here) gives some insight into the rationale behind his concern about an increasing risk of blackouts: his argument appears to be that during the competition probe energy companies will not want to invest in new power generation and with demand rising, gas supplies under threat in places like Ukraine, and old nuclear and coal power stations due to be retired, this could lead to a gap between demand and supply. Such a gap could, in theory, be dealt with by reducing the intensity (for want of a better word) of electricity supplied, called brownouts, or cutting electricity to some customers - blackouts. Here are some quotes from the video (with the time from the beginning that the quote begins in brackets): At 00:31 The concern about this inquiry is it would last two years at a time when we have already had five years of investment hiatus because of electricity market reform. We'll then have a further two years of under-investment﻿. This is coming at a time when actually Britain's energy security is being seriously challenged, not just in power generation but if you look and see what's happening in Ukraine for gas supplies as well. At 05:41: Clearly if we have this competition referral our ability to invest is going to be handicapped because we wouldn't invest in new power generation if there was a possibility that you might have to divest as a result of a competition referral. So that is the political risk during this period. And at 07:30, in comments aimed at shareholders: There will be a period of some regulatory uncertainty, which will make it very difficult for us to invest, particularly in power generation, and therefore I think shareholders may have to be a little patient during this process.﻿ I have asked Centrica if they want to elaborate. In the meantime I will dig out figures for any looming gap between supply and demand, and look at what plans are in place to fill that. I'm still hoping the BBC will load up the Sam Laidlaw interview as an AudioBoo file. Until then, this is a fuller report of what he said, and the reply by the energy secretary Ed Davey, via the BBC News story: Sam Laidlaw, Centrica chief executive, said he hoped \"a lengthy review process will not damage confidence in the market, when over £100bn of investment in new infrastructure is needed\". When questioned on the BBC Radio 4's Today programme over whether it would mean power outages he said: \"There is an increasing risk. A lot can be done in terms of demand management, but actually building a new gas power station does take four years. \"So that's the kind of time pressure we are up against, by adding another two years that makes it six years.\" However, the Energy Secretary, Ed Davey said: \"He is absolutely, totally wrong and I can prove it. We have 14 contracts for power generation [in the pipeline] over the next 15 years. \"What we are seeing in Britain is a big investment in energy. \"It is true that companies like Centrica are not investing as much as we might like them to but we are seeing independent energy generation firms like Siemens coming in in their place.\" Here, in a nutshell, is why today's announcement has been made Ofgem, the energy industry regulator, today announced it would ask the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to investigate electricity and gas suppliers. It hoped to Once and for all clear the air and allow the CMA to ensure that there are no further barriers to effective competition. Ofgem said it acted after a dramatic drop in consumer confidence and growing pressure from rising consumer prices and profits taken by the Big Six retailers who dominate the market, specifically: Retail profits increasing from £233 million in 2009 to £1.1 billion in 2012, with no clear evidence of suppliers becoming more efficient in reducing their own costs, although further evidence would be required to determine whether firms have had the opportunity to earn excess profits﻿. Here is the Ofgem announcement, and here is the Guardian story. Any findings will also play a key part in the political debate over how to respond to one of the key elements of what Labour have successfully dubbed the \"cost of living crisis\" in the UK. Labour wants to freeze energy bills pending such a review. Among the fundamental changes which will be considered is whether major energy companies should be split up and how to make it easier for more companies to enter the market, so increasing pressure on the Big Six to cut prices to keep customers. Responding the the expected announcement, Sam Laidlaw, chief executive of Centrica, once part of British Gas, told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme such a probe raised an \"increasing risk\" of blackouts. Blackouts are regularly used to frighten politicians into making or not making decisions about costs and investment, though they seldom if ever materialise. What is the argument for Laidlaw's latest claim, and is there evidence to justify the fear?

If he gets stuck at the back of a scrum at a temporarily underpriced bar, the 10-minute rate will revert to something less favourable, and he'll be left drinking slower and at a higher price than the others. Underground dives always offer better rates, but he risks losing enough 3G signal to make a last-minute trade before the bill comes in. Drinking in the City is no longer about overpriced champagne, it's about a personal rating on the Per-Pint futures index. I was shocked at recent online survey results: 69% of UK respondents had heard of the online currency Bitcoin, and of those 32% trusted the currency. The survey was a quick piece of work done partly to promote the first Bitcoin London conference this week, and I worry that the sampling is biased towards super-hip kids with tablet devices. But even so, that's pretty amazing. Bitcoins are nothing more than strings of computer code – just like all the other packages of data uploaded and downloaded across the internet. They have value because it's hard to create these particular sequences of code; they are solutions to an ever-changing maths problem, modified to make sure – at the moment – that approximately 150 coins are produced an hour. No more than 21 million coins will ever exist. If you want to understand why, the Bitcoin Foundation has a good wiki explaining the basics. No bank certifies Bitcoins and no treasury has declared it legal tender. They are worth only as much as other people's desire to use them. A recent profile of Bitcoin entrepreneurs argued that \"to be a Bitcoin user is to be a Bitcoin evangelist\". They are traded on a shared belief that these sequences of numbers and letters are worth something. It is a technology created completely by faith. So why are people willing to trust an unregulated technology that poses immediate financial risk? It seems odd given that public trust in science and technology depends directly on the organisations that develop that technology. In the latest Public Attitudes to Science Survey in the UK, 84% of respondents trusted university scientists. 56% trusted industry scientists. One of my crib sheets for this type of issue is a short paper put together by two Cambridge philosophers for a government advisory group that looked at science and trust. They start from the idea that we always trust someone to do something. Trust is not some kind of wholehearted love-in. It's much more specific than that. I tried to pull apart the different organisations producing, trading and investing in Bitcoin, and work out who is being trusted to do what – and whether I would give them my money. Trust to do what? Algorithms, market traders and nightclub owners Trusting the maths of Bitcoin makes sense. Most of the computer code behind it is publicly available, meaning it has been checked over by lots of programmers. The algorithm that limits the supply of coins also verifies transactions between anonymous users. So there is a record of when the coins are bought and sold. To get Bitcoins from cash, you need to go via a Bitcoin exchange. Mt. Gox is by far the most popular. I got a bit uneasy using their site: wiring money to a branch of a random Japanese bank, with annoying overseas payment fees attached; waiting two to five days with no guarantee that funds will turn up in my account with the exchange (they haven't yet). Once the money clears, I can buy Bitcoins at the current market rate. Although, be warned, the market is much more volatile than, say, stocks and shares. One Bitcoin was worth £65 on Monday and now only £48. But at least using Mt. Gox is safer than meeting up in Union Square in New York where you can trade $50 dollar notes for Bitcoins exchanged via Android smartphone apps. After I have my coins, I can then transfer them to my virtual wallet on my iPhone. (Apple has disabled apps with a live link to a virtual currency exchange). And I can choose when to spend them. Not that there is much choice in the UK just yet. There is only one pub that accepts them. Luckily it's near my house. Getting involved with companies that have sprung up around the currency is a much riskier bet. These are the online currency equivalent of nightclubs; daring investments that survive on only their hype. Private exchanges like Coinsetter manage your purchase of Bitcoins for you. The Winkelvoss twins, who once sued Mark Zuckerberg over the ownership of Facebook, have registered a Bitcoin Trust, which will invest in Bitcoins. They hope to operate in the same way commodity–based funds invest in precious metals. And just to mess up metaphor and reality, one New York nightclub owner also runs one of the first Bitcoin payment processing software companies. Venture capitalists are very excited about these companies. Over $10m were invested in Bitcoin start-ups in the past three months. But it's still very early days – there are more investors than there are companies. I find this all a bit strange when it's not clear exactly why Bitcoins are valuable. I have no idea whether I would be investing in a nightclub or gold bars. Being your own bank Putting my faith in Bitcoin is much easier than nanotechnology or nuclear power. So far, I have not trusted the currency to do anything much. It doesn't raise fears about tiny robots taking over the world, or debilitating illness from radioactive exposure. Nor do I have to hand over much control to anyone else – this is an algorithm not a bank. The Bitcoin founders' hands-off approach makes the public's usual questions about how a technology is created less relevant. However, if the private Bitcoin exchanges and investment companies take off, there will be a different story. This would attract the attention of regulators. Crowdfunding peer-to-peer lending platforms went through this when they began to compete with banks' small business loans. UK crowdfunders are now pushing hard for self-regulation, setting out a code of conduct. US regulators already have a tense relationship with the Bitcoin Foundation. A similar online exchange was recently shut down in the US after it was used for largescale money laundering. There is an opportunity for a more cooperative approach in Europe. The UK government chose crowdfunding as one of six areas of business where it wants to remove red tape, signalling a willingness to support alternative finance systems. For some, Bitcoin stands for something much bigger. It is a statement of distrust in banks, and the desire to find an alternative – any alternative. This is certainly the motivation behind Freicoin, an alternative to Bitcoins used by the Occupy movement. It devalues over time, reducing the incentive to save. Switzerland has had an alternative currency system to aid local trade since 1934. Other technologies that bypass the bank are popping up all over the place – peer-to-peer foreign exchange, open source software to analyse financial market risks or an interplanetary payment system for the space tourists of the future. But Bitcoin is today's flag-waver for distributed, accessible finance. I hope it's around for a while. It's an interesting experiment in negotiating how to trust digital technology. And if technology can help us do anything, broadening the financial powerbase is not a bad place to start."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2012/nov/29/invensys-sells-rail-business-to-siemens","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2012-11-29T08:15:55Z","webTitle":"Invensys shares soar as it sells rail business to Siemens","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/nov/29/invensys-sells-rail-business-to-siemens","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2012/nov/29/invensys-sells-rail-business-to-siemens","fields":{"headline":"Invensys shares soar as it sells rail business to Siemens","bodyText":"Another British success story has been sold abroad with the £1.7bn disposal by engineering group Invensys of its high-tech rail services business to Siemens of Germany. Shareholders are in line for a £625m windfall and Invensys said it made sense to \"refocus\" itself on industrial software and control systems. Critics said it was \"bad news for UK plc\". The rail business has provided almost 40% of profits for the Invensys group, whose connections with the industry go back over 150 years through predecessor company Saxby &amp; Farmer. Invensys Rail is the latest in a long line of top British businesses or brands to fall into foreign hands, after International Power was bought by GDF Suez and Weetabix snapped up by the Chinese. Already companies such as Rolls Royce, P&amp;O and the Savoy hotel and transport hubs such as Heathrow airport and Felixstowe docks are controlled abroad. Sir Nigel Rudd, the chairman of Invensys, has already overseen the transfer of both Boots the chemist and Pilkington glass to overseas buyers. Wayne Edmunds, the chief executive of Invensys, argued the Siemens deal was good for investors and the business. \"As well as providing shareholders with an immediate cash return, this transaction enables the group to create a long-term pension solution and therefore increased financial flexibility going forward.\" The British engineering company plans to return £625m to shareholders through a special dividend, with another £400m used to plug the company's pension scheme deficit and £250m held in a pension reserve. The UK pension scheme deficit has jumped by £335m in the last 18 months to £490m in September. The company blamed the Bank of England's quantitative easing programme. Invensys shares had closed on Wednesday night up 27% at 280p as rumours of a takeover swept across trading desks, before the company finally revealed that Invensys Rail would be sold. The shares rose 12% in early trading on Thursday and closed 8.9% up at 305p. Invensys and Siemens have worked closely together recently, jointly providing the signalling for the new Crossrail network running through London. The German business has itself come under pressure for not focusing enough attention on its most profitable divisions and is already a major investor in turbine manufacturing and other activities in Britain. Alex Brummer, a former Guardian City editor and author of a recent book, Britain for Sale, said this latest transaction was bad for the wider UK economy. \"We should not be surprised by this. Sir Nigel Rudd has a habit of selling important British businesses to overseas buyers. It may be good news for the shareholders now, but it is bad news for UK plc as it seeks to create a better-balanced economy.\" Some in the City believe the wider Invensys business could now be targeted for acquisition. Rae Ellingham, analyst at Charles Stanley brokerage, has raised his recommendation on the stock to \"accumulate\" from \"hold\". Invensys will continue trading in its other areas, including installing regulating controls at nuclear power stations, as well as oil and gas plants. Its rail business, however, was arguably its most successful division, taking £775m last year, with operating profits of £116m. It accounted for 30% of business, but 39% of profits. Research this summer from Experian, the information services group, revealed that overseas investors had bought 16 companies worth more than £1bn in the first six months of the year, double the number in the same period a year before."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/mar/11/nuclear-sites-sea-rise-tsunamis","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-03-11T21:00:03Z","webTitle":"Letters: Nuclear sites, sea-level rise and tsunamis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/mar/11/nuclear-sites-sea-rise-tsunamis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/mar/11/nuclear-sites-sea-rise-tsunamis","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear sites, sea-level rise and tsunamis","bodyText":"It seems clear that nuclear facilities will be vulnerable to the effects of global warming (Nuclear power sites face flood and erosion risks, 8 March).

Cumbria's cabinet voted after an hour's debate and a further hour of public questions and comments to exclude the whole of Allerdale from consideration, ruling out any chance of a dump on the Solway Firth or near Cockermouth and the green hinterland of Workington and Maryport including the fringe of the north western Lake District fells. The council's Conservative leader, Eddie Martin, has proposed that Copeland should also be excluded, torpedoing the entire proposal so far as Cumbria is concerned, and that research should shift instead to surface storage at Sellafield. The Labour councillor, Tim Knowles, who leads on environment for the cabinet has countered with a proposal that Copeland should be considered but with all parts of the Lake District national park excluded, which would remove the threat to Ennerdale and Eskdale. The whittling down of suitable areas in the fractured local geology has raised international concern that the wild western fringes of the Lake District would be targeted by prospecting crews, drilling and fellside roads even at the earliest stages of research. Unions have called for an end to the uncertainty over the issue, with nearly 10,000 jobs at the Sellafield nuclear complex on the coast underpinning the economy of \"non-tourist\" parts of Cumbria. But opponents argue that essential long-term work on cleaning up the sprawling plant guarantees ample work for decades to come, and that tourism is economically more significant. Cumbria county and the district councils of Allerdale and Copeland are the last in the UK to remain interested in housing a storage depot, which would cover a hidden area the size of Workington and cost an estimated £12bn. Labour-run Copeland, whose area includes Sellafield, is expected to support the idea but divisions are much closer at Allerdale and Cumbria itself, whose approval would be essential for progress. The councils deferred a decision in October because of unease over a guaranteed right to withdraw right up until construction work started, and to look at alternative disposal methods. Since then, the prospect of serious surface damage during research to Ennerdale and Eskdale, which skirt the greatest fells of the Lake District including England's highest mountain, Scafell Pike, have led to warnings from the national park authority, Friends of the Lake District and international environmental groups that such moves would be vehemently opposed. Garry Graham, deputy general secretary of the Prospect union, which represents 12,000 nuclear workers, said: \"A decision not to proceed to the next stage of feasibility studies will take us straight back to the drawing board. The alternative to building a repository is not no radioactive waste, just continued surface storage. Therefore the assessment of the scientific case for a geological disposal facility needs to weighed against the pros and cons of the alternatives. \"The next stage consists of experts conducting desk-based geological studies, compiling a waste inventory and discussions over the social and economic implications. It is still a long way from a green light for any excavation or exploratory groundwork. Not only does the vote have vast implications for the economic wealth of West Cumbria, which relies so heavily on the nuclear industry for jobs and growth, it potentially casts a shadow over any nuclear renaissance in the UK.\" The government is looking to nuclear power to play an increasing role in keeping the UK's lights on and Baroness Verma, minister for energy and climate change, said: \"We have worked in the last few months to make sure we have been able to respond to those questions. I'm hoping now that having done all the work that I needed to do, the councils are satisfied that they can actually move on to the next stage. However, of course, it is a decision that they have got to take.\" The facility has to meet unprecedented standards including the notion of safe storage of radioactive material for a million years. It would employ some 550 people during construction with 2040 as the target date for storage to start. The campaign group 38 Degrees is raising a petition which has so far had 32,000 signatures and its spokesman Alex Lloyd said: \"This is about people power. For over 32,000 people to sign this petition in just a few weeks sends a really clear message that the public don't want a nuclear dump in the Lake District.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/jan/10/severn-barrage-wildlife-claims-guff","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-01-10T12:40:15Z","webTitle":"Severn barrage opponents dismiss wildlife-friendly claims as 'guff'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/jan/10/severn-barrage-wildlife-claims-guff","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/jan/10/severn-barrage-wildlife-claims-guff","fields":{"headline":"Severn barrage opponents dismiss wildlife-friendly claims as 'guff'","bodyText":"Angling, wildlife and heritage groups on Thursday attacked new proposals for a £34bn tidal barrage across the Severn estuary, with one telling MPs that environmental benefits touted by proponents of the barrage are \"spin\" and \"guff\". But former Labour minister Peter Hain, who stepped down from the shadow cabinet last year to back the plans, told the energy and climate change committee that it would generate 5% of the UK's electricity – equivalent to around four nuclear power stations or thousands of wind turbines – create 50,000 jobs and protect the region from storm surge flooding. \"Of course it's generating controversy and generating interest, anything of this scale is bound to do so. That's legitimate,\" Hain said. He added that the UK is \"blessed with natural renewable energy and we're simply not harnessing it. We need to think big, and act big.\" Hain said the new type of turbines used in the proposal would not harm fish. \"It works on ebb and flow, emulates natural tidal flow of the Severn, and uses different types of turbine that are much more fish-friendly.\" But asked if he thought it was credible that there would be a 100% survival rate for all types of fish passing through the turbines, as developers Hafren Power had claimed, he admitted he could not be certain. Martin Salter, a former Labour MP and national campaigns coordinator for the Angling Trust, said there were 83 species of fish in the estuary and the barrage would harm the economy. He said the Environment Agency was not aware of any turbine designs that could allow fish to safely migrate through infrastructure on the scale of the proposed barrage. \"Claims that these turbines are fish-friendly are absolutely guff,\" he said. \"This proposal could have a devastating impact on Britain's most popular participatory sport. A lot of the arguments put forward by Hafren are nothing less than spin.\" In 2010, the government rejected a previous proposal for a barrage across the Severn estuary, reiterating plans at the same time to push ahead with Europe's most ambitious fleet of new nuclear reactors. The previous plan would have required £600m of government funding but proponents of the new plan say that it will not require public subsidy. Kate Jennings, head of site conservation policy for the RSPB, said that a cost could not yet be put on Hafren Power's plans to compensate a loss of habitat for the estuary's wildlife with newly created habitat elsewhere until more detail was published on the proposal. On the idea of providing compensatory habitat for the fish, she said: \"it's hard to imagine how that is achievable.\" Simon Pryor, director of natural environment at the National Trust, told MPs that the barrage would be visible from landmark sites such as Exmoor, the Quantock hills and the Mendips. However, he said: \"We don't know enough at the moment to contest the claims [made in support of the barrage].\" The criticisms follow a letter in the Telegraph today from the former defence secretary Liam Fox, who called the plan for an 11-mile barrage an \"environmentally disastrous concept\". Hain said that Hafren Power had allocated £1bn for providing compensatory habitat for birds and fish affected. \"[It's] another example of why this is completely different to previous projects, they have said you have to get the ecological issues addressed.\" Hain said the new proposal was \"an entirely different project\" and that it was \"the like of what I've not seen in over 10 years as a minister\". He told the committee: \"The thing we are very keen to get right is getting the wildlife groups involved in the testing of the technology, to make sure the claims of fish-friendly stand up. Meanwhile, the clock is ticking on climate change, on renewable energy targets, and the creation of thousands of jobs.\" Hain met David Cameron last summer to discuss the new proposal, and the prime minister is understood to have asked ministers to examine it. Union leaders from the TUC and Unite told the hearing that they supported the new proposal."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2010/oct/15/russia-venezuela-build-nuclear-power-station","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2010-10-15T18:27:00Z","webTitle":"Russia agrees to help Venezuela build first nuclear power station","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/15/russia-venezuela-build-nuclear-power-station","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2010/oct/15/russia-venezuela-build-nuclear-power-station","fields":{"headline":"Russia agrees to help Venezuela build first nuclear power station","bodyText":"Russia has agreed to help Venezuela build its first nuclear power station, in a move that is likely to raise concerns in Washington about the increasingly close co-operation between Moscow and Caracas. President Dmitry Medvedev announced the move at the end of a two-day visit to Moscow by Venezuela's president, Hugo Chávez. Venezuela's economy is overwhelmingly reliant on oil and Chávez has said he wants the nuclear power station to diversify energy supply. A senior US administration spokesman said the White House was not planning to respond. A state department spokesman, PJ Crowley, said this week that there were no specific concerns about Venezuela's nuclear ambitions. \"Certainly nothing that rivals Iran,\" he said. The official US position is that it is not opposed to civilian nuclear technology, only to the proliferation of nuclear weapons programmes. Medvedev implicitly acknowledged the deal was not likely to be popular with the US administration but defended Venezuela's right to seek access to peaceful nuclear technology. The station is likely to be built over the next 10-15 years. Its cost has not yet been revealed. \"An agreement has just been signed on co-operation in the atomic sphere. I don't know who will shudder at this,\" Medvedev said, speaking at a press conference following talks with Chávez. He added: \"The president [of Venezuela] said there will be countries in which this will provoke different emotions. But I want to say especially that our intentions are absolutely pure and open.\" Russia wanted Venezuela to have a \"full range of energy choices,\" he said. Chávez's visit is his ninth to Moscow and is the first stop on a 12-day European tour that includes Belarus and, for the first time, Ukraine – now once again within Moscow's sphere of influence. On previous occasions Chávez has bought billions of dollars worth of military hardware from Russia including submarines, helicopters and attack aircraft. Both leaders today reaffirmed their plans to continue co-operating on technical and military issues. Viktor Semyonov, an economist at Moscow's Institute of Latin American Studies, said it was logical for Venezuela to seek civilian nuclear technology since its economy was even more dependent on oil than Russia's. Russia is already building a nuclear power station in Iran, and is also holding talks with other Latin American countries including Brazil and Argentina, he pointed out. \"We are a country that exports nuclear technology around the world. Venezuela's economy is 94 or even 95% made up of oil. Russia's is 65%, which is already a lot. They [the Venezuelans] want to widen their sources of energy so they are less dependent on it.\" Sergei Kirienko, the head of Rosatom, Russia's state nuclear corporation, said that Russia could build a VVER — or pressurised water reactor — for the Chávez regime. \"It could be in 10 years. It could be earlier,\" he said. Kirienko said practical nuclear co-operation would start soon, including \"training staff for Venezuela's nascent atomic sector\" and help with drawing up new legislation in line with International Atomic Energy Agency rules. Russia would also carry out \"geological prospecting\" to study the possibility of extracting natural uranium inside Venezuela, he said. Speaking in Moscow on Thursday night, Chávez offered assurances that Venezuela had no interest in building a nuclear bomb, and only wanted to pursue peaceful nuclear technology. He also described the collapse of the Soviet Union as a \"catastrophe\" and launched a familiar attack on the United States, denigrating it as a \"Yankee empire\". Chávez went for a spin in a Lada car, causing miles of gridlock on Moscow's already traffic-clogged streets. Before heading to the airport, he handed Medvedev several gifts. They included three bars of chocolate, some banana jam and a tin of cocoa. Russia's prime minister, Vladimir Putin, travelled to Caracas in April, signing a preliminary agreement on civilian nuclear co-operation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/sep/08/fukushima-nuclear-disaster-pm-japan","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-09-08T19:26:41Z","webTitle":"Fukushima nuclear disaster: PM at the time feared Japan would collapse","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/08/fukushima-nuclear-disaster-pm-japan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/sep/08/fukushima-nuclear-disaster-pm-japan","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima nuclear disaster: PM at the time feared Japan would collapse","bodyText":"Japan's prime minister at the height of the nuclear crisis has said he feared the country would collapse, and revealed that Tepco had considered abandoning the Fukushima Daiichi power plant after it was hit by the 11 March tsunami. In candid interviews with Japanese newspapers, Naoto Kan, who resigned this month, said that at one point he believed the disaster could become many times worse than Chernobyl. \"It was truly a spine-chilling thought,\" he told the Tokyo Shimbun, adding that he foresaw a situation in which greater Tokyo's 30 million people would have to be evacuated, a move that would \"compromise the very existence of the Japanese nation\". In the first week of the crisis Tepco played down speculation that fuel rods had melted after the quake and tsunami crippled the reactors' cooling systems. \"The power was totally lost and there was no cooling capacity,\" Kan said. \"I knew what that meant and I thought, 'This is going to be a disaster'.\" His unease grew when his trade minister, Banri Kaieda, told him that Tepco was considering pulling its staff out of the plant and leaving it to its fate. \"Withdrawing from the plant was out of the question,\" he said. \"If that had happened, Tokyo would be deserted by now. It was a critical moment for Japan's survival. It could have been a led to leaks of dozens of times more radiation than Chernobyl.\" Kan demanded an explanation from Tepco's then president, Masataka Shimizu, but \"he never told me anything clearly\". Kan was also critical of Tepco's failure to immediately obey his order to vent one of the overheating reactors, prompting him to view the plant by helicopter the day after the tsunami. \"I went because we were not receiving accurate information,\" he told the Asahi Shimbun. \"I felt I had to go there in person and speak to the people in charge or I would never have known what was going on.\" Kan, whose handling of the crisis drew widespread public criticism, said Washington had also grown frustrated with his government's response. \"We were not told straight out, but it was obvious that they questioned whether we were really taking this seriously,\" he said. Kan defended the gradual widening of the exclusion zone, and his conversion to a non-nuclear energy policy: \"If there is a risk of accidents that could make half the land mass of our country uninhabitable, then we cannot afford to take that risk.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/nov/26/german-renewable-energy-emission-co2","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-11-26T18:46:37Z","webTitle":"German renewable energy drive brings emissions cuts success","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/nov/26/german-renewable-energy-emission-co2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/nov/26/german-renewable-energy-emission-co2","fields":{"headline":"German renewable energy drive brings emissions cuts success","bodyText":"Germany has reduced its greenhouse gas emissions significantly in recent years as it has pushed forward a renewable agenda leading Europe into an age of wind and solar power. In the past year, the country's CO2 emissions fell by 2.4% compared with 2010, according to figures released by Germany's Federal Environment Agency (UBA). The decrease, say experts, has largely come through a push towards renewable energy that has accelerated since the country began its move away from nuclear power. In the first six months of 2012, the amount of electricity produced using renewable energy rose from 20% to 25%, bringing the country closer to its targets of 35% by 2020 and 80% by 2050. \"We are on a good track in regard to the increase in the share of renewables,\" said Brigitte Knopf, deputy head of research at the sustainable solutions project at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (Pik). \"This is a story of success, though some challenges are still ahead.\" According to figures released by the government agency Germany Trade and Invest, 38% of the electricity produced by renewable energy during that period was through wind power, and almost 16% from solar. The push for renewables has come largely through in Germany's highly regarded and much-copied Renewable Energy Act (EEG), which subsidises producers who invest in wind and solar energies through feed-in tariffs. The cost of subsidy has triggered a heated debate in Germany, because subsidies have been covered by higher energy prices for households. \"If the prices keep increasing, this might undermine the acceptance of the Energiewende [energy transformation],\" said Knopf. This transformation follows the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan in 2011, which prompted Berlin to move forward plans to phase out nuclear energy use in Germany from 2036 to 2022. Eight of 17 power plants were closed last year as part of the Energiewende process. But as well as increasing Germany's reliance on renewables, it also increased German dependence on coal-fired plants, a major source of CO2. While experts said there are no plans for new coal-fired plants, those already under construction will be finished. \"If you have new plants now, they will run for 40 or 50 years and then you will have a problem with emissions in the future,\" said Jan Burck, of environmental group Germanwatch. Germany aims to reduce its carbon emissions by 40% of 1990 levels by 2020 and 80%-95% by 2050 – a target Burck said would be tough. And even though the strategy has brought about a 26.5% reduction up to 2011, according to the UBA figures, there are other problems. Europe's emissions trading scheme (ETS) has less ambitious reduction targets, which means EU companies involved do not need to work towards German goals. As a result, environmentalists are pushing for tougher Europe-wide regulations to bring all of the states into line. But despite the problems, Germany remains committed to its green agenda, driven, some say, by the need to correct the world's wrongs – a sentiment that goes back to the second world war and the postwar generation who challenged their parents afterwards for just standing by. \"That has led to a very strong environmental and anti-nuclear movement,\" says Green party MP Hermann Ott. \"It ultimately led to the foundation of the Green party and made us very strong.

The journey into the heart of the world's worst nuclear crisis since Chernobyl 26 years ago begins much earlier, in the towns and villages that exist in name only, their residents having been sent fleeing a year ago. Homes and shops lie empty, the roads are deserted. In the town of Naraha, groceries sit untouched on the shelves of a convenience store; a handful of cars punctuate a supermarket carpark, abandoned by their owners amid the panic that followed the first explosion at one of the Fukushima Daiichi plant's reactor buildings. Most of the buildings that lie just inside the 12-mile (20km) nuclear evacuation zone – even the grand wooden homes – withstood the violent seismic shifts unleashed by a magnitude-9.0 earthquake on the afternoon of 11 March. But, as the Guardian witnessed on a rare trip to the nuclear plant, the destruction is more insidious than collapsed roofs and ruptured tarmac, but no less shocking. Almost everywhere, beeping monitors alert visitors to the invisible foe that has befouled entire communities: radiation. Further into the evacuation zone, near a disused public relations office belonging to the plant's owner, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), radiation levels rise to 2 microsieverts/hour (the normal background level is 0.2-0.3). The readings soar to 35 microsieverts/hour in Okuma, a town near the plant's perimeter, where residents have been told their former homes could remain uninhabitable for decades. Fukushima Daiichi covers a huge swath of land stretching from its hilltop entrance down to the coast, where its six reactors were easy targets for the 14-metre tsunami that roared ashore soon after the quake. From a vantage point to the south of the site it is easy to see the mangled innards of reactor buildings No 3 and 4 and, behind them, the vinyl shroud covering the No 1 reactor – the first unit to suffer a hydrogen explosion last March. There are few signs of the 3,000 workers on site – a small portion of the many thousands of contractors and subcontractors who have joined the mission to save the plant from an even greater catastrophe. Pockets of workers in protective suits huddle around coiled pipes and hoses used to feed and recycle coolant to the damaged reactors. In the distance are rows of tanks containing tens of thousands of tonnes of radioactive water drawn from the reactors' flooded basements. While temperatures inside the reactors have stayed below the required boiling point, radiation is still too high for workers to enter some areas. The utility's contamination map shows radiation inside reactor No 3 as high as 1,500 microsieverts/hour. The world is in awe of the speed with which Japan has cleared tsunami rubble from other stretches of its north-east coast. But along the Fukushima Daiichi waterfront, the removal of debris deposited by the waves never really began. The seawall, which failed to hold back the ocean on 11 March, is no more. Instead, piles of mesh sacks filled with rocks are all that separate the water from the exposed bowels of the reactors' turbine buildings, now a mass of twisted metal, shutters and ladders, where upended trucks sit in ditches filled with wreckage. Work in this area of the plant is all but impossible. \"Most of the workers here perform a two-hour shift in the morning and again in the afternoon,\" says Katsuhiko Iwaki, deputy manager of the Fukushima Daiichi stabilisation centre. \"But there are areas where the dosages are so high they can only stay for two or three minutes … just enough time to connect a hose before their alarms signal it's time to leave.\" Elsewhere, almost every spare patch of ground is covered in pipes and hoses, and sheets of wood and steel. Avert your gaze from the gaping holes in the reactor walls and you could have stumbled upon an unwieldy building site. Only the mission here is not to rebuild, but to dismantle. The success of the operation to remove melted nuclear fuel from the reactors – a process that will not start for 10 years – will depend on the hundreds of Tepco staff hunkered over computer screens in the plant's emergency control room. Voices rarely rise above a murmur as experts analyse data, while two large screens on a wall link the room, where the air is filtered, to the situation outside and Tepco's headquarters in Tokyo. Takeshi Takahashi took over as plant manager in December after his predecessor was diagnosed with cancer (which is unrelated to the disaster). \"We need to avoid major releases of radioactive materials of the kind we saw after the accident,\" he says. \"We achieved cold shutdown in December, but we must ensure we keep making improvements because we still can't say for sure the facilities on site are totally trouble-free.\" He refused to speculate on who was to blame for the accident before the government had completed its investigation, but he accepted criticism of his employer's transparency in the early days of the crisis. \"We often hear we didn't communicate properly, and I apologise for that,\" he says. \"It was never our intention to suppress information, but there was a chaotic time after the accident when we tended to neglect efficient communication.\" Tepco appears to have adjusted its post-disaster mantra, at least in public. Last year its priority was to stabilise the reactors and prove the plant's destiny was back in the hands of its operator. The utility has since shifted its focus to the tens of thousands of relocated residents. \"I would like to apologise for the trouble we have caused local people,\" Takahashi says, unprompted. \"We're doing our best to make it possible for evacuees to return home as soon as possible, but we have to put their safety first.\" But no one can say when, or if, the stirrings of civic life will be seen in the deserted communities around Fukushima Daiichi. And amid the opprobrium directed at Tepco's corporate culture, it is easy to forget the victims include men, and a small number of women, who are witnessing the recovery effort from the inside. Saori Kanesaki, who once guided visitors around Fukushima Daiichi, is one of 16,000 residents of Tomioka who were driven from their homes last March. \"Before the accident it was my job to tell visitors that nuclear power was safe,\" says Kanesaki, who now works at the plant for a Tepco affiliate. \"But given the situation, if I were to tell them that now … I would be lying.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2013/jan/30/the-mary-berry-story","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2013-01-30T07:01:00Z","webTitle":"The Mary Berry Story; Jonathan Meades: The Joy of Essex – TV review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/jan/30/the-mary-berry-story","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2013/jan/30/the-mary-berry-story","fields":{"headline":"The Mary Berry Story; Jonathan Meades: The Joy of Essex – TV review","bodyText":"'You do know about her son,\" said my girlfriend, looking over my shoulder. I didn't. She told me. Mary Berry's youngest son, William, was tragically killed in a car crash when he was just 19. Suddenly my half-written review of The Mary Berry Story (BBC2) looked petty and mean. I was doing it in the style of a pitch to the BBC, suggesting a two-part documentary – working title The Sam Wollaston Story – about my life. I would return to the house I lived in as a kid, show the world where I played – and sometimes fought – with my brother and sister. I'd revisit my old school and do the story of how I once got really bad measles. There would be some early work stuff: (not) selling advertising space for Business North East Magazine, hop-picking, a brief career as a maintenance man (the famous journalism would come in part two). And I could drop in the odd recipe, things my mum used to make, or some of my own early triumphs, like chocolate Angel's Delight with a Cadbury's Flake crumbled over the top. Actually, I'm not sure about recipes, given that food's not really my thing. Maybe the idea needed some fine-tuning. Now of course I wasn't really comparing myself – a snivelling worm of a television critic – to Mary Berry, star of television and Queen of the Victoria Sponge. I was simply questioning whether someone best known for being a judge on a talent show really merits a two-part prime-time BBC life story. And that doubt stands, even knowing about her tragedy. It's not even an especially interesting life story, not in this first part anyhow. Mary's childhood was reasonably happy, it seems. She lived in a nice big house. People came and went. Dad was strict, as dads were, back in the day. Mary wasn't brilliant at school but she was good at other things. There were ponies and picnics and puddings. Though to be honest I think I'd prefer my pimped Angel's Delight to Mary's mother's bread and margarine pud, but then I'm not very classy. OK, there was a war, but there was for everyone of her age. They had to grow their own veg, dig for victory, and preserve the eggs in something called isinglass, which is made from the swim bladders of fish (mmmm). The school was hit by a bomb, but it didn't get the headmistress Miss Blackburn, worst luck. Oh, and Mary got polio. Yeah, so that knocks the spots off my measles; The Sam Wollaston Story must never, ever see the light of day. But I'm not sure this one should have either. Two hours of it, too! It's Bake Off bonkersness gone mad. And in part two Mary will speak so movingly about the loss of a child that I'll be shown not only to be mean-spirited, but also just plain wrong. It won't be the first time. Jonathan Meades: The Joy of Essex (BBC4) was much more interesting. Meades takes us beyond the familiar fuchsia pink stretch limos, the 4x4s, the fibreglass roman columns and silicone breasts. Beyond Amy Childs country. The only way may be Essex, but Towie Essex is not the only Essex. Meades shows us a different sort of county, a place of philanthropic model villages, temperance islands and rehab villages, social experiments, failed utopias, good intentions and bad architecture, and good architecture. He stands, in black and permanent dark glasses (is he laughing behind there, at us, at everything, or does he simply think he's in The Velvet Underground?) in front of beautiful Essex-scapes – ancient chapels, nuclear power stations, Roman castles, modernist factories, muddy marshes and massive skies. And he delivers his sardonic monologue, a deadpan treat in an age of overenthusiastic and wildly gesticulating television presenting. It might sound wearisome, but it's packed full of challenging ideas, withering judgments, ideas, words (many of which end in –ism and –ity). He tosses in lovely lines (\"middle England's favourite window maker got defenestrated\") nonchalantly. Oh, and I love the voice of the local radio DJ, who has more than a bit of Danny Baker about him, coming from the radio of Meades's Toyota Prius as he drives around. The whole thing is brilliant to listen to, as well as to look at. One tiny thing, Jonathan: they're probably not hawsers clanking on the masts at Burnham-on-Crouch. Much more likely to be halyards I think. I could be wrong. Again. • Tonight's TV highlights • Full TV listings • This article was amended on 30 January 2013.

Wilshere netted two good goals, Mandanda made a decent save from a slovenly Ozil penalty and now Arsenal only need to draw in Napoli to avoid all head-scratching and make sure of their progress. 90 min: Sagna plays Walcott through ... and the would-be striker pokes softly wide from 20 yards. 87 min: Super cross by Walcott, followed by a wild shot by Cazorla, who got all over-excited and blemmed it high and wide from 12 yards. 85 min: OM are finishing with gusto, finally making Arsenal work. Sagna makes an important intervention to end two mintues of OM probing and put Arsenal back on to the front foot. 82 min: Apparently Joey Barton isn't impressed with the atmosphere at the Emirates tonight. Well sing up then, Joseph! 80 min: Substitutions: Ozil off, Arteta on. Lemina off, Cheyrou on. \"How many directions will we go regarding Joey Barton's cameo in the stands?\" wonders Mike Wilner. \"Well, I'd like to start with his Twitter handle: @Joey7Barton. Is he trying to equate himself with, say, CR7? Keep plugging away, lad...\" Then he should have gone with JB7. Or, even better, JB007. Licence to, if not quite kill, then at least tackle hard. 77 min: OM have discovered their pride and, with Valbuena and Thauvin, they now have real quality too. Szczesny has just had to produce an excellent save to thwart Thauvin again, diving full-length to his left to keep out the youngster's rasping low half-volley. Arsenal substitutions: Wilshere and Rosicky off; Walcott and Cazorla on. 74 min: Good save by Szczesny to deny Thauvin. 72 min: Look who's among the OM fans at the Emirates ... 71 min: A marseille attack! An actual Marseille attack! They moved forward with speed and numbers (yes, really!) before Morel flighted a fair cross in from the left and Gignac rose to nod it over from 10 yards. 68 min: Ramsey has hurt his ribs in a challenge from Valbuena. It doesn't look serious but there's no sense keeping him on. I can't see the sidelines but I imagine Cazorla or Arteta has been sent to warm up. Might as well tell Bendtner to go for a jog too, just for the hell of it. Nice move, nice finish, game over. Ramsey bisected the defence expertly and Ozil then rolled an inviting pass to Wilshere, who slammed into the net from 14 yards. 63 min: Decent cross by Monreal, which prompts Giroud to attempt some kind of circus seal routine: the Frenchman tries to balance the ball on the tip of his nose and then flip it up and let it roll down his back. All very impressive, but Mandanda saunters out to pick the ball up when it drops to the grass. 62 min: Thauvin makes an impressive introduction, skipping past two players ... before losing out to Koscielny. Still, the hint of a threat from OM makes this more interesting ... 60 min: Arsenal beginning to find a bit of urgency; but OM are raising their game slightly too, and Morel makes a diligent block on Rosicky. OM changes: This should pep up the visitors: Valbuena and Thauvin on; J Ayew and Imbula off. 57 min: Ozil plays Wilshere in with a beautiful pass but Mandanda makes a fine save to stop the midfielder from bagging a brace. And thealbuena and Thauvin on; J Ayew and Imbula off. 55 min: A snapshot from Giroud from the edge of the area takes a deflection and misses the post by inches. 54 min: That's better from Sagna, who gives a nice return pass to Ramsey. But Morel, who has generally had a stinker tonight, showed admirable determination to get back and dispossess the Welshman. 52 min: Groans from the Arsenal fans! That's what the familiar sight of Sagna shanking a cross into the stands will do. 51 min: Chants from the Arsenal fans! 49 min: Rosicky, who has sparkled more than anyone tonight, spins and probes and then lays the ball off to Ramsey, who produces another of his dinky scoop passes to put Giroud through on goal. But the ref whistles for offside, wrongly. 47 min: If any of you have ever stood in the rain at Dublin's Howth Junction train station on a frigid rainy night in January, you'll have some idea of how bleak this game is. 46 min: OM have mustered the energy to come back out for the second half. Arsenal trudge out, too. And off we go. Please give us some garnish for this gruel. We can't dress this one up: it's been very boring. Arsenal scored early and ambled their way through the remainder of the half against a Marseille team that look like they're turned up merely to fulfil contractual obligations. Arsenal have been negligent in not scoring again - Ozil's soft penalty exemplifying their lack of oomph - and if OM somehow equalise the home side will have only themselves to blame. 43 min: Ramsey feeds Wilshere, who tries to replicate his first-minute goal but, this time, curls his shot high and wide. 42 min: As if miffed by their penalty miss, Arsenal have increased the intensity a tad. They're applying proper pressure now as opposed to just monopolising possession. 40 min: Ramsey takes the freekick instead ... and slams a low one straight into the wall. 39 min: Moreil, who has been all over the shop so far, is booked for bringing down Giroud just outside the area. Freekick to Arsenal. A chance for Ozil to atone? 38 min: Mandanda saves Ozil's lazy penalty! Such a lethargic shot from the German, who made it obivous where he was going to shoot and then dabbed it there. Mandanda plunged to his right to turn the ball away. 37 min: PENALTY to Arsenal, as Ramsey flips the ball over N'Koulou's head and then goes down as he chases after it. The contact was outside the box but the ref awards the penalty ... 33 min: Arsenal's passing has become ropey, OM's feebleness seemingly lending a debilitating drowsiness to the game. Quality and interest are declining. Hard to believe the stakes are so high. The onus is on Arsenal to raise the level and secure the win. It only takes one goof to let even a side as pitiful as this OM outfit back into the game. 31 min: Ozil curls a 40-yard freekick into the area. Mendes drags Giroud to the ground but none of the officials spot it and the ball bounces harmlessly over the bar. 29 min: Imbula tries to run the ball out of his own defensive area but is dispossessed by Wilshere, but the ball runs out of play. Are we there yet? 28 min: If Elie Baup can be bothered, he can spice this up by sending on Thauvin and Valbuena in the second half. So Arsenal could do with raising the tempo here and killing OM off while the visitors are still sleep-walking. 27 min: Koscielny strides out from the back and Arsenal slowly work the ball wide to Rosciky on the lefte. The Czech injects a bit of pace into proceedings by darting forward ... and sending a piddling shot 15 yards wide. Are we there yet? 26 min: Are we there yet? 25 min: Are we there yet? 24 min: Rosicky interrupts the tedium by aiming a lovely curled pass towards Wilshere, but OM scramble to clear the danger. 21 min: Shoddiness in the back rearguard allows Gignac in but Szceszny surges off his line to poucne at the striker's feet and snaffle the ball. 20 min: The Marseille fans are signing. The Arsenal fans are sleeping. The Marseille players have nodded off again, too, and Arsenal almost capitalise, Wilshere crossing from the right but N'Koulou wakes up in time to nick the ball away from Giroud. 18 min: A dinky looped pass by Ramsey into the path of Ozil, who merely has to trap the ball and shoot from 15 yards ... but, for once, the German's control betrays him and the ball runs out of play. 17 min: Marseille summon a bit of gumption, inspired by a bold run by Imbula. Jordan Ayew eventually delivered a cross from the right and Gignac leapt well to meet it, but his header from 15 yards floated high over the bar. 15 min: Arsenal contineu to tap the ball about. They really should get at least a second goal before they completely knock off for the night because, unlikely though it looks, OM may rouse themselves from their meekness at some point. 12 min: As Arsenal put the kettle on, Dortmund take a 1-0 lead against Napoli in the group's other game. The prospect of all teams finishing level on points remains alive. 10 min: At this point we have to ask why Marseille bothered to turn up? Arsenal are not having to do anything special to be royally dominant. They're playing at a gentle pace but OM just can't get close to them or the ball. I know it's a makeshift team but for a Champions League match, this is pathetic. 7 min: Arsenal nearly double their lead thanks to a flowing move and more naive Marseille defending. Giroud slipped the ball into Wilshere, who surged behind the defence and sent a low cross to Ramsey, whose shot from 10 yards was blocked by Mandanda. Marseille defenders just didn't have a clue where any of the Arsenal players were. This could be a proper tonking. 5 min: After prolonged Arsenal probing, Ramsey shuffles at the edge of the area to create room for a shot but then miscues, sending a trickler way wide. 3 min: Arsenal are just stroking the ball around at their leisure now, with OM sitting deep and looking utterly overawed. Only complacency can prevent Arsenal easing their way to victory from here. I may have to revise that 3-0 prediction upwards. That was ridiculously easy. Within seconds of kick-off Wilshere received the ball wide on the right, then ambled forward with no objection from the visitors until he got to the edge of the area, whereupon he sidestepped a defender and curled the ball into the far corner. The teams are in the tunnel, Marseille clad all in turquoise in obvious tribute to David Icke, and Arsenal in the kit made famous by Rotherham United. An ominous start to proceedings for the home side here: news has filtered through to the Emirates that AC Milan, who are playing Celtic, have become the third side in Champions League history to name a starting line-up not containing any numbers 1 to 11, thereby making Arsenal slightly less special, as Arsene Wenger's team were the last to do it (in December 2009, following a precedent set by Valencia in 2006, since you ask). We know Arsenal tend to be mentally brittle so the question facing Wenger at the moment is: should he break this news to his players now or wait until after the match? A pickle, to be sure. In 1982 a Finnish songster called Kojo sang about the construction of a nuclear power station while smacking himself in the head. In 1978 a Norwegian named Jahn Teigen belted out a track called Mile after Mile while performing mid-air splits but had to abandon after snapping his braces. And in 2003 the Scouse brother-and-sister duo Jemini went to Latvia to make unspecified sounds while music was played in the background. All of the above returned from European competition with nul points. Which is the fate that now faces Olympique de Marseille. Since OM are already eliminated from the Champions League and have no realistic chance of making the Europa League, the only possible barrier between Arsenal and three crucial points is the French team's determination to avoid Jemini-esque ignominy. It is a powerful incentive. But most probably not powerful enough, particularly as OM's main priority is clambering back into the top three in Ligue 1, which is why they have not even fielded their best team tonight, resting, amongst others, the brilliant tricksters Mathieu Valbuena and Florian Thauvin. In come several promising youngsters, notably the midfielder Mario Lemina, who was signed from Lorient in the summer after helping France win the U-20 World Cup and makes his OM debut tonight. Gianelli Imbula is another one to watch - the 21-year-old midfielder has immense potential. But Arsenal should be far too strong and savvy for this side and a routine 3-0 victory definitely awaits. You can quote me on that afterwards. But if you plan to do that, you'd best print this page out now because I'll be deleting all trace of the prediction if I'm wrong. You can quote me on that. But if you plan to ... etc,. and so on. Arsenal: Szczesny; Sagna, Mertesacker, Koscielny, Monreal; Flamini, Ramsey; Rosicky, Ozil, Wilshere; Giroud.

Fining utility and transport companies hurts only one group: their customers, for whom prices will rise further in order to meet the cost of paying fines. What is appropriate in such cases is penalties that will really hurt those responsible – jail terms for fraud, disqualification and personal fines against directors, and orders from the court to suspend all dividend payments for a period of, say, three years and for any resulting cash balances, protected from accounting trickery, to be repaid to consumers in the form of rebates. However, the endemic consumer-milking culture of the privatised energy, utility and transport companies – reports over the weekend highlighted the scandal that is our water industry – could be ended through renationalisation by a bold enough government. Does any political party have the bottle? Nigel Beatty Hurstpierpoint, West Sussex • Your report correctly described how price opacity in gas-trading markets sets a context in which price manipulation can occur (FSA examines whistleblower's claims, 13 November). Moreover, the government is about to introduce an energy bill implementing electricity market reform which will make the precise amount of subsidies paid to nuclear and renewable energy sources very difficult to calculate, and hand over more control of the renewables market to the major electricity players. In the process this reform will effectively prevent independent developers from setting up renewable energy projects. Independent analysts have already warned that the complex and highly opaque system of \"contracts for differences feed-in tariffs\", that is proposed by the government, will create favourable conditions for major electricity companies to make money out of the complexity. Currently we have a relatively transparent method of calculating how much extra is paid for renewable energy, but this will disappear as the funding for \"low carbon\" energy sources is pooled together. What a coincidence it is that we will find it difficult to calculate exactly how much extra (on top of market rates) is paid for nuclear power. Proposals for a much simpler and cheaper \"fixed feed-in tariff\" (used in Germany) have been sidelined.

Can we please recognise the negative effect this is going to have on the haulage industry and the potential loss of jobs. Given the amount of fuel consumed on a daily basis, even a small hike in price means our costs increase significantly. We can't always pass on these costs to customers, so we take the hit in an industry which has seen 50% of its market wiped out since 2008.

TV networks will release forecasts of the result after polling stations close at 8pm local time (11am GMT) on Sunday. Opinion polls taken in the runup to the election indicated that the Liberal Democratic party (LDP) would secure a majority in the 480-seat lower house. Turnout was sluggish at just over 27% by mid-afternoon, down 7.8 percentage points from 2009, according to government data. If the forecasts are correct, the LDP leader, Shinzo Abe, will become Japan's seventh prime minister in just over six years. An 11th-hour plea to voters by the prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, to turn their backs on the LDP's \"old-style politics\" was unlikely to save his Democratic party of Japan (DPJ) from a crushing defeat. Some polls suggest the LDP, along with its traditional ally, New Komeito, could even secure two-thirds of seats in the lower house – giving it the \"supermajority\" it needs to overcome a policy deadlock that has blighted successive governments since 2007. The LDP, which governed for all but 11 months between 1955 and 2009, has capitalised on popular anger over the DPJ government's failure to deliver on a promise to replace pork-barrel politics with a new focus on families, welfare and healthcare. Many voters feel the DPJ has dawdled over the reconstruction of the region devastated by last year's earthquake and tsunami. And they associate Noda with an unpopular plan to double the consumption (sales) tax to 10%, a measure that passed only with the support of Abe's party. But there was little enthusiasm outside polling stations for the LDP and Abe, the grandson of a former prime minister who holds revisionist views on Japan's wartime conduct and supports a more active overseas role for Japan's armed forces. Instead, uncertainty over the economy and Japan's response to the rise of China appears to have sent voters reaching for the familiar – big spending on public works to boost growth, and close security ties with the US to counter the perceived threat from China. \"The Democrats are out because they have been unable to implement their policy manifesto and are divided internally. But that doesn't mean I support the LDP,\" said Yosuke Matsumoto, a 33-year-old voter. \"Nothing will change under them.\" Koichi Nakano, a political science professor at Sophia University, said the election was about \"punishing\" the DPJ, which won by a landslide in 2009. \"It seems to me that people are driven by nostalgia, as they seem to want to bring the LDP back to power because they lack better alternatives,\" he told Reuters. Voters, many of whom said they were undecided going into Sunday's election, have no fewer than 12 parties to choose from. Most are unlikely to have an impact on the outcome, but one possible exception is the Japan Restoration party, a far-right group led by the outspoken former governor of Tokyo, Shintaro Ishihara. His party has placed second in some polls and could force Abe into coalition talks in the event of a hung parliament. Abe, 58, whose first stint as prime minister ended in 2007 amid scandal and ill health, has pledged to take a tougher stance on the Senkaku territorial row with Beijing, and to abandon plans to phase out nuclear power by 2040 – a measure the DPJ introduced in response to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident. Of the 480 seats in Japan's lower house, 300 are elected from single-seat districts and the remaining 180 through proportional representation in 11 regional blocks."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2013/apr/25/lydd-airport-expansion-takeoff","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2013-04-25T18:20:22Z","webTitle":"Lydd airport awaiting clearance for expansion takeoff","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/25/lydd-airport-expansion-takeoff","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/apr/25/lydd-airport-expansion-takeoff","fields":{"headline":"Lydd airport awaiting clearance for expansion takeoff","bodyText":"If only all airports could be this peaceful. Beside the soon-to-be-expanded runway of Lydd's optimistically named London Ashford airport the clearest sound is birdsong. Sheep graze by the car park in front of the terminal building. In a couple of hours on an April weekday, only one small craft troubles the control tower: a light plane from nearby Shoreham on a training flight. Gazing across the wildlife reserve to the nuclear power station on the Dungeness headland three miles away, an observer might not immediately see Lydd as an answer to British aviation's big question: if, how, and where the south-east of England will develop the airport capacity that the industry and its allies in business and politics say the UK desperately needs. But Lydd's management believes it can be a part of the solution – and that the government's decision to let it expand should be seen in the context of the wider debate. The location has echoes of the Thames estuary airport plan espoused by the London mayor, Boris Johnson – both remote, peaceful corners of Kent, where birds thrive but a number of people struggle for work. Both are close enough to the high-speed rail line for hopeful talk of quick connections to the capital from those who see tranquil backwaters ripe for economic regeneration. But while architects and politicians project megahubs on Medway, Lydd would take a year to match the traffic of a few days at Heathrow. The ambition here, once the runway extension that will allow fully loaded holiday jets to take off is completed after 2016, is to be a new Southend. That is, London Southend, another revived airfield harking back to a black-and-white heyday. Lydd was a jetsetters' choice when film stars would Channel-hop by driving on to a Bristol Freighter plane: photos outside the terminal's Biggles Bar show Diana Dors beside an open-topped car and a surprisingly dapper Duke of Edinburgh, even for 58 years ago. Approval has been given for up to 500,000 passengers a year; executive manager Hani Mutlaq doesn't want to stoke local antagonism by discussing plans beyond that. But the airport owns land giving scope to expand further. An adjacent railway track that carries nuclear waste from Dungeness could, he says, one day link passengers to Ashford's high-speed train – a 37-minute journey to London, albeit with single fares even higher than the notoriously expensive Heathrow Express. Drawing in the likes of easyJet, as Southend has, would be a coup, but the clearest plan is to expand the executive jet service. Right now, even the Saudi who owns Lydd – Sheikh Fahad Al-Athel, of the Al-Yamamah arms deal fame – can't land his private jet, flying in from Jeddah via Luton instead. With only a trickle of commercial passengers, the airport loses around £1.5m a year. But Mutlaq, an engaging Jordanian who landed in New Romney to propel, in various roles, his boss's nine-year-long expansion bid, thinks there is a brighter future: \"Heathrow's out of capacity, Gatwick is running out, Stansted will too. At a certain point, Heathrow and Gatwick will say, guys, I need an [Airbus] A380 or a [Boeing] 747 in that slot – and start kicking people out.\" Those giant A380s are steadily coming in: three of British Airways' dozen on order – the first to be based at Heathrow – will be operational this summer. Bigger planes will indeed play a part in the hub airport's bottom line, to squeeze more passengers into the finite number of slots. Ninety pilots are being trained to fly the A380 in a £10m simulator beside BA's Grade II-listed Heathrow hangars – recently modified to allow the giant aircraft's tailfin through the doors. BA's Richard Frewer, who helped design the simulator, performs a virtual takeoff and landing at LA and Hong Kong; conversation is easy over the engines. The noise level is true to life, he says, and very different from other planes, where headphones are needed in the cockpit.. \"Once you've pulled the flaps and the landing gear in, it's very quiet. Disturbingly so.\" That quiet engine may prove as important for capacity as the hundreds of extra seats. Last week Hounslow council launched a public consultation to ensure its residents' experience under the flightpath is heard loud and clear by the Davies commission, which will shape London's airport development. Waiting for the roar of an incoming plane to clear the infants' school where he was speaking, deputy council leader Colin Ellar said: \"That noise you hear now I suffer every day, and it wakes me up at 4.30am.\" Hounslow is relatively supportive of Heathrow, the borough's chief employer: neighbouring Richmond's forthcoming referendum is expected to starkly reject any possible expansion. Even if many Tory MPs now rue the coalition's decision to scrap Heathrow's third runway – and the transport ministers squarely opposed to Heathrow expansion, Justine Greening and Theresa Villiers, have been shuffled on – the politics of bringing more planes over London remain toxic. The aviation policy framework published in March reiterated the idea of growth elsewhere to take pressure off London's main airports. Lydd's management points to its planning sign-off coming in the wake of that statement and George Osborne's budget talking up infrastructure: its £25m investment could mean jobs in a region where employers such as Pfizer have shut down. But opponents question how many jobs will come. Louise Barton, a former City analyst now leading the Lydd Airport Action Group, says the lack of demand makes the business plan nonsensical: \"Commercially, it's a complete joke.\" Campaigners believe the proximity of Dungeness B nuclear plant is a serious safety issue; others fear for the fragile protected habitat. Barton cheerfully admits to being \"the biggest nimby\" but says the area has plenty of airport options, from Gatwick to nearby Manston, another minor Kent airport that now connects to Schiphol's KLM network. And while she believes Lydd's expansion isn't currently viable, she says a long view is needed. \"Airports lead to urbanisation: you'd have new roads, housing and industrial estates if it ever takes off. You can't stop the economic imperative of an airport.\" That argument, if slightly rephrased, is one that backers of airports from Heathrow right through to Lydd would not dispute, but aggressively promote: that aviation is a driver of economic growth. The argument Britain will need to resolve is if the noise and pollution is a price worth paying – and who will pay it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/feb/13/nuclear-police-forces-merger-warning","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-02-13T13:54:30Z","webTitle":"Warnings over proposed merger of UK's nuclear police forces","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/feb/13/nuclear-police-forces-merger-warning","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/feb/13/nuclear-police-forces-merger-warning","fields":{"headline":"Warnings over proposed merger of UK's nuclear police forces","bodyText":"A government proposal to merge the UK's two nuclear police forces would be costly, messy and could create a conflict of interest between protecting British weapons and foreign-owned power stations, the Defence Police Federation has warned. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) and the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) have launched a \"scoping study\" into whether to amalgamate the MoD police, which looks after nuclear bomb bases and other military sites, and the Civil Nuclear Constabulary (CNC), which has responsibility for nuclear power plants. Both forces differ from the normal police in that they usually carry guns. But the idea has already run into fierce criticism from the staff association that represents the MoD police rank and file. And other critics have raised fears about the abuse of a merged force for political purposes. A merger would be \"an extremely expensive exercise that would be unlikely to generate any savings in the short or medium term, and would distract from more realistic ways of reducing the MoD's budget deficit,\" said Eamon Keating, national chairman of the Defence Police Federation. He pointed out that the MoD police had a much wider role than the CNC, including the ability to carry out investigations, the maintenance of public order and marine activities. \"This divergence in roles, training and responsibilities would make any kind of amalgamation rather messy,\" he told the Guardian. Because the CNC was responsible for power stations run by the French company, EDF Energy, there \"could be a conflict of interest with our responsibility to the MoD estate and the nuclear deterrent,\" Keating argued. \"A merger of our two organisations would be poorly timed, given that the amalgamation of the eight Scottish constabularies is already going ahead and there are lessons to be learned from that process.\" The MoD police has nearly 3,500 officers based at 86 defence sites across the UK, including the bomb bases at Aldermaston in Berkshire and on the Clyde near Glasgow. In December the Guardian reported that it was facing up to 1,500 job cuts. The CNC is a smaller force, with just under 1,000 officers at 17 civil nuclear sites, including Sellafield in Cumbria and EDF's eight nuclear power stations. Peter Burt, project director of the Nuclear Information Service, which monitors the nuclear weapons industry, is concerned that a merger would create a national private police force under the political control of a minister. He said: \"The conviction of senior EDF company executives in France for spying on Greenpeace and the Mark Kennedy case in this country, where an undercover police officer spied on climate campaigners, shows how power could easily be abused for political purposes under the new arrangements.\" The Civil Nuclear Police Federation has also complained about being left out of early consultations. \"Following discussion with Decc, the federation has been promised proper engagement on any possible merger,\" said the federation's general secretary, Nigel Dennis. The MoD did not respond to questions about the proposed merger, referring inquiries to Decc, which pointed out that the two police forces were already working towards closer collaboration. \"Any potential conflicts of interest will be given due consideration as part of the scoping study, which is now ongoing and is intended to identify whether a merger would bring net benefits,\" said a Decc spokesman."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/damian-carrington-blog/2013/apr/25/hendry-energy-nuclear-shale-gas","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-04-25T10:30:00Z","webTitle":"Harnessing volcanoes: Charles Hendry talks nuclear, fracking and more","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2013/apr/25/hendry-energy-nuclear-shale-gas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2013/apr/25/hendry-energy-nuclear-shale-gas","fields":{"headline":"Harnessing volcanoes: Charles Hendry talks nuclear, fracking and more","bodyText":"\"One concept is to harness a new volcano,\" says Charles Hendry, who has lost none of his enthusiasm for energy policy, despite losing his minister's post in last September's reshuffle. He is talking about plans to export Iceland's abundant geothermal energy to UK via a 1600km underwater cable. \"It taps into an affordable source of electricity, and the technology is not particularly complex,\" he says. \"I am advising some potential investors.\" Hendry, a Conservative MP, was in the energy hot seat for two-and-a-half years, which he wryly observes was \"two-and-half times more than most energy ministers in the last 14-15 years\". His successor John Hayes whipped up a storm over wind turbines but was blown out of the job in just seven months. Hendry also had the brief for five years in opposition and was widely acknowledged to have been a knowledgable and effective minister. So what, I wondered, does he make of the state of play today on the key issues such as the nuclear power stand-off with EDF and the hype behind shale gas. Along with Labour's Baroness Bryony Worthington, he is chairing a series of reports from Carbon Connect aiming to give a solid, fact-based foundation for the continuing debate. Cross-party co-operation is key, he says, or energy customers will see their already rising bills soar further as political uncertainty makes big energy investments more risky. \"A company told me in November that their cost of capital had gone up from 6% to 7%. That's a 15% increase, due to political risk,\" he says. \"If we need £100bn of investment for low carbon energy, that's an extra £1bn just in interest payments, for which consumers are going to have to pick up the tab.\" But he thinks that political risk is being lowered as clarity comes through and cites George Osborne's autumn statement as an example. That's ironic in my opinion as I think the chancellor has done more to create political risk and costs than anyone else. What would be a fair settlement in the battle between ministers and French-state-controlled EDF over the subsidy needed to get new nuclear reactors built at Hinkley Point in Somerset, I ask? \"The government wants a number that begins with an 8 – EDF want something that begins with a 9,\" he says, referring to the £80-£99 per megawatt hour price range believed to be under discussion. Hendry thinks a deal will be done: \"Both sides have too much to lose.\" One possibility in sealing a deal, he says, is that the government could take on EDF's future political risk. That would mean minister signing a legal contract that binds the government – meaning taxpayes - to compensate EDF for any future policy changes that leave the company out of pocket. \"We do it all the time in the North Sea,\" he says. But if the deal collapses, is there a feasible future for UK energy without nuclear? \"You can have energy security without new nuclear reactors, but it will be more expensive and more carbon intensive. There would undoubtedly be more gas in the system,\" he says. Another live wire in the energy debate is whether the government should commit to a virtually carbon-free electricity supply by 2030, a so-called decarbonisation target, as recommended by the government's official advisers, the Committee on Climate Change and the Energy and Climate Change (ECC) select committee of MPs. Tim Yeo, Hendry's fellow Tory MP and chair of the ECC committee, has already rebelled against the coalition and tabled an amendment that would set the 2030 target, so will Hendry do the same? \"I haven't decided yet,\" he says, which will not reassure the whips. He says is it crucial for supply chain companies that the low-carbon energy market does not die away after existing 2020 targets are met. On the other hand, \"as a minister, I railed against targets without roadmaps.\" We move on to shale gas and I ask, who is driving the amazing hype behind fracking, when every independent authority says it won't be a game-changer for the UK? \"There are clearly people who have invested a lot of money in it and who believe a big shale gas programme will deliver for them a good return,\" Hendry says. \"They really want to get on and drill holes. But we have to have the highest level of environmental protection and it takes some time to get that in place.\" When minister, Hendry had a spiky exchange of letters with Lord John Browne, chairman of leading fracking company Cuadrilla and the government's lead non-executive director, which I revealed through freedom of information requests. Cuadrilla had failed to inform Hendry that an earthquake caused by is operations had deformed the casing on its well and he questioned Cuadrilla's \"performance as a licensee\". Did Hendry think the issue has been satifactorily resolved? \"Cuadrilla is very aware of what it needs to do in terms of public and government acceptance,\" he says. \"If they haven't got the best practice they won't be going ahead.\" Next up is the recent failure of the European Parliament to reform its flagship climate policy, the emissions trading scheme, which is all but sunk by a vast oversupply of permits. \"It is a disaster for the credibility of the EU ETS. It shows there is no political will to make it an effective tool and that is very bad news,\" Hendry says. \"Nobody could have worked harder than [Europe's climate action commissioner] Connie Hedegaard. But she is up against some very powerful vested interests.\" He thinks that the UK's new floor price for carbon emissions – today six times higher than the EU price - is actually a benefit as it provides the certainty that industry asked for. \"I wouldn't be surprised if other countries emulated us,\" he says. Lastly, I ask him why he thinks he lost his ministerial post. He says a few days before the reshuffle he had gone through all the ministers of state and assessed their chances. \"I came up with a list of those I thought were vulnerable, people who were not very close to George, close to David [Cameron], close to Ian Duncan Smith.\" There were four people on the list – Hendry was one - and all four went, he says. \"I probably got on with doing the job in the department and didn't do the Westminster and Number 10 bit enough.\" But there's no point having regrets, Hendry says. He has already announced he will stand down as an MP in 2015. \"It means I can do important things like the Carbon Connect reports,\" he says. And get that cable to Iceland's volcanoes built."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/may/30/germany-to-shut-nuclear-reactors","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-05-30T18:18:16Z","webTitle":"Germany to shut all nuclear reactors","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/30/germany-to-shut-nuclear-reactors","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/may/30/germany-to-shut-nuclear-reactors","fields":{"headline":"Germany to shut all nuclear reactors","bodyText":"Angela Merkel has committed to shutting down all of the country's nuclear reactors by 2022, a task said by one minister to be as mammoth as the project to reunite East and West Germany in 1990. Monday's announcement, prompted by Japan's nuclear disaster, will make Germany the first major industrialised nation to go nuclear-free in decades. It gives the country just over 10 years to find alternative sources for 23% of its energy. The move, hammered out at a mammoth 14-hour overnight sitting at the Kanzleramt, came amid mass nationwide protests against nuclear power and at a low point for the chancellor's Christian Democratic party (CDU), support for which has crumbled at the ballot box in five regional elections this year. Although the proposal was welcomed among the general population, who have long been opposed to nuclear power, it was a move derided by one of Merkel's own MPs as \"knee-jerk politics\". The plan is to keep shut eight reactors which were suspended in March in the immediate aftermath of the Fukushima disaster, and to close the rest by 2022. The phase-out must be ratified in parliament and is likely to face strong opposition from utility companies. On Monday a spokesman for the energy giant RWE said that \"all legal options\" were on the table. Last week, grid operators warned the phase-out could result in winter blackouts – a prospect Merkel scoffed at . She insisted the decision would not lead to Germany simply importing nuclear power. \"We will generate our own electricity from other sources,\" the chancellor told a press conference in Berlin. She said the plans would give Germany a chance to be a \"trailblazer\" for renewable energy, suggesting it could eventually earn, rather than cost, the country money. Energy firms warned that the decision – a total policy reversal – would require significant investment in energy infrastructure. Philipp Rösler, new head of the FDP party, which rules in coalition with the CDU, agreed, likening the task ahead to that which faced Germany in 1990 after reunification. A study in 2009 showed that €1.3 trillion (£1.1tn) had been transferred from the West to rebuild the East. This comparison was also made in an editorial by the left-leaning Tageszeitung newspaper on Monday, which said Merkel's decision was \"historic\" and \"a moment like the fall of the Berlin Wall\". The government's vocabulary seemed to consciously echo the reunification process, with Merkel heralding an \"Energie-Wende\" – \"die Wende\" is the word for change which became shorthand for the fall of communism and reunification. Die Welt, a conservative daily, said the policy U-turn demonstrated a \"creeping rejection of the economic model which has transformed Germany into one of the richest countries in the world\". The French poured scorn on Germany's decision. \"Germany will be even more dependent on fossil fuels and imports and its electricity will be more expensive and polluting,\" said the French industry minister, Éric Besson. German households pay twice as much for power than homes in France, where 80% of electricity comes from atomic plants, he said. Germany last year was a net exporter of power to France, according to data from the French grid operator, RTE. This trend was reversed last month after the accident at Fukushima and Merkel's decision to halt Germany's oldest reactors. \"Germany's energy policy will only work if there are improvements at the same time,\" the EU energy commissioner, Günther Oettinger, said on Monday. He said there was a need for better grid infrastructure, storage capacity and forward planning as well as a more pronounced rise in renewable supply. Germany plans to cut electricity usage by 10% and double the share of renewable energy to 25% by 2020. Merkel first mooted an accelerated exit from nuclear power within days of the Fukushima meltdown, ordering a three-month \"moratorium\" during which nuclear power could be debated. It was a remarkable U-turn. In September 2010, she had committed to extending the lives of Germany's 17 nuclear plants. Many of her party are unhappy with her handling of the situation. \"Knee-jerk politics like the reaction to Fukushima does not pay dividends,\" said Mike Mohring, the head of the CDU faction in the Thuringian state parliament, last week. Among other G8 nations, only Italy has abandoned nuclear power. • This article was amended on 31 May 2011. The original said that the 14-hour overnight sitting was held at the Bundestag.

The truly shocking event was to learn that prime minister David Cameron has inhaled the hallucinogenic fumes of fracking hype and become intoxicated. Chancellor George Osborne's heady enthusiasm for the illusory attractions of shale gas in the UK were well known, but the hope remained that Cameron might yet make good on his promise to lead the greenest government ever. Not any more. On Tuesday, he told MPs: \"It may be that this gas revolution is really quite transformative and there is going to be a lot more gas and the price won't be as expensive. If we ignored it completely, you could be giving your economy much higher energy prices than is necessary.\" This is nothing more than the delusion of addiction. Like all addictions, our fossil fuel craving tempts us to ignore inconvenient truths that threaten our next fix. The simple reality for shale gas in Europe is that no serious, independent authority, from the International Energy Agency down, thinks fracking will provide enough gas to dent its price in Europe. As the government's own advisers set out today, over-reliance on gas exposes consumers to far higher hikes in bills. Those memorably dubbed frack-heads by Andrew Rawnsley tend to ignore climate change but the prime minister did not. Instead, he prescribed the equivalent of a drug user dealing with a wild high by swallowing a fistful of downers. If the gas revolution did come to pass, Cameron said, then capturing and burying the emissions would deal with climate change. Yet fitting that expensive technology in order to burn \"cheap\" gas is like happily getting addicted to heroin because you can check into rehab later. How has this hazy fracking mirage, constructed entirely on analogies with the US that evaporate into thin air as soon as you look at them, become so concrete in the minds of the two men leading our nation? The Guardian's energy editor, Terry Macalister, says: \"In 20 years, I've never come across such heavy lobbying than I have for shale gas. It's a pity renewables can't get that financial muscle.\" It is no surprise that those with most to lose from the UK kicking its fossil fuel habit are the dealers. Amidst this addled euphoria, energy secretary Davey's announcement on Thursday looked stone-cold sober. It is right to explore whether shale gas can safely compensate in some part for the UK's declining North Sea supplies, bolstering a little the nation's energy security as it uses gas in the transition to a clean and sustainable system. But it is also right to question how likely that it is. Michael Liebreich, CEO of Bloomberg New Energy Finance, calculates it would take 2,400 fracked wells to offset North Sea declines. Erecting onshore wind turbines will feel like a breeze by comparison. On safety, regulation could make shale gas extraction safe in theory, but only if it is adhered to. Cuadrilla has drilled a mere three wells so far but has already broken the terms of its planning permission. Davey's investigation of the earthquakes caused by Cuadrilla found \"weaknesses in its management of environmental risks\", now being addressed. The dash for gas started by Osborne and now blessed by Cameron is, like buying street drugs, a risky gamble that we do not need to take. The least-risk, least-cost route to an energy system fit for the 21st-century involves some gas but must focus on renewable energy, energy efficiency and, some think, nuclear power. But try selling that much safer-sounding fix to an addict."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/may/18/energy-climate-davey-fossil-fuel-nuclear","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-05-18T07:30:00Z","webTitle":"Ministers must resist the siren call of spin to prevent climate failure | Damian Carrington","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/may/18/energy-climate-davey-fossil-fuel-nuclear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/may/18/energy-climate-davey-fossil-fuel-nuclear","fields":{"headline":"Ministers must resist the siren call of spin to prevent climate failure","bodyText":"No one thinks it will be easy to slash the carbon emissions driving climate change while keeping the lights on and at an affordable price. But trying to tackle the challenge with policies that contradict each other and silly spin makes a tough job unnecessarily harder. Ed Davey, the energy and climate change secretary, launched a good report on Friday, suggesting the damage wrought on the UK's economy by spikes in global oil, gas and coal prices could be reduced by over half in 2050 as a result of climate change policies. \"Only last year, the impact of the Arab spring on wholesale gas prices, pushed up UK household bills by 20%,\" he said. \"Every step the UK takes towards building a low-carbon economy reduces our dependency on fossil fuels, and on volatile global energy prices.\" \"The more we can shift to alternative fuels, and use energy efficiently, the more we can ensure that our economy does not become hostage to far-flung events and to the volatility of market forces,\" he added. So far, so sensible. But what about the impact of far-flung events on the UK's faltering ambition to build new nuclear power stations? Well, that's a completely different story, apparently. Energy minister Charles Hendry was asked exactly that on Tuesday by MPs. Being exposed to events abroad, such as the nuclear disaster at Fukushima and the election of nuclear-power-sceptic François Hollande in France, was \"inevitable\", said Hendry. \"If we want to see nuclear power as part of the energy mix, that's a challenge we have to take on.\" The MPs on the energy and climate change (ECC) select committee revealed another contradiction on Thursday, when tackling the \"carbon reduction committment\", an incentive to increase energy efficiency that chancellor George Osborne turned into £1bn \"stealth tax\". A DECC official told MPs that just because something is cost-effective - like energy efficiency - does not mean people will do it. As Labour ECC member Barry Gardiner pointed out, this apathy is exactly the problem with the flagship Green deal, which aims to make 14m homes cheaper to heat. Cutting grants and instead relying on people to take out loans will lead to a 90% cut in loft insulations, according to the government's own impact assessment. Compounding contradictions with spin shifts perceptions from cock-up to conspiracy. Another DECC minister, Greg Barker tweeted on Thursday: \"Having listened carefully to industry, we are looking at scope for pushing back a little the next proposed reduction in the solar tariffs.\" Good news after a rocky time for the solar industry? Yes but only up to a point, according to solar industry campaigner Howard Johns: \"In reality, Barker had little choice but to announce a delay to the cuts hurriedly on Twitter - the legal deadline to implement them on 1 July expired on Monday.\" And there's more. Another member of the ECC, Conservative Laura Sandys, greeted a 750,000 drop in the number of fuel poor households published on Thursday with this tweet: \"First time numbers have dropped since 2005 - Gov measures starting to pay off!\" Except, as green campaigner Martyn Williams noted, the drop took place under the policies of the previous government. The new government, according to the Association for the Conservation of Energy, fuel poor households will receive 30% less government support under the Green Deal, while grants for home energy efficiency are being halved. And yet more. As noted again by Williams, Ed Davey told the house of commons on Thursday, that solar panel installations are at August 2011 levels, despite the subsidy having halved since that time. Williams's graph shows this is only true if you include the spike caused by policy changes in March. Since then, installations have crashed and are flatlining at a third of the August 2011 level. Overall, I agree with the verdict of Green party MP Caroline Lucas, on the wannabe \"greenest government ever\". \"It's more subtle than saying it's all been terrible, but it's more tragic, as well, because they have the bits of the jigsaw,\" she said recently. Joined up thinking and resisting the siren call of spin could prevent the tragedy becoming farce and deliver the dramatic change needed.

Early gigs by these German electronic pioneers routinely took place in art galleries, emphasising the band's conceptual distance from American rock music. In those days, their Düsseldorf recording studio, known as Kling Klang, was next to Gerhard Richter's art studio and they all used to have kickabouts with Joseph Beuys. Tonight, 40-odd years later, Kraftwerk find themselves in a gallery again, one that used to be a power station, which is what Kraftwerk means in German. If Ralf Hütter – the only remaining founder member – looks mildly amused throughout the first two evenings of this enthralling residency, that's because he is. Whenever Hütter looks up, an indoor hill of 1,000 people wearing 3D glasses greets him, and surround-sound speakers ping his music around the Turbine Hall (quite something, when Radio-Activity's frankly awesome Voice of Energy growls, like a malevolent ghost in the machine). It's hard to tell, but Hütter seems to be in charge of melodies and organ sounds, intoning words into a headset, his veneer of impassivity compromised when The Model – unbelievably, Kraftwerk's sole chart-topping hit – makes him jig his head slightly. At the end of Computer Love on Thursday night, there is even a smile. Although each night is devoted to a specific album, both Autobahn (Catalogue 1, Wednesday) and Radio-Activity (Catalogue 2, Thursday) open with Kraftwerk's theme tune, The Robots, and end with a slew of crowd-pleasers. The atmosphere is reverential – too reverential, even, given Kraftwerk inspired such a large fistful of loud and sweaty genres: electro, hip-hop, techno. By the time the chronology of their hits winds round to Computer Love, though, Kraftwerk are emitting pretty up-to-date digital chirps and whirrs and a brave few are dancing. To Hütter's right stand three more bodysuited-suited music-workers of various vintages, \"Mensch-Maschines\" operating identical neon-lit workstations and displaying variations on male pattern baldness. The tension between their manliness (those suits are very tight) and their machine-liness (efficient solemnity) is one of the things that make Kraftwerk – even this Kraftwerk 6.0 – such a hoot. They are as camp as they are conceptual, a retro-futurist nostalgia act who remain too wonderful to sneer at, even as they peddle revamps of their back catalogue, and rumours of new material drift perennially on the wind. All-too-human tribulations have long surrounded these flawed automatons. There have been multiple fallings out, even lawsuits to attempt to prevent the publication in 2000 of I Was a Robot, former member Wolfgang Flür's memoir. But their sly humour remains one of Kraftwerk's most enduring suits. You have to hope, at least, that Kraftwerk are in on the joke of their own graphics. As much a part of these gigs as the music, the 3D stuff flying at you is a hugely entertaining spectacle. A satellite attacks during Spacelab; notes and words tumble out into the audience. But all these visuals are hilariously basic, given the current sophistication of the medium, spurred by film and gaming. Funniest of all is Autobahn, in which a vintage VW pootles along, a badly drawn hand tuning its cartoon car radio, while an old-fashioned Mercedes threatens to overtake (and finally does). Humour is only one of Kraftwerk's functions, though. Awe is another. Radio-Activity, the title track of their 1975 album, began its life-and-a-half as a paean to technological progress. Over the years, however, it has been repurposed as a warning against nuclear folly. For the past couple of years, Kraftwerk have been playing a remix with lyrics in Japanese whose climax is the resounding word \"FUKUSHIMA\" glowing in black and white, at once chilling and compassionate. Their emotional clout is undeniable. Pristine songs such as Neon Lights are desperately sad as well as shiny, and Tour de France makes competitive cycling appear a heroic pursuit once again, in the wake of Lance Armstrong's disgrace. These first two nights, however, beam a laser at Kraftwerk's nuts and bolts: their lesser-known album-track sound experiments. Unbelievably, this may be only the third time that the deepest workings of Autobahn and Radio-Activity – tracks such as Intermission and Uranium – have ever been played live. Of the two, the Autobahn album emerges as more cogent. A comet approaches, and night turns into morning, complete with achingly beautiful faux-birdsong, originally played both on flutes and primitive keyboards, and now reproduced by laptop. Kometenmelodie 2 chugs along blithely, while Morgenspaziergang is just exquisite. By contrast, Radio-Activity is more austere and bitty, punningly divided between nuclear power and popular music dissemination.Still, Antenna is an unexpectedly cheery motorik vamp. It's quite difficult to overstate exactly how far ahead of their time Kraftwerk were in the 70s. They remain almost ridiculously exciting. Equally, though, examined deeply, as these nights do, Kraftwerk's music is hugely comforting: full of churchy organs and an almost childlike sense of wonder."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2010/oct/18/uk-government-new-nuclear-power","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-10-18T14:31:04Z","webTitle":"UK government approves eight sites for new nuclear power stations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/oct/18/uk-government-new-nuclear-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2010/oct/18/uk-government-new-nuclear-power","fields":{"headline":"UK government approves eight sites for new nuclear power stations","bodyText":"The government today gave the green light to eight new reactors, in a move that will see the UK push forward with the most ambitious fleet of new nuclear power stations in Europe. As predicted by the Guardian yesterday, the coalition also confirmed that it is dropping support for controversial plans to build a huge tidal barrage across the Severn estuary. The backing for a new generation of nuclear power stations marks a significant political compromise by the climate and energy secretary, Chris Huhne, after the Liberal Democrats had campaigned against new nuclear in the general election. The Conservatives, however, had backed new nuclear power stations. Today's announcement by the Department of Energy and Climate Change will see nuclear power plants operating at eight sites within the next decade: Bradwell, Essex; Hartlepool; Heysham, Lancashire; Hinkley Point, Somerset; Oldbury, South Gloucestershire; Sellafield, Cumbria; Sizewell, Suffolk and Wylfa, Anglesey. All are in the vicinity of existing nuclear power plants. Huhne said: \"I'm fed up with the stand-off between advocates of renewables and of nuclear which means we have neither. We urgently need investment in new and diverse energy sources to power the UK.\" Last November, former energy secretary Ed Miliband named 10 sites suitable for new nuclear reactors, but two greenfield sites in Cumbria - Kirksanton and Braystones - were last week dropped from the list. But the coalition has stressed that new reactors will have to be built without public money. Earlier this year, energy minister Charles Hendry told a nuclear industry audience: \"The coalition agreement clearly sees a role for new nuclear, provided that there is no public subsidy. We are clear. It is for private sector energy companies to construct, operate and decommission new nuclear plants. It will be for us to ensure the appropriate levels of safety, security and environmental regulation.\" The coalition's revised draft national policy statements on energy published today show that half the new energy capacity built in the UK by 2025 is expected to come from renewable sources of energy – the majority of which is likely to be wind."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global/2013/jul/18/stephen-emmott-ten-billion-observer-debate-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2013-07-18T18:05:00Z","webTitle":"Stephen Emmott's Ten Billion - the Observer debate as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2013/jul/18/stephen-emmott-ten-billion-observer-debate-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global/2013/jul/18/stephen-emmott-ten-billion-observer-debate-live","fields":{"headline":"Stephen Emmott's Ten Billion - the Observer debate as it happened","bodyText":"On that note, it's goodbye from me. I leave you with a link to the latest edition of BBC's Start the Week, where Emmott was among the guests discussing many of the same issues he raised tonight. Thanks to everyone who followed the debate tonight, and keep an eye on our Environment section for more developments in this area. Loud round of applause from the 150-or-so crowd we had here at the Science Museum, and I can report that Stephen is now surrounded by 20 or so attendees eager for more. Closing point from Emmott: \"You are warned that there are parts of my book that are already out-of-date, but this is the case with scientific literature as well. The world is changing very quickly.\" @jnmulholland is now wrapping up, and I'll take this opportunity to thank him and Stephen for joining us tonight, and everybody in the audience for keeping Stephen on his toes with some thoughtful questions. Audience member now asking whether things may need to get much worse before governments really take action. Interesting one here from Emmott: \"We're looking seriously at the idea of programming life to be able to breed crops that are resistant to drought, to fungal pathogens.\" (The question there was whether or not less democratic governments might actually be able to push through green policies quicker than their democratic counterparts) Emmott, in response to another question: \"If you look at autocratic forms of government - most notably China - yes, they get things done quickly, but those aren't necessarily the right things. China has made possible its rapid growth by pushing through decisions quickly, but the environmental consquences of its booming industry are not good.\" Interesting point from the audience - \"MOOCs have opened up these debates to much larger academic audiences, and we now have far more minds, from far more diverse backgrounds, looking for scientifically rigorous solutions. Perhaps this is where the solution will be found.\" Emmott: \"Actions are totaly different from words when it comes to green initiatives - this applies just as much to businesses as it does to politicians.\" Emmott: \"I would love to think business will play a much more central role than it is in moving debate forward.\" \"The planet is not overcrowded per se\", adds Emmott, \"Look at regions like Siberia. It's just that the way in which 10bn of us would use its resources is not viable.\" Emmott: \"I don't believe we are simply going to be able to adapt our way out of these crises, unless that adaptation is adopting a radically different way of life.\" \"I'm not an economist\", begins Emmott, \"But this whole issue requires a level of debate among politicians, economists and the wider public that simply isn't here at the moment.\" Another question now: \"Cost is always used as an excuse for not taking action against climate change or other environmental crises. Is it time we challenged the primacy of economic growth?\" The #10billion hashtag is eerily quiet - perhaps the resource crisis has hit rather earlier and more quickly than even Stephen fears? Emmott: \"The view is that if fertility rate was 2.0, population would not increase, is simply nonsensical. It's not two in, two out. By the time a set of parents has died, they've had two children, but so have each of those children, and perhaps even each of those four grandchildren.\" \"... however, accompanying those same improvements will be a growth in consumption, so it's not that simple. Also, I have noticed that every time the UN revises its population projections, they do appear to be going upwards.\" Emmott: \"First of all I think fertility will drop and we won't reach that figure of 28bn. It is the case that as GDP increases and education of women increases, fertility rates tend to drop.\" New question: \"Are you saying we sholdn't have children anymore?\" ... to which Emmott responds thusly: \"If Siberia thaws, it will open up vast amounts of natural resources for Russia that have been as yet inaccessible. The geopolitical impact would be huge.\" @jnmulholland now mentions the increasing interest of miitary bodies in the resource scarcity crisis and its implications for national security In response to another question: \"I don't use the word apocalyptic\", says Emmott, \"but the problems we're getting into are unprecendeted. Nobody knows what's going to happen, but it looks like it's going to be very bad, whatever it is.\" Audience member asks \"don't small changes lead to larger ones?\" in response to Emmott's argument that turning appliances off standby mode (etc) are pointless. Emmott sticks to his guns. Fun one here from the audience - \"Your book contains a lot of blank pages, Stephen.\" Emmott is quick to lay that decision at the feet of Penguin, his publisher First questions references the singularity hypothesis - that we will be able to create a higher species that will guide us out of the current crisis. Emmott bats it away, saying he doesn't think the theory holds water The tone of questions should give a pretty good idea of the audience we have here We're now going to take some questions from the floor. This should be interesting... Emmott: \"I don't see how we can 'technoogise' our way out of this hole, although I should remind you that we have certainly 'technologised' our way into it.\" Emmott: \"There is a place for climate change sceptics, but denying it altogether is unacceptable. There are uncertainties in climate models by their very nature, but scientists are working - I am working - at reducing the size of the error bars.\" Emmott: \"On the today show people are debating whether kids should take a packed lunch to school. The political debate has to change.\" \"I just don't think we're going to take the necessary steps\", says Emmott @jnmulholland asks Emmott how - if we are the problem - can we also be the solution? Emmott: \"We're living completely unsustainably. There's a good case for saying we're ust the wrong species for this planet. We probably shouldn't exist on a planet this size, and certainly shouldn't have been allowed to develop technologically as we have. Admittedly I'm being a bit daft here.\" Emmott: \"Who are we - sat here in a rich country - to say 700m Chinese shouldn't have their day living as we did one time?\" \"I think we've already gone too far. I hope that I'm wrong - and indeed many people on the internet have already concluded that I am\", adds Emmott, showing a healthy level of self-awareness, before adding: \"I think we're fucked\" Emmott: \"CERN isn't the biggest, most important experiment on earth. That would be the experiment we, the human race, are carrying out on the planet.\" \"If the current rate of reproduction were to continue, by the end of this century there will be 28bn of us\", says Emmott. This is a topic we've covered on the Datablog \"Don't have children\" is stupid advice, says Emmott. But he cautions that continuing to reproduce at current rates would be disastrous When it comes to throw-away advice on how to live greener lives, \"wee in the shower\" is apparently a personal favourite of Emmott's. Make of that what you will... Emmott has now turned on corporations, citing the enormous externalities produced by the private sector. Suffice to say he seems rather sceptical of the idea that green credentials will soon rise up the agenda at board meetings Interlude:Here is an extract from Ten Billion that the Observer featured last month. As you can see from the comment count (977, for those interested), it has sparked plenty of healthy (and less healthy) debate \"How do we prioritise water use?\", asks Emmott. Crops need water, but demand for water for direct human consumption is also going to continue to rise as populations grow and developing countries' demands increase Having dismissed geo-engineering as experimental [at this stage], Emmott has now moved on to the food crisis, and the argument that we need a second Green Revolution Next on the agenda is geo-engineering, all forms of which Emmott cautions are still unproven Emmott has named nuclear power and desalination plants as two part-solutions to the problems facing the globe, but accepts that each - and in particular desalination - would give rise to additional problems of its own For those who haven't read Stephen's book, here are a couple of reviews to give you an idea of the debates 10 Bilion has sparked: John Gray's review for the Guardian Chris Goodall - part of the Guardian's Environment Network - took a rather more critical line Got a question for Stephen, or a comment on the book? We're using the #10billion hashtag this evening, so get tagging to join the debate Emmott: \"Things are definitely going to get worse. We currently have no known means to be able to feed 10 bn people given current consumption levels and climate projections\" Emmott: \"Our cleverness and inventiveness are the drivers of every problem our planet is now facing\" Stephen has now taken to the stage, opening with a lighthearted aside that the warmth of reviews of the theatrical production was more down to the theatre itself than the quality of his work Observer editor John Mulholland is just introducing Stephen, discussing Ten Billion the theatrical production - the precursor to the book of the same title"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"environment/blog/2013/jan/03/three-easy-environmental-resolutions-2013","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-01-03T07:00:00Z","webTitle":"Three easy environmental resolutions for 2013 | Natalie Bennett","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2013/jan/03/three-easy-environmental-resolutions-2013","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/blog/2013/jan/03/three-easy-environmental-resolutions-2013","fields":{"headline":"Three easy environmental resolutions to aim for in 2013","bodyText":"It's new year's resolution time – the mince pies are sitting heavy on the stomach, the Christmas tat is spewing from every bin and it's time for a fresh start. For Britain's environment, clearly the most important resolution is to restructure the government's energy bill to put energy conservation at its heart, to restore the target of decarbonising electricity by 2030 and to follow most of the developed world in drawing a final line underneath the failed decades of expensive nuclear power. But that's a tough one to face this early in the year. So for now, let's start with the small, the easily delivered, the no-brainers, the cheap and the free. First, the simplest. Ireland did it yonks ago, Wales has done it, and Scotland is doing it: let's put a levy on single-use plastic bags in English shops. (It's even party policy for one party in the coalition government.) It's surprising it's not Conservative policy really, given the Daily Mail has made it a flagship campaign. Bag use rose by around 5% to 6.75bn in the past year, despite claimed voluntary efforts by stores to cut back. How many times do you have to say \"no bag please\" in your local chain stores? The London assembly has backed action, there's lots of excellent local campaigns. So now is the time for England to catch up with the rest of the UK. No, it's not going to save the planet, but as a small step towards cutting pointless resource use, and cleaning up our towns, cities, countryside rivers and seas, this truly is an easy win. Let's get back to parity with China on this one please. Next, let's cut down on unnecessary night time lighting of shops in cities and towns. The French are leading the way, having banned neon shop lighting in the early hours last year, and they're now looking at insisting the lights inside shops go off for similar hours. Yes, I admit that those people who love to window shop between 1am and 6am might be slightly discommoded – not that I know anyone who does that. But I know that a lot of people would enjoy a reduction in light pollution – both those who like to gaze up at the stars and those trying to sleep in glare-ridden bedrooms around the shops. And even the Daily Mail might like the fact that we could build a few less wind turbines if we cut demand for electricity instead. There would be a saving on shop electricity bills and so perhaps even a saving on our shopping bills. And this would be a small step towards the bigger range of energy reduction measures that we need, as with insulating and draft-proofing our dreadful quality housing stock and making sure that all new build homes meet the highest energy standards. It costs us all to provide extra energy capacity – we can all save cash, and improve our lives. Finally, an environmental measure that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, and make our towns and cities far more pleasing places – let's introduce 20mph speed limits everywhere people live, work and shop: make it the default urban limit. No need for lots of expensive signage – in fact you could probably clear a lot of street clutter. And motorists would see a saving in fuel costs and wear and tear, at the \"cost\" of an average of 90 seconds being added to their journeys. We're seeing big progress around the country on 20mph limits – the London borough of Islington is likely to soon be followed by others – but we could make a big national leap and save a lot of campaigners' time and energy, and a significant number of lives, if we took an immediate step across England and Wales. The cost of all of these three measures would be tiny, and the benefits – to our finances and quality of life – significant. They're perfect easy resolutions to start with – then we can get more ambitious."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/julian-borger-global-security-blog/2012/dec/15/iran-nuclear-talks","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2012-12-15T03:09:00Z","webTitle":"New round of Iran nuclear talks 'imminent'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/julian-borger-global-security-blog/2012/dec/15/iran-nuclear-talks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/julian-borger-global-security-blog/2012/dec/15/iran-nuclear-talks","fields":{"headline":"New round of Iran nuclear talks 'imminent'","bodyText":"The Washington Post is reporting that nuclear negotiations between six major powers and Iran could resume soon, probably in Istanbul. Initial meetings could begin as early as next week, though they are more likely to start after the New Year's Day holiday. These new round of talks was originally expected to take place at the end of November, soon after the US presidential election, but were delayed while the six-nation negotiating group (US, UK, France, Germany, Russia and China), considered what they were going to put on the table. According to the Post, that will look rather similar to what was put on the table at abortive talks in the summer: no new sanctions, a lifting of the ban of sales of aircraft parts to Iran, and help with peaceful nuclear power generation, in return for Iran stopping its production of 20%, or 'medium-enriched', uranium, the removal of its existing 20% stockpile and the closure of its underground enrichment plant at Fordow. Reading between the lines somewhat in the Post article, the enhancements in this updated offer to Iran are to be back-loaded. Much greater inducements, like sanctions relief and ultimate acceptance of Iran's right to make low-enrichment uranium, would be available further down the road in return for further Iranian concessions, and this \"grand bargain\" would be spelled out more clearly. In the short term, however, Iran would be offered very little more. Here is the key, rather odd, quote from a senior administration official: The package has the same bone structure, but with some slightly different tattoos If true, this is a harder-nosed approach than I expected on the basis of conversations with diplomats back in October, when it looked like some more significant sanctions relief would be offered up front. It seems that Washington believes that the intense and deepening sanctions on Iran will be enough to get 20% enrichment halted and stop the clock on Israeli military action. This is what the senior official told Joby Warrick of the Post: Our assessment is that it is possible that they are ready to make a deal...Certainly, the pressure is on. If a deal is done on this basis, it will seen by western governments as a vindication for the tough sanctions policy of the past year. But the approach is high risk, and will backfire if Tehran feels it is being humiliated. In October, western officials said that they acknowledged that for the deal to work, Iranian negotiators had to be able to go home and plausibly claim victory. By contrast, the tattoos remark seems designed to do the opposite - emphasis the superficial, decorative enhancements to the new offer. This is one guess at what is happening. In the absence of a new secretary of state there is no final US decision on a fundamentally new approach. Meanwhile, there are signs of give from Tehran. Iranian officials have been cooperative enough with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to make the agency believe (again) that they will go along with an investigation into possible past nuclear weapons work. At the same time, Tehran has got on the phone and called for a meeting with the six powers in the next few days, leading Washington to believe it is desperate and ready to give in over 20% enrichment. We shall see. In the past, Iran has agreed to meetings and signed up to investigations as a way of alleviating pressure, and then just tried to keep the ball in play without giving anything substantial away. That is quite another thing from making major strategic decisions under outside pressure."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2012/dec/13/fracking-shale-gas","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2012-12-13T12:35:57Z","webTitle":"Fracking for shale gas: the right way forward? | Mark Lynas and David Santillo","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/dec/13/fracking-shale-gas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2012/dec/13/fracking-shale-gas","fields":{"headline":"Fracking for shale gas: the right way forward?","bodyText":"The UK government has given the green light to fracking for shale gas – a controversial practice of hydraulic fracturing – under strict conditions. Energy secretary Ed Davey said: \"Shale gas represents a promising new potential energy resource for the UK. It could contribute significantly to our energy security, reducing our reliance on imported gas, as we move to a low-carbon economy. My decision is based on the evidence. It comes after detailed study of the latest scientific research available and advice from leading experts in the field.\" Fracking is polarising many in the environmental movement. To help you understand what is at stake, climate change writer Mark Lynas and Greenpeace scientist David Santillo debate the pro and cons of the practice, and will answer your questions in the thread below. Mark Lynas, freelance writer working full-time on climate change By going big on opposition to fracking, the environmental movement risks scoring a large own-goal. Just as they have done with nuclear power, the greens are using arguments about trivial and manageable risks to try to stop a technology that can help to reduce a much greater risk – that of global warming. The local environmental impacts of fracking should be taken seriously, but are often wildly overstated by opponents. For the UK the company Cuadrilla, which wants to drill in the Lancashire shale, uses only sand, water, a benign chemical called polyacrylamide (at 0.04% concentration) and trace amounts of salt. The fracking takes place 3km below the surface water table, and disposal of the resulting flowback water is strictly regulated by the Environment Agency. The UK may have 6,000 billion cubic metres of shale gas or more, enough for 60 years at current consumption. Gas is a cleaner fuel than coal, but because coal is currently cheaper than gas the UK's carbon emissions are higher than they need to be. Shale gas could reverse this situation as it has in the US, where coal is in decline and emissions are falling. In the longer term, however, gas-fired power stations should be required to capture their emissions through carbon capture and storage technologies. Greens must remember that coal is the single biggest contributor to global warming, and that coal mining – which still goes on in the UK – has vastly greater landscape and even seismic impacts too. The priority must be to get coal off the UK grid, and shale gas – with captured emissions – can help that to happen. David Santillo, senior scientist for Greenpeace Hydraulic fracture methods (\"fracking\") are associated with a range of environmental impacts, some of which are not fully characterised or understood. The process consumes huge amounts of water (estimated at anywhere between 9,000 and 29,000 cubic metres of water for a single well). A range of hazardous chemicals are added to fracturing fluids (at least 260 chemical additives are known to be used), some of which are toxic, carcinogenic or mutagenic. These chemicals can contaminate groundwater if well bores fail, and are part of waste fluid streams returned to the surface, which can also pick up contaminants such as heavy metals, volatile hydrocarbons and naturally occurring radioactive elements from the shale itself. Well-drilling operations can also cause severe landscape degradation and noise pollution simply as a result of normal operations. On top of all this, it appears that the greenhouse gas \"footprint\" of shale gas may be significantly greater than for conventional gas and has even be claimed by some to be worse than coal. Greenpeace is therefore opposed to the exploitation of unconventional gas reserves until the impacts are fully investigated, understood, addressed and regulated. We call for significant more effort to be put into understanding the full impacts of fracking."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2013/mar/31/north-korea-sabre-rattling-seoul","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2013-04-01T09:10:00Z","webTitle":"Seoul remains calm despite North Korea's sabre-rattling","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/31/north-korea-sabre-rattling-seoul","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/mar/31/north-korea-sabre-rattling-seoul","fields":{"headline":"Seoul remains calm despite North Korea's sabre-rattling","bodyText":"Judging by the mood among people in the South Korean capital on Sunday, the message has yet to get through that their country is in a state of war with its belligerent neighbour. Groups of tourists and young couples filled the streets of Seoul near the cavernous glass edifice of city hall, relishing the warmth of the early spring sunshine after another bitterly cold Korean winter. Shoppers swarmed into the Lotte department store, snapping up early-evening discounts in the basement food hall, while TV channels served up an eclectic mix of baseball, period drama and news of a spiralling crisis over government appointees surrounding the new president, Park Geun-hye. Little, if anything, was said about North Korea, which has directed a flurry of furious threats at the South and the US in recent weeks, culminating in the release of a mildly comedic photograph of the regime's 30-year-old leader, Kim Jong-un, seated with his generals in front of a map pinpointing envisioned US targets for a nuclear strike. \"Kim Jong-un is crazy,\" said Josiah Jung, a 22-year-old student. \"He runs a poor, hungry country … his threats are just talk designed to get food and money. But if North Korea bombs any part of South Korea, like it did in 2010, this time we should respond with an all-out attack.\" While experts believe the North is a long way off building a functioning nuclear weapon, let alone one that can reach the US mainland, Pyongyang gave notice on Sunday that it would push ahead with the development of weapons of mass destruction. In a statement released by the official KCNA news agency, the central committee of the ruling Korean Workers' party slammed charges that the North was using its nuclear programme to win aid and diplomatic concessions. Nuclear weapons \"are neither a political bargaining chip nor a thing for economic dealings to be presented to the place of dialogue or be put on the table of negotiations aimed at forcing [Pyongyang] to disarm itself,\" the party' top decision-making body said. North Korea's \"nuclear armed forces\" it added, \"represent the nation's life, which can never be abandoned as long as the imperialists and nuclear threats exist on earth\". The announcement comes amid frequent threats to attack South Korea and its allies, the US and Japan. On Saturday, the regime said it had entered a \"state of war\" with Seoul and would \"settle accounts with the US\" after two of its stealth bombers took part in a training mission over an uninhabited South Korean island. Pyongyang said it would retaliate against any provocations by the US or the South \"without prior notice\". In response, the unification ministry in Seoul, which is responsible for cross-border relations, said: \"North Korea's statement is not a new threat but is the continuation of provocative threats.\" Most analysts believe North Korea, now ruled by a third generation of the Kim dynasty, is reverting to a trusted diplomatic strategy of using threats to win concessions on aid and, ultimately, a peace treaty with the US. The regime, so the received wisdom goes, has neither the capability nor the political will to make good on its threats. It knows that an attack on the US or its overseas assets would invite swift, powerful retaliation against Pyongyang and prompt the collapse of the regime. That view is shared by many South Koreans, even those too young to remember similar provocations by Kim Jong-un's father, Kim Jong-il. \"This has been going on since the 1950s and 60s,\" said Lee Jang-won, a 29-year-old employee of a solar power firm who recently completed his national service. \"I don't think North Korea will do anything major, despite what it says. Kim Jong-un has too much to lose.\" Kim burnished his credentials as the North's \"supreme commander\" with a successful rocket launch last December and a nuclear test last month, but he is still building his reputation at home. The North Korean economy is in ruins after years of international sanctions, and the state can no longer provide for its people, 24 million of whom face regular food shortages, the UN says. The North's statement said its nuclear programme would be accompanied by economic development through more foreign trade and investment and a focus on agriculture, light industry and a \"self-reliant nuclear power industry\". \"Even dictatorships respond to public opinion and public pressure,\" said John Delury, a North Korea analyst at of Yonsei University in Seoul. \"He's expected to pay attention to, and make improvements in, the common people's standard of living. They've put that promise out in their domestic propaganda.\" While threats of a nuclear strike or other major attacks are being dismissed as bluster, the possibility of a more localised conflict is a growing concern. In November 2010, the North shelled Yeonpyeong, a South Korean island near the countries' disputed Yellow Sea border, killing two civilians and two soldiers. Earlier the same year, a torpedo attack blamed on the North sank a South Korean naval ship, killing 46 sailors. Seoul did not take action, but promised fierce retaliation if attacked again, raising fears that a naval clash or isolated shelling in the coming days or weeks could quickly spiral out of control. Scott Snyder, a senior fellow for Korea studies with the US Council on Foreign Relations thinktank, said the US should now help Kim Jong-un find a way to lower the diplomatic temperature. \"There is a need for the US and South Korea to offer some clear diplomatic gestures of reassurance toward the North that can help the North Koreans climb down, calm down and change course,\" Snyder told AFP. For now, cool heads prevail in Seoul's presidential Blue House. Park, a conservative who took office less than two months ago, has spoken of engagement with the North – a departure from the hardline stance of her predecessor, Lee Myung-bak, who cut free-flowing aid and took inter-Korean relations to their lowest point in years. Park reportedly wants to begin the process by offering humanitarian aid, followed by huge investment in North Korea's social and economic infrastructure, but only if Pyongyang abandons its nuclear weapons programme in return."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/musicblog/2013/feb/10/kraftwerk-tate-modern-trans-europe-express","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2013-02-10T11:36:08Z","webTitle":"Kraftwerk at Tate Modern, night three: Trans-Europe Express","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2013/feb/10/kraftwerk-tate-modern-trans-europe-express","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/musicblog/2013/feb/10/kraftwerk-tate-modern-trans-europe-express","fields":{"headline":"Kraftwerk at Tate Modern, night three: Trans-Europe Express","bodyText":"For the third night in a row, a black curtain falls from a ceiling to reveal a 66-year-old in a Spiderman suit, and three men to his right that no-one really cares about. It is getting past Bovril Time too: 10.30pm on Friday night, this show starting later to fit Tate Modern's weekend opening hours. Eight hundred people stand in front of this peculiar tableau, and it only takes the clack of a train track to make all of them scream. The power of Kraftwerk really is an odd thing. Tonight, Ralf Hütter's music-workers play Trans-Europe Express, an album that hymned our continent's speedy rail service. Thirty-six years ago, the T-E-E only took first-class passengers, and this record still has a similar elegance. It brings together delicate instrumentals full of synthesised strings and songs that comment on fame in strange, dispassionate ways. Iggy Pop and David Bowie's names have never been uttered more mysteriously than on the title track, while a Hall of Mirrors lyric prophesies the life Hütter is now living: \"The artist living in the mirror with the echoes of himself\". But this album that fans know and love is not the album Kraftwerk play tonight. Perhaps Hütter accidentally put the cassette into his car stereo the wrong way round: Side 2 of Trans-Europe Express comes first, followed by Side 1. This does allow the album's stunning title track to kick off the concert, and its menacing melody to dart, whip and whirr around the Turbine Hall. In full effect, the quadraphonic sound in this cavernous space is a triumph of engineering, and a feast for the ears. Nevertheless, this new order casts the album in a very different light. Trans-Europe Express originally opened to the gentle, magical arpeggios of Europe Endless – instead, we hear this, rather oddly, after its reprise, Endless Endless. Thanks to this jiggery-pokery, some of the album's subtleties get lost. John Harris mentioned similar revisionism during the Radio-Activity gig: Kraftwerk playing the version of the title track from 1991 album The Mix, which made its position against nuclear power clangingly clear. The original is hauntingly lonely and morally ambiguous. Perhaps Kraftwerk are sidestepping subtlety for a greatest hits mentality these days – a shame when only 800 diehard fans a night get to hear it. There are other problems tonight, too. The sound cuts out several times, prompting the ravier members of the crowd to bawl and throw cushions. The 3-D visuals during Franz Schubert are also uninspiring: the white smudges washing across the black screen aren't a patch on the spaceships and cascading treble clefs we get later. A clip from the Autobahn video also appears by accident before Showroom Dummies (new boy Falk Grieffenhagen is in charge of live visuals, and deserves a smack on the neoprene-covered bottom for that schoolboy error). But as the dummies come to life in that song, breaking through a shop window, you hear the sound of glass smashing, again and again; the noise is so brilliantly clear, you swear that it sparkles. Trust the Man-Machine to get the power back on at this point, and fix the broken bits. The greatest hits set that follows plays out chronologically, ironically given the first half of the show. Tracks from 1981's Computer World provide the highlights: the electronic gurgles in Numbers reveal funk as its most poppy and pure, while Computer Love's innocence remains oddly moving. There are also a few children at the edges of the crowd, and their presence, despite the late hour, makes perfect sense. Kraftwerk turn nursery rhymes and lullabies into pop after all, which marvel and wonder at the new world around them. Other moving moments tonight involve the Man-Machine's leader. Before Radio-Activity begins, an image of Hütter appears from the mid-1970s in stark black-and-white, his face in beautiful profile, slowly approaching an old-fashioned microphone. You realise that this is where Kraftwerk's live power began. Then an electronic voice shudders from those lips, whirls round through the room, and sends electricity up the spine. The two hours end with 1986's Musique Non-Stop, and the way Hütter leaves the stage is touching, too. After his colleagues walk one by one, he plays a final solo behind his neon-lit music-station; it's hard not to think of his days on the Autobahn tour, playing behind a similar light that shone his name in bright blue. Then he speaks – \"Goodnight, Auf Wiedersehen\" – walks to the wings, bows, and touches his heart with the flat of his hand. Here is a 66-year-old man with one hell of a legacy behind him, still understanding the power of ghosts in his machine."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2013/feb/28/cancel-apocalypse-andrew-simms-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2013-02-28T11:00:01Z","webTitle":"Cancel the Apocalypse by Andrew Simms – review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/feb/28/cancel-apocalypse-andrew-simms-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2013/feb/28/cancel-apocalypse-andrew-simms-review","fields":{"headline":"Cancel the Apocalypse by Andrew Simms – review","bodyText":"Back in the days when he had the gleam of youthful promise, David Cameron affected to be interested in green politics, and something called \"general well-being\". Ed Miliband was a somewhat evangelical secretary of state for energy and climate change, whose first speech as Labour leader examined the notion of \"life beyond the bottom line\". But the long aftermath of the economic crash looks to have left precious little room for such ideas, instead pointing up the irony that one of the consequences of the financial crisis has been the squashing of any convincing conversation about everything that caused it, and what it actually means. Perhaps this is down to the incremental, drily pragmatic nature of democratic politics; perhaps it's just reflective of capitalism being capitalism, so that anything hostile to its interests is quickly neutralised. Whichever it is, while inequality is widening, glaciers are still melting and what passes for British debate about it seems laughable. On a bad day, it can seem as if the entirety of politics now rotates around a quarterly event: the release of the provisional figure for economic growth, or the lack of it. The economist, campaigner and author Andrew Simms works in a rather different universe, accessible via the offices of the New Economics Foundation. He is most renowned for Tescopoly, his book about the rise of the titular retail giant, and his subsequent invention of the concept of \"clone towns\". But Cancel the Apocalypse is much more ambitious: a treatise on why the human race cannot go on as it is, and what we might be able to do by way of an alternative. In addressing what the political-economic vernacular calls sustainability, it takes in the banking system, energy generation, the global air-travel business, meat-eating and more – along with such tangential reference points as the psychedelic rock band Hawkwind, Kurt Vonnegut's Galapagos and Doris Lessing's The Memoirs of a Survivor. It is a breathless, quotation-packed work, light years from anything to do with orthodox politics, which suggests someone unpacking the entire contents of their head: it's probably about 100 pages too long, and best read at the rate of a chapter every few days. Yet Simms's talent for casting gigantic issues in pleasingly human terms is clear, and proved by his evocation of the five or so days in 2010 when the ash from an Icelandic volcano shut down European airspace. He describes staring into the unblemished blue from Kew Gardens, and realising what was afoot: \"Flying was something we thought we couldn't live without, [but] the world did not come to a standstill.\" He is also keen to push his arguments into new territories, as evidenced by what turns out to be the book's unexpected highlight: a chapter on advertising and PR, and the extent to which they work as the free market's multicoloured telescreen. And he has facts galore. The county of Cornwall alone, he says, has to dispose of 4,000 tonnes of junk mail every year – \"500 dustcarts' worth, costing them around £700,000\". If you consider left-field the idea of slowing down the capitalist machine via a ban on billboard advertising, it's worth bearing in mind that it has already been done in Vermont, Maine, Hawaii and Alaska. No one will agree with every word. For my own part, I was maddened by Simms's complete hostility to nuclear power. A lot of what he writes is open to an obvious enough criticism: that his arguments should probably be addressed at China, India and Brazil rather than a small and increasingly insignificant corner of northern Europe. But there is a joy in reading someone setting out the case for such unmentionables as a 21-hour working week and an economy that runs wholly on renewables. Moreover, when you have set the book down and pondered its essential message, you are left with an entire mindset rather than specific proposals. Consume less, he says. Be sceptical about new technology. Slow down. And do not fall for the modern political class's post-Blair belief that history is bunk, and to draw on the past is to be a hopeless throwback: it is only a comparative blink since the second world war found millions of people reshaping their lives in the cause of a common endeavour, and the same thing could yet happen again. And then there is the fetish of growth, or rather growth-ism. As Simms points out, the idea that economies necessarily have their limits was being voiced when capitalism was still young: in 1848, John Stuart Mill argued that \"a stationary condition of capital and population implies no stationary state of human improvement\". A century and a half later, Adair Turner, a former director of the CBI, told Simms that if anyone thinks \"the most important objective of public policy is to get growth from 1.9 per cent to 2 per cent and even better 2.1 per cent\", they're worshipping a \"false god\", and \"extra growth does not automatically translate into extra human welfare and happiness\". These are pretty ordinary thoughts, but ones that the dull noise coming from Westminster renders almost exotic – and essential."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2012/mar/13/uk-energy-future-france","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-03-13T12:47:14Z","webTitle":"How the UK is handing control of its energy future to France | Jonathon Porritt","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/mar/13/uk-energy-future-france","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/mar/13/uk-energy-future-france","fields":{"headline":"How the UK is handing control of its energy future to France","bodyText":"Aside from the pro-nuclear zealots, most protagonists in favour of nuclear power rely on \"there is no alternative\" advocacy – because of climate change, energy security, the \"lights going out\", we need nuclear, the argument runs. Such thinking is alive and well within the coalition government to the extent that ministers are no longer prepared to listen to contrary evidence. As a result, UK energy policy is being manipulated and subverted to make it possible for French nuclear power companies (EDF and Areva) to start building four new reactors in the UK – two at Hinkley Point in Somerset and two at Sizewell in Suffolk. Along with three other former directors of Friends of the Earth, with experience going right back to the 1970s, I am very familiar with the record of the nuclear industry in pulling the wool over the eyes of both senior officials and ministers. A recent report reveals how the government's own analysis shows that the UK could achieve all its energy objectives without new nuclear – through investment in energy efficiency, renewables, combined heat and power, and grid upgrades. The authors reserve judgment in their conclusion about how it is that the evidence has been so comprehensively fiddled – \"We don't like conspiracy theories, but either it's a monumental series of mistakes, or the nuclear lobby has got control of the Whitehall machine\" – but personally I am in no doubt that it's the latter. As a result, we are about to hand over control of Britain's future energy policy and climate security to the French government – as I demonstrate with Charles Secrett, Tom Burker and Tony Juniper in a note to the prime minister today. It is our belief that the two German operators here in the UK (RWE and E.ON) are incapable of building new nuclear power stations now that the German government has opted for early closure of its remaining reactors. Centrica, which has an option of 20% in any new build at Hinkley and Sizewell, has a weak balance sheet and is already under intense scrutiny from its investors. That leaves EDF, which is 85% owned by the French state. EDF will only build those reactors if the risks involved are borne by British households and businesses rather than by themselves – in other words, if they are guaranteed a high enough price for the electricity those reactors will generate to compensate them for the huge risks involved in building the reactors. And EDF, along with its partner Areva, certainly know about those risks. They have two on the go at the moment in Finland and France. Both are massively over budget and running around four years late. The four previous reactors they've built took an average of 17.5 years from the start of construction to delivery of the first electricity. This kind of experience with the European pressurised reactor led François Rousseley, the former head of EDF, to recommend that the EPR be abandoned. This advice was endorsed by a recent report by the French National Audit Office which also found the EPR to be too complex and expensive. It's a total mess. To make it possible for the French to build reactors of the wrong kind, that we don't need, that we can't afford, and that will massively distort energy policy in the UK for the next 40 years, the coalition government is about to rig the market (through its electricity market reform) to favour nuclear at the expense of every other alternative. Our analysis shows that huge amounts of direct and indirect subsidy will be made available to the nuclear industry to facilitate this high-risk strategy. The coalition government's continuing pledge that there will be no subsidies for the nuclear industry is palpably dishonest, and the Lib Dems (who once had sufficient integrity not to fall prey to the seductive deceits of the nuclear industry) will pay a heavy price for this betrayal. As my colleague Tom Burke said: \"It is shocking that the government is willing to turn over control of our energy and climate security to France in pursuit of a nuclear mirage. British householders and businesses will be compelled to pay for a French nuclear loser.\" And it's equally shocking to me that a number of leading environmentalists have added their support to this disastrous policy. As the truth of what's really going on becomes clearer, let's hope they have the decency to rethink their bizarre pro-nuclear advocacy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2014/jun/18/cameroon-v-croatia-world-cup-2014-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2014-06-18T23:55:22Z","webTitle":"Cameroon 0-4 Croatia: World Cup 2014 – as it happened | Barry Glendenning","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jun/18/cameroon-v-croatia-world-cup-2014-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2014/jun/18/cameroon-v-croatia-world-cup-2014-live","fields":{"headline":"Cameroon 0-4 Croatia: World Cup 2014 – as it happened","bodyText":"That's all from me. OK, sorry to dash off, but I have to go and record the latest episode of ourt World Cup Daily podcast with AC Jimbo, who doesn't like to be kept waiting. Be sure to download it and listen when it goes up in a few hours. In the meantime, thanks for your company. Peep! Peep! Peeeeeeep! It's all over. Croatia have won 4-0 due in no small part to the idiocy of Alexandre Song, who was sent off in the first off for a preposterous show of petulance. Cameroon join Australia and Spain among the list of teams who've already been eliminated from the tournament, while Croatia must now beat Mexico in what promises to be a great game, if they are to advance to the last 16. 90 min: Assou-Ekotto and Moukandjou have a disagreement over something, which leads to some shoving and ends with Assou-Ekotto sticking the nut on his team-mate. He didn't do it particularly violently, it was more of a Pepe effort. Luckily for him the referee didn't see it, or he'd almost certainly have been sent off. 89 min: Pletikosa saves brilliantly from Webo, who took advantage of a brilliant Assou-Ekotto cross to head the ball into the ground and up, only to see his goal-bound effort tipped over the bar. 88 min: From a corner, the ball's lumped long to the halfway line for Rebic to chase. He finds himself alone in the Cameroon half, with Rakitic galloping up through the centre at an astonishing rate of knots, considering how late in the game it is. Rebic plays the ball through to Rakitic, whose first touch is poor. He lifts the ball over the keeper and wide, when scoring looked easier. 87 min: We're treated to the familiar sight of several Croatians bearing down on the Cameroon goal. Ante Rebic shoots straight at Charles Itandje, who can only parry the ball back into the centre of the penalty area. He gets away with it: the ball doesn't break kindly for any of the onrushing Croatians. 84 min: Benjamin Moukandjo squanders a great chance to get his name on the score-sheet, curling a shot wide of the right upright from the left side of the penalty area when in acres of space with all the time in the world to pick his spot and shoot. 83 min: Croatia goalkeeper Stipe Pletikosa is forced to gallop off his line and make a rare save, diving at the feet of Salli to block a shot. 82 min: Eduardo and then Darijo Srna each have shots blocked in quick succession as Croatia meander through midfield at their leisure again. 78 min: Cameroon win a free-kick and then a corner in quick succession, but fail to take of advantage of either to pull back a consolation goal. 77 min: Croatia substitution: Ivan Perisic off, after a fine performance. Amnte Rebic replaces him to make his seventh appearance for his country. 76 min: Eduardo and Kovacic exchange passes on the fringes of the Cameroon penalty area again, but a leaden-footed touch by the latter gifts possession back to Cameroon. 75 min: Cameroon substituion: Eric Choupo-Moting off, Edgar Salli on. 74 min: Mateo Kovacic had just replaced Sammir in midfield and made an instant impression, cantering up the right flank, before pulling the ball back to his fellow substitute Eduardo, who shot diagonally from outside the penalty area. At full streth, Itandje could only parry the ball to the feet of Mandzukic who tapped it home. Mario Mandzukic scores as easy goal as he'll ever get, tapping home from three yards or less after Charles Itandje had parried a low Eduardo drive from distance into his path. 70 min: Cameroon substitution: Vincent Aboubaker, one of few Cameroon players to perform well tonight, goes off. Pierre Webo replaces him. No sooner thasn he comes on than Stephane Mbia goes close to pulling a goal back for Cameroon, firing wide after going through on goal while Croatia's players were day-dreaming. 68 min: Croatia substitution: Ivica Olic off, after putting in another epic shift. Eduardo on. 66 min: Croatia Stephane Mbia mugs Sammir of possession in midfield and canters into space towards the Cameroon penalty area. He sends the ball left to Vincent Aboubaker, who skews a wild shot wide. 64 min: Perisic picks up the ball in space and advances down the inside right channel. Had he crossed quicker, he'd have picked out Sammir screaming for the ball in acres of space about nine yards from goal, but Perisic dilly-dallied over his pass and allowed a Cameroon defender to get back and block. 62 min: Cameroon could get beaten by seven or eight goals here. They're a man down, three goals down and seem to have given up completely if the marking at that corner was anything to go by. They had seven players in the penalty area and not a single one of them picked up Croatia's centre-forward before the ball was sent into the mixer. 61 min: And they score from it. Completely unmarked in the penalty area, Mandzukic rises highest and firmly heads the ball past Charles Itandje from seven yards. 59 min: Modric tries to play a deft pass on to the head of Perisic on the edge of the Cameroon six-yard box, but Nicholas Nkoulou heads clear. Croatia win a corner. 58 min: Darijo Srna takes the free-kick, but hits the ball a couple of yards over the bar. 57 min: Nounkou brings down Perisic on the edge of the Cameroon penalty area, dead centre, just inside the D. The referee reaches for his holster and brings out his can of disappearing foam. 55 min: Olic goes close to scoring his second of the night, but settles for winning a corner after finding himself in acres of space on the edge of the six yards out but failing to take full advantage. 54 min: I've just seen a replay of that second Croatia goal.Itandje took a massive divot out of the ground as he took his free-kick, which I suppose is forgivable in golf (as long as you replace it afterwards), but not in football. 51 min: Cameroon substitute Dany Nounkeu tries to Tim Cahill a volley past Pletikosa from the right side of the penalty area. He puts his laces through the ball and strikes it well, but his effort fizzes over the bar. 50 min: Mandzukic misses a glorious chance to make it 3-0. Darting through the centre on to a through-ball from Sammir, he found himself clean through on goal and had only Itandje to beat. What does he do? Attempt to lift the ball over the oncoming keeper and put it wide. He was under pressure from a last-ditch lunge from Nicholas Nkoulou, but for a striker of his supposed quality, that was a poor finish. 48 min: That was a great opportunist goal from Perisic, who's been man of the match thus far. Itandje's goal-kick was far too casual and went straight to the Croatian. He still had plenty to do, but Cameroon made it easy for him. They appear to have thrown in the towel already; none of their defenders made much of an effort to close down Perisic as he bore down on the goal. Ivan Perisic doubles Croatia's lead with a fine solo strike. On the left flank, he takes possession of a poor kick-out from Charles Itandje, makes a diagonal run into the penalty area and blasts the ball past the hapless goalkeeper. Second half: Ten-man Cameroon kick off, having made a change at the break. Dany Nounkeu has replaced centre-half Aurelien Chedjou. Half-time: The teams troop off for their half-time brew with Croatia a goal and a man to the good. Ivica Olic scored the opener from six yards after 10 minutes, then Alex Song infuriated his manager and team-mates with an absolutely moronic and entirely deserved dismissal a few minutes before the break. 44 min: Song's dismissal means that Ivan Rakitic and Luka Modric now have the run of midfield. Bear in mind that this gazme is being played in the sauna that is Manaus, where it's difficult enough to compete for 90 minutes with a full complement of players. 41 min: That was Cameroon in a nutshell, there. As Mbia and Moukandjo were arguing with each other after a mix-up, Alex Song was sprinting behind Mandzukic, who appeared to slow down and cause a collision. Song continued running after him and sort of - as difficult as it should be to perform such an act - elbow him from behind. The referee was perfectly placed and had no hesitation in showing him the red card. That's really dim-witted from Song. All we needed was a couple of players elsewhere on the pitch arguing about bonus payments and we'd have been able to shout 'House!' in the game of Cameroon bingo. The Cameroon midfielder elbows Mandzukic down the back in an off-the-ball incident and is shown a straight red card. I'll need to see that again to be sure of what happened. 39 min: Mbia and Moukandjo get in each other's way as they try to take possession of a Choupo-Moting cross. 37 min: Matip advances down the inside-left channel, beating two players in the process. Swivelling to try and cross the ball, he hits the ball off Darijo Srna then watches in exasperation as it ricochets out for a goal-kick off his own leg. 35 min: Rakitic takes a corner for Croatia. Perisic darts in from the edge of the penalty area to get on the end of it and thumps a meaty header wide. 32 min:The game's gone a bit flat, but livens up when Stephane Mbia picks up the ball on the right flank, leaves Pranjic sprawled on the turf and gallops into the penalty area. Rather than pick out a team-mate or drill the ball into the mixer, he continues to advance, making it easy for Dejan Lovren to close him down. 31 min: Croatia win a free-kick wide on the right, a good distance out. Rakitic sends the ball into the crowded penalty area, where Mandzukic gets a touch on the ball. Offside. 28 min: A bit of a lull after a fairly frenetic opening half hour. Both sides are channeling their attacks down the respective right flanks, where both left-backs are in all sorts of bother. As a one-time left-back who spent my entire career in all sorts of bother, I can recognise the signs. 26 min: Dejan Lovren goes a galloping down the inside left flank and takes out the Cameroon defence with a ball over the top towards Ivica Olic on the approach to the Cameroon penalty area. Olic's attempted \"finish\" from there is rather less clinical than his earlier effort and he ends up trapping the ball out for a goal-kick. 23 min: Cameroon win a corner, which is sent to the far post. Ivica Olic is back defending and puts it out for a throw-in. That's taken, Sammir wins possession and attempts to run the ball out of defence and is brought down by Joel Matip.Free-kick for Croatia, deep inside their own half. 21 min: Luka Modric has been in the wars again, having sustained a bloody nose after being brought down in midfield. He's forced off the field to get himself cleaned up, but returns soon after. 19 min: Some respite for Cameroon. Alex Song tries his luck from the edge of the Croatia penalty area. Dejan Lovren charges down his effort. 17 min: Rakitic shoots low and hard from distance. In the Cameroon goal, Charles Itandje saves comfortably. Having got off to a great start, Cameroon are now in all sorts of bother. Their defence looks incredibly creaky and Croatia are making hay down the right hand side. Metaphorical hay, I hasten to add. The grass isn't long enough for them to make actual hay. 16 min: From the corner, Croatia create another goalscoring opportunity, with the ball bouncing down for the unmarked Perisic from four yards out. From four yards out, he somehow contrives to miss, shooting straight at Itandje. 15 min: Croatia attack down the right flank again and Srna sends in another cross towards Mandzukic. Stephane Mbia tips the ball over the bar with his head to concede the corner. 14 min: Alex Song goes down holding his shin under a challenge from Pranjic on the halfway line, but no free-kick is forthcoming. 12 min: That was an excellent goal from Croatia. Darijo Srna advanced up the right for the first time and sent a cross towards Mario Mandzukic. The Croatia striker wrestled for control of the ball, which broke to Perisic in space on the right side of the penalty area. Out of the corner of his eye, he spotted Olic making a run towards the edge of the six-yard box and rolled the ball between two defenders and into his path. Boom! Olic wasn't going to miss from there. The hardest looking man on the pitch puts Croatia ahead against the run of play, finishing with aplomb from seven yards out after being teed up by a wonderful diagonal pass from Ivan Perisic. 10 min: Croatia play it long from the back and the ball's flicked on for Mandzukic to chase. The ball's ushered back to Charles Itandje by a defender. 9 min: You'll have noticed I haven't mentioned Ivan Rakitic or Luka Modric yet. There's a reason for that - they've barely had a kick of the ball between them. They need to get into this game if Croatia are to have any chance. 7 min: Croatia launch their first attack of note, but Perisic over-hits his cross to Mandzukic, who had moments previously been lying on the turf at the other end of the pitch accusing some Cameroonian or other of elbowing him in the chops. 5 min: Another free-kick for Croatia, after Lovren brings down Aboubaker between touchline and the side of the Croatia penalty area. Assou-Ekotto sends the free-kick towards the near post, where Ivan Perisic clears. It's been a splendid start for Cameroon; Vincent Aboubaker is playing superbly, running into space around the penalty area, drawing fouls from assorted Croatian defenders. 3 min: Cameroon win the first corner of the game, after excellent play from Vincent Aboubaker. Benoit Assou-Ekotto sends the ball into the mixer andhis delivery is excellent, but Stephane Mbia fouls Stipe Pletikosa in the Croatia goal and the referee awards a free-kick. 2 min: Cameroon fly out of the traps, getting a cross in with their first attack. Moments later they attack down the right flank and Danijel Pranjic slides in to foul Benjamin Moukandjou. Free-kick for Cameroon, over by the right touchline. Nothing comes of it. 1 min: We're off for the third match of the day. The first two have been belters, so here's hoping this one will be of equally high quality. Croatia kick-off, playing from right to left in Italian restaurant table-cloth shirts, white shorts and blue socks. Cameroon's players wear green shirts, red shorts and yellow socks. Not long now. The players emerge from the tunnel, with boths sets wearing tracksuit tops over their jerseys. They line up either side of referee Pedro Proenca and his team of match officials. Benoit Assou Ekotto's barnet is looking particularly splendid, despite the best attempts of the humidity to flatten it. Croatia's anthem is played next and at the end of the line of Croatia's line, Ivica Olic is wearing the expression of a man weighing up whether or not to glass somebody he thinks might have spilt his pint. Disciplinary tightrope department: Croatia defenders Vedran Corluka and Dejan Lovren are the only players from either side on yellow cards. ITV are covering this match: Having picked over the bones of Spain's exit from the tournament, they're now previewing England's match against Uruguay tomorrow night. It's almost as if, somehow ... Cameroon v Croatia isn't the main story tonight. Click on the link above to read an absolutely sensational match report from the Maracana written by Sid Lowe. Bear in mind, a tight deadline means he'll have clicked \"send\" on that bad boy as the final whistle blew, while looking over his shoulder for marauding Chileans. Bear that in mind next time you accuse somebody of lazy journalism. A cynic writes: \"Isn’t the scheduling here slightly odd?\" asks Michael Plant. \"Brazil play their second game before Russia and South Korea play their first; now the other Group A game is placed after both Group B games … and Brazil enter their last group game with an extra 27 hours or so of rest over their opponents. Purely coincidental I’m sure.\" Those line-ups again, this time with added substitute clutter Cameroon: 16-Charles Itandje; 2-Benoit Assou Ekotto, 3-Nicholas Nkoulou, 14-Aurelien Chedjou; 17-Stephane Mbia, 21-Joel Matip, 6-Alexandre Song, 18-Enoh Eyong, 8-Benjamin Moukandjo; 10-Vincent Aboubaker, 13-Eric Choupo-Moting Substitutes: 1-Loic Feudjou, 4-Cedric Djeugou, 5-Dany Nounkeu, 7-Landry Nguemo, 9-Samuel Eto'o, 11-Jean Makoun, 12-Henri Bedimo, 15-Achille Webo, 19-Fabrice Olinga, 20-Edgar Salli, 22-Allan Nyom, 23-Sammy Ndjock Croatia: 1-Stipe Pletikosa; 11-Darijo Srna, 3-Danijel Pranjic, 5-Vedran Corluka, 6-Dejan Lovren; 19-Sammir, 18-Ivica Olic, 7-Ivan Rakitic, 10-Luka Modric, 4-Ivan Perisic; 17-Mario Mandzukic Substitutes: 2-Sime Vrsaljko, 8-Ognjen Vukojevic, 9-Nikica Jelavic, 12-Oliver Zelenika, 13-Gordon Schildenfeld, 15-Milan Badelj, 16-Ante Rebic, 14-Marcelo Brozovic, 20-Mateo Kovacic, 21-Domagoj Vida, 22-Eduardo da Silva, 23-Danijel Subasic You join me in exceptionally buoyant mood!

Here's hoping he has a good match tonight, because Croatia could certainly do without getting shafted again. Early team news: Despite early fears that he might have to sit this one out with a foot injury, Croatia midfielder Luka Modric returned to training yesterday after an MRI scan revealed no lasting damage. Left-back Daniel Pjancic is likely to start in place of Sime Vrsaijko, having recovered from the injury that kept him out of the Brazil game. Croatia will also field striker Mario Mandzukic, who returns from suspension, with Nikica Jelavic the man almost certain to make way. In the Cameroon side, Samuel Eto'o seems a certainty to miss out with a knee injury, but will be assessed before the team-sheets are submitted. Fenerbahce striker Pierre Webó is the likely replacement, if Eto'o is not passed fit. How Croatia fared in their opening match:Not too well either, although they were excellent in defeat against a Brazil side that got plenty of help from Japanese referee Yuichi Nishimura, who couldn't have been more of a \"homer\" if he was overweight, worked in a nuclear power plant and was father to children named Bart, Lisa and Maggie. Barney Ronay was in São Paulo for that one and this is how he saw it. How Cameroon fared in their opening match. Not too well. They lost 1-0 against Mexico and could consider themselves lucky to have escaped from Natal with such a slender margin of defeat. Mexico had two perfectly good goals disallowed for offside, while their opponents looked strangely sluggish and subdued. Enrique Gomez braved torrential rain at the Estádio das Runas for the Guardian and you can read his report by clicking on this link. Croatia national anthem: Here's what ABC frontman Martin Fry made of the Croatian effort and his opinion is worth taking on board because (a) he wrote Poison Arrow and The Look of Love and (b) he's one of few men in history who is able to wear a gold lamé suit without looking even remotely ridiculous. \"Lyrically it’s an unapologetic heads up to the glory of the beautiful homeland,\" he says. \"You wouldn’t expect anything less from a national anthem. With instructions to Drava to keep on flowing and the Danube to not lose it’s vigour. A real Croat love fest. What is surprising is the tune. Nothing prepares you for the brazen ferocity of the Croatian anthem. It sounds not unlike a child with a wooden spoon and a biscuit tin followed by a stern beating. Percussion supplied by dustbin lids on boots and sledgehammers. At least it’s mercifully short. It should fire up the team in Brazil. Anything less than victory and Luka Modric will be forced to listen to it repeatedly on the bus home.\" Cameroon national anthem: Steve Harley is best known for his 1975 No1 hit Make Me Smile (Come Up and See Me) and is currently on tour in the UK. Here's what he had to say about the Cameroon national anthem when he asked him for a review. \"Suitably overblown and pompous, this is a proper national anthem,\" he wrote. \"Translated from its native French, the libretto does become a mish-mash of fourth-form poetry ('O Cameroon, cradle of our ancestors/Go, stand, be jealous of your freedom', and other beauties such as, 'May [your children] serve you as their sole purpose/To fulfil their duty forever…'), but given the full-blown orchestral treatment, with percussion, flutes, and horns of every type, played in a marching tempo, all-the-while betraying its French ancestry, it is a really stirring piece. It is musical and charming. Plus, it is short.\" Good evening everybody. Welcome to this evening's minute-by-minute coverage of the crucial Group A clash between Cameroon and Croatia. With both sides having lost their opening games, last night's entertaining stalemate between Brazil and Mexico means that defeat for either team will end their hopes of progressing to the knockout stages. Kick-off in Manaus is at 11pm (BST), but I'll be here with all the team news and build-up for an hour or so before that."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2012/jun/04/countryside-windfarm-bribes-wind-turbines","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-06-04T10:37:25Z","webTitle":"Tory MP calls for countryside windfarm 'bribes'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jun/04/countryside-windfarm-bribes-wind-turbines","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/jun/04/countryside-windfarm-bribes-wind-turbines","fields":{"headline":"Tory MP calls for countryside windfarm 'bribes'","bodyText":"Communities need to be \"bribed\" to accept more windfarms in the countryside, a Conservative MP has said. Tim Yeo, chair of the Commons energy and climate change select committee, said onshore windfarms needed to be encouraged, after it was revealed that the government wants to slash subsidies. \"We do have to work harder to find places where wind turbines are acceptable and be more creative about sharing the benefits with locals,\" Yeo said. \"Frankly, we need to bribe them.\" The Observer revealed on Sunday that the Treasury wants cuts of 25% in subsidies given to onshore turbines, a move critics derided as pandering to the 100 Conservative MPs who demanded cuts from David Cameron in February. The MPs' position has been backed by Lincolnshire county council, which wants to ban wind turbines from being built within 10km of any settlement of 10 or more houses. The council's leader, Martin Hill, told the BBC's Today programme: \"We're not going to say we aren't going to have any more windfarms. But I don't think we want the whole county to be covered by a forest of them.\" Yeo said cutting financial support for windfarms and making them harder to erect did not make economic sense. \"The cost of onshore wind is about half that of offshore wind,\" he said. \"If you want to cut down the cost, slow down the rate of offshore wind development, not onshore.\" Yeo said new nuclear power stations, which he supports, would take a long time to build. \"We can decarbonise now, or much more expensively in the 2020s. Onshore wind is a quick and fairly easy win.\" Subsidies for renewable energy, which the government sees as essential to tackling global warming and securing a sustainable energy supply, are added to home energy bills. These have soared in recent years, mainly due to rises in the global gas prices. Yeo said: \"If we shut down all the onshore wind in the country, families would save just £6 a year.\" A poll for the Independent shows that two-thirds of people in the UK believe more wind turbines is an acceptable price to pay for more green energy. The findings back those of a poll for the Guardian in March, in which 60% of people said they would support new windfarms in their area, compared with 20% for a coal-fired power station and 24% for a new nuclear power station. The Guardian poll also showed the debate had polarised since 2010, with the number of people strongly opposed to windfarms tripling to 21%. Less than 10% of renewable energy in the UK is owned by individuals or communities, compared with over 65% in Germany, where four times as much clean power is produced. Rainer Hinrichs-Rahwles, head of Germany's renewable energy federation, said: \"The UK system excluded those people who would have to see the turbines from their financial benefits.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/poverty-matters/2012/aug/01/india-power-struggle","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2012-08-01T13:11:18Z","webTitle":"India's power struggle | Salil Tripathi","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/aug/01/india-power-struggle","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/aug/01/india-power-struggle","fields":{"headline":"India's power struggle","bodyText":"This week, much of northern India was plunged into darkness for two consecutive days. About 700 million people were left without power, a situation that has affected transport, communication, healthcare, industries, agriculture and everything in between. The outgoing power minister, Sushil Kumar Shinde, blamed a few states for drawing more power than they were entitled to. He didn't name them, but Indian newspapers were less coy, identifying Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana and Jammu Kashmir as the offending areas. The regional grid could not cope with the increased demand, and – because some of the grids are interconnected – the system tripped. The power sector operates as if economic principles don't matter. India primarily depends on coal for its energy needs. It has vast coal reserves, but its extraction rate is inefficient. State-owned Coal India, which controls 80% of production, is required to sell coal to industry at a hugely subsidised rate, considerably below market price, making production uneconomic. Transmission losses are huge: some result from ageing infrastructure, but many are due to electricity theft by politically connected individuals who give away electricity cheaply, or even for free, in return for votes. Customers who fail to pay bills on time – not least state-owned companies – are another culprit. Since 2003, the government has allowed private industry to generate power, but such companies are unable to operate viably since Coal India cannot guarantee a reliable supply. Approximately 55% of India's energy comes from coal, but Coal India's production rose by only 1% last year (well below the expected growth rate). At a time of rapidly growing demand, this has led to increased imports. Private power producers are stuck between a rock and a hard place. Unable to rely on Coal India, they would like to import coal. But it costs a lot more in international markets, and they are prevented from passing costs to consumers. Most Indian consumers pay less for their power than it costs to generate and distribute. Politicians, fearful of the public backlash that has greeted previous price rises, won't increase fuel costs. The conventional wisdom is that parties can win elections by offering cheap electricity. And so the cycle continues. In the past year alone, the gap between demand and supply has grown to 10.2%, up from 7.7% the previous year. In the southern states of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, which are unaffected by the current blackout, companies are investing in diesel-run generators for their own needs, which increases their fuel costs threefold. Fresh investment in coal mining has been difficult for several reasons. India's well-intentioned environmental laws have made prospecting for mines in protected areas more difficult; a Maoist insurgency rages in large parts of central India, including the mineral-rich region, making operations unsafe; and procedures to get capital investment approved are cumbersome and bureaucratic. Alternatives aren't promising. Gas output from the Bay of Bengal has not met its promise. India uses nuclear power, and would like to invest more, but post-Fukushima fears coupled with nimbyism have slowed efforts to build plants. Foreign investment in nuclear power generation is permitted, but investors have been deterred by India's refusal to put a cap on accident liabilities and insistence that equipment suppliers, not plant operators, should be held to account in the event of an accident. In the face of these problems, those who can afford it buy private generators and diesel-powered units to keep their homes and factories running; millions living below or close to the poverty line do not have access to electricity at all. Yet the situation is not altogether bleak. Some states are exploring innovations. As the Wall Street Journal reports, Tamil Nadu may allow a nuclear plant. Bihar is privatising distribution in one large city. In Maharashtra, some consumers can negotiate their tariffs directly with the generator. And Gujarat has not only cracked down on power theft, becoming a surplus state, but also set up a parallel distribution network to sell farmers electricity at competitive prices. By splitting residential and agricultural use, the state has stabilised supply. India needs an estimated $400bn investment in the power sector if it is to meet its development goals. Power failures shave percentage points off the country's's growth, inhibiting development and delaying the time when millions below the poverty line can live a life of dignity. Electricity is vital. It doesn't just keep the plasma TVs working, or the air conditioning humming – it means students in rural India can study at night, medicines and vaccinations don't spoil due to a lack of refrigeration, and food in cold storage doesn't rot. • Salil Tripathi wrote this piece in a personal capacity"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/feb/28/fukushima-visit-full-face-mask","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-02-28T20:05:27Z","webTitle":"Fukushima visit: I wanted to rip my full-face mask off more than once","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/feb/28/fukushima-visit-full-face-mask","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/feb/28/fukushima-visit-full-face-mask","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima visit: I wanted to rip my full-face mask off more than once","bodyText":"It is impossible, on a brief visit, to grasp the scale and complexity of the post-meltdown operation at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant. But entering the ground zero of Japan's nuclear crisis, as the Guardian did on Tuesday, at least means going through the same procedures as the thousands of people who work there every day. The day began with a full-body radiation check at J Village, a training camp for Japan's national football team that is now the logistical hub for a nuclear recovery operation expected to last decades. After issuing our small group of visiting journalists with a clean bill of radioactive health, officials from the Japanese energy firm Tepco showed us how to keep it that way. That meant being covered from head to toe in protective overalls, three pairs of gloves (one cotton, two rubber) and two sets of elasticated shoe covers. The overalls turned out to be liberating compared with the full-face masks that rounded off our list of nuclear prophylactics. The urge to rip mine off came more than once; only the potentially gruesome consequences stopped me. Radiation affects inanimate objects, too, of course. No piece of equipment was allowed to leave the briefing room until it had been swathed in clear plastic, not even the microphones into which masked TV journalists would later shout their pieces to camera. During our short foray outside, notebooks were left on the bus in case they were condemned as low-level nuclear waste. On the 50-minute journey to the plant, on a bus whose interior was an incongruous mix of protective pink plastic and mock chandeliers, radiation monitors bleeped in unison as we drove through hotspots, then fell silent as the hazard passed. The day ended with a second session in the radiation counter. Would the reading be higher than this morning, and if so, by how much? The fear that an official was about to pull me aside and deliver the bad news was mercifully short-lived. Thankfully, I was all clear. A glance at the dosimeter hanging around my neck showed that in the four hours I had spent at Fukushima Daiichi, my body had absorbed a negligible 0.044 millisieverts of radiation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/blog/2013/mar/22/uk-weather-flooding-and-spring-snow-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2013-03-22T16:56:00Z","webTitle":"UK weather: flooding and spring snow ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/blog/2013/mar/22/uk-weather-flooding-and-spring-snow-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/blog/2013/mar/22/uk-weather-flooding-and-spring-snow-live","fields":{"headline":"UK weather: flooding and spring snow","bodyText":"That's it from me for today. Thanks for all the comments and pictures. Wrap up warm ... Here's a round-up of today's weather news: • Rescuers searching for a woman thought to have been trapped in a landslide at her home in Looe, Cornwall, have found a body. The woman, thought to be Susan Norman, was discovered after rescue teams spent the day looking through the wreckage with specialist search dogs. Identification of the body has not yet taken place. It is thought heavy rain triggered the landslide, which engulfed part of the property. • Many parts of Britain have been battered by blizzards, snow and rain – and the cold weather is forecast to continue this weekend. Schools were cancelled and roads were closed across the Midlands, the north-west, and parts of Wales and Scotland. • In Northern Ireland 48,000 homes are still without power this evening after heavy snow and ice brought down power lines mainly in counties Antrim and Down. A World Cup qualifying match between Northern Ireland and Russia meant to be played in Belfast was postponed until tomorrow. • Parts of the Sellafield nuclear power plant in Cumbria were shut down and staff sent home due to the bad weather. • The Environment Agency has issued 80 flood alerts (\"flooding is possible\") - mostly in the south east and south west - and 12 flood warnings (\"flooding is expected – immediate action required\") - all of them in the south west. • The Met Office’s weather warnings show amber snow warnings (“be prepared”) for Wales, the north-west, and parts of the west and east Midlands, as well as south-west Scotland and the east of Northern Ireland. The Met Office has issued an amber rain warning for Cornwall. The less serious yellow warnings (“be aware”) for snow are in place for the whole of Northern Ireland, plus a large strip covering much of the the west of England, Wales and Scotland from London to the Isle of Mull, and the east coast of Scotland too. The whole of the south-west and most of south Wales gets a yellow rain warning. The snow warnings cover much the same area for tomorrow too. Rescuers searching for a woman who was trapped under a landslide at her property in Looe, Cornwall, have found a body in the wreckage, Cornwall Fire and Rescue Service have said. The \"site status\" of Sellafield nuclear power station has now \"returned to normal\", a spokesperson has said: Following on from a site incident being declared at Sellafield earlier today, we can now confirm that the site status has returned to normal. As a precautionary measure, the site emergency control centre will remain manned and operational to deal with any issues arising due to continuing adverse weather conditions. All plants remain in a steady, controlled, safe state and safe manning levels continue to be maintained. There is some dispute on Twitter about what season we are currently enjoying. This plaintive tweet compares today's temperatures with those of 22 March 2012. I just had a look back at my emails from 22 March 2012. They were all about nice weather, picnics, games of frisbee, buying shares in sun tan lotion, and so on. So, yes, Michael, it looks like it really was ... Food supplies are being airlifted to the Isle of Man as the severe weather disrupts scheduled ferry services, the Press Association reports. A spokeswoman for the Weather Channel has been in touch, and she has some bad news: this weekend is forecast to be one of the coldest March weekends since 1962. “There is no sign of warmer weather as we near the Easter weekend and move into spring,” she adds. “There is more snow on the way and parts of the Midlands and east Wales could see 20-40cm over the highest ground.” It’s 20 degrees colder than this time last year, and about 10-12C colder than normal. It will stay mainly dry next week so there will be no more heavy snowfalls, she says, just lighter showers, but some temperatures could reach -10C. Happy Easter ... The Arctic-like conditions are now impacting on ambulance services in Northern Ireland, reports Henry McDonald. The Northern Ireland ambulance service say they are experiencing delays responding to an already high number of emergency calls. A spokesperson said calls are being responded to but delays are inevitable and may continue for up to 36 hours. \"In order to ensure that those most seriously ill or injured patients receive the most timely response, NIAS would ask the public to call 999 only when absolutely necessary for the duration of this period of bad weather,\" they said. The Northern Ireland v Russia game has been postponed until tomorrow due to the weather. Kathy Maskell, a weather expert from the University of Reading, has been in touch to discuss whether a cold snap like this really is unusual for March. Maskell, who works for the university’s Walker Institute for Climate System Research, said: The low temperatures we've experienced this March would have seemed quite normal to people over the first half of the 20th century, but we've seen a gradual rise in typically March temperatures for East Berkshire (and for most land areas of the world), particularly over the last 30 years. It's likely that some of the warming in the UK over the last 100 years is because of increasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, but natural variations in temperature in the North Atlantic Ocean have probably played a part in the rapid warming of about 1C in the March temperature over the last 30 years. However, this March in the UK definitely bucks the long term warming trend and seems all the more chilly as a result. Is the weather – like everything else – worse under the coalition? Simon Rogers finds out. Firefighters have said they believe Susan Norman is inside the collapsed building in Looe. Dave King from Cornwall Fire and Rescue Service said: \"Crews have now been able to go safely into the building. Early investigations suggest that she [Ms Norman] is in there.\" Here’s another round-up from around the country: • West Midlands: Nearly 230 schools closed today, many reporting burst pipes and frozen heating systems. Staffordshire was the worst hit, with 170 closing their doors, but there was also disruption in Walsall, Dudley and Wolverhampton. • Birmingham: Melting snow flooded the St Chad's Queensway tunnel, shutting the road and leaving traffic backed up along main routes into the city centre. Engineers spent all morning trying to pump the water back out of the tunnel. • North Wales: Nearly 200 schools are closed as a result of heavy snow, including 61 in the Wrexham area. Flintshire was also badly affected. At the Sellafield nuclear power plant in Cumbria, staff have been sent home early due to the bad weather. The operation of the site was not affected, but some parts of the site were shut down. A spokesman said: In response to the current and predicted adverse weather conditions on and around the Sellafield site, as a precaution, a site incident has been declared and the plants on the site have been moved to a controlled, safe, shutdown state. The site emergency control centre has been established and is managing the incident in line with well-rehearsed procedures. We have implemented a phased early release of staff from the site. This will be carried out in a safe, controlled manner. There is no reason to believe that there will be any off-site nuclear, environmental or conventional safety issues associated with the incident. The priority for the team is to protect our workforce, the community and the environment. In other sports news ... As mentioned earlier, Northern Ireland's crucial World Cup qualifier against Russia at Windsor Park is in doubt due to the snow in Belfast, which would be a first in Irish international football history, Henry McDonald reports. No Northern Ireland games have ever been called because of the weather. An Irish Football Association statement said: \"The referee will inspect the pitch at 10am this morning as part of his normal duty. We will keep you updated throughout the day.\" Ground staff are clearing the snow off the pitch but more is expected to fall before tonight's 7.45pm kick-off. Windsor Park is among the more basic grounds in international football and it does not have much in the way of defences to the elements. Groundsmen have been joined by local volunteers in their efforts to clear the snow and city council staff have been involved in gritting the approaches to the ground. If the match is postponed it would be rearranged for Saturday. Meanwhile it really is a case of a tale of two cities when it comes to the weather in Northern Ireland today. Derry has escaped most of the snow, unlike Belfast. However our journey here was severely delayed due to that rumoured snow on the Glenshane Pass, which snow ploughs finally cleared shortly after noon. The Battle of Towton has been cancelled, reports Maev Kennedy - or rather the annual commemoration on the field of the bloodiest battle on English soil, which contemporary accounts say left ditches clogged with Lancastrian and Yorkist bodies and streams running scarlet. This would have been a rare year when the commemoration coincided with the actual day of the battle, Palm Sunday. In 1461 the two armies fought for ten hours in a blizzard, and this year months of rain and snow have left the site completely waterlogged. The Towton Battlefield Societyhas sadly announced: \"The weather forecast shows no sign of any improvement so we have decided that for safety’s sake we should cancel the event.\" Downing Street has been trying to allay people's fears that the cold snap could lead to Britain's gas supplies running out next month, forcing the nation to pay higher prices for fuel from elsewhere. A No 10 spokesman said: The absolute key thing on this is that supplies are not running out. The gas market is how we source our supplies and that market continues to function well. The prime minister's key concern is that gas supplies continue. It is absolutely clear that supplies are not running out. Asked if the prime minister was confident that this would remain the case, the spokesman replied: \"Absolutely confident.\" Reader Freja Swogger sends this picture showing 25cm of snow in Wrexham, north Wales. Police are using a sniffer dog to search for the woman missing after her house in Looe, Cornwall partially collapsed during heavy rainfall. Thermal imaging cameras used to identify signs of life proved inconclusive. Neighbours said they heard \"windows popping\" at the three-storey property under the pressure of a torrent of surface water that had been washed down the road behind the building, which is split into three flats and named Veronica. Graham Claybourn of Devon and Cornwall police said Susan Norman lived in the ground-floor flat, and had returned from a trip yesterday evening: The woman was away but returned last night at about 6pm. There are no other suggestions where she might be - she might be in there [the property] … She was last heard from yesterday evening. If we think she's in there our duty will be to make the premises secure and safe. The fire service said it was too dangerous to enter. We cannot put anybody at risk - at the moment it is too dangerous for anyone else to go in. He added: \"Our priority is to find the lady. If we cannot account for her, she will turn into a missing person.\" The property is one of a number of detached homes along the road, overlooking a sheer drop to the picturesque Looe Valley branch line. Sandplace Road, which runs along the entrance to the properties, has been closed to traffic for months after a landslide nearby just before Christmas. The road running along the back of the homes, a main road into Looe, was said to have been carrying excess surface water caused by a combination of heavy rainfall and uncleared drains, the Press Association reported. This map shows where Sandplace Road is. Pete Temlett, a retired police officer, said he was woken in the night by the young man who lives in the top-floor flat: He was obviously in a state of shock and said his house had collapsed and he had to escape. I immediately got dressed and went down to the house with him, but I could see it could collapse at any moment. The windows were popping out and you could see the house was moving. My immediate thought was for the safety of the woman who lives in the bottom flat, but I couldn't go in there. I thought if I open a door it could collapse and cause her more injury. The Environment Agency has issued 76 flood alerts (\"flooding is possible\") - mostly in the south east and south west - and 15 flood warnings (\"flooding is expected – immediate action required\") - all of them in the south west. A slight thaw in Belfast is producing floods in the east of the city, reports Henry McDonald en route from Belfast to Derry. There are reports that heavy flooding is also affecting the Albertbridge Road in east Belfast, at its junction with the Ravenhill Road, which has caused a long delay to motorists heading into the city centre from the Newtownards Road. Meanwhile there are rumours via Twitter that the Glenshane Pass - the mountain road between Derry and Belfast - is now blocked – which is bad news for this passenger as he travels by coach from Belfast up to Northern Ireland's second city. On both sides of the main motorway at present the countryside is blanketed in snow but speed has been restricted to 40mph. Crosswinds are making this Translink double-decker feel like a flight experiencing turbulence. Which the nice newlywed couple from Derry at the back of the coach upstairs will be used to; they have been travelling by plane from the Caribbean to New York and on to Dublin Airport for 28 hours following their honeymoon. Here’s a round-up of some of the weather news from around the country: • Lancashire: Snow has led to 20 school closures with west Lancashire, Pendle and Lancaster particularly badly affected. • Cumbria: Some 36 schools have shut due to poor weather conditions. The A686 at Hartside is closed, as is the A66 at Stainmore. The A595 and A5092 towards Millom is inaccessible and the M6 from Hackthorpe to Shap is passable with care. The A66 across the Pennines to Cumbria was closed in both directions. • Peak District: The Woodhead Pass on the A628 is closed in both directions. • Northern Ireland: More than 44,000 homes and businesses, mostly in the south and east of the province but also on the north coast, have been left without power after being battered by snow, sleet and storm-force winds overnight. More than 70 schools were forced to shut. Northern Ireland's World Cup football qualifying fixture against Russia tonight is in doubt, and may have to be played tomorrow instead. Police investigating whether a woman is trapped inside a house in Cornwall after part of the property collapsed say Susan Norman, who is in her 60s, has not been seen or heard of since 6pm yesterday, reports Steven Morris. Her house in Looe, south Cornwall, was hit by a landslide and floodwater this morning. More than dozen people living in the street have been evacuated. Police were using a sniffer dog to search for Ms Norman in the wreckage. A spokesman said it was likely to be a slow and laborious process. In north Cornwall a woman suffered life-threatening injuries when she was thrown from a VW Polo and ended up under a van. The accident happened in driving rain on the A13 near Kilkhampton on Friday morning.

The Met Office’s weather warnings show amber snow warnings (“be prepared”) for Wales, the north-west, and parts of the west and east Midlands, as well as south-west Scotland and the east of Northern Ireland. The Met Office has issued an amber rain warning for Cornwall. The less serious yellow warnings (“be aware”) for snow are in place for the whole of Northern Ireland, plus a large strip covering much of the the west of England, Wales and Scotland from London to the Isle of Mull, and the east coast of Scotland too. The whole of the south-west and most of south Wales gets a yellow rain warning. The snow warnings cover much the same area for tomorrow too.

More than 40,000 homes in Northern Ireland are without electricity this morning after arctic conditions descended on the province, reports Henry McDonald. Heavy snowfalls and winds of up to 50 mph brought down power lines over night in counties Antrim and Down. One of the casualties of the snow and high winds has been Belfast's Lyric Theatre, which is without power and had to cancel an event scheduled for today. Seventy schools have also been closed in eastern counties and at least seven rural roads have been cut off due to snow and fallen trees. Northern Ireland Electricity said the damage to power supplies was concentrated in southern and eastern areas. \"Damage has been caused by flying debris and high winds, including broken electricity lines and damage to poles and other equipment,\" NIE said. \"There may also be further faults which have not yet been reported to Northern Ireland Electricity and the adverse weather conditions, which could cause additional faults, are continuing. \"Customers who contact NIE by phone should listen fully to the recorded telephone messages which will provide the best and latest information available.\" Both airports in Belfast remain open but the George Best City Airport's runway was closed for a time earlier this morning. A woman is unaccounted for in Looe, Cornwall, after a block of flats partially collapsed following a landslide at the rear of the property, reports my colleague Steven Morris. Residents have been evacuated from half a dozen other properties in the same street as a precaution. More details soon ... Reader Ray Adams sends this picture from Eastwood in Nottinghamshire. Reader Zoey sends this picture of a cold and windy Coventry. Good morning. It’s 22 March, the third day of spring, and Britain faces a day of heavy snow, blizzard conditions and flooding. We’ll be covering it live throughout the day here. Already more flooding is expected in the south-west due to heavy rain yesterday and overnight. The Environment Agency has 18 flood alerts in place along the south-west coast warning of expected flooding, with a further 80 alerts issued to areas at risk. And snow is expected to hit everywhere north of the M4 motorway west of London, with the north-west, north Wales and south-west Scotland worst affected. In Northern Ireland, heavy rain is expected to turn to up to 30cm (12in) of snow across the hills of Down and Antrim, while on the east coast rain and sleet could cause localised flooding. Cold gale-force winds will sweep across the country creating blizzard conditions and temperatures are expected to fall well below freezing. The Met Office has issued a number of severe weather warnings urging the public to be prepared for \"severe disruption\" to transport and energy services. Tell us what’s happening where you live.

But his words about \"our full share of waste management and disposal costs\" were carefully chosen. The consultation document reveals that EDF considers their full share of these costs to be around 20% of the total. As our report Nuclear Power? No Point! highlighted last year, nuclear is only responsible for 4% of the energy consumed in the UK. More energy can be saved by energy conservation measures in homes and businesses. Focusing on the nuclear industry takes resources away from building new renewable capacity, which, given sufficient political will, could provide more than enough electricity for the UK. Darren Johnson Green party spokesperson on Trade and Industry • EDF's claim that they \"have not asked for subsidy for new nuclear\" is not all that it seems. The nuclear industry, owned by British Energy (in turn owned by EDF), will be receiving huge sums of windfall profits under government proposals for a floor price on carbon emission allowances. British Energy will greatly expand its profits for no increase in nuclear power production, all subsidised by electricity consumers. Based on Royal Academy of Engineering analysis (a pro-nuclear source) a carbon floor price of £30 per tonne is likely to lead to electricity price increases of around 2.5p/Kwh. Given that British Energy produces (according to their website) around 50 TWh per year, this would give them annual windfall profits of around £1.25bn a year. Many argue that the \"floor price\" would have to be higher than this to make new nuclear power stations profitable. A floor price of £50 per tonne would give EDF windfall profits (at 50 TWh a year) of over £2bn a year. Indeed British Energy and EDF are already receiving hundreds of millions of pounds a year of subsidy by another name through existing levels of carbon prices. Dr David Toke Senior lecturer in energy policy, University of Birmingham • Paul Spence's defence of new nuclear power stations based on the assertion that they won't be a financial burden to the public ignores the taxpayer's liability in the event of a \"new Chernobyl\". No insurance company will offer cover for such an event or the consequences of a terrorist attack or any other less serious but still unquantifiable risk. In its determination to sanction new nuclear power plants, the government is underwriting these risks; without such an undertaking no commercial company would even contemplate building a new nuclear power station.

Just off one of the platforms, between the standard-class waiting room and a cleaners' storeroom, and set back behind three successive doors, it was small and plain: a desk, a grimy extractor fan and two windows made opaque to passing travellers by reflective material. Tony Blair used this room when he was prime minister. His constituency, Sedgefield in County Durham, was a short drive away. When he needed to get to London, 260 miles south, he and his entourage would often catch the fast Darlington train, which can take less than two and a half hours. More usefully still, many other key New Labour figures took the same line, among them Peter Mandelson, Alan Milburn and David Miliband. Altogether, the north-east of England, which contains about a 25th of the UK population, was represented by \"a third of Blair's first cabinet\", noted the veteran anatomist of British power networks, Anthony Sampson, in 2004. (Sampson was himself born in County Durham.) Rarely before had our remotest and often poorest region been such a hub of political influence. When Blair arrived early or his train arrived late, it was felt by Whitehall that the increasingly controversial premier could not just stand on a platform, waiting. Hence the secret room. Now, it is just the station manager's office. The building around it has gone back to being a market town station with flaking paint and a fragile roof, where isolated passenger footsteps echo in the long middle-of-the-day lull and trains for Scotland and the south of England rattle through without stopping. No current cabinet minister has a north-east seat – only two of its MPs are Tories. Labour's power base is now in London, Yorkshire and the north-west. Since the Blair era, the area has slipped in other ways. Between 2007 and 2012, unemployment rose faster than in any other UK region, to more than 10%, the highest in the country. Throughout 2013, as joblessness receded in most of the UK, in the north-east it carried on rising. This year, it has begun to fall a little but remains the worst in the nation. Since 2007, the area's contribution to national economic growth, measured as gross value added, has shrunk from an already weak 3% in the Blair years to barely 2%. The Northern Rock building society, with roots in the region going back a century and a half, has suffered a humiliating meltdown. The north-east has been, and will probably continue to be, especially harshly treated by the coalition's spending cuts. According to the Special Interest Group of Municipal Authorities, a typical council in the region will lose £665 in government funding per inhabitant between 2010 and 2018, the biggest national fall. Meanwhile, public sector employment in the region – the highest in England at more than one job in five – has been falling since 2009, a year before the coalition took office. At Newcastle United, one of the north-east's disproportionate number of fiercely followed, rarely successful football clubs, the recent sponsorship of the team shirt tells a similarly dispiriting story: Northern Rock from 2003-2011; Virgin Money, Northern Rock's current, Edinburgh-based owners, from 2012- 2013; this season, the payday loan company Wonga. Between 2011 and 2012, child poverty rates in Middlesbrough and Newcastle Central rose to 40% and 38% respectively. \"For as long as anyone alive will remember, this has been a 'problem region': a special case, a sick man,\" wrote the Newcastle-born novelist Richard T Kelly in a 2011 essay, What's Left For The North-East? In recent years, some rightwingers have begun to throw up their hands. \"It is at least as hard to buck geography as it is to buck the market,\" said the influential Tory thinktank Policy Exchange in 2008. \"It is time to stop pretending that there is a bright future for Sunderland.\" And last year the Tory peer Lord Howell suggested the region had \"large uninhabited and desolate areas… where there's plenty of room for fracking\". Weeks later, the Economist described Middlesbrough and Hartlepool as part of \"Britain's rust belt\"; \"Despite dollops of public money and years of heroic effort… [these] former industrial heartlands are quietly decaying.\" The magazine concluded with an unlikely but ominous comparison: \"The Cotswolds were the industrial engines of their day. One reason they are now so pretty is that, centuries ago, huge numbers of people fled them.\" From Darlington, an old and scuzzy two-carriage train chugs east along a branch line towards Middlesbrough. Along the way, it stops at Thornaby-on-Tees, an ex-industrial town beside the river Tees. From the 1840s until the 1980s, the Head Wrightson ironworks here made everything from parts for bridges to parts for nuclear power stations; then foreign competition closed it. In 1987, Margaret Thatcher visited the site and took a much-photographed walk across a yellowing wasteland of weeds and factory remnants, wearing an inappropriate smart suit but looking unusually pensive. Shortly afterwards, her government, seeking to soften its reputation as the hammer of the north, created the Teesside Development Corporation, and the wasteland was turned into the Teesdale Business Park, a US-style landscape of corporate lawns, car parks and low office blocks. The blocks are still there, neat and anonymous except for the corporate logos: Barclaycard, the NHS, the privatised services firm Serco. The car parks are full of mid-range vehicles. For three decades, the north-east has been a centre for modestly paid clerical work, such as call centres and the \"back office\" administrative processes of companies based elsewhere. But at the Teesdale Business Park, \"To Let\" is the most common logo; some are so old, they have rotted and snapped off. As with Thornaby, Middlesbrough is a flat riverside town that once grew fast because of iron foundries: from only 25 inhabitants in 1801 to 165,000 in the 1960s. The Victorian centre was built to a grid pattern, like a US boom town, with docks just to the north for exporting iron and coal. But in 1980 the docks closed, the population began to fall, and a void opened between the town and the river. It is still there, starting a few yards from the town centre; a great windswept triangle of rubble and rust, boarded-up houses, Dickensian wall fragments and roads to nowhere. Derelict waterfront warehouses stand in the distance. A middle-aged security man in a peeling wood cabin guards them. \"There's lots of steel cable in those sheds,\" he says. \"And lots of people try to steal it.\" When asked how long it has been so run-down, he shrugs and says without emotion: \"As long as I can remember.\" The town's population is around 138,000. To a visitor, the long, straight streets of the town centre seem eerily empty of pedestrians. At the sizable railway station, the weekday rush hour sometimes barely exists: at 8.30 on a Friday morning, I counted fewer than a dozen other people on the platforms. The station cafe had not bothered to open. \"If things carry on as they are now,\" says Alex Niven, a leftwing writer from Northumberland, \"in five years the situation will get somewhere like Detroit.\" Several other authorities in the north-east that I interviewed invoked the long-imploding American city, unprompted. He left the area 10 years ago, aged 18, and now lives in London. \"Almost all my friends from school live in London now. When you go back to the north-east, the landscape's kind of crumbling. There is this sort of sadness. It feels like a people who've been weakened, who've just been cut loose.\" Geography does not help. \"The north-east is at the far corner of the country, but it is separated by more than just miles,\" writes Harry Pearson, born near Middlesbrough, in his 1994 book The Far Corner. \"There is the wilderness of the Pennines to the west, the emptiness of the North York Moors to the south, and to the north, the Scottish border… Sometimes the north-east [seems] more like an island than a region.\" It is an island that the HS2 rail project is not currently intended to reach. Meanwhile, the prospect of Scottish independence and the near-certainty of more Scottish devolution threatens to marginalise the region further. \"Scotland can already do more to attract inward investment than we can,\" says Chi Onwurah, Labour MP for Newcastle Central. \"More power for Scotland, in that sense, would not be a benefit for us.\" Pinned to a board in her constituency office is a list of Newcastle food banks. Outside, contrastingly, the grand city centre streets are much busier than in Middlesbrough, full of prosperously dressed people and big branches of the same upmarket chainstores as in richer places. \"Newcastle is the economic capital of the north-east,\" she says, \"but the centre, especially, is not representative of the region.\" A few minutes' walk farther out, cheap cafes offer soup of the day for a pound, and other scruffy businesses have long ceased to offer anything. \"Every time I see a building boarded up,\" Onwurah says, \"it strikes fear into my heart.\" Onwurah grew up on a Newcastle council estate in the 60s and 70s. It was then a smoky, clattering centre for shipbuilding and other heavy industry, but these were in terminal decline. In 1984, she left to study electrical engineering, then worked away from Newcastle for a quarter of a century, until she was elected as MP in 2010. In the interim, the city reshaped its economy around tourism and nightlife, as an internationally hyped \"party city\"; around sport, with the 90s resurgence of Newcastle United; and around culture, with the opening in Gateshead of the Baltic art gallery in 2002 and the Sage music centre in 2004. \"It was a very heady time,\" says Niven, who supports Newcastle United and as a teenager often travelled into the city from rural Northumberland. \"The north-east has a brash, confident side. There's also often a sense of slumbering potential, that one day a messiah or a revival will come.\" In the 90s and noughties, optimism was most concrete along the river Tyne, which separates Gateshead and Newcastle. Decaying canyons of quayside buildings filled with flash new bars, expensive flats, high-end office space and public art. It was easy to visit Newcastle – which I often did then – and think it was becoming a swaggering, economically self-sufficient provincial city, such as those you find in less centralised countries: another Marseille or Hamburg. The quaysides are slightly less uplifting now. On the Newcastle side, several bars have shut down. Bridge Court, an enormous, empty office block, has a plaque that reads, \"The foundation stone was laid by Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, on 22 September 1994\"; another sign says, \"Demolition. Keep Out\". Niven sees the north-east's revival under the Blair government as \"largely superficial. In the long term, it didn't lead to better jobs and infrastructure. You can't base the revival of a region on nightlife and football.\" Onwurah, whose grandfather worked in the shipyards and whose mother grew up on the quayside, is less scathing: \"Labour did a lot in the north-east, to stop the concentration of economic power elsewhere getting much worse, but we didn't overcome the underlying issue. We haven't got the previous sources of economic growth. And we haven't got enough skills and entrepreneurs.\" A successful region, she says, has a \"critical mass\" economically. \"If you don't have critical mass, to attract people and investment, you go into decline. We're on the edge of that.\" She holds up her hands and makes a flat, wobbling gesture: \"We're teetering.\" In Middlesbrough, the riverside wasteland has been earmarked for regeneration – as a new area called Middlehaven – for almost 30 years. Recessions, anxious developers and the town's wider economic struggles have confined most construction to the area's fringe. Yet there is one exception: an incongruous silvery curve of a building in the centre of the emptiness. Middlesbrough College opened in 2008; it houses engineering workshops, training kitchens, hair and beauty salons, and other vocational course facilities for 16- to 18-year-olds. In 2011, it was rated \"good with outstanding features\" by Ofsted. Walking down the college's bright and warm internal street, seconds after being out in the dereliction, and seeing students at work in the glass-walled rooms or rushing back and forth, it seems absurd to think that Middlesbrough does not have a long-term future. But in the window of the in-house Jobs Shop, only half a dozen positions are offered. One is at a local seaside care home for the elderly: the successful applicant will earn £107.20 for a 40-hour week. Further education is one of the north-east's few growth industries. \"Without it, I dread to think what some of the cities would be doing,\" says Andy Pike, director of Newcastle University's Centre for Urban and Regional Development Studies. \"A lot of people want to come and study in the north-east\" – academic standards are high, living costs low and the nightlife boisterous. But, Pike adds, \"We have a problem with graduate retention: not as many stay as could do. It's a thin labour market. The people who stay typically will not end up in graduate jobs. And then local non-graduates will be bumped out of the labour market altogether.\" In the north-east, the increasingly de-skilled, low-paid labour market of Britain under the coalition is at its meanest. Full-time wages are the lowest of any UK region. In 2007, the Middlesbrough Institute of Modern Art, or Mima, cheekily echoing New York's Moma gallery, opened on a redeveloped square in the town centre. It looks the part: slick, glassy exterior; high-ceilinged interior; dozens of attentive young staff in Mima T-shirts. It offers an ambitious programme of community events and exhibitions – currently, Art And Optimism In 1950s Britain. Yet a gallery cannot make a town centre vibrant by itself. On Thursday evenings, it opens late, but on the Thursday I visited I saw four other visitors in half an hour. Since the 1930s, governments have tested regeneration projects in the region. Edward Twiddy is one of the latest reformers to be despatched from London. Since 2012, he has been head of the North-East Local Enterprise Partnership (Nelep), a typically optimistic coalition creation, which aims to get business and local councils – almost all Labour – to work together for the area's economic benefit. Twiddy previously worked at the Treasury and for the Foreign Office in Iraq. He is slight and cerebral-looking, and speaks mostly in fluent Whitehall jargon. \"The region's still going through some fairly big structural changes,\" he tells me. \"The north-east was over-specialised – in coal, for example. Nowadays, people need to be able to approach life differently. You've got to be able to travel, to be competitive… Economic activity will move [away] if you cannot convince the market that yours is the right place to work.\" But even Twiddy is off: he is set to leave Nelep for Atom, a new digital bank to be based \"in the north-east\". I ask how many staff Nelep has. Twiddy pauses: \"The core is four. Then there are people doing discrete pieces of work for us, people loaned to us, people I've scrabbled around for, got a few pennies for… There are about 11 or 12 of us in all.\" Nelep replaced One North-East, a regional development agency created by the Blair government that had 400 staff. Yet there is a more economically independent side to the region. A few miles east of the centre of Newcastle, a side road leads steeply downhill to a half-hidden stretch of the Tyne. In the early 1980s, the quays here were a rotting ladder of derelict docks and slipways. Then two local property developers, Freddy and Bruce Shepherd, began to buy the land, clean it up, reuse the old cranes and rent out the quaysides: first to companies involved in North Sea oil, then to others involved in undersea cable-laying and offshore wind power. Shepherd Offshore now stretches along the Tyne for miles. In its riverside boardroom, with giant reels of cable as tall as tugboats looming outside the windows, Twiddy makes the introductions over coffee served in Versace mugs. The Shepherds are heavyset men with fierce handshakes and slightly loose tongues. \"We are the raggy end of the couch up here in the north-east,\" Bruce says. Freddy interjects: \"We get nothing easy. Not off the government. Without us, there would be nothing here but two abandoned shipyards.\" \"Up and down the river, we're close knit,\" Bruce says. \"There are more than 2,500 jobs. We're a manufacturing base. We train people. But we're forgotten down here.\" How many jobs were there in the days of the shipyards? \"Six and a half thousand,\" Freddy says. \"I was an apprentice in the shipyard here. You're never going to get back to those numbers.\" Bruce offers a tour of the quay in his spotless Range Rover. As we drive, he points out other cars parked nose to tail at the roadside: \"There's never enough parking. The number of people working here keeps growing.\" We leave the road and enter a muddy construction site, scheduled to house a new national research centre for offshore and undersea technology, a collaboration between the Shepherds, Newcastle city council and Newcastle University. Bruce ploughs through puddles, his property developer's patter in full flow, then stops his spattered Range Rover at a fence that faces the famous old Swan Hunter shipyard. It is still a wasteland, but new developments are encroaching from all directions. Another sign of entropy reversed would be to attract more southerners; not just to study but to work. Twiddy is one. Tony Trapp is another. Raised in London, he has been one of the area's handful of legendary entrepreneurs since the 70s. Then, he helped invent an undersea plough for laying seabed pipes and cables by driving a specially adapted tractor up and down a beach in Northumberland. Several companies and clever products later, he now runs Osbit Power, which makes self-stabilising gangways to connect offshore wind turbines to maintenance vessels. The enterprise is based in a previously derelict hotel in sweeping Northumberland countryside. Behind its unkempt walls, purposeful-looking young employees cluster at desks or in front of whiteboards, while Trapp, a creased man of 68 with a murmuring voice but an intoxicating can-do aura, briefs them and holds court. \"I've always based my businesses on clever graduates,\" he says later. \"I've taken on hundreds, some from Newcastle University, from Northumbria University. For offshore engineering, the north-east is the best place in Europe.\" But in other ways he sees the local economy as still underpowered. \"Persuading clever people from the south to come here is quite hard. It's not just the image they have of the north-east – it does have the worst statistics, in health, in booze… If you look at many CEOs of big companies here, they don't live up here. They live in Surrey, London. It's insulting, in a way.\" For a second, he looks his age. \"I don't have the solution to the north-east.\" It is not Twiddy's job to voice such doubts. Instead, he takes me to the coast, not far from where Trapp tested his undersea plough. It is a brilliant blue day, and the often luminous north-east light is at its most seductive. We drive into the small town of Blyth, where there has been a port since the 12th century, which suggests the region has more staying power than the doom-mongers claim. We approach a cluster of shiny, towering blue-grey sheds, where the National Renewable Energy Centre tests blades for offshore wind farms. In December, the government increased its subsidy for this source of electricity, a rare gift from Whitehall to the north-east in the age of austerity. Twiddy sounds like a small boy for a moment: \"The crane for lifting the blades is just amazing!\" We walk to one of the windowless sheds. Inside, spot-lit, suspended above an expanse of polished concrete floor, a single pale grey blade, with weights and cables attached to it, flexes slowly up and down, vast and stately as the tail of a whale. The only sound is the hum of the air-conditioning. In a space the size of a small cathedral, but clean and tidy as a science lab, only two employees are visible: distant, purposeful figures in dust coats. Working here looks much better than working in a chilly shipyard, a call centre or a nightclub, or for most of the region's previous economic saviours. But Mill says the centre has a staff of 69. The north-east will need an awful lot more workplaces like it this if it is going to stop teetering."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/live/2015/may/05/election-2015-live-nick-clegg-boost-campaign-final-48-hours","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2015-05-05T21:01:01Z","webTitle":"Election 2015 live:  Miliband reveals first coalition red line to scrap non-dom tax status","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2015/may/05/election-2015-live-nick-clegg-boost-campaign-final-48-hours","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/live/2015/may/05/election-2015-live-nick-clegg-boost-campaign-final-48-hours","fields":{"headline":"Election 2015 live:  Miliband reveals first coalition red line to scrap non-dom tax status","bodyText":"Echoing scenes from Challenge Anneka, Britain’s political leaders scrambled themselves across the length and breadth of the country in planes, trains and automobiles as they entered the last 48 hours of the election campaign. The prime minister is currently on a non-stop 36-hour tour of the UK, which will see him talking to nightshift workers as he campaigns through the small hours, while Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg is embarking on a 1,000-mile two-day battlebus odyssey from Land’s End to John O’Groats. Ed Miliband was in Bedfordshire and North Warwickshire, while Ukip’s Nigel Farage was in Ramsgate and the Green’s Natalie Bennett was in Cambridge. The big picture While we could easily have predicted to see plenty of babies kissed, sleeves rolled up, thumbs flicked to the sky and hard hats donned, we could be forgiven for presuming in the last 48 hours that none of the country’s politicians would “commit news”. But rather than stick to the safety of photo ops in the final throes of the election campaign, the parliamentary hopefuls did quite the opposite. Nick Clegg issued a warning over the prospect of a second election before Christmas, a Ukip candidate was suspended for a foul-mouthed rant and Ed Miliband revealed a so-called red line over scrapping the non-dom rule and in doing so acknowledged for the first time he might not seal a majority. Who knows what tomorrow might bring? What happened today A list of “very, highly or extremely controversial” potential cuts to benefits have been drawn up by civil servants in response to warnings that the next government would struggle to keep welfare spending below a legal cap of about £120bn a year. Nick Clegg raised questions on Tuesday about the stability of any post-election deal with the Conservatives, saying he would never be a party to a government that recommended withdrawal from the EU. The Lib Dem leader said: “I would never, of course, accept being part of a government that advocated withdrawal from the European Union”. A second election before Christmas is inevitable unless the Liberal Democrats become part of a government in the event of a hung parliament after 7 May, Nick Clegg has said. Nicola Sturgeon has warned that the next British government could be illegitimate if it fails to include “Scottish voices” as she stepped up demands for a post-election deal with Labour. The Scottish National party leader told a rally in Dumfries on Monday that it would be wrong for it to be made up solely of English MPs, hinting that she expects David Cameron’s Tories to win the most seats in Thursday’s election. A Ukip parliamentary candidate has been suspended after saying he would shoot his Tory rival if he ever became prime minister, the party has said. In an expletive-laden rant, Robert Blay said the Conservative party’s candidate Ranil Jayawardena was “not British enough to be in our parliament” and accused him of timing the birth of his child to coincide with the general election. The Conservatives have raised 10 times more in donations than Labour in the final week of the general election campaign, official figures showed on Tuesday. David Cameron’s party received £1.36m, while Ed Miliband’s campaign gained £131,242, according to the final list of contributions released by the Electoral Commission. The Evening Standard has urged Londoners to vote Conservative in Thursday’s general election. The newspaper is following in the footsteps of its stablemate the Independent, which on Tuesday morning stunned many by announcing its support of a continuation of the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition. Laugh of the day My hasn’t he grown? ITV Meridian scored an absolute winner when they discovered a 24-year-old clip of a lean and youthful Ed Miliband - or Ted Miliband as he was known back then - leading a rent strike on behalf of Oxford students in the spring of 1991. Quote of the day I feel like the British public will go through as many Milibands as they can til they get to on that they like. So, I dunno how many more of the brothers there are but I’m sure if the British public continues to meet more and more Milibands they’ll find one that they deem appropriate. US comedian Jon Stewart gave a brief but typically sardonic take on the UK election for Channel 4 News, in which he predicted England will “secede itself” and praised Cameron and Miliband for “lowering expectations”, further underlining how much he will be missed when he leaves the Daily Show in August. Hero of the day Roland Emmerich’s upcoming sequel to Independence Day will be getting a female president in the shape of Sela Ward. Ward, best known for big-screen roles in The Fugitive and Gone Girl, will be playing the character of President Lanford. I accept Lanford is a fictional political character, but presuming the film will end with the world being saved, most likely by her, then her selection seems fair. Villain of the day Ukip parliamentary candidate Robert Blay was suspended after saying he would shoot his Tory rival if he ever became prime minister. In an expletive-laden rant, Blay says the Tory party’s candidate Ranil Jayawardena was “not British enough to be in our parliament”. Tomorrow’s agenda I can’t quite believe I’m about to write this - but tomorrow is of course the final day of the election campaign. So what can we expect? 24 hours of pleas and promises, insults and putdowns, banners and balloons and predictions and projections. That’s it for me for today. It has been a pleasure. Join the Guardian’s election team tomorrow morning, as we bring you the latest news, reaction, analysis, pictures, video, and jokes from the campaign trail. Alan Travis, the Guardian home affairs editor, has written a guide to what happens if no single party wins a majority and there is a hung parliament again. He writes: Britain has no written constitution but the nearest things we have to official handbooks in this situation are the cabinet manual drawn up in 2011 and the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011. The rules, however, make clear that Cameron is entitled, and indeed required, to stay on as a caretaker prime minister in a hung parliament. “The incumbent government remains in office unless and until the prime minister tenders his or her resignation and the government’s resignation to the sovereign,” says the manual. This means that while Cameron does have first go at forming a new government, it does not stop any other party leader from trying to do the same thing. Outgoing Daily Show presenter Jon Stewart has told Channel 4 News the Scottish National Party will hold the deciding vote on 7 May. The comedian joked England would “secede itself” after the election and said David Cameron and Ed Miliband had been smart to “lower the public’s expectations”. In an interview with Jon Snow, he said the UK had better institutions than the US - but still arrived at “stupid decisions” such as going to war in Iraq. You guys do it right. You get to the same terrible results we get to but you do it so much more efficiently. To do in six weeks what it takes us four years to accomplish it’s quite exciting. Asked by Snow what he believed the outcome would be, Stewart said both Cameron and Miliband have been smart as to “not portray themselves as too Churchillian or too charismatic”. I think it’s really smart to lower the public’s expectations of what either one of those could accomplish. It’s going to come down to SNP, they’re going to be the deciding vote and England is going to secede from itself. Snow suggested that satirical comics like Stewart had contributed to a breakdown in trust in politicians, which Stewart flatly rejected. That’s not the problem of the jokes. People have lost faith in the system, not because people have pointed it out, but because the system has shown itself to be so fraudulent. We here in the states look very admiringly about the fact you don’t spend that much money on elections, you do them very quickly, your news media is sober, concise and clear minded, it has no partisan rumblings, it has no bias, you have institutions in place that we imagine we wish we had and yet here we are you guys make the same stupid decisions we do even with the proper institutions. With not spending too much on elections, with having a better news broadcasting system, with questioning your politicians in Question Time directly and yet you still went to war in Iraq so I’m not sure what the answer is anymore. Here is a video clip of Stewart’s interview. Nick Clegg has just been speaking to journalists on the Liberal Democrat battle bus as it makes its way to his constituency of Sheffield Hallam for a quick stop off before trundling on to the Lake District. He said that the two biggest parties didn’t want a coalition and were under “huge pressure” from within their own ranks to try their best to run a minority government and avoid coalition. If you pick up the phone to any Tory MP on the right of the Tory party and ask them if they want to re-enter a coalition with the Liberal Democrats – once their expletives have died down after five minutes – for them its an article of faith that somehow the right wing vocation of the Conservative party was denied its moment in the sun by the presence of the Liberal Democrats. Clegg said he thought “the Labour party perhaps haven’t been through the pain barrier of realising that they’re not going to run things on their own again”. I think the Labour Party would have a hell of a job on its hands explaining to its activists why they might want to enter into a centrist coalition with a party they have been vilifying in hysterical terms for half a decade. The Lib Dem leader said that, while he was grateful for endorsements from a series of national newspaper editorials, including the Financial Times and the Independent, he wished the warm words had come sooner. The deputy prime minister said he’s getting about four hours sleep a night and is trying to get in some early morning kickboxing sessions to keep his energy levels up. He’s been taking cat naps at the back of the bus, apparently, unbeknownst to the journalists, who sit at the front. My colleague Henry McDonald has filed this sobering piece from Northern Ireland. Armed checkpoints will be mounted across Northern Ireland over the next 48 hours in the run up to polling day. The Police Service of Northern Ireland said the extra security along main arterial routes over the region is in response to a rising dissident republican threat. Republican organisations opposed to the peace process have tried to intensify their violent campaigns ahead of the general election. PSNI assistant chief constable Stephen Martin said: “In light of the four attacks carried out in Belfast and Londonderry over the last two weeks, the PSNI will have an enhanced profile in local communities to provide safety and reassurance to everyone.” Last week the PSNI discovered a large bomb during a security operation in North Belfast at the edge of the republican Ardoyne district. The Conservatives have raised 10 times more in donations than Labour in the final week of the general election campaign, official figures showed on Tuesday. David Cameron’s party received £1.36m, while Ed Miliband’s campaign gained £131,242, according to the final list of contributions released by the Electoral Commission. Over the four full weeks of campaigning, Labour secured the most financial backing, receiving £4,658,499 – most of which came from unions – while the Conservatives were given £3,456,017. In the final week, the Liberal Democrats raised £89,000, Ukip £7,896 and the Green Party £10,000, the watchdog said. Over the entire “short” campaign, Ukip took in £1,614,312 and the Liberal Democrats £234,000. We’re doing our last Guardian / British Thinks focus group in Thanet at the moment. The participants have been asked to bring symbolic objects to sum up how they have viewed the election campaign This man, a Labour supporter, brought a DIY “Ukip survival kit” which contains nails for “the coffin” of South Thanet because he says he is resigned to the fact that Nigel Farage will win here. Among other items brought along by members of the panel were a CD (“things just keep on spinning around but there’s no difference”), a blindfold, and a set of keys (“because the election it’s a bit like a car key party”). Ukip has suspended a general election candidate for “abhorrent” abuse about a rival - including racial slurs and a threat to shoot him should be ever become prime minister. The Mirror published a video of Robert Blay speaking to its investigators about Tory opponent Ranil Jayawardena at a public meeting on Saturday in Ramsgate addressed by party leader Nigel Farage. The Press Association reports: Ex-Conservative Mr Blay - who is standing for election in North East Hampshire - noted that Mr Jayawardena had been tipped as Britain’s first Asian prime minister. The Mirror reported that he went on: “If he is I will personally put a bullet between his eyes. If this lad turns up to be our prime minister I will personally put a bullet in him. That’s how strong I feel about it. “I won’t have this f***** as our prime minister. I absolutely loathe him.” Reporter Andre Rhoden-Paul has just sent this from Sheffield: Two protestors campaigning for victims of child abuse have scaled the roof of Nick Clegg’s constituency office in Sheffield. The protesters from Come Clean on Child Abuse accuse the deputy prime minster of not doing enough to address historic allegations of sex abuse at his former school. Martin Matthews, 44, and Robert Carwadine, 50, scaled Clegg’s office in Fulwood, Sheffield late last night. The men holding a banner saying “time to come clean” on the roof of the premises, shared with a plumbing company, plan to protest until polling stations close at 10pm on Thursday. Martin Matthews of Great Bookham, Surrey dressed as superhero Flash said: We want politicians that are going to get hold of these historical allegations of child abuse, clear it up and say it’s never going to happen again. A spokesman for Clegg said: The actions of abusers were horrific. They have ruined people’s lives, and it is right that all must be done to get to the truth. There are police investigations underway, as well as the Independent Panel Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse under Justice Lowell Goddard. These must be allowed to do their job, and have our full support. Police cars are monitoring the protestors and declined to comment. From the Ukip campaign trail In fresh polling today the Tory peer Lord Ashcroft put UKIP on 12% – a one point rise – cheering the party somewhat after a recent apparent squeeze in support. Still under pressure to deliver a key Ukip breakthrough by winning a seat in the east Kent constituency of South Thanet, Nigel Farage appeared however to be reducing his exposure to the media today in order to focus on chasing local votes. The press were invited to join the UKIP leader on a walkabout in the town of Sandwich – a Tory stronghold in the south of the constituency – but an appearance at a bingo hall in port town of Ramsgate in the evening was cancelled as Farage continued to canvass on the streets. Separate Ashcroft polling which was release six days ago put Farage two points behind his Conservative opponent Craig Mackinlay in South Thanet. Douglas Carswell, who is seeking re-election in the Essex constituency of Clacton, joined Farage on the trail in Thanet and later tweeted pictures of the two on the streets of Cliftonville, a strongly Labour district of Margate where there have been particular tensions over the issue of immigration. Nationally, there was some cheer for Ukip in the form of polling today by the Tory peer Lord Ashcroft which had the party rising one percentage point to 12 percent. Ashcroft polling which was released six days ago put Farage two points behind his Conservative opponent Craig Mackinlay in South Thanet. Voters who Farage encountered in the earlier part of the day in Sandwich included a man who expressed concerns about the threat to the UK from “arabs” and extremists. Farage later reportedly said that he could not believe that the security threat from ISIS infiltrating the UK via migrants crossing the mediterranean was not a “massive issue” in the election campaign. The latest poll from the Mirror/Survation puts Labour one point head of the Tories. Here’s the Mirror’s deputy political editor Jack Blanchard with the rundown of results: My colleague Rowena Mason has more on Ed Miliband’s hint of his first red line in any coalition negotiations with the Liberal Democrats by saying he would only lead a government that abolishes non-dom status. She writes: There has been speculation over the past 24 hours that Labour could seek to partner with the Lib Dems even if both parties together fall short of a majority to ensure they together form a larger bloc than the Conservatives. This could help address the question of legitimacy, which the Tories argue would be a problem for Miliband if he were to try to become prime minister without having won the largest number of seats. My colleagues Shiv Malik and Patrick Butler have this exclusive on a list of “very, highly or extremely controversial” potential cuts to benefits drawn up by civil servants in response to warnings that the next government would struggle to keep welfare spending below a legal cap of about £120bn a year. They write: The cuts proposed by officials at the Department for Work and pensions include abolishing statutory maternity pay and barring under-25s from claiming incapacity benefit or housing benefit. Money could also be raised, civil servants suggested, by increasing the bedroom tax in certain cases. In one of the DWP documents seen by the Guardian, two Whitehall officials say colleagues who were consulted in 2014 about the potential cuts described them as “very/highly/extremely controversial” which highlighted that when it came to welfare spending that there was “not much low-hanging fruit left”. The Conservatives have proposed cutting £12bn in welfare after the election, without specifying how the budget would be cut. The DWP proposals were canvassed the year before, amid warnings that the failure of the coalition to get to grips with accelerating spending on key benefits would leave the next administration “vulnerable to a breach” of the welfare spending cap. Just returning to Nick Clegg’s interview on Radio 4’s PM, my colleague Patrick Wintour has flagged a key quote on the Liberal Democrat leader’s position on working with parties that want to withdraw from the European Union. Asked by Eddie Mair if he would be happy to work with the Tories even though David Cameron is ready to hold an in-out referendum on the European Union in the next two years, Clegg replied: I would never accept, of course, being part of a Government that advocated withdrawal from the European Union. Cameron has said he would fight to persuade voters to back staying within the EU in the event of a referendum - so who is Clegg targeting here? Meet Ted Miliband ITV Meridian has dug into the archives and found the first ever TV appearance of Ed Miliband – or Ted as he was then known – when he was just a fresh-faced, grey wooly jumper-wearing student in spring 1991. Miliband told the interviewer he was “delighted” to see the 10 second clip of him leading a rent strike on behalf of Oxford students, and asked how it was found so many years later. Patrick Wintour, the Guardian’s political editor, has tweeted this key line from Nick Clegg’s Radio 4 PM interview: Ed Miliband will tomorrow vow that the non-dom rule will be scrapped by any government he leads after the election campaign. The Labour leader last month announced that if he wins the election he will abolish the non-domicile rule that allows many of Britain’s richest permanent residents to avoid paying tax in the UK on their worldwide income. In a rare nod to the prospect that his party will not win an overall majority, Miliband will say “any government” he leads will do the same. He will say: Let me be clear: any government I lead after this election will abolish the non-dom rule. The next Labour government will do what no government has done for 200 years. We will replace the non-dom rule with a clear principle: anyone permanently resident in the UK will pay tax in the same way. And only Labour will do this. We have come to expect David Cameron and Nigel Farage defending the richest and most powerful. But it is extraordinary that Nick Clegg is defending the non-dom rule too. Nick Clegg came under pressure from Eddie Mair on Radio 4’s PM over a tweet sent by Lord Scriven about a private conversation the deputy prime minister had with David Cameron. Q: Can I have a private conversation with you without you blabbing to someone else? What did you tell Lord Scriven about David Cameron? Scriven is an old friend of mine, Clegg says. I’m not going into private conversations I had. I refuse to provide a running commentary on private conversations. Here’s the original tweet that caused such a stir. Natalie Bennett, the Green party leader, is making her third trip in a fortnight to Bristol West – a seat the party thinks it can win. She will be joined by party grandees Baroness Jenny Jones and Jean Lambert MEP, as well as Jack Monroe the writer and food campaigner who left the Labour party in favour of the Greens. Bennett’s message is that the Greens will help deliver a “fairer” economy, and are determined to: “keep the Tories out of government and keep Labour in line.” Party members and supporters are invited this evening to bring along an undecided friend to meet Bennett et al., to try and persuade them to vote Green. On Wednesday morning, Bennett, Monroe and the Bristol West candidate, Darren Hall, are visiting Fareshare, a charity which takes food destined to go to waste and distributes it to the most needy. The Greens are buoyed by an Ashcroft poll that puts them ahead of the Lib Dems, who hold the seat in Bristol West, but behind Labour. Still, they insist they have the momentum. In the Guardian Monroe last month explained why she is supporting the Greens: Like greeting old friends, I embraced the importance placed on a national health service, on public transport, on sustainable energy, on fair pay for fair work. An interview with Nick Clegg is now being aired on Radio 4’s PM. I will listen in and flag the most interesting snippets. Ed Miliband, the labour leader, has spent the day touring marginal seats and dodged five questions about how he will act in the very likely event of a hung parliament. He was asked three times at an event in Bedford if he would seek to be prime minister even if he leads the second largest party. But he repeatedly refused to say, arguing it would be a distraction from the last 48 hours of campaigning. David Cameron, the Prime Minister, then upped his warnings about Miliband trying to govern even if he has fewer seats, saying it would create a “massive credibility problem”. Confronted with these accusations later in North Warwickshire and asked to reassure swing voters, the Labour leader said: All I have to say to voters making up their minds is to focus on the big choice the country faces. I’ll let others speculate on the election outcome. He would not even use the example of other European countries, where the leader of the second biggest party is commonly prime minister, to make a case for legitimacy. “Rather than politicians talking about themselves we should be talking about the British people and the choice laid before them,” he said. It was a brief interview on Radio 4’s PM with Plaid Cymru’s Leanne Wood. Most interesting moment was when Eddie Mair asked Wood about her 2007 arrest for blockading Faslane naval base in Scotland during a protest against the Trident nuclear programme. Q: Are you proud of that moment? I’m proud of the campaign work I’ve done in relation to Trident, Wood said. I’m proud my party has made Trident replacement a key issue during this campaign. Faisal Islam of Sky News has spotted election related graffiti on a poster at an underground station. Awkward. Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood is being interviewed on Radio 4’s PM now. I’ll have a listen and flag up the key moments. My colleague Marina Hyde has been on the campaign trail with Boris Johnson and David Cameron. She writes: An audience of captive workers was laughing, and David Cameron was laughing with a slightly clenched jaw. Whether the PM and Johnson ever really liked each other, even in the Bullingdon days, has always seemed doubtful. Either way, they now embody the least convincing relationship of mutual reverence since that between Alex Ferguson and Jose Mourinho. Read the article in full here. With just 48 hours to go before the UK decides, politicians are making their final push on the campaign trail, from Land’s End to West Lothian. Here are the election photo highlights of the day: The Scottish Tory leader, Ruth Davidson, and the first openly-gay leader with a major political party in the UK, has appeared together with her partner Jen Wilson for the first time on the campaign. Wilson joined her at the Strathspey steam railway at Aviemore where Davidson, never knowingly shy of a photo opportunity during this campaign, smeared coal dust on her face before she posed with a coal-filled spade by the loco’s boiler. The SNP has suspended two party members today after their involvement in angry protests at a Scottish Labour rally in Glasgow yesterday. Piers Doughty-Brown and James Scott have been placed under “administrative suspension” pending investigation of their role in yesterday’s incident in the city centre, which saw Labour activists - including leader Jim Murphy and supporter Eddie Izzard - jostled and abuse hurled at them by self-described “anti-austerity campaigners”. Amid scuffles, involving a handful of protesters and party members, Murphy and Izzard were forced to abandon an open-air rally and interviews with the media when protesters, carrying a banner reading ‘Red tories Out’, began playing music from a sound system and heckling with a loud-hailer. Murphy later condemned “the ugly face of aggressive nationalism”, while SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon described the fracas as “disgraceful” and “absolutely nothing to do with the SNP”. She said: “All parties have the right to make their case and they should be listened to respectfully.” However, today it emerged that two of the leaders of the protest were SNP members. They were also identified by Labour activists as among those who protested outside last Friday’s Labour rally, attended by Ed Miliband, also in Glasgow. Good afternoon, Jamie Grierson here. I’m taking over the blog for the rest of the day. Follow me on Twitter here and please keep your comments coming in below the line. To kick off my evening session here’s a film from the Guardian’s video team of mayor of London and parliamentary hopeful Boris Johnson as he joined David Cameron on the Conservative campaign trail. Lord Ashcroft has released his latest poll findings. The Conservatives lead by two points in this week’s Ashcroft National Poll, conducted over the past weekend. The Tory lead is down by four since last week, with Labour unchanged on 30 per cent. The Liberal Democrats are up two points at 11 per cent, Ukip up one at 12 per cent, the Greens unchanged at seven per cent and the SNP up one at five per cent. Ashcroft has also written up the findings from focus groups he conducted in three marginal seats. Given the argument about whether a Labour minority government would be legitimate if Labour did not have the most seats, the conclusions on this issue is particularly interesting. Here they are. One possible outcome is that Labour could form a government with the help of other parties, even if it comes second to the Conservatives in terms of both votes and seats. Most did not realise such an outcome was even possible, and many – including many who planned to vote Labour – were indignant at the idea: “They would have cheated their way in”; “It would be underhand. Not what the public wanted, not what the public said”; “It’s dealmongering, moving away from democracy”; “If that happened, at the next election, I’d think, what’s the point of voting?” Not everyone was exercised about it – but so many felt so strongly that it suggested such a government would have a job persuading the public of its political legitimacy, however constitutionally permissible it might be. That’s all from me for today. My colleague Jamie Grierson is taking over now for the rest of the day. Ed Miliband has given an interview to Louise Pentland, a fashion vlogger. No, I’ve never heard of her either, but she has 1.26m followers on Twitter (a few more than me) and her YouTube channel has more than 2.1m subscribers. She is another Russell Brand non-voter. She voted when she turned 18, she says in the interview, but hasn’t voted since. Miliband tells her that the country is “run by those who turn up”. With less than 48 hours until the polls open, it was surprising to see the pace of this series of debates slow a little. Welfare is a divisive and emotionally-charged issue so it was almost bizarre to see the candidates sit back and allow their rivals to finish lengthy answers without interruption. Ukip’s Suzanne Evans and Liberal Democrat Steve Webb brought very little to the lectern, while the Greens’ Jonathan Bartley was fairly mute too. It came down to a classic clash between the blues and reds, but Labour’s Rachel Reeves failed to place the work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith under any considerable pressure - and vice versa. However, there were stand-out moments thanks to the voracious interrogation conducted by presenter Andrew Neil, whose thoroughly researched briefings and bulldoggish style has illuminated these debates throughout the campaign. Here are some key moments: IDS admits Tories have not worked on where £12bn cuts will come from The Conservatives have previously revealed plans to make £12bn of “savings” to welfare in the first two years of the next parliamentary term. The prime minister and his party has faced frequent calls to reveal exactly where the axe will fall. Neil pushed Iain Duncan Smith to explain where the cuts will come from, asking the work and pensions secretary why he thinks it is not relevant for the public to know. Duncan Smith explained his party hasn’t done the work on exactly how the savings will be made. We would have to have done the work on it. That’s why. We would have had to reach agreement as to exactly where those are... as soon as we’ve done the work and had it modelled we’ll let everybody know what that is. Neil then asks the question on many a lip: shouldn’t you have done this work before you ask people to re-elect you? The work we do on this will be done in the spending review and we will announce that in time. The rise in food bank use is the fault of the recession, says IDS The work and pensions secretary was urged to explain the rise in use of food banks, which according to the latest figures from the Trussell Trust were used to feed almost 1.1 million people for three days in 2014-15. Duncan Smith said it was the fault of the recession, which Neil pointed out was over long before the spike in use of food banks. The real principle rise and the reason for the rise in the use of food banks and support through the community was the terrible recession we had. It’s difficult to overstate this we had the biggest recession we have had in living memory. Don’t mess with Iain Duncan Smith The Greens’ Jonathan Bartley infuriated the work and pensions secretary with a suggestion that, according to press reports, 60 suicides can be linked to the Government’s welfare reforms. In perhaps his most impassioned moment of the debate, IDS flatly denied the claim and swiftly put Bartley in his place. The Green didn’t apologise but certainly appeared to realise the enormity of his allegation and soon quietened down. Here is IDS’s moment of fury in full: That’s just scurrilous. You make an allegation and you can not stand that up and I simply say to you be very careful. You say you’re a Christian, be very careful what you say about people’s motivations. I have to tell you now, the department has looked at this and I’m not prepared to accept the welfare changes that have improved the quality of lives for all sorts of people... and what I’m telling you now is what we absolutely know is you can not make allegations about individual cases, in tragic cases where obviously things go badly wrong and suddenly say this is directly as a result of Government policy. I totally reject that. What a scurrilous point to make. I think what you said is cheap. A Tory candidate’s tweet comparing Labour to Jimmy Savile, as we reported earlier (see 9.58am), has generated more anger. Craig Whittaker, standing for re-election in Calder Valley, linked to the Daily Mail article headlined “Trust Labour? I’d rather trust Jimmy Savile to babysit” earlier this morning. Since then, care charities have tweeted their displeasure at Whittaker’s tweet: Incidentally, The Who Cares? Trust acts as the secretariat for All-Party Parliamentary Group on children in care, which is the parliamentary group which Whittaker chairs. Hat tip to Political Scrapbook for pointing that out. We’re always sympathetic to typos at the Grauniad. James Duddridge, a Conservative candidate, has had an unfortunate experience at the printers. Either that, or else he has come up with a cunning ruse to publicise his election leaflet. In his Today programme interview Nick Clegg complained that both Labour and the Tories opposed constitutional reform. That may have been a little unfair. Ed Miliband half-heartedly backed the alternative vote, whereas the Conservatives aggressively campaigned against it (and won). So it is hard not to smile at the news that, if AV had been introduced, the principal beneficiaries would have been - the Conservatives. Chris Hanretty has been looking at the figures, using British Election Study research, and he has posted his findings on the Newsnight blog. According to his analysis, the Conservatives would get 30 more seats than currently forecast, mainly because they would benefit from a huge number of Ukip second preferences. Labour would get fewer seats than currently forecast. And, according to Hanretty, the Lib Dems, who it was assumed would be the principle beneficiaries of AV, would neither gain nor loss. AV would have no effect on them at all. On the basis of Hanretty’s figures, Cameron would comfortably be on course to remain prime minister. Ed Miliband has conducted a video interview with the Guardian. It covers quite a range of topics, from relations with his brother to Manic Miner. Our BritainThinks focus group’s verdict on the campaign What do the real voters think? We have 60 in five key seats giving their view throughout the campaign as part of our polling project with BritainThinks. They each have an app and are telling us what they think of stories as they crop up. Below are some of their thoughts – from newspaper editorials to coalition deals: In a speech in Cambridge Natalie Bennett, the Green party leader, said all three main parties were failing to address the problem of climate change. All three parties want us to pursue the fantasy of fracking as an energy source, ignoring the need to decarbonise our electricity supply by 2020. Conservatives and Labour want to build new roads and expand airports, ignoring the environmental and social impacts on communities. None of the establishment parties have the bold plans to improve energy efficiency on the scale that we need to both tackle fuel poverty in Britain and to cut our carbon emissions. None have plans to break up the oligopoly of the Big Six energy firms, to democratise our energy supply and put it in the hands of communities and small local companies. None have acknowledged that nuclear power is another failed 20th century dinosaur. Blow after blow hits the nuclear power sector. The two European plants under construction are wildly over schedule and over budget, and may not generate a single watt. But the nuclear lobbyists still find government doors swept open before them, while policies fail to deliver for our renewable future. Only the Green party is setting out the policies that could make Britain a leader in the technology we need to build a low carbon future, which is the only future we can have. It would be a future of tremendous possibility, of good, stable jobs and warm, comfortable, affordable-to-heat homes. A future with a stable climate. According to the Daily Record, one of the protesters who disrupted Jim Murphy’s rally in Glasgow yesterday, Piers Doughty-Brown, is an SNP member who has now been suspended from the party. Margaret Curran, the shadow Scottish secretary, said this showed Nicola Sturgeon was wrong yesterday to say this had nothing to do with the SNP. Yesterday Nicola Sturgeon said the appalling scenes on the streets of Glasgow were nothing to do with the SNP, yet today she has suspended the SNP member who led the disruption. What happened yesterday was the ugly face of nationalism, but we will never let it stop us making a positive case for Scotland’s future - and it will never stop me standing up for the people of the East End of Glasgow. As someone who has been followed on the streets of Glasgow by Mr Doughty-Brown and who has raised concerns about his behaviour for months, I am happy to assist Nicola Sturgeon with her investigation. My colleague Peter Walker has been listening to Lucy Powell’s interview (see 1.08pm) in more detail. He says it is clear that she was just making the point that carving something in stone does not in itself guarantee that it will happen. At another point in the interview Powell said: [Ed Miliband is] highlighting a point he’s been saying throughout this campaign – it was just another way of highlighting that. Powell has also made this point on Twitter. Nick Clegg’s warning about a second election being inevitable unless the Lib Dems are included in a coalition in a hung parliament (see 1.32am) is striking (and probably rather alarming to everyone who feels that one election a year is more than enough). But is it actually true? Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, there will not be another general election until 2020 unless one of two things happens: two-thirds of the Commons votes for an election, or the government loses a vote of confidence and 14 days pass without an alternative government winning a vote of confidence. What Clegg is doing is effectively issuing the same sort of “vote for stability” message that David Cameron is issuing. Cameron is arguing that to ensure stability we need to avoid a coalition/hung parliament, while Clegg is arguing that to ensure stability we do need coalition, but in other respects they are making the same point. They are both alarming voters with the prospect of chaos. But would having the Conservatives or Labour trying to govern as a minority party, without the Lib Dems, really generate such chaos as to make a second election inevitable? For there to be a two-thirds vote in favour of an election, the Tories and Labour would both have to support the idea. That is not totally inconceivable, but it is very hard to imagine, mainly because circumstances that might favour one of them electorally would make the other party want to postpone. Besides, Labour can’t afford a second election. It is slightly easier to imagine circumstances where a government loses a confidence vote and no alternative government wins one. But, given that the SNP have said they would do everything to keep the Tories out of power, it is hard to see them voting down a Labour government. Another point is that, as long as someone else is available to try to form a government (Boris Johnson? Andy Burnham? Even Clegg himself?), then it is possible they could have a go. As Catherine Haddon explains in a helpful Institute for Government blog on this, “there is nothing in the act that restricts the number of times we go through the merry-go-round of a government falling and a further government being formed.” Clegg is assuming this crisis would arise because a minority government without the Lib Dems involved would be unable to govern. It is at this point that his logic really falls down. The Lib Dems have produced various examples of how minority Tory/Labour governments would not be able to pass bills (see 2.40pm), but they all ignore the fact that, on some measures, those governments would be able to rely on opposition support. For example, the Lib Dems says a minority Labour government would have to offer full fiscal autonomy to the SNP. But they wouldn’t, because Scottish devolution legislation could go through with the support of the Lib Dems and the Tories, who both support the Smith commission proposals. Minority government would involve ministers having to compromise with the opposition, but – as Clegg should know better than anyone else, because the Lib Dems have championed pluralistic politics for years – this is perfectly doable. Anthony King, a professor of government at Essex University, makes exactly this argument in an article in today’s Telegraph. And here’s the conclusion from a recent Institute for Government report, Westminster in an age of minorities (pdf), a paper that specifically addresses how minority government could work. The biggest challenge for a minority government undoubtedly lies in the parliamentary arena, where bills and spending plans may be defeated, amended or talked out (if timetable motions are defeated). Yet minority governments are often far from impotent in the legislature. Instead, successful minority governments put together temporary coalitions with different parties on different issues, conceding enough to get their business through, and relying on the fact that the interests and preferences of opposition parties are rarely aligned. Minority administrations hold an extensive set of powerful levers simply by virtue of being in government. At Westminster, the executive tightly controls the budget process, has the ability to block non-government legislation fairly easily, retains the sole right to introduce secondary legislation (which is rarely challenged in parliament) and, despite recent reforms, can still determine the business of parliament most of the time. It makes hundreds of important public appointments, can reorganise the structure of government departments and agencies largely at will, and retains important prerogative powers over defence, foreign policy and much more. All of this illustrates that a government without a majority can still be a powerful and effective force, although its survival rests on the continued acquiescence of opposition parties. Hi Jamie Grierson here. I’ll be listening to the Daily Politics election debate on BBC Two, starting now. Today it’s on welfare. Conservative work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith, Labour’s shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves, Liberal Democrat Steve Webb, Ukip’s Suzanne Evans and the Green party’s Jonathan Bartley are all appearing. I won’t post a minute-by-minute account, rather flag the most interesting moments. Here is more from the Lib Dem news releases justifying Nick Clegg’s claim that there will be a second election before Christmas unless the Lib Dems are included in coalition. New analysis reveals it would be virtually impossible for a minority Conservative or Labour government to pass key legislation without major financial concessions to buy off smaller parties like the SNP, Ukip and DUP ... Party analysis reveals: A minority Labour government would not be able to pass a Queen’s speech without conceding full fiscal autonomy to the SNP. A minority Labour government would not be able to pass a spending review if reliant upon SNP “ending austerity” votes, without conceding on their plans to make savings in the first year from departmental budgets and welfare cuts. A minority Conservative government would have to find an additional £1bn for Northern Ireland to buy DUP votes to support a spending review. A minority Conservative government would have to slash funding for international aid to buy off Ukip and rightwing Tories. A minority Conservative government would not be able to pass a Queen’s speech without conceding to Ukip’s demands to hold an EU referendum this year, undermining Cameron’s claims that he wants to stay in Europe after negotiating a new settlement. A minority Labour government would not be able to pass key budgetary votes as the SNP have stated they will vote against estimates if they include the cost of Trident. Nick Clegg made his comment in a news release the party has just sent out. Here is the Nick Clegg quote in full. Everybody knows that no one will win this election – even if David Cameron and Ed Miliband won’t admit it publicly. That means that politicians will have to work together to put the country first. The Liberal Democrats have shown that coalitions can be strong and stable. But instead of creating stability, Labour and the Conservatives will create a shambles. If they try to stagger through with a messy and unstable minority government instead of putting the country first then they will risk all the hard work and sacrifices people have made over the last five years. The last thing Britain needs is a second election before Christmas. But that is exactly what will happen if Ed Miliband and David Cameron put their own political interest ahead of the national interest. The only party that will ensure stability is the Liberal Democrats. I will post a snap analysis shortly. This is intriguing. I’ll post more when I get a full quote. The Tories are getting excited about this quote from Lucy Powell, vice chair of Labour’s election campaign. “Labour know Ed Miliband has no intention of keeping the promises he makes during the election campaign,” says Grant Shapps, the Conservative chairman. Here is the quote: I don’t think anyone is suggesting that the fact that [Ed Miliband has] carved them [his promises] into stone means, you know, means that he will absolutely, you know, not going to break them or anything like that. To my ears, Powell was just making the (fairly obvious) point that the fact that Labour’s election pledges have been carved in stone will not, by itself, guarantee that they won’t be broken. But the BBC are running this as one of their lead items in the World at One news bulletin. You can listen to the audio on the Guido Fawkes website and judge it for yourself. This is pretty extreme. Perhaps it was the moment when David Cameron endorsed Matthew Offord, not Boris Johnson, as the next Tory leader. (See 10.53am.) Leanne Wood, the Plaid Cymru leader, has issued a statement saying voters should use the election to end Wales’s position as a forgotten nation. The old way is on its way and people in Wales now have the chance to keep Wales at the heart of the political agenda beyond election day. I ask people in every corner of our country to think about it: which local candidate will best represent your community at Westminster? Which party do you trust to make sure Wales’ voice is heard loud and clear? I have been encouraged by the warm reception Plaid Cymru teams have received across Wales during this campaign. If you like what Plaid Cymru has had to say during this election campaign, vote for us. There have not been many (any?) memorable speeches this campaign. But, according to my colleague Libby Brooks, who was there (see 12.27pm), Gordon Brown’s was “thunderous”. Here are two extracts from the text sent out in advance (which, knowing Brown’s speaking style, may have borne little relationship to what he actually said). Brown defended Labour’s decision to rule out a deal with the SNP. While for the SNP the pursuit of nationalism is their goal, we believe in partnership, and that real progress is not some progressing at the expense of others but all of us progressing together. So it could never have been Scottish nationalism but only Scottish Labour that led the way to a minimum wage across the whole of the UK, to stop the good region undercutting the bad and the bad nation undercutting the worst in a cut-throat race to the bottom – and it is a minimum wage that we will convert into a £8 an hour minimum wage And that is why there can be no deal, no tie-in, no arrangement and no compromise with an SNP for whom nationalism is the imperative they serve. Not because we are taking the low road of electoral calculation. But because we have taken the high road of supporting the very principles of cooperation that the SNP want to break; the principles of partnership that the SNP would smash; the principles of sharing that the SNP would bring to an end; and the principles of solidarity that the SNP would throw into the dust. And that’s the difference. The nationalists wake up in the morning thinking of how to advance the cause of a separate state. We wake up in the morning thinking of how to advance the cause of social justice. Their aim is a second referendum. Our aim is a fair economy. He said Labour would take people to the “mountaintop of social justice”. Join us and let us all play our part in Labour and Scotland’s fight for social justice. And I say to those who feel the pain of others and who believe in something bigger than ourselves: we know that when the strong help the weak it makes us all stronger. I say there are millions like you who cannot be truly happy when others are sad, who cannot be at ease when millions are ill at ease, who cannot feel fully secure with so many insecure, and who cannot be comfortable when so many are without comfort. And so I give you my view. The independence people really want is independence from poverty. The liberation people really want is liberation from deprivation and unemployment. And the freedom people really want is freedom from all forms of injustice and inequality. Yes it’s an uphill battle, but the battle is for the mountaintop of social justice. Join us and let us all play our part in reaching that mountaintop. In a characteristically upbeat speech, in the face of unanimously devastating polls, Jim Murphy has told voters in Scotland to ask themselves one question as they step into the polling booth on Thursday: what would David Cameron do? Putting the squeeze tightly on voters wavering between Labour and the SNP, he said: “A Conservative prime minister who has reduced his great office to the status of the SNP’s cheerleader in chief, who has built his whole campaign on talking up the SNP. Does he want you to elect that one Labour MP who could be the vote that kicks him out of Number 10 or does he want you to elect an SNP MP who in the parliamentary arithmetic could be the only thing to save his skin?” While Murphy was characteristically upbeat and measured in the face of devastating polls, Gordon Brown delivered a thunderous address, calling on Scottish voters – including those who voted yes in the referendum – to “ascend to the mountaintop of social justice together” by voting for Scottish Labour. “In our DNA is the idea and determination that we will share our resources across these island, from each according to his capacity, to each according to his need … The sharing that a nationalist could never understand because it is not in their DNA to put social justice above the needs of nationalism.” Speaking of legitimacy, Guardian columnists Jonathan Freedland and Polly Toynbee turn their attention to Friday morning and the question of legitimacy in a hung parliament. Who decides who forms a government? Who gets to have a go at it first? Will it be down to Nick Clegg? And what do the front pages of the rightwing press tell us about the Tories’ plans? In his Q&amp;A this morning Ed Miliband studiously refused to talk about what might happen in the event of a hung parliament. (See 11.13am.) But David Cameron has not been so reticent. In an interview with the Daily Mail this morning, he suggested that Labour would not have the “legitimacy” to govern if it were not the largest party. Asked whether a government led by a party that had failed to win the most seats in the Commons and votes in the country could have legitimacy, [Cameron] said: ‘I think people would have serious questions and problems with it – and they would have every right to.’ In an interview with the LBC this morning, Cameron went slightly further. Nick Ferrari asked him about stories in the paper suggesting Miliband wanted to form a government even if he did not have the most seats. Cameron replied: I just think that there’s a massive credibility problem, with this idea that you can have a Labour government, backed by the SNP, only fighting for part of the country. I mean, the concerns of voters that I’m hearing about that, are very, very strong. Cameron suggests a Miliband government would have “a massive credibility problem” if Labour did not have the most seats. Is Cameron right? Analysis Technically, no. In so far as there is a guide to the British constitution, it is the Cabinet manual (pdf). And there is nothing in it saying that the government has to be led by the party with the most seats. A party with a majority gets to form a government but, if no party has a majority, the government is formed by whoever is “is best able to command the confidence of the House of Commons” (with the proviso that the incumbent prime minister gets to try first). All constitutional experts are agreed that the government does not need to be led by the largest party, and there is precedent for the second largest party being in power, although you have to go back to the Labour government of 1924. But Miliband could have a problem on Friday because many people will think that there would be something amiss with the “loser” of the election forming the government. Many voters will not have had time to brush up on their 1920s history, and they may well remember Jim Murphy making the argument in Scotland earlier in the campaign (in words that he probably regrets now) that the largest party forms the government. Opinion polling evidence also shows that people would back Cameron on this point. When YouGov asked people recently who had “better claim” to be prime minister in a hung parliament situation, 48% said the leader of the party with the most MPs, and only 26% said the leader of the group of parties that could command a majority (the “correct” answer). Earlier this morning on the BBC Norman Smith said there could be a conflict come Friday between the “parliamentary arithmetic” and “perceived legitimacy”. In fact, a purist would say that legitimacy should rest with the leader of the party best placed to command the parliamentary arithmetic. But that is not where we are, and instead this weekend may see an intense public debate about two alternative concepts of legitimacy. Ukip have got a two-page advert in the Daily Telegraph. Unfortunately for Ukip, the Telegraph hasn’t shown them the same courtesy that other advertisers, like HSBC, sometimes get from the paper. As the Press Association reports, the two-page ad follows a front-page splash headlined: “A vote for Ukip is a suicide note for Britain”. Miliband is now taking questions from the press. Q: Why are you not travelling as much as your rivals in the last 48 hours? Miliband says he will fight flat out to win the election. Q: The shortfall in NHS hospital trusts would use up most of the extra money you have set aside for the NHS. Miliband says he is highlighting those figures because they show the crisis facing the NHS. Only Labour would address this, he says. Q: What is your view on who has the right to form a government? Miliband says there are 48 hours left. He is fighting for votes, and focusing on the issues. Q: If you are not the largest party, will you try to form a government? Miliband says he is focusing on getting the right outcome for the election. In his Q&amp;A, Ed Miliband says when he hears David Cameron “banging on” about how good life is for working people, he realises that he just does not “get it”. The Conservatives have unveiled a defector from Ukip. Elliot Nichols was a Ukip district councillor in Surrey until yesterday. He was also Ukip’s parliamentary candidate for South West Surrey until he stood down before Christmas, citing personal reasons. In a statement released by CCHQ, Nichols said: Two years ago I left the Conservative party and joined Ukip. I switched with high hopes. Since then events – especially in recent months – have convinced me that this was a grave error of judgment. I made a mistake – a big one – and today I am proud to rectify it. We need an EU referendum, a sustainable NHS, better schools, a tax-free minimum wage, and above all a strong economy. To these challenges, each critical in its own way, Ukip offers no solutions, only soundbites, and nasty ones at that. So, Nichols is a double defector. He ratted, and re-ratted, as Churchill put it. If the children of Britain were the only voters on Thursday, David Cameron would emerge with 40% of the vote, according to a survey by the weekly children’s newspaper First News. More than 5,000 First News readers took part in the junior general election, which would make the Green party the third largest Commons bloc (on 18%), behind Labour on 22%. (NB: It is perhaps stating the obvious to point out that the kind of parents who buy their child a subscription to a weekly newspaper are likely to be at either end of the political spectrum – traditional conservative or campaigning left – which may be reflected in their child’s choice.) The final count was: David Cameron, Conservative: 40% Ed Miliband, Labour: 22% Natalie Bennett, Green: 18% Nick Clegg, Lib Dem: 9% Nigel Farage, UKIP: 6% Nicola Sturgeon, SNP: 4% Leanne Wood, Plaid Cymru: 1% David Cameron has been holding an event at the same time as Ed Miliband. I did not see the live footage, but, from Twitter, it sounds as if it has been quite lively. Our multimedia team have launched this impassioned plea from Guardian columnist Owen Jones for people to vote on Thursday. He urges the electorate to blame the people with power, not those without it. Change rarely comes from the generosity of the powerful but is fought for from below, he says. Now is the time to take action, he concludes. Q: Would you re-introduce the educational maintenance allowance? Miliband says he cannot promise to restore EMA. But he would give the vote to 16- and 17-year-olds, he said. The government would not have been so keen to get rid of the EMA if young people had had the vote. Q: What is your view on the trade deficit? Miliband says that in the scale of unwritten stories, the current account deficit is very important. Productivity is further behind other countries than it has been. That is why skills training is so important. Q: What would you do in a hung parliament? Miliband says he will leave the commentary to others. He is fighting for every vote. Q: Would you introduced electoral reform? At the moment every vote does not count equally. Miliband says he is sympathetic to that point. But he is not in favour of proportional representation. We had a referendum on the alternative vote, he says. Q: Can you imagine Labour getting rid of private schools? Miliband says his priority is improving state schools. Q: What are you plans on housing. I love my children, but don’t want them living at home? Miliband says Labour would build 1m homes during the course of the next parliament. Also, he would reform the private rental market. Q: The campaign has been marred by racism and nationalism. How would you address this? Miliband says he sympathises with this point. There is more that unites us than divides us, he says. Q: Will you implement in full the Leveson proposals? Miliband says he will “do right by the promises we made to the victims of press intrusion”. That is in the manifesto, he says. Alert readers will know, of course, that there is a connection between this point and the Ivor Gaber post at 9.51am. Q: Can we nail this point about the Liam Byrne note. It was the Tories who started this, with the note Reggie Maudling left for Labour in 1964? Miliband, perhaps sense that there is not much to be gained from attacking the Tories over the state of the economy in the 1960s, instead chooses to attack David Cameron’s economic plans. Ed Miliband is speaking now. It is largely his standard stump speech, about the need for an economy that works for working people, not those at the top, but he includes a passage highlighting the new figures about two-thirds of hospital trusts having to make deep cuts that we highlighted in today’s Guardian splash. Miliband says that when the NHS is underfunded it is working people who will lose out the most. There is a live feed of the event on the BBC website, or you can watch the embedded live stream below: Bedford is a classic marginal. The Tories won in 2010, but, according to a poll from Lord Ashcroft last summer, Labour was then ahead. On this list of target seats produced last year, it was 24th on Labour’s list. Ed Miliband is about to start a People’s Question Time event in Bedford. He is being introduced by Patrick Hall, the Labour candidate. Hall says that, as the campaign goes on, the attacks on Miliband from the Tories have got more extreme. He says he is very pleased that Miliband has chosen not to retaliate in kind. That is a testament to his decency, he says. A Tory parliamentary candidate has been heavily criticised for retweeting a Richard Littlejohn headline that compares Labour being in charge of the country with giving Jimmy Savile the chance to babysit. Craig Whittaker, who is standing for re-election in Calder Valley, linked to the Daily Mail article – headlined ‘Trust Labour? I’d rather trust Jimmy Savile to babysit’ – early this morning. To make matters worse, Whittaker chairs the all-party parliamentary committee for looked after children and care leavers. Emma Burnell, writing on LabourList, says the Mail headline is “the sickest propaganda yet” and that the victims of Jimmy Savile deserve better than to be dragged into political attacks: Politics can be a rough game, but there should be boundaries. Acceptable levels of decency in dialogue. There are criticisms of Labour from the right – that many may not agree with – but a clash of ideologies will always lead to strong and impassioned arguments. But there are limits. Just as some on the right were justly shocked over the vitriol over the death of an old woman (no matter what political damage she did to the country) Labour have a right to expect not to be unjustly compared to Jimmy Savile. More importantly the victims of Jimmy Savile deserve not to have their abuse abused for political purposes. Nicola Sturgeon has told Scottish voters that they have 48 hours to end austerity, driving home her message that this is an election like no other in terms of Scotland’s opportunity to make its voice heard in Westminster (which of course is another example of using “Scotland” and “SNP” interchangeably – last time I looked, the country had exactly the same number of MPs as it had last time round). At a campaign visit to a nursery in Livingston – her second big media event with the impressive local candidate Hannah Bardell, who is challenging a 10,000 Labour majority – Sturgeon said: “Not once in my life has Scotland voted Tory and yet for more than half my life we have had a Tory government. With more anti-Tory MPs than Tory MPs elected in May we can lock David Cameron out of Downing Street.” She reiterated her challenge made in Dumfries last night to Ed Miliband to join the SNP in an anti-Tory bloc on Friday morning: “We’ve been absolutely clear that SNP MPs will vote to stop a Tory government even getting off the ground – Ed Miliband now needs to give the same commitment.” Ivor Gaber, a journalism professor, has written a good article about media coverage of the election that we have just launched on our site. He concludes that the “Tory press” is back with a vengeance. Here’s an extract. I guess we shouldn’t have been surprised by [the resurrection of the “Tory press”], but even seasoned press observers – well, this one at least – could have been taken aback by the sheer ferocity of the 21st-century incarnation of the beast – had it all not seemed so ludicrously, even comically, dated. The Daily Mail has been frothing at the mouth about “Red Ed” for the past two years or more. One has to hand it to the paper for its sheer determination in trying to plant the concept into the mind of the general public at every opportunity – Lynton Crosby eat your heart out. But the failure of the campaign to find any sort of resonance among the man or woman in the pub or coffee bar has been one of the more edifying aspects of the campaign. The Sun has been equally ridiculous and made itself a laughing stock, which will be remembered long after the polls have closed with its classic twin-headed monster splash – “SNP will eat your babies” for its English readers and “Nicola for Sainthood” north of the border, both on the same day! Much mirth for all we media watchers. Jim Murphy tells the Daily Record this morning that he would be “heartbroken” if votes for the SNP usher in another five years of Tory government across Britain. The Scottish Labour leader, who is facing heavy losses on Thursday, said he feared a return to the dark days of Thatcher when his family were forced to emigrate to South Africa after his father lost his job. It’s interesting to note how Tory warnings of SNP “coalition chaos” are reported here: the Herald this morning describes David Cameron as “ruthlessly playing the Scottish Nationalist card” in a last-ditch attempt to appeal to voters in the south. And the Herald also has an interesting story about Kirsten Oswald, the SNP candidate hoping to claim Jim Murphy’s seat, appealing to Tory voters in her election literature. Curious, when pro-union tactical voting seems to be the overwhelming trend in Scotland. Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, was asked by Victoria Derbyshire on the BBC just now if Labour would accept that it had no right to form a government if it was not the largest party after Thursday. Burnham replied: The party with the largest number of seats normally gets the chance to try and form a government. But we have to see how the country votes, don’t we. But, when pressed on whether Labour would refuse to try to form a government in those circumstances, he refused to engage. “We will have to see who the country votes,” he replied. It was not right to speculate on this now, he claimed. Jim Murphy, the Scottish Labour leader, is to make a final plea to wavering and lost Labour voters to back his party by insisting that failing to vote for Labour on Thursday will result in “a decade of Tory rule”. Murphy is due to appear with Gordon Brown in Glasgow later this morning. Polls unanimously predict Scottish Labour faces a wipeout at the hands of the SNP, and Murphy is being challenged heavily in his East Renfrewshire seat by the SNP candidate Kirsten Oswald – who has been appealing to Conservative voters in the once Tory stronghold to back the SNP. Her letter to Tory constituents praised the “values of hard work, responsibility and public service which the Conservative party has traditionally stood for”. Murphy is due to say that only Labour is capable of unifying the UK: We’re less than 48 hours away from being able to change our country and set out on the road to a fair economy. We get it by rejecting the divisions of the past and embracing a fairer plan for Scotland’s future. We cannot gamble on ending Tory rule with a vote for the SNP. They plan to vote against Labour budgets and a Labour Queen’s speech, and are planning the road to a second referendum. It’s the last thing working class people in Scotland need. The Tories plan is classic divide and rule. A divided Scotland means five more years of Tory rule. The only way to be sure of getting rid of the Tories is to vote Labour, if David Cameron has even one more MP than Labour then he will hold talks with the Lib Dems. Caroline Lucas, the only Green MP in the last parliament and the candidate in Brighton Pavilion, was also on the Today programme this morning. She effectively urged Green supporters not to vote tactically - ie, not to wear one of Polly Toynbee’s nose-pegs - and to instead back the party they believed in. Up and down the country the sense that I’m getting [is] that people are fed up of tactical voting, that there is far more of a sense of people wanting to vote for what they believe in – and in particular, what the Green party is offering, the politics of hope instead of all of this politics of fear. Every other party right now is trying to terrify you out of voting for the opposition because of something to do with migration or something to do with the SNP. None of them are putting forward a positive vision and the number of people now coming to the Green party saying that they are desperate to vote for something positive – whether that be our policies for much more ambitious action on climate change, whether that’s our policies on challenging austerity, whether it’s to do with standing up for a truly public NHS – that is what people want. They’re fed up of voting with a nose peg over their noses and when they take that nose peg off, there’s a pretty nasty smell around and that’s because they haven’t voted for what they believe in. Here’s another exhibit from the “You’d never know he was a Lib Dem” school of campaign strategy. After Wiltshire MP Duncan Hames’ leaflet, which had more blue, red, and Ukip purple than yellow, come these billboards from John Leech, who is campaigning for re-election in the studenty marginal of Manchester Withington. Could the size of the student vote be the reason why Leech isn’t shouting from the rooftops that’s he a proud Lib Dem? At the end of an election campaign, after countless interviews, it is hard to get a party leader to say anything new and I don’t think John Humphrys landed any great scoops. My colleague Tom Clark thinks Nick Clegg firmed up his line that the Lib Dems would talk to the largest party first in a hung parliament situation, but I’m not even sure about that. If there was anything new, it was not so much that the Lib Dems would talk to the largest party first, but that they would give them “the space and the time” to form a government. Here are the key points. Clegg said that the Lib Dems would give the party that won most seats and votes “the space and the time” to try to form a government. The party that gets most votes and the most seats, in other words the party that gets the biggest mandate from the British people, even if it does not have a slam-dunk majority, it seems to me right to give that party the space and the time to try and set up a government. The Lib Dems would talk to that party, he said. But any possible deal would depend on that party being willing to engage with the Lib Dems too, he insisted. “Time and space” could be Clegg’s way of saying that we should not expect a decision about potential coalitions etc anytime soon after Thursday night. Given that many seat projections, like ours, are tending to point towards the Tories having most seats and votes, this is probably good news for Tories. However, as Chris Terry, a researcher for the Electoral Reform Society points out, Clegg’s views could be irrelevant. Terry is referring to the Lib Dem rules that say that any coalition proposal will only be adopted if it has overwhelming support within the party. The precise “triple lock” rules are complicated, but you can read them here. Clegg said that seats and votes would both be taken into account when deciding which party had the best mandate from the electorate. This interpretation probably benefits the Tories, since it is quite possible that Labour could have more seats, but fewer votes, than the Tories, but very unlikely that this could happen the other way round. He said providing stable government would be a priority. First we should obey the democratic will of the British people, secondly we should guarantee stability above and beyond everything else, we need a stable, decent and united government after Thursday. I worry terribly about the fracturing of politics as Labour rush off to the left and the Conservatives rush off to the right. That suggests Clegg would prefer a coalition to supporting a minority government on a confidence and supply basis. He said the Lib Dems would only accept ministerial posts in a coalition if they could implement some of their policies. They were not interested in power just for power’s sake, or “bums on seats in Whitehall”. He said neither Labour nor the Tories could be trusted to deliver constitutional reform. He confirmed that an EU referendum was not a “red line” issue for the Lib Dems, and that the party would consider backing Tory plans for one in return for the Tories agreeing to support some key Lib Dem demands. He insisted that the Lib Dems would do better than commentators expected. At one stage, when John Humphrys said the Lib Dems were bound to lose some seats, he said he would not even accept that, but that was more light-hearted bravado than a serious prediction. Q: Andrew George, a Lib Dem candidate, says he has always voted against Trident. So you have a national policy and a local policy. Which is the Lib Dem policy? Clegg says all parties have MPs who are opposed to Trident. There are Labour MPs opposed. Some Tories have reservations about the cost, he says. The Lib Dem policy is clear. It would maintain Trident, but do so “on a less all-singing, all-dancing basis”. Q: Some would say that’s a typical Lib Dem compromise. Some would says that is moving with the times, says Clegg. And that’s it. I will post a summary soon, although that shouldn’t take long, because it was not a revealing interview. Q: You wanted a fairer voting system. But, in fact, we have a less fairer voting system because you blocked boundary reform. So what is the point of another Lib/Con coalition? Clegg says his reforms have been frustrated. It was not just the Tories; Labour united with the Tories to block Lords reform. They also obstructed reform to party funding. If you want constitutional reform, you cannot trust Labour and the Tories “one jot”, he says. Q: You say you have been a moderating influence on the Tories. But the Tories have claimed credit for some of your ideas. So it looks as if you have not achieved much at all. Clegg says that even by the provocative standard of Today questions, that is a bit much. The Lib Dems had 8% of the vote. But they ensured that 27 million people got a tax cut, and that apprenticeships were extended, and pensions were reformed, and equal marriage was introduced. And they produced the stability that allowed the economic recovery to happen. Q: Why is opposition to an EU referendum not one of your red lines? Clegg says he is not in principle opposed to a referendum. But the Lib Dems agreed that, in the event of more power being transferred to Brussels, there should be another referendum. Q: Cameron has gone further than that. So why is the referendum not a red line for you? Clegg says he has other red lines. Many listeners will think investing in the NHS, and in schools and nurseries, and raising the income tax threshold are more important. Q: Did David Cameron tell you the Tories would not win a majority? Clegg refuses to answer. He does not control what Lib Dem people tweet. Clegg says, again, his “hunch” is that the Lib Dems will do much better than people think. Where people hear the Lib Dem story, they like it. They like the stability and decency and unity it stands for. Q: If you only get half the seats you have now ... Clegg says he does not think that will happen. He is not joining in the “hysterical” punditry. The Lib Dems will do better than people expect. Q: If you lose seats ... Clegg says he does not accept that. He wants more. Q: Vince Cable says you should have as many ministers as last time. Would it be legitimate for you at all to be in government? Clegg says he would not accept power for power’s sake. He is not just interested in “bums on seats in Whitehall”. It would be about whether the Lib Dems could implement their policies. Q: If the Conservatives get more seats than Labour, will you offer yourself to them? And the same with Labour if they get the most seats? Clegg says the party that gets the most votes and seats should have the space and time to try to form a government. But he does not know whether the party in that position would reach out to the Lib Dems. Of course the Lib Dems would listen to what that party said. The key thing is to provide stability. The Lib Dems would follow the democratic instructions handed to them by the electorate. Q: If the Tories or Labour get the most seats, would you offer them your support? Clegg says he would talk to the party with the most seats. Q: Would you look at votes as well as seats? Clegg says it is seats and votes that both count. John Humphrys is interviewing Nick Clegg now. Q: Would you do a deal with Labour? Clegg says who does a deal with whom will be entirely determined by the votes of voters. Q: But you who want to do a deal with will affect those votes? Clegg says David Cameron and Ed Miliband are “preposterously” pretending they will win a majority. He is not. The Lib Dems would add a heart to a Tory government, or a brain to a Labour one. They would not do a deal with Ukip or the SNP. So they are “the guarantors of stability”. Good morning. I’m taking over from Claire. John Humphrys will be interviewing Nick Clegg on the Today programme shortly. As Claire said earlier (see 7.01am), Clegg has had some strong support in the papers today, with the Times and the Independent praising his record. But she missed one other surprise Lib Dem partial-endorsement. Nigel Farage isn’t happy about the claims today by Iain Duncan Smith that a vote for Ukip is “like a suicide note”: Here’s some more info from the Guardian’s Scotland correspondent, Severin Carrell, on the day ahead north of the border: At 9am, Nicola Sturgeon gives a speech at a children’s nursery in Livingston on how SNP MPs will work at Westminster. At 10.45am, Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie joins former Gordon MP Sir Malcolm Bruce and candidate Christine Jardine for a “final push” in their campaign against SNP candidate Alex Salmond. At 11am, Jim Murphy, the Scottish Labour leader, gives a speech with former party leader and prime minister Gordon Brown in Glasgow. Then at 11.45am, Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson campaigns on the Strathspey steam railway in Danny Alexander’s seat of Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey. John Swinney, the SNP deputy first minister of Scotland, has just been on the Today programme. He was pressed on claims made by his boss, Nicola Sturgeon, that a Westminster government without Scottish MPs would lack legitimacy. Swinney said the comments had to be understood in the context of the Tories holding only one seat in Scotland, which he said it could lose on Thursday: We’ve had a number of Conservative governments that were roundly rejected in Scotland by the electorate … There is a need for a government of the United Kingdom to be representative of the whole of the United Kingdom. We’ve set out a position that we will do everything we possibly can do to lock the Conservatives out of power … The important parliamentary point is that the government that is formed has to command a majority in the House of Commons … It’s important when that government is comprised that it is supported throughout the United Kingdom and has political legitimacy throughout the United Kingdom. Last year’s independence referendum does cast a shadow over this election, Swinney said: There is nothing that can happen from this election that can lead to another referendum. [But last year] the UK party leaders came to Scotland and said to Scotland, don’t leave the United Kingdom. We can use that voice to create influence to deliver the policies that people in Scotland want to see delivered. Nick Clegg has had an early (and hair-raising) start, braving the Cornish winds for an interview with ITV’s Good Morning Britain: My lucky colleague Frances Perraudin is aboard the Lib Dem battle bus and sends this agenda for the next 48 hours: The Liberal Democrat battle bus starts its 1,000-mile dash from Land’s End to John O’Groats today, stopping at marginal constituencies to make one last attempt to convince undecided voters before polling day. Today the bus will transport party leader Nick Clegg through a long line of Lib Dem seats, starting in St Ives, via stop-offs in Somerset, Cardiff and Solihull. The battle bus will then continue heading north on Wednesday, visiting Cumbria, Glasgow, Inverness and John O’Groats before finishing back in the deputy prime minister’s constituency of Sheffield Hallam on Thursday, so he can place his vote. Today’s Guardian long read profiles David Cameron. Matthew D’Ancona writes: To understand Cameron is to look beyond the straightforward countenance – the psychic inertia in which the English upper middle class seems to specialise – and to observe the struggle between a radical social reformer who wanted to transform both the character of conservatism and the nature of the 21st-century state, and the supreme pragmatist who accepted that politicians must adapt dreams to circumstances. He never forgot that, in politics, he had chosen what Bismarck called ‘the art of the possible’; or, that in politics, as in any performance art, timing is all. The Telegraph has also announced its view on who ought to be PM after polling day. I’d insert a drumroll here but savvy readers will be ahead of me: it’s Vote Cameron! On the question of bringing both economic and political stability, the choice is clearer every day. In 2015, the national interest and private necessity do indeed coalesce. A vote for Mr Miliband looks to be one for chaos and recession. Mr Cameron is offering stability and opportunity. Good morning and welcome to the Guardian’s election live blog, as we dive into the final 48 hours of campaigning. I’m Claire Phipps, kicking off the blog today, before handing over to Andrew Sparrow to steer you through Tuesday’s twists and turns. We’ll have live coverage every day from 7am till late until polling day on Thursday. After the polls close, we’ll just keep on going until we fall over/readers fall over/there’s a government that doesn’t fall over. I’m on Twitter @Claire_Phipps, so do come and chat there or in the comments below. The big picture It’s not often I write this, but Nick Clegg might well be starting the day with a smile on his face. First, there was the Guardian/ICM poll that found him on course – despite earlier polling predictions – to save his own seat. OK, it’s no Cleggmania Part Two: his seven-point lead in Sheffield Hallam is because almost half the people (48%) who say their nationwide preference is for the Conservatives are planning to support the Lib Dem leader (leaving the Tories’ own candidate in the constituency on a measly 12%). And a party leader retaining his own seat is hardly the stuff of electoral dreams. (Those with long memories might also recall that a last-minute Sheffield rally doesn’t always bode well.) But the Lib Dem leader has had a further boost from the Independent, which has backed him in an editorial that called for the continuation of the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition. You can read the story about that here and the editorial itself is here: Nick Clegg may not personally recover from the tuition fees debacle, despite being right (eventually). But history will record him as the man who turned a party of protest into one of government. As a principled, effective politician who could hold another coalition together, we hope he keeps his seat. Clegg should insist on being education secretary in the next government, the Independent says, before adding: Any partnership between Labour and the SNP will harm Britain’s fragile democracy. For all its faults, another Lib-Con coalition would both prolong recovery and give our kingdom a better chance of continued existence. The Times, too, has taken a sympathetic look at Clegg’s five years in government and decided he deserves another shot: The deputy prime minister has been more maligned than any politician in Britain these past five years. Most of that criticism has been unfair, though he did block much needed electoral boundary reform. He has nonetheless taken the opprobrium with good grace and conducted himself with civility. It would be a shame if that were rewarded with expulsion. The newspaper endorsement is a funny beast, and readers are not always happy with the editorial stance taken (as the Guardian well knows). But if nothing else, Clegg’s boost will be well discussed on social media today – and that’s not an arena he has dominated so far in this campaign. There will be – and has already been – discussion too of the possible role of father-and-son owners of the Independent, Alexander and Evgeny Lebedev. Certainly the latter seemed rather won over by David Cameron in an interview he conducted himself – with lots of pictures of them together – for the Evening Standard (which the Lebedevs also own, and which is expected to unveil its own endorsement of the Conservatives). In February, Lebedev Sr told the Guardian it would be up to his editors to decide which political parties to back. Certainly the Independent on Sunday took a different stance, insisting it would stay “true to our name … while our rivals have reverted to their ideological bunkers” and not advise its readers which way to vote. (Cross Independent readers – and the comments under the editorial suggest there are a few – might prefer Steve Richards’ take, in the same organ.) You should also know: Ed Miliband has warned that the NHS faces a financial bombshell, with two-thirds of hospital trusts face having to make “swingeing cuts”, after a leaked internal document showed that the health service is projected to run a deficit of nearly £2bn this year. A payment of £50,000 gives business people direct access to Cameron and senior Conservatives at dinners, drinks receptions and other events. Nicola Sturgeon has said it would be wrong for the Westminster government to be made up solely of English MPs, hinting that she expects the Tories to win the most seats. Labour is to give security guards at the party’s northern head office backdated earnings after the Sun reported (paywall) they were being paid less than the living wage. Iain Duncan Smith says a vote for Ukip would be akin to writing Britain’s “suicide note”. In a remarkably chummy interview in the Daily Mail, Cameron describes finding his “oomph” for the final days of the campaign (removal of asterisks is all my doing): There was no bollocking. There was just a sense that … um. I just thought, I’ve got to turn the dial up. Read Nadia Khomami’s summary of all Monday’s key moves here. And with just two days to go, here’s how the polls shape up: Diary Today, expect to hear more from the two main parties on their key pushes: Labour on the NHS and the Conservatives on the economy. Nick Clegg is on the Today programme at 8.10am before jumping on the Lib Dem battle bus to begin a two-day sprint from Lands End to John O’Groats, today via Newquay, Cardiff and Solihull. Ed Miliband will be in Bedfordshire and North Warwickshire. David Cameron goes west from Twickenham and Hendon, to St Ives and Torbay. Nicola Sturgeon campaigns in Livingston. Nigel Farage heads to Ramsgate. Gordon Brown and Jim Murphy are out in Glasgow. Green leader Natalie Bennett is campaigning in Cambridge. Her colleague Caroline Lucas is on the Today programme at 8.40am. John Swinney, the SNP deputy first minister, is on the Today programme at 7.15am. The big issue Two days before the polling stations open and we are in a strange zone in which politicians are mocked for publicly stating that they can win a majority, but regarded with suspicion at the mere hint that they might be considering how they might govern post Thursday. So the Telegraph today leads on “Ed Miliband[’s] plot to become prime minister even if he does not win election”, suggesting Labour could attempt to woo the Liberal Democrats to lessen the reliance of a minority government on the SNP. The BBC reports that in the event that the Tories have the most seats but are short of an outright majority – the scenario towards which many polls now lean – a Lib-Lab deal could enable them to outvote the Conservatives: There would be many hurdles to be overcome before any Labour-Lib Dem minority government could be formed. It would be accused by opponents of being a ‘coalition of the losers’. Many Lib Dems would be opposed to minority coalition: not only would the party have to compromise yet again on its policies in return for power, but it would also have even less chance of getting its own policies implemented. Alternatively, as my colleagues Patrick Wintour and Rowena Mason report, Cameron could try to “cling on to power” with the support of the Lib Dems and Democratic Unionists. They offer a helpful guide to the (albeit not very helpful) rules: It is argued that the Cabinet Manual – the civil service book setting out the rules on the transfer of power – states a prime minister can stay only until the point at which it is clear they cannot command the confidence of the Commons; not when any other party demonstrates they can form a majority or requires a vote in the House. The relevant section of the manual states: “Where an election does not result in an overall majority for a single party, the incumbent government remains in office unless and until the prime minister tenders his or her resignation and the government’s resignation to the sovereign. An incumbent government is entitled to wait until the new parliament has met to see if it can command the confidence of the House of Commons, but is expected to resign if it becomes clear that it is unlikely to be able to command that confidence and there is a clear alternative.” The argument will then turn on whether convention expects the prime minister to resign as soon as it is clear that they no longer command a majority. Some argue precedent, with expert opinion saying the leader of the largest opposition party will be appointed prime minister. The Guardian’s data editor, Alberto Nardelli, says the permutations make tactical voting this Thursday “an even more important issue than in other elections”. Here’s his guide to how to do it. Read these The view from abroad today, as the world wonders who it’ll be dealing with come Friday: For US polling guru Nate Silver’s Five Thirty Eight, Mona Chalabi takes a trip to Clacton to try to explain Ukip: Voters over the age of 40 are twice as likely to vote Ukip as those under 40. That may be because older voters have different priorities. While the economy, unemployment and education all rank high as concerns for the overall British electorate, they’re lower on the list of worries among those who are going into, or are already in, retirement. That works to the disadvantage of other parties claiming that Britain’s economic stability would be jeopardised by exiting the European Union. And that works to the advantage of Ukip, which is not well-versed in policy areas like the economy, having focused almost exclusively on the EU and immigration. Steven Erlanger, in the New York Times, profiles the two contenders for PM: David Cameron, 48, the red-cheeked toff who went to Eton and belonged to snooty clubs; and Ed Miliband, 45, the gawky, adenoidal, agnostic son of a Marxist Jewish refugee and historian … Both Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband, though part of a younger generation of leaders, have pulled their parties back to the past, toward older ideologies. And the Guardian has rounded up writers from Le Monde, El País and Süddeutsche Zeitung for a European take on the UK result: Face it, my beloved Britons: you’ve got a weird electoral system. You might think it’s normal that the Greens could get 10% of the vote and just one seat, while the SNP might end up with 4% and 50 seats. But it’s not. Even if it does stop Ukip. Even the name is funny: first past the post. It sounds like a board game in which a team of journalists and a team of politicians jump from one marginal seat to another, with a rich lord called Ashcroft tossing the dice. Closer to home, do check out John Harris and John Domokos’ diary of 11 weeks on the campaign trail up and down Britain; here they’re in Bristol: If the Greens are going to increase their support further, they’re going to have to appeal to parts of the city where politics – of whatever hue – cuts very little ice. A good example is Redcliffe, where we spend two hours following a Green team around some threadbare low-rise flats. One twentysomething mother-to-be doesn’t know there’s an election on; neither do a group of young men crowded around a stairwell, though their spirits are lifted by news that the Greens support the decriminalisation of weed. The day in a tweet Chalking up half a point for the Lib Dems for their “women are just like regular human beings” video. Now how about some more female Lib Dem MPs? If today were a TV drama, it would be… Poldark. Compare and contrast: the Cornish cliffs. The grey, grey sea. The manly stare. The devoted onlooker(s). The key story you’re missing when you’re election-obsessed Fox News in the US has apologised after wrongly reporting that a man had been shot “multiple times by police” in Baltimore, a city already riven with tension after six police officers were charged in connection with the death of Freddie Gray.

Ditlev Engel, chief executive of Vestas, wrote in a comment for the Guardian on Thursday: \"The failure to establish a firm 2030 power sector carbon cap prolongs uncertainty for the supply chain where investment time horizons extend well beyond 2020. This is a significant missed opportunity. Over the last year the onshore wind sector has been politically vilified. Such attacks add to the political risk attributed to the entire UK wind industry.\" Vestas pulled out of its wind turbine manufacturing plants in the Isle of Wight and Southampton with the loss of 425 jobs in 2009. But the company retains research facilities in the UK and is considering a future expansion. Engel's warning comes ahead of the publication of the energy bill on Thursday, which the government says will trigger billions of investment in the UK's power generation. But ministers have been at loggerheads over the role of wind power, and the government's emphasis on gas-fired generation – with plans to build at least 20 new gas power stations – has been attacked by green campaigners. Engel said: \"Broader political agreement over the increased use of wind energy in the UK is needed. There is a common misunderstanding that it is possible to be vehemently anti-onshore wind while promoting the development of offshore wind. That is not the case. There is one wind industry in the UK, with largely the same developers, financiers and manufacturers operating across both the offshore and onshore environment.\" David Cameron has been one of those championing offshore wind, while appointing John Hayes as energy minster – even though Hayes has been notably hostile to windfarms, and campaigned against a planned onshore development in his constituency. Engel warned that the spillover effects from these rows would put off renewable energy investment. He said: \"Offshore investors witnessing the attacks on the onshore sector are left wondering if they might be next. Political consensus needs to give confidence across the whole wind sector.\" This could endanger the tens of billions of investment that is currently under consideration by some of the world's biggest wind turbine manufacturers. General Electric, Siemens and others are considering plants around the coast that could generate thousands of jobs. Last week, the energy secretary, Ed Davey, disclosed key details of the energy bill – promising a tripling of the money energy companies can add to bills to pay for renewables from £2.35bn this year to nearly £10bn at the end of this decade. Adjusting for inflation that would be worth £7.6bn in today's prices, an increase of nearly three times. Engel said this had helped to raise confidence among investors. But key details have still not been set out, including the \"strike price\" for renewable technologies and for nuclear power, which will determine how much return such companies can make on their investments. Those details will not be known until the middle of next year, and renewable supporters have been concerned that this would lead to a delay in building the infrastructure needed. Engel confirmed this: \"Final investment decisions for projects supported under the new support scheme are unlikely until the new arrangements are in place.\" Engel also confirmed that Vestas remained interested in the UK, despite its factory closures. He said new prototypes of offshore windfarms would be tested in the Isle of Wight. However, Vestas currently has no specific plans for expansion in the UK."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2010/sep/06/germany-extend-nuclear-power-stations","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-09-06T13:59:00Z","webTitle":"Germany agrees to extend life of nuclear power stations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/06/germany-extend-nuclear-power-stations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2010/sep/06/germany-extend-nuclear-power-stations","fields":{"headline":"Germany agrees to extend life of nuclear power stations","bodyText":"The German government today agreed to extend the working lives of its nuclear reactors by an average of 12 years, in a controversial move that will shape the energy strategy of Europe's largest nation for decades to come. Having put the seal on a deal that was hammered out after lengthy talks between politicians and power companies, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, hailed it as a \"revolution in energy provision\". She said it would help to ensure Germany's place at the forefront of \"the most environmentally and worldwide most efficient\" energy policy. Under the agreement, the four power companies E.ON, RWE, EnBW and Vattenfall have agreed to pay the German government €30bn (£25bn) to allow the operating lives of its 17 nuclear plants to be extended. The companies will also pay €2.3bn in nuclear-fuel rods tax over the next six years, as well as an annual €300m for the next two years and €200m between 2013 and 2016 into a special renewable energy investment fund. The decision marks a turnaround on the decision reached almost a decade ago under the Social Democratic (SPD) and Green party coalition of Gerhard Schröder to phase out nuclear power early in the next decade. Opposition politicians and environmental groups referred to today variously as \"heartbreaking\" and \"a black day\". Sigmar Gabriel, leader of the SPD, said it was a \"black day for energy policy\", and accused the government of selling out to the energy lobby. \"The security of the Germans has been sold to four large companies,\" he said. \"Never before has the impression been given so shamefacedly that politics can be bought.\" The decision could prove the government's hardest test yet, at a time when its popularity ratings are suffering. According to recent polls, most Germans are in favour of phasing out nuclear power as soon as possible. Experts have predicted that the issue could put new wind back in the sails of the Green party, which has pledged to reverse the decision if it gets into government. Merkel now faces the tough challenge of trying to ensure that any draft law bypasses the Bundesrat, or upper house of parliament, where she lost her majority earlier this year. Greenpeace energy expert Tobias Münchmeyer said extending the lives of the plants amounted to little more than \"a pure monetary gift from the government\", which \"damages Germany while being of advantage to the companies\". He said the decision would also lead to the production of \"thousands of tonnes\" of additional atomic waste, and with it, the problem of where and how to store it. The conservative government in neighbouring Austria condemned the decision, referring to it as a \"disappointment\" and a \"retrograde step\" for energy policy. \"Germany has simply made it easier for itself to keep its CO2 emissions down,\" said Austrian environment minister Nikolaus Berlakovich, who added that the future lay in renewable energies. \"What's clear is that atomic energy is no answer to climate change and no sustainable way in which to reduce CO2 emissions,\" he said. A protest against the decision has been scheduled for 18 September in Berlin. But Merkel, who spent a week in August touring nuclear power plants and alternative energy producers, said it was precisely to ensure the embracing of renewable energy that she had agreed to keep nuclear power plants running for longer. She said nuclear power would be a \"bridge\" that would allow more time for reliable and affordable technologies to be developed. Merkel pointed to the renewable energy investment fund, whereby nuclear utilities will effectively pay part of their gains from the extension to develop renewable energy. The decision was reached following a report that said Germany would not be able to reach to its goal of reducing CO2 emissions by 80% in 2050, compared to 1990 levels, if it abandoned nuclear power too soon."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2012/feb/17/nuclear-deal-britain-climate-change","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2012-02-17T18:55:27Z","webTitle":"This nuclear deal is good for Britain and the battle against climate change | Mark Lynas","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/feb/17/nuclear-deal-britain-climate-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2012/feb/17/nuclear-deal-britain-climate-change","fields":{"headline":"This nuclear deal is good for Britain and the battle against climate change","bodyText":"Although the UK-French nuclear power deal signed by David Cameron and Nicolas Sarkozy today does not add up to much in terms of its details – a few hundred millions here and there, not much in the multi-billion-pound world of civil nuclear generation – it does send an important political signal: Britain and France will not follow Germany down the path of eschewing nuclear power. Instead, the governments and industries of both countries will work closely together to up the pace of nuclear new-build in the UK. This matters, because within the next 10 years all but one of our current fleet of nuclear reactors will be decommissioned – meaning the UK will lose nearly a fifth of its electricity-generation capacity, all of it zero-carbon. Even if we build windmills flat-out and stick solar panels on as many buildings as we can afford, this lost nuclear capacity must be urgently replaced – or Britain's carbon emissions will inevitably rise as we burn more coal and gas to bridge the gap. It is instructive that the German Green party is now weakening climate targets at a state level – precisely because the nuclear phase-out leaves the country more reliant on domestic dirty brown coal and imported Russian gas. Despite insisting that climate change remains their pre-eminent concern, greens around Europe insist on putting their anti-nuclear ideology ahead of any concern for the stability of our planet's climate. Both Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth are effectively lobbying for more gas plants in their anti-nuclear campaigning, making a mockery of their years spent raising awareness of global warming. Although a small number of \"environmentalist\" protesters (eight at the last count) have already moved onto the proposed site for the UK's two first new nuclear stations at Hinkley Point in Somerset, today's Anglo-French deal makes it far less likely that they will have their way and stop or delay new nuclear construction. Hinkley is in line for Britain's first two EPRs – a new \"generation-III\"-type power station able to pump out a hefty 1.6 gigawatts of zero-carbon power at full capacity. The EPR also includes protection against airline impacts for its reactor dome and an impressive array of safety features, which would make a Fukushima-style meltdown vanishingly unlikely and any radiation properly containable even if the worst ever did happen. Unfortunately, all these new safety features help make the EPR fabulously expensive: two EPR reactors under construction in Finland at Olkiluoto, and in France at Flamanville are both years behind schedule and billions over budget. Although these might be passed off as first-of-a-kind engineering problems – and indeed the two other EPRs under construction at Taishan, in China, are proceeding on budget and on time – the UK government is clearly nervous about the abilities of Areva and EDF (both state-owned French companies) to get the flagship Hinkley Point plants built and generating power for the grid by the planned dates of 2018 and 2019 respectively. There is also a danger that Britain will become over-reliant on France for its nuclear capacity, although today's deal with Rolls-Royce for power-station components potentially worth £400m offsets this somewhat. Areva in particular is currently lobbying heavily for the UK government to commit to a new plant (likely at Sellafield) to convert the country's 100-tonne plutonium stockpile into \"mixed-oxide\" fuel (MOX), which can be burned in its EPR stations. However – as the Guardian recently revealed – there are fourth-generation technologies already available that can dispose of both plutonium and waste stockpiles much more reliably and cheaply. Today's deal does envisage some fourth-generation nuclear co-operation – on a prototype sodium-cooled fast reactor called Astrid – but France does not envisage deployment until 2040 at the earliest. The UK could and should be much more ambitious, because new fast reactors offer a way of solving the nuclear waste problem by burning up all the long-lived elements that make current waste a concern for tens of thousands of years, and leaving only a smaller residue that is effectively safe within just three centuries. But the Prism reactors, which recycle and burn waste, are offered not by a French company but by GE-Hitachi, a US-based firm. Moreover, GE's new ESBWR boiling water reactor may offer a higher degree of passive safety, and cheaper construction, than the EPR – though this, of course, is not something that Sarkozy would ever admit to Cameron. Whichever models of reactor are chosen for Britain – and Westinghouse's AP1000 is also in the running, for the site at Wylfa in Anglesey and perhaps elsewhere – decisions need to be made soon. Current government plans envisage a hefty 19 gigawatts of new nuclear capacity available by 2025, but if this vision is to become a reality the UK needs to get a move on. Hopefully today's deal will be a help rather than a hindrance in this much-needed energy and climate effort. • Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2013/dec/15/george-osborne-public-spending-taxpayers-money","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2013-12-15T07:04:00Z","webTitle":"Let's rethink the idea of the state: it must be a catalyst for big, bold ideas  | Mariana Mazzucato","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/15/george-osborne-public-spending-taxpayers-money","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/15/george-osborne-public-spending-taxpayers-money","fields":{"headline":"Let's rethink the idea of the state: it must be a catalyst for big, bold ideas","bodyText":"In his epic book, The End of Laissez-Faire (1926), John Maynard Keynes wrote a sentence that should be the guiding light for politicians around the globe. \"The important thing for government is not to do things which individuals are doing already, and to do them a little better or a little worse; but to do those things which at present are not done at all.\" In other words, the point of public policy is to make big things happen that would not have happened anyway. To do this, big budgets are not enough: big thinking and big brains are key. While economists usually talk about things that are not done at all (or done inadequately) by the private sector as \"public goods\", investments in \"big\" public goods like the UK national health service, or the investments that led to new technologies behind putting a \"man on the moon\", required even more than fixing the \"public good\" problem. They required the willingness and ability to dream up big \"missions\". The current narrative we are being sold about the state as a \"meddler\" in capitalism is putting not only these missions under threat, but even more narrowly defined public goods. Public goods are goods whose benefits are spread so widely that it is hard for business to profit from them (or stop others profiting from them). So they don't attract private investment. Examples include transport infrastructure, healthcare, research and education. Even if you're an avid free-marketeer you can't avoid benefiting, directly and indirectly, from such public investments. You gain directly through the roads you drive down, the rules and policing which ensure their safety, the BBC radio you listen to, schools and universities that train the doctors and pilots you depend on, parks, theatre, films and museums that nurture our national identity. You also gain, indirectly, through enormous public subsidies without which private schools, hospitals and utility providers would never be able to deliver affordably and still make a profit. These are conferred as tax breaks, and provision of vital skills and infrastructure at state expense. While social welfare is relentlessly trimmed and targeted, corporate welfare grows inexorably, as business widens its relief from the taxes that fund public infrastructure (while tax credits top-up its less generous wage packets). And the non-appropriable benefits of knowledge – costly to produce, cheap to acquire and use once published – spread the influence of public goods much wider. Nuclear fusion, fuel cells, asset-pricing formulas and genome maps are discoveries for all, not just one company. But it now seems like the doubters, those who contest the idea of \"public goods\", have won the contest. The state's provision of many of these goods – notably transport, education, housing and healthcare – is being privatised or outsourced at an increasing rate. Indeed privatisation and outsourcing are happening at such a rapid pace in the UK they are practically being given away – as the sale of Royal Mail at rock bottom prices revealed recently – denying the state a return for its near-century long investment. Yet because we are told the state is simply a \"spender\" and meddling \"regulator\", and not a key investor in valuable goods and services, it is easier to deny the state a return from its investment: risk is socialised, rewards privatised. This not only eliminates any return on public investment but also destroys institutions that have taken decades to build up, and rapidly erodes any idea of public service distinct from private profit. When public goods are privatised they lose their \"public good\" nature: it does become possible to profit from distributing mail, running trains, renting out homes and providing education. We're continually promised that, due to efficiency gains and innovations prompted by the profit motive, public goods can be delivered more cheaply and effectively by the private sector. All this while still giving their providers a decent profit, so that more is invested. Has privatisation of UK rail provided lower prices, more innovation and investment? Has contracting-out prison security to G4S made that system more efficient and high quality? Have outsourced NHS services provided the taxpayer with higher quality healthcare that's still free of charge and assigned on merit? Users' impressions and regulators' performance indicators give at best a mixed signal on service quality. Private firms' commercial confidentiality – often a stark contrast with the right-to-know approach to public enterprise – makes it hard to identify or measure any changes in efficiency. So the state is robbed of its deserved returns of investment, and public services are worsening – but is the state at least relieved of the associated costs and financial burden? No. What's very clear is that while private profits are now being made, public subsidy has not disappeared. The UK government explicitly subsidises its \"privatised\" utilities, with net transfers amounting to (among others) more than £2bn annually for train operating companies, and £10bn in investment guarantees alone for new nuclear power station builders (these, ironically, include other countries' state-owned utility firms – willing to advance their capital under the generous long-term price arrangements offered by the government, while their privatised UK counterparts like Centrica dismiss these as too risky and return their cash to shareholders). Private companies can receive further implicit subsidies through investment guarantees and tax breaks; ad hoc assistance (such as meeting energy firms' decommissioning costs, and taking over pension liabilities to enable privatisation, as with Royal Mail and the remnants of the coal industry); rules that enable the circumvention of corporate taxes that are already below income-tax rates (and falling fast); and the assurance that the state will step back in to repossess (without penalty) any operations the private sector finds too expensive, as with Network Rail and the East Coast train-operating franchise. But in the US, UK and all across Europe, where it's almost universally argued that today's governments are too big, these subsidies are rarely called into question. The debate focuses on the need for public debt levels to come down. And since taxes are judged to be too high – on the basis of very unclear arguments regarding incentives – debt reduction ends up relying on massive public-spending cuts. Growth will supposedly be stimulated by reducing the size of the public sector though privatisation and outsourcing – alongside the eternally-promised reduction of tax and \"red tape\", which is seen to be hindering an otherwise dynamic private sector. Typically, the last UK budget focused on targeted tax reductions which are more fairly termed \"tax expenditures\", lifting a \"burden\" from companies that other sectors (mainly public services) will have to absorb. These include a drop in corporation tax to 20% from April 2015 (explicitly designed to undercut the rest of the G20), more reliefs from national insurance, and reductions in regulation – always hailed as reducing cost, despite the financial sector's recent warning on where those short-term savings can later lead. Is tax too high? In the US, the top marginal income tax rate was close to 90% under Republican president Dwight Eisenhower – widely recognised as reigning over one of the highest growth periods in US history. Today the total US tax bill is the lowest it has ever been. The spending cuts about to hit the US – the infamous \"sequester\", which will damage institutions ranging from Nasa to social services – would not be needed if the US tax bill (24.8% of GDP) were only four percentage points lower than the OECD average (33.4%), instead of eight points. Yet tax cuts usually achieve no discernible increase in investment, only a measurable increase in inequality. This is because what actually guides business investment is not the \"bottom line\" (costs, as affected by tax) but anticipation of where the future big technological and market opportunities are. In the UK, Pfizer did not move its largest R&amp;D lab in Sandwich, Kent to Boston due to lower tax or regulation but due to the £32bn a year that the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) spends on the bio-medical knowledge base that feeds them. Equally, although it was the National Venture Capital Association that in the mid-1970s negotiated huge reductions in US capital gains tax (from 40% to 20% in just six years), venture capital was actually following the footsteps of strategic public funding. In biotech, it entered the game 15 years after the state did the hard stuff. And when the UK's Labour government reduced the minimum time for private equity investment to qualify for similar tax breaks from 10 to two years,it made venture capital even more short-termist, increasing golfing time not investing time. For the private sector, opportunities lie not in the creation of major new knowledge and technology but in the returns on investment in \"intellectual property\" that others have commissioned and not yet commercialised. Profit flows from privately capturing the \"external benefits\" conferred by public goods, when the public sector continues to underwrite them The challenge today is to bring back knowledge and expertise into government that can drive the big missions of the future. Yet current de-skilling and de-capacitating government will not allow that. As I discuss in my new book, The Entrepreneurial State: debunking private vs. public sector myths, all the technologies that make the iPhone so smart were indeed pioneered by a well-funded US government: the internet, GPS, touch-screen display, and even the latest Siri voice-activated personal assistant. All of these came out of agencies that were driven by missions, mainly around security – and funding not only the upstream \"public good\" research but also applied research and early-stage funding for companies. New missions today should be expanded around problems posed by climate change, ageing, inequality and youth unemployment. But while it's great that Steve Jobs had the genius to put those government technologies into a well-designed gadget, and great, more generally, for entrepreneurs to surf this publicly funded wave, who will fund the next wave with starved public budgets and a financialised and tax-avoiding private sector? As the late historian Tony Judt used to stress, we should invent and impose a new narrative and new terminology to describe the role of government. The language being used to describe government activity is illuminating. The recent RBS sale was depicted as government retaining the \"bad\" debt, and selling the \"good\" debt to the private sector. The contrast could not be starker: bad government, good business – a needless inversion of the public good. And public investments in long-term areas like R&amp;D are described as government only \"de-risking\" the private sector, when actually what it is doing is actively and courageously taking on the risk precisely where the private sector – increasingly more concerned with the price of stock options than long-run growth opportunities – is too scared to tread. Once the entrepreneurial and risk-taking role of government is admitted, this should result in a sharing of the rewards – whether through equity of retaining a golden share of the patent rights. By privatising public goods, outsourcing government functions, and the constant state bashing (government as \"meddler\", at best \"de-risker\") we are inevitably killing the ability of government to think big and make things happen that otherwise would not have happened. The state starts to lose its capabilities, capacity, knowledge and expertise. Examples that counter this trend – and language – should be celebrated. When the BBC invested in iPlayer – the world's most innovative platform for online broadcasting – instead of outsourcing it, it went against the grain. It brought brains and knowledge into a public sector institution. When recently the Government Digital Services (GDS) – part of the UK's Cabinet Office – wanted to create its own website, the usual solution was to outsource it to Serco, a private company that has recently won many government contracts (even Obamacare insurance work). Dissatisfied with the mediocre site that Serco offered, GDS brought in coders and engineers with iPlayer experience, who went on to produce an award-winning website that is costing the government a fraction of what Serco was charging. And in so doing also made government smarter – attracting, not haemorrhaging, the knowledge and capabilities required for dreaming up the missions of the future. To foster growth we must not downsize the state but rethink it. That means developing, not axing, competences and dynamism in the public sector. When evaluating its performance, we must rediscover the point of the public sector: to make things happen that would not have happened anyway. When the BBC is accused of \"crowding out\" private broadcasters, the difference in quality of the programmes is considered a subjective issue not worthy of economic analysis. Yet it is only by observing and measuring that difference that we can accurately judge its performance. The same is true for the ability of public sector institutions not only to subsidise pharmaceutical companies but actually to transform the technological and market landscape on which they operate. The public sector must produce public goods, and through the creation of new missions catalyse investment by the private sector – inspiring and supporting it to enter in high-risk areas it would not normally approach. To do so it requires the ability to attract top expertise – to \"pick\" broadly defined directions, as IT and internet were picked in the past, and \"green\" should be picked in the future. Some investments will win, some will fail. Indeed, Obama's recent $500m guaranteed loan to a solar company Solyndra failed, while the same investment in Tesla's electric motor won big time – making Elon Musk richer. But as long as we admit the state is a risk-taking courageous investor in the areas the private sector avoids, it should increase its courage by earning back a reward for such successes, which can fund not only the (inevitable) losses but also the next round of investments. Instead, calling it names for the losses, ignoring the wins, and outsourcing the competence and capabilities, is ridding it of the courage, ability and brains to create the missions, hence opportunities, of the future. And without brains, all government will be able to do is not make big things happen but simply serve a private sector that is concerned only with serving itself.

Some areas saw as much as 2½ft of the white stuff, with drivers in badly affected states ordered to stay off hazardous roads. Here's a state-by-state round-up of how the storm has impacted on the area. Connecticut Up to 3ft of snow was recorded in some areas of Connecticut, one of the worst hit states. As the storm gathered pace, governor Dannel Malloy imposed a travel ban on the state's highways and deployed national guard troops around the state for rescues or other emergencies. A coastal flood warning was posted for southern Fairfield County. Friday evening's high tide was expected to have been 3 to 5ft higher than normal in western Long Island Sound. The state's two biggest utilities planned for the possibility that up to 30% of their customers – more than 400,000 homes and businesses – would lose power. As of early Saturday, more than 35,000 had no service. Non-essential state workers had been ordered to stay home Friday. Schools, colleges and state courthouses were also closed. All flights after 1.30pm at Bradley airport near Hartford were cancelled, and Connecticut transit ceased all bus service from Friday. Meanwhile, some gas stations reported running out of fuel due to the rush to prepare for the storm. Maine Snowfall totalling 29in was recorded at Portland International Jetport by Saturday morning, setting an all-time record for the city. Officials cautioned drivers to stay off the roads, with police reporting numerous vehicles getting stuck in deep drifts. The storm was blamed for a 19-car pileup in Cumberland on Friday that took four hours to clear. Meanwhile races in the national toboggan championships were postponed for a day on Saturday Massachusetts Hundreds of thousands of residents in Massachusetts were without electricity Saturday morning after heavy snow and winds wiped out power lines. Governor Deval Patrick declared a state of emergency Friday and ordered a state-wide travel ban, believed to be the first since the blizzard of 1978. In Plymouth, the Pilgrim Nuclear Power Plant lost power and automatically shut down during the storm. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission said there's no threat to public safety. In total, some 400,000 people were affected by blackouts. Meanwhile, widespread damage was reported along coastal regions with further storm surges expected. New Hampshire A blizzard warning remains in effect until 4pm Saturday for portions of the state. Hundreds of schools were closed Friday, airlines cancelled flights and sporting and civic events were postponed as governor Maggie Hassan declared a state of emergency. People were encouraged to stay indoors, and state-run liquor stores closed at 6pm Friday. But as of Saturday morning, the New Hampshire's Office of Emergency Management was reporting no major problems caused by the storm. There remained concern over the potential for flooding in the coastal town of Hampton. New Jersey A blizzard warning for north-east New Jersey suggested that as much as 14 inches of snow could hit the state and Governor Chris Christie urged everyone to just stay home. But as of Saturday morning, it appeared the state had escaped much of the damage. State police and the Office of Emergency Management reported few power outages, and only minor traffic incidents. Meanwhile Newark airport – one of the main hubs serving neighbouring New York City – was reopened on Saturday, but with flight delays. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo declared a state of emergency as snow fell heavily Friday afternoon, but as with New Jersey, the storm resulted in very few blackouts. On Saturday Cuomo announced that he was sending resources to Connecticut and Massachusetts as the neighbouring states suffered far worse than New York. Nonetheless, the storm brought massive disruption Friday to the state's transportation system, with around 2,300 flights cancelled. Flights to New York Cityy resumed Saturday morning. Snow ploughs cleared snow off major streets in New York City on Saturday, and the subway system remained running throughout. At its deepest, snow in the city ran to 10 to 12 inches. Outside of the city, roads remained treacherous, resulting in at least one death. A 74-year-old man died after being struck by a car in Poughkeepsie; the driver said she lost control in the snowy conditions, police said Pennsylvania Pennsylvania was spared the worst of the storm, although residents in parts of Philadelphia awoke to up to four inches of snow. Utility companies reported around 1,200 customers were left without power Friday night. Rhode Island Parts of Rhode Island were covered in a 2ft blanket of snow Saturday morning. Meanwhile utility companies reported 185,000 customers suffered blackouts at the height of the storm Interstate 95 and other major highways were closed to traffic and transportation officials limited commercial traffic on the Newport Pell Bridge because of winds gusting more than 60 mph. Vermont The storm was blamed for a multiple-vehicle accident and a series of other crashes on Interstate 89 in Bolton and South Burlington. Southeastern parts of state saw a foot of snow fall overnight. Ontario, Canada At least 350 traffic collisions were reported in Toronto, and at least three people died in southern Ontario as a result of the storm. Meanwhile, an 80-year-old woman in Hamilton collapsed while shoveling her driveway, and two men were killed in car crashes, one of them in a multi-vehicle collision."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2012/jan/31/iaea-approves-tests-japan-reactors","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-01-31T08:15:07Z","webTitle":"IAEA approves stress tests on Japan reactors","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/31/iaea-approves-tests-japan-reactors","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/jan/31/iaea-approves-tests-japan-reactors","fields":{"headline":"IAEA approves stress tests on Japan reactors","bodyText":"Japan's attempts to restart nuclear reactors that were shut down in the wake of the Fukushima Daiichi accident were boosted after UN inspectors gave their backing to stress tests designed to confirm the reactors' safety. Inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] said the reactor assessments were \"generally consistent\" with the body's own safety standards, despite concern among some experts that the tests are flawed. The IAEA's upbeat appraisal was expected, and does not guarantee that Japan's nuclear authorities will be able to put reactors back into service amid growing opposition from host communities in the wake of the Fukushima disaster. The team arrived in Japan nine days ago at the invitation of the Japanese government to review stress tests being conducted by the country's industrial and nuclear safety agency (Nisa). The tests, in which computer simulations are used to gauge the reactors' ability to withstand severe events such as earthquakes and tsunami, were ordered after a triple meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi in March unleashed large amounts of radiation into the environment. The accident, the worst involving nuclear power since Chernobyl 25 years ago, forced the evacuation of more than 80,000 residents living within a 12-mile (20km) radius of the plant. Almost a year on from the disaster, none of the residents has been allowed to return home; some have been warned their old neighbourhoods may remain uninhabitable for years. James Lyons, the leader of the 10-member IAEA team, said: \"We concluded that Nisa's instructions to power plants and its review process for the comprehensive safety assessments are generally consistent with IAEA safety standards.\" Nisa officials said their first evaluation showed that two idle reactors at a plant in Oi, western Japan, were able to withstanding a disaster similar to the magnitude 9 earthquake and tsunami that wrecked Fukushima Daiichi. But two experts who sit on a panel advising Nisa on the safety appraisal said the stress tests were too limited in scope and did not prove that nuclear reactors were safe, adding that the IAEA visit was simply a public relations exercise. \"It is obvious that a visit by an international organisation advocating nuclear power is part of a political agenda that is built into a story already finished in advance,\" Professor Hiromitsu Ino of Tokyo University and Masashi Goto, a former nuclear plant design engineer, said in a statement. Quake damage and scheduled safety checks prompted by the Fukushima accident mean that all but three of Japan's 54 reactors are out of service. Without approval for restarts, Japan will be without a single operating nuclear reactor by the end of April. The trade and industry minister, Yukio Edano, has said, however, the country can survive the summer free of power cuts even without nuclear power. The prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, believes Japan needs to retain a number of reactors while it develops alternative energy sources. The Fukushima crisis forced the country to abandon plans to generate more than 50% of its power from nuclear by 2030. Towns that host nuclear power plants have criticised the government for introducing the tests before the official investigation into the Fukushima accident is complete. Local approval is not legally required to restart a reactor, but few believe the government will bring plants back online without public support. In another measure designed to bolster public confidence in nuclear power, the cabinet on Tuesday approved legislation that will end the nuclear safety agency's organisational ties to the trade and industry ministry. The ministry has been criticised for failing to recognise the dangers posed by nuclear power and for its close ties to utilities. The bill would also limit a reactor's operational lifespan to 40 years, with a controversial one-time extension of 20 years for those that pass additional safety tests. One of the six reactors at Fukushima Daiichi went into service 41 years ago."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2013/may/05/nothing-wrong-low-carbon-strong-government","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2013-05-04T23:04:24Z","webTitle":"There's nothing wrong with low-carbon policy that strong government can't fix","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/may/05/nothing-wrong-low-carbon-strong-government","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2013/may/05/nothing-wrong-low-carbon-strong-government","fields":{"headline":"There's nothing wrong with low-carbon policy that strong government can't fix","bodyText":"The UK's energy policy is not \"plausible\" and a \"crisis\" is inevitable. That is the view of Peter Atherton, a respected utilities analyst who works for Liberum Capital, an investment bank in the City. Atherton is convinced that successive UK governments have grossly underestimated the engineering, financial and economic challenges posed by the planned move from a high-carbon electricity sector to a low-carbon one. He believes that the cost of switching from largely coal- and gas-fired power stations to a mix of gas-, wind- and nuclear-generated electricity will cost more than £160bn by 2020 and more than £375bn 10 years later. He warns that it means \"electricity bills rising by at least 30% by 2020 and 100% by 2030 in real terms.\" That would be political dynamite and Atherton knows it. He predicts that there will be three groups of \"casualties\": the government, consumers and investors. This apocalyptic scenario – contained in an investment note issued last week – will warm the hearts of many in the City (and possibly some in the Treasury) who believe the green agenda is a giant waste of money. It will alarm the wider community who accept that climate change must be tackled, and those who believe a \"carbon bubble\" is developing around fossil fuel companies whose assets are overvalued in a world turning away from coal and oil. And it is clearly at odds with the ideas of ministers such as Ed Davey, the energy secretary, whose Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) calculated last month that \"household dual fuel bills are estimated to be on average 11% (or £166) less in 2020 than they would be without policies being pursued.\" Those figures do, however, involve some heroic assumptions about energy-efficiency measures being implemented. But Atherton is not the only one in the City asking difficult questions. Harold Hutchinson, a utilities analyst with Investec Securities, is also deeply sceptical about the UK's nuclear strategy. Britain is waiting to see whether EDF and DECC can agree on plans to construct reactors at Hinkley Point in Somerset – the first new nuclear generation plant in this country since Sizewell B opened in 1995. The deadline for a decision to be taken has slipped back as the two sides haggle over the financing commitment – we are really talking subsidies here – that the government is willing to give to the French company. The coalition has set much store on new nuclear but is balking at guaranteeing a price of over £100 per megawatt hour. Hutchinson points out that the last time nuclear was built in Britain there was the state-owned Central Electricity Generating Board to help. Similarly, the current list of newbuild projects in France, Finland and the Czech Republic all have the state as the major shareholder. \"The real political question is whether the UK has the stomach to underwrite the (very real) cost risks associated with ensuring that nuclear power can flourish. To date, that remains an open question,\" he concludes. To make matters more difficult, Britain has sold off the atomic technology group Westinghouse, as well as British Nuclear Fuels, and is now talking of doing the same with its stake in Urenco, the uranium enrichment company. One suspects Atherton, who encourages the few British-owned energy suppliers such as Centrica and SSE to \"limit their future exposure\" in the UK, is building a case under which our low-carbon ambitions are junked and we revert to fossil fuels – which only \"cost less\" because the damage to the environment they cause is currently given no financial value. This strategy is implausible. Any \"crisis\" stems from the government's unwillingness to use the power of the state to ensure local companies build a network fit for tomorrow at a cost the consumer can bear. If David Cameron is looking for a patriotic mission to head off the Ukip surge, then instead of funding a futile war in Kabul, he could start ensuring domestic energy security through the proper funding of the new Green Investment Bank in Edinburgh. A cooling-off period will stop trackers getting the blues Shortly before a little-known mining company known as Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation (ENRC) was floated on the stock market in 2007, its directors went on a course to learn about \"what it means to run a public listed company\". The details were reported by the Observer's sister publication, the Guardian, last week. A team of big-name lawyers and bankers spouted their advice on how directors should behave once the company was listed in London. No one in attendance should have been in any doubt that the contents of the awayday mattered. The cachet of a London listing should not be forgotten. London is regarded as a top-notch place to float shares – and, crucially, has an army of index-tracking funds left with little option but to hoover up stakes in newly listed companies, especially ones that are immediately catapulted into the FTSE 100 blue-chip index. In 2007, ENRC was one of them. The index-trackers ploughed into a company that is now beset by rows about its boardroom structure and is under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office regarding fraud allegations. Those index-tracking funds found themselves stuck with an investment in a company where the saga just keeps running and running and where the share price has fallen 80% – seemingly with very little chance of staging a recovery. Little wonder that the City is facing questions about what can be done to avoid index-trackers becoming involved with unproven companies such as ENRC – or potentially a smaller company such as the one-time shell business Bumi, which won a place in the next tier down, the FTSE 250. How about this for a fast and simple solution? A moratorium on tracker funds buying up new companies entering the blue-chip index for, say, two years. During that time, all of the skeletons would be blown out of the cupboards – helping the trackers to avoid being dragged into hazardous areas in future. RBS must be done with musical chairs before a share sale The starting gun has not quite been fired on a share sale for Royal Bank of Scotland, but it has certainly been cocked. And there is no doubt that last week's talk by chairman Sir Philip Hampton about the possibility of a prospectus being drawn up next year was encouraged by the Treasury. Before a prospectus can be drafted, however, a number of hurdles must be overcome. One of them is the issue of the top management team. By the time of any share sale, the finance director, Bruce van Saun, is likely to have moved to the US arm, Citizens, and been replaced by insider Nathan Bostock. But what about the chief executive, Stephen Hester? He wants to stay on until a sale is achieved – and so he should. But he will face questions about long he should hang around afterwards. It is time for RBS to be more transparent about its succession planning."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2013/feb/27/centrica-british-gas-increase-profit","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2013-02-27T20:57:21Z","webTitle":"Fury at Centrica's £2.7bn dash for cash","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/feb/27/centrica-british-gas-increase-profit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2013/feb/27/centrica-british-gas-increase-profit","fields":{"headline":"Fury at Centrica's £2.7bn dash for cash","bodyText":"The acrimonious debate over soaring energy bills and mounting fuel poverty reignited when British Gas – the biggest energy supplier in the UK – unveiled an 11% increase in profits and its parent group, Centrica, promised a £1.3bn handout to its shareholders just months after pushing through an increase in household bills. Campaign groups warned that 160,000 children had been dragged into fuel poverty by the actions of the big six energy suppliers since 2010, while trade union bosses accused energy chiefs of \"creaming off\" profits. Dividends of more than £3.5bn have now been paid out by Centrica over the last five years. Anger was exacerbated by confirmation that Phil Bentley, British Gas's managing director, will stand down with a combined pay and pension package worth more than £10m. British Gas imposed a 6% price rise last November, adding £80 to the average annual gas and electricity bill for the 8.4 million households it serves. Centrica argued that the average profit figure of £50 per British Gas household represented a profit margin of only 5%, which it said was a similar return to supermarkets. The company said the profits had allowed the energy group to invest £50bn to secure new wholesale gas supplies from countries such as Norway and Russia. \"It's important that Centrica makes a fair and reasonable return so that we can continue to make our contribution to society and to invest,\" said Sam Laidlaw, the chief executive of Centrica. \"Last year we incurred a tax charge of over £1bn and invested over £2bn to secure new sources of energy for the UK, well in excess of our profits.\" But the campaign group Fuel Poverty Action warned that the British Gas profit of more than £600m would send a \"shiver down the spine\" of customers, with some facing the choice between heating and eating due to recent price hikes. \"These profits were made on the back of forcing millions into fuel poverty and from a 'dash for gas' that will send bills even higher as well as contributing to rising food prices through climate change,\" said the campaign's spokesman, James Granger. \"People are angry and want the alternative to the big six's monopoly: cheaper, clean, renewable energy under the control of communities, not greedy energy tycoons.\" Centrica reported operating profits of £2.7bn – up 14% – and announced plans to hand an additional £500m to shareholders this year by buying back, and then cancelling, its own shares. The process should increase the share price. Nick Luff, the finance director, said it was fair to give back cash to investors because Centrica had raised £2bn from them in 2008 to invest in new nuclear power stations. It has now dropped those plans. He urged customers to \"take action\" by installing more efficient boilers, improving insulation and utilising new technology such as smart meters. The Energy Bill Revolution, a campaign group formed by charities including Barnardo's plus old age and disability groups, warned that an extra 160,000 children had been forced to live in homes in fuel poverty over the last two years. The organisation warned that a further 25% increase in power bills could double the total number of people affected from 1.6 million to 3.2 million. It called on the prime minister to end the \"growing scandal\" of cold homes by using a carbon tax to make all UK homes super energy efficient. Meanwhile Dave Prentis, general secretary of the Unison union, said it was a scandal that so many children were now living in freezing homes while shareholders and directors were \"creaming\" off profits. \"The rise in fuel poverty is a blight on this country with hundreds and thousands of people joining the growing numbers now spending more than 10% of household income on energy costs. Without action we are sleepwalking into a very cold and dark future,\" he warned. The issue of soaring energy bills combined with fines for doorstep mis-selling and other abuses by the gas and electricity suppliers has triggered a raft of initiatives by the industry regulator, Ofgem, but campaigners and even politicians believe they are not nearly tough enough. The Labour party has said it will scrap Ofgem while a report by the all-party House of Commons energy and climate change select committee in December attacked the regulator's timidity. \"We find it unsatisfactory that Ofgem should be so hesitant about launching preliminary investigations into potentially anti-competitive behaviour,\" it said. The general climate of unease has not been helped by a Financial Services Authority inquiry into concerns about irregular trading in the wholesale gas market. Centrica and the other large energy companies such as RWE npower and E.ON have all instigated their own internal inquiries and say they are convinced none of their traders are at fault. Bentley, the 54-year-old former BP executive who has been at the centre of previous rows over the scale of big six energy company earnings, plans to leave British Gas by the end of the year and is apparently hoping to become a chief executive elsewhere.

But Chris Bain, director of Catholic development agency Cafod, points out that there are two St Francises. One was the founder of the Franciscan order and is the patron saint of the environment; the other was the much lesser-known Xavier, a Jesuit missionary who travelled the world widely, especially in Asia. Which Pope Francis will the world get? A man strong on progressive ideas and global issues, or a highly conservative one interested primarily in spreading the Catholic message? The choice of name was important but ambiguous, says Bain. \"He's not that well-known outside Argentina. We know he is very strong on social justice; a simple, humble man. It augurs well for global development. We would hope he can also get his message across to the rich world to live simpler lives.\" Cafod, one of 160 NGOs that come under the wing of the Vatican, collectively raising and distributing billions of dollars annually in poor communities, hopes the mission of the Catholic church will now move towards tackling poverty. \"To have a pope from Argentina, from Latin America, is a momentous decision. It demonstrates we are a universal church, one that is understanding of the fact that most of the church lives outside Europe and North America. I hope he will put global poverty, climate change and environmental degradation higher up the church agenda,\" says Bains. Francis may be a passionate defender of poor and disenfranchised but he is a relative innocent in global affairs. His handling of the powerful political forces at work in the faction-riven Vatican is likely to have equal influence on development. The Holy See has a unique place at the UN as a non-member state and permanent observer. The only religion to have this privilege, it has traditionally used it to directly influence policy by negotiating and voting on recommendations just like any national government. It has often used its voice to block consensus at international population and climate conferences, and mostly supports the US. But because of its formidable clout and direct reach to 1.2 billion people globally through its priests and missionaries, it is increasingly lobbied by countries and corporations. \"It's a small state heavily lobbied by the great powers, and seen as an easy listening post. Companies, too, know how influential it is and have been trying to influence it for years. To be fair, the Vatican has developed great expertise on the humanitarian side but not on the environmental side,\" says Sean McDonagh, an Irish Columban missionary, author of books on nuclear power and biodiversity, and an adviser to the Vatican. The influence of corporations and the way they try to manipulate the Catholic agenda is clearest in areas such as GM crops, where the Pontifical academy of sciences, based at the Vatican, takes positions on areas of moral and scientific importance, says McDonagh. In May 2009, after 40 scientists visited the Vatican to advise on transgenic crops and the direction of agriculture in developing countries, the Holy See concluded that scientists had both the right and the moral duty to be \"stewards of God\" by genetically modifying crops. The meeting was organised by academy member Igor Potrykus, a member of the academy, who had developed GM \"golden Rrice\", a strain that he has worked tirelessly, but unsuccessfully, to introduce to poor countries for more than 10 years. There were few, if any dissenters or people from developing countries at the meeting and almost all the experts were well-known supporters of the technology. They included a Monsanto employee, and the heads of many organisations and academic insitsutions that have taken large sums from GM companies.Though the group's opinions were not expressions of the Holy See, the biotech industry hailed the result as a breakthrough, a signal to Catholics that the pope favoured GM. A Wikileaks cable six months later was interpreted by a crowing US analyst as the Vatican being \"quietly supportive\" of the crops. \"[US agricultural company] Monsanto's representatives have continually pushed the leadership of the Catholic church into giving its blessing to GM crops, and then using that endorsement to undermine local bishops' conferences in Asia, Africa and Latin American that might be opposed to GM technology,\" says McDonagh. Whether it is GM crops, abortion, population, poverty, debt, wealth distribution or climate change, in a globalised world the Vatican's voice is massively important in developing countries. Wikileaks cables showed how the previous pope linked climate change to population. \"In the Vatican's view,\" the US ambassador to the Vatican wrote in 2009, \"unsustainable lifestyles in developed countries – and not population growth worldwide – is to blame for global warming.\". The ambassador added that the Vatican \"will continue to oppose aggressive population control measures to fight hunger or global warming\". The Vatican's direct influence on poverty, and its traditional closeness to conservative US politics, was most clearly seen in the 1970s and 80s, when it worked with the US government to stamp out \"liberation theology\" – a Marxist analysis of the Bible, implying preferential treatment for poor people, that became a powerful revolutionary movement to counter some of Latin America's most unjust, rightwing military regimes. Thousands of priests and bishops worked with social justice movements, landless peasants and indigenous people. More than 100 priests were murdered, including Archbishop Romero of El Salvador, believed to be one of Pope Francis's most important influences. Pope Francis's connections to liberation theology are disputed, but Leonardo Boff, the Brazilian intellectual theologian defrocked by the Vatican in the 1980s after publishing a book on liberation theology, told the New York Times: \"I am encouraged by this choice, viewing it as a pledge for a church of simplicity and of ecological ideals. What is more, Cardinal Bergoglio comes from the developing world, outside the walls of Rome.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2013/mar/15/greenland-government-oil-mining-resources","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2013-03-15T22:00:05Z","webTitle":"Greenland government falls as voters send warning to mining companies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/15/greenland-government-oil-mining-resources","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/mar/15/greenland-government-oil-mining-resources","fields":{"headline":"Greenland government falls as voters send warning to mining companies","bodyText":"The race for resources in the frozen wastes of the Arctic has brought down its first national government, leaving foreign oil and mining companies shivering about the future. Voters in Greenland feared that ministers were surrendering their country's interests to China and foreign multinationals and called an end this week to the government of prime minister Kuupik Kleist. London Mining, which has a former British foreign minister, Sir Nicholas Bonsor, on the board, has been at the centre of a row in the country after speculation it could bring in 2,000 Chinese workers to build one of the world's biggest iron ore mines expressly to serve steel mills in Beijing. The activities of Edinburgh-based Cairn Energy, which drilled for oil off Greenland's south-west coast in 2011, had also polarised opinion between those who welcomed the potential for a hydrocarbon strike bringing huge economic wealth and those worried about spills. The Siumut party in Greenland, led by Aleqa Hammond, has just won 42% of the vote, allowing it to form a coalition government in place of the current ruling party led by Kleist. The election campaign was dominated by a debate over the activities of foreign investors and concerns among the 57,000 population that Greenland's future could be dictated by the demands of potentially polluting new industries such as mining and oil rather than traditional Inuit trades of fishing and hunting. Hammond, 47, who was educated in Canada and brought up with traditional skills such as curing seal skins, said she would take a more critical look at Chinese mining investments in Greenland. She also pledged to increase royalties on miners and ensure they talked through staffing plans with trade unions. \"We are welcoming companies and countries that are interested in investing in Greenland,\" she said in her first interview since the election. \"At the same time we have to be aware of the consequences as a people. Greenland should work with countries that have the same values as we have, on how human rights should be respected. We are not giving up our values for investors' sake.\" Global warming has caused thawing of sea ice that has made drilling for offshore oil easier and opened up huge amounts of land which are believed to be stuffed with iron ore, copper and rare earth minerals used in tablets and mobile phones. There is still an acceptance in Greenland that foreign investment is needed to bring in revenues and allow the mainly self-governing country to escape economic dependence on an annual grant from its former colonial power Denmark. Although a rush by the main oil companies into the Arctic has led to some embarrassing setbacks – Cairn has found nothing off Greenland and Shell has just abandoned drilling plans for this summer off Alaska – there is still keen interest in the region, most notably off Russia. However, Shell was banned from work off Alaska by the US government this week until it came up with a more robust safety programme. Late last year, a UK House of Commons committee called for a halt to all drilling in the far north until a pan-Arctic response plan was in place. Joan Walley, chair of the environmental audit committee, said: \"The infrastructure to mount a big clean-up operation is simply not in place and conventional oil spill response techniques have not been proven to work in such severe conditions.\" Recently plans for onshore mining have triggered concern in Nuuk, the capital of Greenland. London Mining wants to spend more than £1.5bn on constructing a mine, pipeline and deep sea port in the south-west of the country. The company said it \"does not want to talk\" about the impact of the latest political upheaval on its plans but denied it had hired workers from China or anywhere else and said it would not do so until it had permission to proceed with its mine at Isua, 95 miles (150km) east of Nuuk, which could eventually produce 15m tonnes of iron ore a year. Others with plans are Greenland Minerals and Energy, an Australian-listed company, which wants to mine rare earth minerals at Kvanefjeld and – even more controversially – uranium to fuel nuclear power. A spokeswoman for the foreign office in Beijing said on Friday: \"To my knowledge, no Chinese enterprises have been granted oil, gas or mining licences. There are no Chinese workers entering Greenland.\" She said a single Chinese company is in the early stages of joining an investment project in Greenland. A report on the website of China's Ministry of Land and Resources said mining company Sichuan Xinye had held preliminary discussions with London Mining about eventually taking over the Isua scheme. Other Chinese companies digging for business in Greenland were said to include Jiangxi Zhongrun Mining and Jiangxi Union Mining. Beijing is more openly expansive about its hopes that the thawing ice in the Arctic Ocean will open a new, more direct, shipping route linking east and west. A Chinese shipping firm is planning the country's first commercial voyage across the Arctic Ocean to the United States and Europe in 2013, a leading Chinese scientist said earlier this week at a conference organised by the Economist magazine in Oslo. Huigen Yang, director general of the Polar Research Institute of China, said the experimental trip he led last year on the icebreaker Xuelong, or Snowdragon, to explore the route had \"greatly encouraged\" Chinese shipping companies. Russian and Norwegian shipowners have already started and \"one commercial voyage by a Chinese shipping company may take place this summer,\" said the scientist. Yang showed delegates at a conference about the Arctic in Oslo longer-term scenarios under which between five and 15% of China's international trade, mostly container traffic, could use the route by 2020. Whether that will include the 250,000 tonne iron ore bulk carriers that London Mining wants to use from Isua, will depend on Hammond."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2012/oct/10/iranian-minister-nonaligned-sanctions","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2012-10-10T11:12:04Z","webTitle":"Iranian minister calls on non-aligned nations to resist sanctions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/10/iranian-minister-nonaligned-sanctions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/oct/10/iranian-minister-nonaligned-sanctions","fields":{"headline":"Iranian minister calls on non-aligned nations to resist sanctions","bodyText":"A senior Iranian minister has called on \"independent\" nations to \"define a new structure for the world\" and resist sanctions during a visit to India. The energy minister, Majid Namjoo, played down deepening economic problems in Iran and said US and European sanctions imposed over his country's nuclear programme hurt those who imposed them most. A new round of sanctions may be announced at a meeting of EU foreign ministers next week. Namjoo repeated Tehran's claim that Iran needed nuclear power to replace its vast oil and gas reserves and that Iran had no ambitions to build a nuclear weapon. \"Oil and gas resources will be finished in the future so we need another source of energy,\" he told an audience of businessmen in Delhi. \"[Western powers and their allies] try to put obstacles; they kill and terrorise our scientists,\" Namjoo said, referring to the deaths of several people associated with Iran's nuclear programme. Iran's currency has lost much of its value in recent weeks, prompting demonstrations in Tehran and giving encouragement to western officials, who believe popular pressure is mounting on Iranian decision-makers. Most analysts believe the sanctions are compounding Iran's economic woes, undermining the value of the national currency. Prices of everyday staples are now rising almost every day. Iran hopes to build support among traditionally non-aligned powers such as India. However, the relationship with Delhi is complex. Western and Indian intelligence agencies and investigators believe Iran was behind a bomb attack in Delhi in February that left the wife of an Israeli diplomat badly injured. India, which suffers a chronic power shortage, imports large amounts of Iranian oil, though it has been trying to reduce the total, under US pressure. Indian diplomats privately play down their trade links with Iran. Iran, one of the world's largest oil producers, relies on crude sales for 80% of its export revenue and to bring in foreign currency. Britain, France and Germany hope to tighten already tough EU sanctions on Iran at next week's meeting. Fears of an imminent Israeli military strike on Iranian nuclear facilities have calmed. Rather than targeting specific firms, the UK has suggested imposing sanctions on whole sectors of trade with Iran to cover materials that could help Tehran expand its nuclear programme, particularly uranium enrichment. However, some member states fear the effect of enhanced sanctions on the European economy. Namjoo, who has met a series of Indian ministers in Delhi, lobbied for increased private investment from India in Iran's energy sector. He referred to the historic legacy of the Silk Route across Asia, and spoke of his admiration for Jawaharlal Nehru, the Indian post-independence leader who pioneered an independent policy for developing world nations. \"The non-aligned movement shows that tyrannic structures in the world cannot continue. Iran and India can play a role in defining new structures,\" the minister said. Tehran recently hosted a summit of non-aligned nations."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/aug/25/wikileaks-fears-china-nuclear-safety","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-08-25T15:02:44Z","webTitle":"WikiLeaks cables reveal fears over China's nuclear safety","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/aug/25/wikileaks-fears-china-nuclear-safety","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/aug/25/wikileaks-fears-china-nuclear-safety","fields":{"headline":"WikiLeaks cables reveal fears over China's nuclear safety","bodyText":"China has \"vastly increased\" the risk of a nuclear accident by opting for cheap technology that will be 100 years old by the time dozens of its reactors reach the end of their lifespans, according to diplomatic cables from the US embassy in Beijing. The warning comes weeks after the government in Beijing resumed its ambitious nuclear expansion programme, that was temporarily halted for safety inspections in the wake of the meltdown of three reactors in Fukushima, Japan. Cables released this week by WikiLeaks highlight the secrecy of the bidding process for power plant contracts, the influence of government lobbying, and potential weaknesses in the management and regulatory oversight of China's fast-expanding nuclear sector. In August, 2008, the embassy noted that China was in the process of building 50 to 60 new nuclear plants by 2020. This target – which has since increased – was a huge business opportunity. To keep up with the French and Russians, the cable urged continuous high-level advocacy on behalf of the US company Westinghouse to push its AP-1000 reactor. This is crucial, according to the cable dated 29 August 2008 from the American Embassy in Beijing, because \"all reactor purchases to date have been largely the result of internal high level political decisions absent any open process.\" For the US embassy, a bigger concern was that China seemed more interested in building its own reactors – the CPR-1000 – based on old Westinghouse technology, at Daya Bay and Ling Ao. \"As the CPR-1000 increases market share, China is assuring that rather than building a fleet of state-of-the-art reactors, they will be burdened with technology that by the end of its lifetime will be 100 years old,\" reads another cable dated 7 August 2008. For the past 10 years the CPR-1000 has been the most popular design in China. In 2009, the state news agency Xinhua reported that all but two of the 22 nuclear reactors under construction applied CPR-1000 technology. The cable suggests this was a dangerous choice: \"By bypassing the passive safety technology of the AP1000, which, according to Westinghouse, is 100 times safer than the CPR-1000, China is vastly increasing the aggregate risk of its nuclear power fleet. \" \"Passive safety technology\" ensures that a reactor will automatically shut down in the event of a disaster without human intervention. Plants without this feature are considered less safe as they rely on human intervention which can be difficult to provide in a crisis situation. China says it has updated and improved the technology on which the CPR-1000 is based, but the government recognises that it is less safe than newer models. China's national nuclear safety administration and national energy administration are currently drafting new safety plans, which are thought likely to include a stipulation that all future plants have to meet the higher standards of third-generation reactors like the AP-1000 or thorium technology. But it will still have to manage dozens of second-generation reactors for decades to come. Four CPR-1000s were approved by the state council just days before the Fukushima explosions. That accident – which was ranked on the same level as Chernobyl – has prompted a dramatic rethink of nuclear policy in Japan, Germany and Italy. There is no sign of a change of heart in China, which plans to build more reactors than the rest of the world put together between now and 2020. The latest to be completed was the CPR-1000 at Ling Ao earlier this month. The US embassy and Westinghouse may have wanted to play up the risks to improve the strength of their own bids, but safety concerns are also expressed within China. This year, Prof He Zuoxiu, who helped to develop China's first atomic bomb, claimed plans to ramp up production of nuclear energy twentyfold by 2030 could be as disastrous as the \"Great Leap Forward\" – Mao Zedong's disastrous attempt to jump-start industrial development in the late 1950s. Writing in the Science Times, He asked: \"Are we really ready for this kind of giddy speed [of nuclear power development]? I think not – we're seriously underprepared, especially on the safety front.\" The rush to build new plants may also create problems for effective management, operation and regulatory oversight. Westinghouse representative Gavin Liu was quoted in a cable as saying: \"The biggest potential bottleneck is human resources – coming up with enough trained personnel to build and operate all of these new plants, as well as regulate the industry.\" Such worries increased in July when another of China's new industrial projects – a high-speed railway – led to a collision that killed 39 people. It too was built domestically, based on foreign designs and rolled out faster than its operators appear to have been capable of dealing with."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/mar/14/carbon-targets-renewables-atomic-risks","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-03-14T21:00:03Z","webTitle":"Letters: Carbon targets, renewables and atomic risks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/mar/14/carbon-targets-renewables-atomic-risks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/mar/14/carbon-targets-renewables-atomic-risks","fields":{"headline":"Carbon targets, renewables and atomic risks","bodyText":"At issue in your article (UK wants renewable energy target scrapped, 12 March) is what new EU targets should be put in place for 2030. The UK is one of a number of countries that believe any new targets should be technology-neutral, leaving member states free to determine the most cost-effective energy mix to get the best deal for consumers. Our communication to the European commission explicitly states that the UK is not in any way \"against renewables\". Far from it – renewables will play a key role in the future UK energy mix, helping to reduce import dependency and meet our carbon targets. But the consumer will be best served in the long term through all low-carbon energy technologies competing freely to meet our energy needs and emission-reduction targets. Edward Davey MP Energy and climate change secretary • The news that the UK government is secretly lobbying the European commission for the abolition of future EU renewable energy targets sadly comes as no surprise, and merely reveals the scale of the challenge facing supporters of clean, green power. Coalition ministers have shown little appetite for meeting the UK's 2020 target: indeed, rather then take positive steps to boost, encourage and support burgeoning green technologies, which have created thousands of new jobs and made an important contribution to climate change goals, the government has instead penalised those that have thrived. Attention has now turned to onshore wind, for which there is huge potential in the UK. Last week the UK government supported ambitious targets in the EU 2050 energy roadmap, but we know from experience that a voluntary, market approach does not give the necessary clarity or impetus for the required investment. \"Sign up and hope\" is not a policy. We are told that straitened public finances mean that subsidies for green energy are no longer affordable, but stepping up our ambition on emission reductions makes sense for our energy policy, and economic sense in terms of green growth and jobs too. Frankly, no other solution will do. Jean Lambert MEP Green, London Keith Taylor MEP Green, South East England • Your report was correct to assume that Lib Dems would oppose allowing nuclear energy to be given parity with renewables for the purposes of meeting European targets, but the situation is more complex than it implies. When the Lib Dems last had a full debate on nuclear energy, the majority opposed it. However, since then, circumstances have changed. The climate is changing faster than we expected, our progress on replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy systems is slower than hoped for, efficiency measures are not reducing demand fast enough, and fossil fuel supplies are becoming less reliable and more difficult to procure. The party's current stated position is opposition to spending taxpayers' money on nuclear power stations. The cases for and against another generation of nuclear power stations were debated in the summer 2011 edition of Challenge, the journal of the Green Lib Dems (an organisation of party members with a special interest in environmental issues). While continuing to believe that increasing the use of renewable energy has to be our primary objective, an increasing numbers of Lib Dems think that the need to combat climate change is so urgent that we need both renewables and nuclear energy. The development of nuclear and renewable energy technologies were both emaciated by competition from cheap, polluting, unsustainable fossil fuels. We need to look to the future with a set of EU-wide targets that allow the development of renewables and other low-carbon energy production technologies. The proportion of energy production that each EU member state could reasonably be expected to provide from renewables depends on climate, topography and population density. The next set of EU targets need to further increase the proportion of energy required to be produced from renewables, but to be achievable by all it will have to be lower than the maximum some states could achieve. I would thus support a further requirement for low-carbon energy, which member states could fulfil with further renewables or with other low-carbon sources such as nuclear. Steve Bolter Member of Green Lib Dems executive • As we approach another drought, (Report, 12 March), consider August 1666, when the Thames at Oxford was reduced to a trickle… The great fire of London started early on 12 September, and the east wind drove the flames before it, burning much of London and spreading smoke as far as Oxford. In 2007 a nuclear power station site was still proposed at Didcot on the Thames; even when in \"down mode\" a nuclear power station requires around 3MW of cooling to keep the fuel rods stable. In August 2011 Dominique Bestion, research director of the French Atomic Energy and Alternative Energies Commission, said he foresaw no new inland nuclear power stations being built because of climate change. He cited the experience of France, where they increasingly have to put their nuclear plants into sleep mode on rivers such as the Loire. In the summer of 2003, when 15,000 people died in the heatwave in France, three of the Loire plants were shut down and blackouts ensued. In response France installed over 200MW of distributed photovoltaics to meet summer peak demands, when such inland nuclear plants fail to generate. Nuclear energy in a rapidly warming climate, with more extreme weather, is unsafe, whether inland or by the sea. We already have the technology to build a safe and sufficient renewable energy future at much lower costs. The question is, who is actually stopping us doing it? Professor Susan Roaf Edinburgh • Your welcome article on Fukushima (Report, 9 March) sadly repeats the mantra that for cumulative doses below 100mSv: \"No study has linked cancer development to exposure at below that level.\" I hope the Guardian will not fall for the reassurances of the nuclear industry so easily. The low-dose radiation debate has a long history, including the pioneering work of the late Alice Stewart, who discovered the link between exposure to diagnostic X-rays in utero and increased risk of childhood cancer. The peer-reviewed open-access journal Environmental Health has published two articles of mine (2007, 2009) on radiation risks for cancer mortality in Japanese A-bomb survivors exposed to under 20 mSv external doses. Greg Dropkin Liverpool • I have just heard that the energy regulator Ofgem has given the energy giant EDF a rap over the knuckles for mis-selling (Report, 9 March). EDF has apparently agreed to pay £4.5m to its vulnerable customers in lieu of a fine. Surely, if this hugely profitable company has been contravening the rules on selling, it should be fined. This \"in lieu of a fine\" agreement seems to me to let the company off the PR hook and allow them to spin bad practice as a generous gesture to their vulnerable customers. Last November a French court fined the same company, EDF, £1.3m (€1.5m) for spying on Greenpeace in France, sent two senior EDF employees to prison for three years and awarded Greenpeace damages from the company. This seems like an honest and transparent way of dealing with a company that has broken laws. This weekend, a large number of people are expressing their opposition to plans to build new nuclear reactors in the UK by surrounding the nuclear power station at Hinkley Point on the Bristol Channel. This is the first site where our prime minister recently announced preliminary work would start on a new reactor as part of a joint Anglo-French deal. Guess which energy company will be doing this work? EDF. If this company cannot abide by our regulations on fair selling and falls foul of French law when it has concerns about those who oppose its plans, should we really trust it to build and run nuclear plants, which have the potential to experience some of the most hazardous accidents on the planet? I am opposed to further expansion of nuclear power, but if our government insists on this course, surely it should at least go out to competitive tender.

Lobbying by energy companies to channel government policy towards serving their best interests is intense. This would not be a problem if ministers and civil servants wielded their power to base policy on evidence rather than influence, but Britain has moved well past this point. There is genuine uncertainty about who is in control of the overall energy policy and which stakeholder – ie EDF, the French nuclear company or the non-nuclear companies in the \"big six\" and major energy users – has the most traction with the different ministries, in particular the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc), and the Treasury. Consumer interests are at the bottom of the pile. EDF set out as early as 2006 what was needed for new nuclear power to be built in Britain and this has now been put in place via the electricity market reform (EMR) process. This is despite a tidal wave of criticism, not least because the number of secondees in Decc from EDF and British Gas/Centrica – a fellow member of EDF's nuclear consortium – far outweigh any other company. The other main lobby is that which argues that the cheapest way to decarbonise our energy system is to move to gas, rather than the low carbon generation of nuclear and renewable energy. This is a short-term economic view, supported by the Treasury, which conveniently leaves others to deliver and pay for the long term, more difficult solution to climate change. In practice, this means that Decc does all it can to support nuclear power while the Treasury attempts to support gas as best it can by moving as much risk of investment away from UK PLC to the nuclear companies. At the same time, both lobbies relentlessly undermine renewable energy thereby making sure their deployment is as limited as possible so that nuclear power or gas can step in. This is not only confusing but it has led to wildly one-sided policies from the government. For example, a letter in 2010 from National Grid set out its decision to not require new nuclear power plants to pay for the additional costs they will impose on the electricity network. The letter ended saying this was because, at £160m per plant per year, it would make nuclear power uneconomical. Renewable energy, on the other hand, has to pay the costs of connections. Or take the EU Renewable Energy directive, intended to help renewable electricity by ensuring that it is \"taken\" before generation from other sources of electricity, thereby reducing investment risk. The UK has mostly sidestepped the spirit by letter of law actions. However, recently even the letter of the law has been broken with National Grid favouring nuclear over wind in its management of energy at peak times of demand. There has been a barrage of ill-informed media reports of the extra costs that renewable energy currently, and will, add to energy bills. Not only has Decc, or the Treasury, not clarified those costs (about 7% of total price rises between 2004-10, or £30 on the average energy bill) but George Osborne has irresponsibly fuelled that debate with his \"we're not going to save the planet by putting our country out of business\" rhetoric. Meanwhile, our nuclear liabilities are £6.93bn annually, or around £350 per year for each household. What is so depressing about this is that the lobbies for a continuation of our current energy system – effectively lobbying against a sustainable and secure energy system – appear to be pushing at an open door in Whitehall. Unlike most European countries, we in the UK do not have a state-funded research institute for renewable energy and energy efficiency whose role it is to provide information to government. Renewable energy in the UK simply does not have the same level of credibility as is the norm in Europe, and increasingly around the world. Partly this is the relentless onslaught of the lobbies. But it is also something to do with the expertise and current ethos embodied in our civil service. It has been independent advisers the Committee on Climate Change and Ofgem, Britain's energy regulator, that have clarified the costs of renewable energy in Britain – not our civil service or our ministers. On the contrary, our ministers have been part of the misinformation process. We have seen the effect of hands-off regulation in our banking, financial sectors and media – without intervention from ministers and civil servants. We must not make the same mistakes within energy because climate change, unlike an economy, will not recover."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2012/dec/10/infrastructure-projects-free-meddling-olympics","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2012-12-10T00:01:03Z","webTitle":"Infrastructure projects must be free from meddling, says Olympics chief","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/dec/10/infrastructure-projects-free-meddling-olympics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2012/dec/10/infrastructure-projects-free-meddling-olympics","fields":{"headline":"Infrastructure projects must be free from meddling, says Olympics chief","bodyText":"British politicians must emulate the Olympics and protect multibillion-pound infrastructure projects from political meddling to prevent a repeat of the muddle that has marred energy policy and airport planning, according to the former chairman of the Olympic Delivery Authority. Sir John Armitt is leading an infrastructure review commissioned by the Labour party that will consider the case for a quango to oversee long-term planning for projects ranging from nuclear power stations to new runways. Successive governments have been criticised by business leaders for failing to drive through new energy and airport capacity, including coalition wrangling over an energy bill and David Cameron's decision to park aviation policy under an independent review until after the next election. Armitt, a former chief executive of Network Rail, said cross-party backing and a lack of political interference had contributed to the smooth buildup to the 2012 Games. \"We got it right,\" he said. Lord Adonis, the Labour peer who will sit on Armitt's advisory panel, said: \"Where there is a clear national imperative, and the politicians work together, then those people who delivered [the Games], led by John, did not have to constantly worry that politicians would pull the plug.\" Without evidence of long-term planning and certainty, Armitt said, politicians will struggle to unlock the private sector investment they are so keen to funnel into infrastructure. So far, UK pension funds have committed £700m to pay for infrastructure projects, against a target of up to £2bn set by the Pension Protection Fund and the National Association of Pension Funds, which between them control more than £800bn in assets. \"When you talk to financial institutions and you talk to the private sector, one of the biggest reasons they all give for having difficulty in making an [infrastructure] investment is that they don't know how certain this programme or project will be,\" said Armitt. He added that energy policy was a prime example of political indecision, saying \"you don't need to be a genius\" to see that the UK needs an array of energy sources. His advisory panel includes Sir David Rowlands, chairman of Gatwick airport and former permanent secretary to the Department for Transport, and Rachel Lomax, former deputy governor of the Bank of England. The panel will deliver an interim report in spring, and final conclusions in the autumn. Referring to the coalition's appointment of Sir Howard Davies, former director of the London School of Economics, to lead an inquiry into airport capacity, Adonis said Armitt's panel should win broad political support. \"The coalition clearly recognises that they have a problem in this area [of infrastructure planning] or they would not have set up the Davies review.\" Armitt acknowledged that the commission had few global precedents to follow. One potential inspiration is offered by Sir Rod Eddington, the former chief executive of British Airways and current chairman of Infrastructure Australia, a government body charged with \"developing long-term solutions for infrastructure bottlenecks and decades of underinvestment\". However, Armitt cautioned that the body was still expected to take instructions from the Australian government, which could increase exposure to short-term political pressure. Adonis and Armitt also considered the examples of Network Rail, which is owned by the state but operates at arm's length under independently vetted five-year plans; the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, which sets interest rates; and the Office for Budget Responsibility, the government-backed independent economic forecaster. Armitt added that any new institution recommended by the panel would be publicly funded and would report to parliament. \"We almost take pride in this country in saying that we get there after muddling along. We cannot afford to muddle along,\" he said. Adonis stressed that the panel's findings, and its recommendations for a new independent institution, would not challenge the role of ministers as final arbiters in infrastructure decisions. \"Nobody is proposing that the decision will be taken out of the democratic process. But we are seeking to remove short-term party politics from the process,\" he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/jul/04/green-news-roundup","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-07-04T13:14:25Z","webTitle":"Green news roundup: Forests, food waste and extreme weather","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/04/green-news-roundup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/jul/04/green-news-roundup","fields":{"headline":"Green news roundup: Forests, food waste and extreme weather","bodyText":"Environment news • No sell-off of forests, promises Caroline Spelman • Scientists say ongoing weather extremes offer proof of climate change • Protect whales from new oil industry threat, warns WWF • Wiltshire council votes for tough new planning restrictions for windfarms • Ban food waste from landfill for renewable energy, urges thinktank • MPs give green light to loan plan for home insulation On the blogs • Is it now possible to blame extreme weather on global warming? • England is lagging behind with its woodland creation strategy • How would you lead us out of the climate predicament? • Nuclear more popular than gas but wind blows both away • Help map the UK's bumblebee population Multimedia • Dragonflies and damselflies – your Green shoots photographs • Greenpeace's Save the Arctic video • The week in wildlife - in pictures • Nuclear power protests in Japan - in pictures Features and comment • Share your photos of 'signs of summer' • What is the 'polluter pays' principle? • US Navy's 'great green fleet' sets sail for Pacific Best of the web • Oh Canada: the government's broad assault on the environment • US heatwave sets more temperature records • Adventurers sail through wave of tsunami debris • Beyond Rio, green economics can give us hope For more of the best environment comment and news from around the web, visit the Guardian Environment Network.

According to Decc's 2012/13 budget, taken from its 2012–15 business plan, dealing with \"nuclear legacy\" issues costs around £2.5 billion a year, more than 42% of Decc's total budget. Of that, around £1.6 billion is spent on managing the various plants and storage facilities at Sellafield, the huge site in Cumbria which is home to the radioactive remains of nuclear weapons and energy programmes dating more than half a century. Sellafield employs 9231 people, according to a new National Audit Office (NAO) report. How much will Sellafield cost going forward? The NAO anticipates the total future costs for decommissioning Sellafield, over a century or so, will be £67 billion. This has risen from £47 billion since 2009 – a remarkable rise in just three years. (Note that the costs would look lower if a discount rate was applied to reflect the fact that the money will be spent over many decades.) What projects are causing the costs to rise? The NAO reviewed the 14 major projects currently in design, planning and construction at Sellafield – including some with weird and wonderful names such as \"Highly active liquor storage tanks\" and \"Magnox swarf storage silos retrievals\". The total anticipated cost of these 14 projects rose by £900m in the ten months between May 2011 and March 2012. Here are the growing costs of the projects at the design and planning phase: And here are ones under construction: Are the projects on schedule? No, as the chart below shows, most of the projects under construction are running behind schedule as well as over budget. What does all this mean for the cost of nuclear energy? Although the costs of Sellafield relate mainly to handling waste from old nuclear projects – including postwar weapons programmes – the NAO's report begs the question of whether cost estimates for decommissioning future nuclear power plants may also have been underestimated. Whether that's true is impossible to know, though a glance at the figures suggests that even if decommissioning and waste disposal costs for future plants were two or three times higher than current government estimates, that wouldn't significantly change the economics of new nuclear plants. Decc's assumptions about the costs of different power sources are based on a report by Mott MacDonald, which estimates their total cost including up-front capital, fuel use and eventual decommissioning. Here are the estimates it gives for a selection of common technologies; for the full list see page 7-2 of the report. These figures are the subject of heated debate. Solar advocates point out that PV prices are dropping like a stone while nuclear costs are rising – and that solar should really be compared to the retail rather than the wholesale price of electricity, as it delivers power straight to the end user. On the other hand, nuclear advocates argue that a unit of reliable 'baseload' nuclear energy is worth more than a unit of intermittent wind or solar. Those debates aside, rising decommissioning costs would be unlikely to change the comparisons significantly, because in the Mott MacDoland report only around £2.50 of the estimated £96–98 total cost of generating a megawatt hour from new nuclear plants is earmarked for decommissioning and waste disposal. So even if this amount doubled or tripled nuclear would remain a relatively low-cost low-carbon power source. Nuclear advocates also argue that the waste at Sellafield could be turned into valuable fuel for a new generation of 'fast' or thorium reactors.

Forecasts suggest that gas supplies in the UK could theoretically be exhausted by 8 April, requiring Britain to turn to imports from Norway and Russia. The warning came on the day Scottish and Southern Energy, one of the UK's biggest power suppliers, warned that there could be electricity blackouts in the country within three years. A lack of gas storage facilities, and rapid depletion at the UK's North Sea gas fields, has led to the UK having as little as two days' supply of the fuel in reserve. Demand spiked during the coldest March in 50 years. Though experts have warned of the problem for years, and the government has championed a \"dash for gas\" that would see a massive rise in demand for the fuel, little has been done to increase storage facilities. Ian Marchant, chief executive of SSE, said there was a \"very real risk of the lights going out\" within the next three years. SSE intends shutting down power plants, enough to have supplied 2m homes, as the stations are either uneconomic or coming to the end of their lives. Other firms are also planning to take power stations out of service, including the UK's fleet of ageing nuclear reactors, increasing the risk that demand for electricity will exceed the available supply. Marchant said: \"It appears the government is significantly underestimating the scale of the capacity crunch facing the UK in the next three years and there is a very real risk of the lights going out as a result.\" His comments follow warnings by Alistair Buchanan, the departing chief of Ofgem, that power shortages will be many times more likely in the next five years. Government estimates suggest that energy bills could rise by £100 a year this winter. Britain only ever holds about 15 days of gas in reserve because of lack of storage facilities and a failure to attract investment to build new ones. Britain is in fact unlikely to run out before 8 April but the estimate is based on trends that include current imports and consumption. The warnings are a particular blow to George Osborne, the chancellor, who has championed a new \"dash for gas\" in the UK, that would see gas take over as the dominant fuel in the UK's power generation market. Much of the generating capacity that SSE plans to retire consists of gas-fired power stations, though the recent budget has given tax breaks for shale gas extraction in the UK and heralded what could be the biggest expansion of UK gas-fired power in a generation. SSE said gas-fired power was uneconomic because of the fuel's high price compared with coal. The move by SSE highlights the disputes over energy policy and energy generation, following upheavals in the international markets for fossil fuels. It also brings into question whether targets to cut carbon dioxide can be met. Andrew Pendleton, head of campaigns at Friends of the Earth, said energy firms were trying to hold the government to ransom by threatening power outages that would help them extract concessions to get financial benefits. The UK has only six big energy suppliers to households, which campaigners say reduces competition and raises prices. Coal has become much cheaper because of the use of fossil fuel in the US in the past five years, where a massive increase in the supply of cheap gas is attributed to fracking, the controversial method of blasting dense rocks apart under high pressure. The coal that would have been burned in the US is now available on international markets at cut-price, and has now become \"the preferred fuel\", according to SSE. That is the opposite of what the government, and the EU intended by their energy policies in the past decade. Coal was supposed to become more expensive than gas, because of the EU's emissions trading scheme, which puts a price on carbon emissions. That has not happened, because flaws within the system mean the price of carbon is near an all-time low, meaning coal-fired power stations are not penalised for their effect on the climate. Marchant urged the government to bring forward reforms favouring gas. \"The government can reduce this risk [of power cuts] very easily, by taking swift action to provide much greater clarity on its electricity market reforms.\" An energy bill is under discussion by parliament at the moment. SSE's warnings were dismissed by green campaigners as \"an attempt to force the government's hand\". Pendleton said: \"The risk is that these companies are holding us to ransom, in order to make the environment more favourable to their forms of generation. There is a lot at stake here. Basing our energy strategy on gas rather than clean forms of energy such as renewables means we could be held to ransom more and more in the future in this way. It could do a huge amount of harm.\" The government rebuffed the claims from SSE. John Hayes, minister for energy, said: \"We're alive to the challenge facing us. The bill before parliament will set the conditions for the investment needed to keep Britain's lights on in the long-term. The amount of spare power available today is currently comfortable. As old infrastructure closes over the coming years we expect this margin to reduce but we will make sure it stays manageable.\" Most of the UK's nuclear power plants are slated for closure by 2022, and many coal-fired stations must be closed or run at reduced capacity within the next few years because of EU rules on pollution. Experts have warned for years of a looming \"energy gap\" between demand and supply. The building of wind farms and other forms of renewable energy, which were supposed to fill the gap, has been below expectations, in part due to planning laws. Hayes said: \"We are not complacent about this... We are confident in our approach and in the responsiveness of the market in providing secure power supplies.\" Joss Garman, political director of Greenpeace, said: \"Not content with the profits they're making from sky-high energy bills the gas industry now seems to be trying to hold everybody to ransom – 'give us even more of your cash or we'll turn out the lights'. \"Cheap coal and the collapse of the carbon price have made gas burning less profitable, but that's a reason to ban unabated coal burning and reform the carbon market, not to give hand-outs to the big six energy companies. \"Gas-fired generation should only be a last-ditch backup for renewable energy sources, and [ministers] should prioritise support for interconnectors, storage, and combined heat and power stations that would compliment renewables and guarantee we have secure power.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2013/jan/27/ian-breach","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2013-01-27T13:12:47Z","webTitle":"Ian Breach obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/jan/27/ian-breach","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2013/jan/27/ian-breach","fields":{"headline":"Ian Breach obituary","bodyText":"Some Guardian journalists stay for life; others move on. Ian Breach, who has died aged 72, was in the second category at a time when many stayed. He joined the Manchester features department as a young subeditor in May 1964. By 1972 he had already been the paper's jazz critic, become its first technology correspondent and, indeed, its first \"anti-motoring\" motoring correspondent. Environmental concern increasingly clashed with road-testing new cars. The story goes that Ian went in to see the editor, the austere Alastair Hetherington, suggesting that what the Guardian needed was a transport correspondent. \"Really?\" replied Hetherington, \"I love driving my Jaguar.\" Ian left; a few months later the paper appointed a transport correspondent. Ian's path to the Guardian had hardly been conventional. As a 16-year-old Manchester working-class lad with a few GCEs, he took a marine engineering apprenticeship via Bolton technical college and Royal Dutch Shell. On leave in summer 1959, he met his future wife, Jacky, and effectively jumped ship to join her in London. Ian found work in PR and technical journalism. His Guardian potential was spotted by Anthony Tucker, soon to be made science correspondent. First-hand knowledge of technology allowed Ian to talk detail with experts such as Walt Patterson at Friends of the Earth, and then describe complex issues in an understandable way. Passionate about arts as well as the environment, witty, contrary yet credible, he had the nerve, for instance, to expose industry \"gifts\" to motoring correspondents while still with the Guardian. By the mid-1970s Ian, Jacky and their daughter, Emmie, had moved north to Milburn, a Cumbrian village nestling into Cross Fell. His first, typically provocative, act at Milburn was to make a film about village life. Restless ambitions then took him to Tokyo for six months as a senior speechwriter at the United Nations University. Back home, Ian's speciality, energy policy, equipped him perfectly to cover the 1977 Windscale inquiry hearings into commercial waste reprocessing proposed by British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL) at Sellafield. Both the Financial Times and the New Scientist moved quickly to employ him. Following the inquiry he declined a staff job with the FT, but wrote a meaty Penguin Special, Windscale Fallout: A Primer for the Age of Nuclear Controversy. The paperback is a balanced account of the inquiry and of the Callaghan government's decision in 1978 to approve the thermal oxide reprocessing plant (Thorp). However, its conclusion is uncompromising. \"The politics of nuclear power and reprocessing will increasingly be those of disillusion, anger, frustration and mistrust. We shall all be the losers.\" Meanwhile, Ian became a freelance Cumbria reporter for BBC Newcastle. He saw himself as a natural. But his first attempt at speaking to camera provoked an angry response from his veteran colleague: \"It's too long, too wordy, and you aren't using your eyes. I don't care if you've worked for the Bible, sunshine. They won't use it.\" He learned quickly, to the point where he was soon making films for Look North and the magazine programme Coast to Coast. His BBC editor there, John Mapplebeck, recalls how he had a \"marked effect on the way TV covered places and topics\". Then followed a productive stint with BBC Scotland. Tempted back to the north-east of England by Tyne Tees Television doubling his BBC salary, Ian came to realise that his appointment as a current affairs presenter doing \"state of the region\" programmes had been a ploy by the ITV company to help secure its franchise renewal. He was left kicking his heels after the franchise was confirmed. So, in 1986, he left to join BBC South West in Plymouth, where he made poignant films, all networked, for a series called Natural Concern exploring disasters such as the Camelford water poisoning incident, issues including stag hunting on Exmoor, and events such as the economic death of a farm. They led to a successful period in Birmingham as chief reporter on Countryfile. In 1989 Ian became one of the BBC's first environment correspondents, London-based, with responsibilities across radio and TV. After years in the regions he rose to the national and international brief. But his biggest story was again near home. On 15 November 1993, Panorama broadcast A Very British Folly, his film exploring the tortuous political history of Thorp. Perhaps it was the title, because the presentation was even-handed enough: BNFL took the BBC to the Press Complaints Commission and lost. However, his BBC star waning, he compounded matters by writing to the director general, John Birt, demanding more air time for environment. His contract was not renewed. If the mid-1990s proved difficult for him professionally, Jacky flourished, running Chris Mullin's Sunderland South constituency office. Jacky died suddenly in 1999. She had requested a humanist funeral, which Ian helped plan. Shortly afterwards, he was asked if he was interested in training to be a humanist celebrant. Indeed he was. Some 13 years and more than 1,000 ceremonies later, he took a final humanist funeral in December 2012 for a young Carlisle mother who had died of cancer. He was himself dying of lung cancer. Ian approached ceremonies with a reporter's diligence and a TV presenter's flair. He had an exceptional ability to recreate and calibrate the lives he celebrated. Ian is survived by Wendy, his second wife, Emmie, four stepchildren, five grandchildren and one great-granddaughter. • Ian Breach, journalist, born 30 September 1940; died 22 January 2013"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global/2012/nov/13/guardian-weekly-letters-16-november","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2012-11-13T13:59:03Z","webTitle":"Guardian Weekly Letters, 16 November 2012","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2012/nov/13/guardian-weekly-letters-16-november","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global/2012/nov/13/guardian-weekly-letters-16-november","fields":{"headline":"Guardian Weekly Letters, 16 November 2012","bodyText":"Attenborough's warning How fortunate we are to have someone of the stature of David Attenborough still around after six decades of educating us about the wonders of nature (Force of nature's stark warning, 9 November). And who better than he to pinpoint the blame for the current terrible loss of biodiversity: \"...so many mouths, so many people in the west offering to pay for these forests to be cut down...\", he says. Climate change will also impact adversely on biodiversity as species move polewards or to higher altitudes to try to survive a warming Earth. Many will be impeded by human settlements that have not been there in the past when the planet has warmed or cooled. It is one of those problems that could be solved easily if you reduced human population, as Attenborough says. George Monbiot may claim that climate change is caused only by the richer world burning fossil fuels and the poor are not to blame (Extreme weather will cause salvation, 26 October). But it is also exploding populations who cut down forests to grow food, or intensify agriculture for greater yields. Taking everything into account in the production of food from fertilisers to machinery to transport, agriculture now accounts for 30% of greenhouse gas emissions. The more mouths, the more farming, the more emissions. Jenny Goldie Michelago, NSW, Australia Future of nuclear power Thank goodness the Bric countries have not been spooked by the Fukushima incident and are continuing their building of reactors (Nuclear still generates a buzz, 2 November). The knee-jerk response by Japan (understandable) and Germany (fooled again by the irresponsible Greens) has probably set back a global clean, emissions-free, base-load energy supply by several years. Bric nations obviously know that nuclear is their best, probably only option for a secure, clean energy future. The British and the Americans are building new reactors as well. It's interesting that the UK energy minister has recently put paid to the development of any more onshore windfarms, citing them as grossly inefficient and expensive and only good for wealthy landowners collecting rent from hosting them on their land. The UK has finally joined Canada, France, Spain and several US states in reducing or discontinuing subsidies for wind. If only countries would ignore the scaremongering Greens and other anti-nukes and look at the truth about the essential safety and that nuclear is the most powerful source of energy known to mankind, I'm confident that countries, including Japan, will come back to it as an essential part of their energy future. Terry Krieg Port Lincoln, South Australia • Nuclear power is not a greenhouse-gas-free source of energy. That assumption has long been proven wrong. The industry is heavily dependent on fossil-fuel energy. This is because the nuclear fuel cycle is exceptionally demanding of energy sources that exist outside its original uranium. The mining and processing of the uranium, the elaborate transport procedures necessary to move these materials with any safety, the significant carbon dioxide debt carried by the construction of the plants and the investment of energy in storing nuclear waste add up to large-scale carbon dioxide emissions. We must add to this the energy in decommissioning and dismantling aged reactors. This will soon be a significant factor because high numbers of the world's reactors are at the end of their working lifetimes. In July 2005 the journal Australian Science published an analysis of the greenhouse gas costs of nuclear reactors, excluding decommissioning costs. If the reactors were using the increasingly scarce high-grade uranium ores as their fuel source, the greenhouse gas cost was already high. If they were using the low-grade ores, the only ones available after 2024, the greenhouse gas emissions of the reactor become more than those for a gas-fired thermal station of the same electric output. To all the other terrible problems associated with nuclear reactors and nuclear fission, we can safely add that of their being large emitters of greenhouse gases. Denys Trussell Auckland, New Zealand We must expand the vote I nodded in agreement as I read your lead article on the possibility of the world being able to vote in the US election (Too bad the world can't vote, 26 October). Indeed, if the US is meddling disproportionately in a particular country's business, then why shouldn't the citizens of that country vote on who governs the US? The outcome of the vote affects them just as it would a US citizen. This is a fascinating thought, a whole Pandora's box that urgently needs to be thrown wide open. For example, if EU trade policy has targeted markets in Africa and caused significant disruption to those markets, then surely the Africans affected should be able to vote in European elections. If a sovereign wealth fund or global corporation has acquired agricultural land in a developing country for industrial farming operations, then surely those who have lost their farms, their homes and their grazing land should be able to vote on the board of that fund or corporation. Furthermore, if a country has squandered mineral resources, destroyed natural habitat or has polluted the environment, then surely those as-yet unborn citizens who will suffer disadvantage due to that policy should be allowed to vote. Of course, none of this is possible but the point we need to recognise is that democracy is worth nothing unless it is applied responsibly and compassionately. And even worse: if democracy panders solely to the short-term desires of a particular electorate, then such a system can easily become a vehicle for inadvisable decisions, for injustice and, at times, for evil. Alan Mitcham Cologne, Germany Other people's children I congratulate Clare Kathleen Bogen for having the courage to write what a lot of us have been thinking and saying (Yummy mummies are rude, 26 October). Other people's children are not the centre of my universe; why do mothers (and fathers too) think they should be? The health and safety issue in this article is an interesting point too – other patrons tripping over scooters and children running around in cafes while hot drinks are being served. Who is to blame when one of the little darlings is injured? I also commend Kate Connolly regarding the Berlin coffee bar owner, Ralf Ruller, banning pushchairs and prams (Pushchair ban causes a froth, 19 October). What about the affront to other customers who have to dodge these monstrosities and the little darlings contained therein, and put up with the noise created by them? Ruth Ehrlich Alanya, Turkey Writers and art lovers Edward Dolnick tells us that there are no unscrupulous billionaires looking for stolen Picassos to adorn the spots above their fireplaces, and that art thieves only steal for bragging rights and because it's easy (No one wins in this game, 26 October). He also puzzlingly states that few art thieves have ever entered into an art gallery except to rob it, and finally that they see art theft as kidnapping without all the fuss. Dolnick has such insight into the world of art thieves that I finished this pleasant little piece wondering if art thieves also occasionally write for the Guardian. Ryan Grant Little Berlin, Germany Briefly • Further to the story of scientists being imprisoned in Italy for not predicting an earthquake (2 November): earthquakes are \"acts of God\" so the person who should be most able to predict them should be the man who claims to be closest to God.

Having shed so much light on who he is, this startlingly candid autobiographer has left one question unanswered: namely, what gave him the courage to launch the deeply spiritual and neo-Freudian rock opera Tommy and the even more daring semi-Wagnerian Quadrophenia when Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka-dot Bikini and Lonely This Christmas were topping the charts? In his Indian guru Meher Baba's vein, the answer may well be found in silence. Frank Landsman Bandung, West Java, Indonesia • Ian Cobain asks why the British government continues to resist the Mau Mau claim for compensation and an apology (2 November). The obvious answer is that having the case heard may expose the fact that similar behaviours have been stand operating procedure for the army in Northern Ireland, Iraq and Afghanistan.

What were the values that you saw in the party then that made you make that decision? The key realisation was that we live on a planet with limited resources, on which you can't have unlimited growth. To sum it up in one image: the Greens had a poster at the time which said: \"We've only borrowed the Earth from our children.\" That single sentence still sums up the philosophy of my party for me. We need responsible lifestyles: we need to make sure that we don't use up the resources that belong to other generations, but also that we don't use up the resources of other countries. Fairness shouldn't end on Germany's doorstep. The nice thing is that the idea of sustainability translates very well from ecology to economics. It's in the DNA of my party that we aren't just OK with the idea of a balanced household budget, but that our very founding philosophy tells us that we shouldn't burden the next generation with mountains of debts. How has the Green party and their typical voter changed since then? The Greens are more at ease with German society and its values: this is our country, not an enemy we have to fight against. We want to change and improve this country because we like it. And society as a whole has become greener too. When I joined, I would have never believed that the world's fourth largest economy would eventually agree to phase out nuclear energy – and that even though the Greens were in opposition. What used to be considered alternative ideas are now mainstream policy. For example? When I was young, I used to collect rubbish in my home town and recycle in my spare time. At school I had learned how hard and energy-inefficient it was to produce aluminium, and how hard to break it down again. So my friends and I developed a concept whereby we would start aluminium collection points around the town and then take the bins to collection points outside the city. My mother used to curse me, because we ended up with piles of aluminium in our basement. But eventually the local council cottoned on to the scheme and started doing the same thing professionally. Why is the Green party so much more successful in Germany than in the UK? I wouldn't say that. Let's not forget that the British Greens once got 15% at European elections – we've never managed that much. The French managed more than 16%. Feeling a bond with nature isn't a uniquely German phenomenon. Of course, the debates can run differently at times. For example, the debate on nuclear power takes on a different course in Germany – the famed \"German angst\" does play a role, and I think that's correct. In the UK, the nuclear debate is more of an argument about cost. But that's not to say that the end results aren't similar: ie, that hardly anyone builds nuclear power stations these days. Everyone is more realistic about the dangers of nuclear. How would you sell the benefits of wind energy to the Brits? That's easy. It's not about ecology: there are pragmatic economic reasons for taking wind energy seriously. Onshore wind energy is cheaper and faster; offshore is more expensive and takes longer to build. It's that simple. For those who think it spoils their view of the landscape: would you rather have a nuclear power station plonked in the middle of the countryside? I find that logic strange. And of course no one in the Green party thinks you should just put windfarms anywhere – there are parts of the countryside that should be off limits. In the past, the energy market in Germany used to be run by four big players. Since the shift to renewables that we helped to bring about, regional authorities and cities council have become empowered to act as players in their own right, buying back the networks that they sold to private companies in the past. In Germany, a large number of windfarms are regionally owned: that helps to decentralise power and encourages competition. What do you say to critics of Germany's nuclear phaseout, who argue that it will merely end up having to import more dirty coal energy from abroad? We are looking at a third industrial revolution, and just as there were once those who opposed the invention of the steam engine, there are now those who hark back to nuclear energy. In Germany we now have just over 20% of our energy coming from renewable sources. All predictions from the past have turned out not to be true: when I went to school, my teachers used to say that maybe, just maybe we might have 3% of renewable energy one day. Angela Merkel says we'll have 35% by 2020; we at the Green party say it'll be 45%. My guess is: we'll both be wrong, because it'll be even more than that. And at any rate, don't listen to what Cem Özdemir has to say on this, don't listen to what the Greens have to say, listen to what Siemens is doing. Siemens are not switching from nuclear to clean energy because they want to lose money: they want to make profit. And I'd warn anyone who questions whether they'll manage: industrial policy, that's one thing the Germans know how to get right. If the Brits would rather hand the first mover advantage down to us, then so be it – as a German, I thank them for it. We already cater for many of the markets for renewable energy around the globe, and our future competitors are more likely to come from China than from the other side of the Channel. In Germany, industry is now starting to thank us for pestering in the past, because it forced them to go through the kind of innovations that the rest of the world is now catching up with. The Brits are still discussing whether they should insulate their houses better in the future, and we insulate them. Germany is proud of its export industry. But in order to make Europe work, doesn't Germany need to start importing more as well? I don't think it's a matter of either/or. The traditional left's mistake is that they've only read half of Keynes, namely the first bit about not making a recession worse by trying to save money. You learn that in the first term at university. But the second part of what Keynes says, that you have to pay your debts back in the end, that bit isn't so easy. It's a nice idea, but in reality no one does it – especially when you're dealing with four- to five-year electoral cycles. Germany's mistake under Merkel has been to assume that a country like Spain can get rid of its debt problem purely through austerity. So it's not a matter of \"either/or\", but a matter of \"and\": we need debt brakes, but also a long-term perspective for growth. And in order to get there, you have to deal with bad interest rates: our suggestion would be a \"sinking fund\" to pay down excessive sovereign debt in the eurozone. When, or if Europe emerges from the current crisis, what will it look like? Europe's problem isn't that Germany exports too much. The problem is that we haven't done enough to increase demand in Germany. The recent increase in pay rates was a small step, but the lack of a basic minimum wage is a problem. That's an absurd German quirk: it doesn't make sense for our British friends to have a minimum wage but not us. Europe's other problem is that there are some countries within the eurozone who are no longer capable of being competitive. Too much debt is certainly a problem in Greece, but not everywhere across the eurozone. Our main problem is that we need to become more competitive, and Germany shouldn't just stand by the sideline and comment but become an active member of the community. There's a theory that says we're looking at a trend towards ever smaller parties across Europe, who cater exclusively for regional and specialist interests. Is Germany on the path to Belgian conditions? That's hard to say. We saw the rise of a new party with the Pirates in Germany, but we are currently seeing a decline in their polling results. It's certainly true that the days of lifelong voter loyalty are over – all parties notice that. But you see that in Great Britain too, even if you have a majority voting system. If you look at the power of Ukip in some parts of the country, and the effect it is having on Tory policy, then you can see that even a party that gets 3-4% can wield a lot of influence. In every country in Europe there is currently a lot of insecurity, and populists are trying to exploit that. Does Germany still have a problem with the far right? We have to be honest enough to admit that there is a problem, particularly in the east. In most parts of Germany, we make a point of not entering a dialogue with the NPD [the National Democratic party] – we regard them as an anti-democratic movement. But we have to realise that there are small pockets in the country where that isn't the case, because the other parties have simply withered away. There are no short-term fixes for that, but we shouldn't ignore it completely either. We have to make sure that we don't just try to ban the extreme right, but also that we support those movements and those citizens that stand up to the far right. There's still plenty Germany can learn from countries who have more experience with diversity: one important step would be to make sure that the police force reflects the ethnic diversity of the population. Does Germany have a problem with the way it treats its migrant population? For a long time, Germans only knew non-whites living in Germany as Ausländer, \"foreigners\". Then they started talking about Einwanderer, \"immigrants\". But I'm not an immigrant, I migrated to Germany via the maternity ward of a German hospital. When I speak to my American friends and they ask me what generation immigrant I am, I tell them that in Germany, I'm considered a second-generation immigrant. But to them, I would be a first-generation immigrant, because I was born in Germany. When the Greens were last in government, we changed the law so that people who were born in Germany would also be legally certified as Germans – replacing a law introduced by Kaiser Wilhelm in 1913. If we win the next election, we want to extend the citizenship law further – not because we want to make things easier for immigrants, but because we think it's in Germany's interest that people who have lived in the country for a long time are recognised as citizens. Solving problems is always easier among citizens than between citizens and non-citizens. In 1998, I said I wished that people with a similar background to mine could play football for Germany. I got into lots of trouble for that: a lot of Germans shook their head and I got criticised in the Turkish press. And look at the national team now."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/oct/08/firms-tories-2030-carbon-target","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-10-07T23:17:00Z","webTitle":"Firms call on Tories to back 2030 carbon target for power sector","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/08/firms-tories-2030-carbon-target","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/oct/08/firms-tories-2030-carbon-target","fields":{"headline":"Firms call on Tories to back 2030 carbon target for power sector","bodyText":"More than 50 businesses, including household names such as Asda, Sky and PepsiCo, have called on the government to put in place a 2030 target on decarbonising the power sector. They argue that such a move – already backed by Labour and the Lib Dems – will stimulate investment and revitalise the UK's ageing energy infrastructure. Their call comes as George Osborne prepares to address the Tory party conference, a speech that may recall aspects of his oft-repeated attacks on green policies as a burden on businesses. Osborne's aides have made clear the chancellor is against a 2030 target on carbon, and last year he fought successfully to have the UK's carbon targets for the 2020s reviewed. Osborne also supports a new \"dash for gas\", which would entail building a fleet of about 20 new gas-fired power stations, and which green campaigners and renewable energy companies have said could raise emissions and stifle investment in renewable energy. The businesses – including some of the biggest in the UK, and spanning a wide range of sectors from retailers to insurance and technology companies – have written to the chancellor to urge him to support a 2030 target that would in effect ensure that almost all of the UK's electricity was from low-carbon sources. This would require a massive expansion of renewable energy, and potentially also nuclear power and the installation of carbon capture and storage at fossil fuel power stations. The letter was co-ordinated by the Aldersgate Group, a coalition of businesses that supports the move to a more sustainable green economy. In a veiled reference to Osborne's attacks on renewable energy and environmental regulation, the letter says: \"The government's perceived commitment to the low carbon transition is being undermined by recent statements calling for unabated gas in the power sector beyond 2030 and the absence of a specific carbon intensity target.\" The signatories point to a warning from the Committee on Climate Change, the statutory body that advises ministers on meeting carbon targets, that the widespread use of gas-fired generation without carbon capture and storage after 2030 could violate the government's own commitments on carbon reduction. Peter Young, chairman of the Aldersgate Group, said: \"The message of this letter is loud and clear: we must put an end to any political uncertainty surrounding the UK's energy future and start unleashing the billions of pounds of overdue investment which will deliver new growth for our economy.\" In a message directed at the Tory party conference, he said: \"Both the Labour and Liberal Democrat parties understand this huge growth opportunity and backed a 2030 carbon target for the power sector at their party conferences. Now the Conservative party must step up to the mark and provide the full cross-party support which businesses have been calling for.\" The businesses did not set a particular level for the 2030 target, preferring instead to ask only for a target. The biggest names on the list include Asda, Aviva, Alliance Boots, BT, British American Tobacco, Cisco, EDF, Eurostar, Marks &amp; Spencer, Microsoft, PepsiCo, Philips, Reed Elsevier, Sky, The Co-operative and Tridos Bank."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/french-election-blog-2012/2012/apr/02/eva-joly-green-candidate-french-election","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2012-04-02T08:54:14Z","webTitle":"Green party's 'strange' Joly struggles to win over voters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/french-election-blog-2012/2012/apr/02/eva-joly-green-candidate-french-election","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/french-election-blog-2012/2012/apr/02/eva-joly-green-candidate-french-election","fields":{"headline":"Green party's 'strange' Joly struggles to win over voters","bodyText":"Can you run for French president if you've got a strong foreign accent? It's not going to do you any favours, as the Norwegian-born Green candidate, Eva Joly, attests. Joly is a household name in France as the ruthless fraud prosecutor who nailed the 1990s corruption scandal at the oil giant Elf. The maverick 67-year-old's pursuit of corruption at the highest reaches of the French elite inspired Claude Chabrol's dark thriller, A Comedy of Power, in which Isabelle Huppert played a vengeful magistrate loosely modelled on Joly. But her presidential campaign as candidate for the environmental party, Europe Ecologie-les Verts, has failed to take off. Festering at around 2% in the polls, when last year the Greens had hoped for 10%, she has faced sniping and doubts, even from within her own camp, about campaign strategy and the wisdom of putting forward a novice \"non-politician\" in one of the world's most cut-throat presidential battles. Joly, an MEP for the Paris region since 2009, has tried to make her non-political background and outsider-status a selling point. But the former investigating judge with trademark red glasses admitted this weekend she was seen as too \"strange\" for many. Born Gro Eva Farseth in Oslo, she has lived in France for 50 years and has dual French-Norwegian nationality. Her strong Norwegian accent and monotone voice were always seen as a handicap but she refused voice coaching. Instead, she has slammed the prejudice and discrimination against France's sizeable number of foreigners and immigrants which she says has been exposed by attacks on her campaign. She made a campaign video in defence of people with accents that became one of the classic films of the election, in which she bats off charges from Karl Lagerfeld, the Paris-based German fashion-designer, that she should take French lessons. Asked on TV on Sunday if she would take a ministerial post in any future leftwing government, she said no one would ask her because she represented too much \"strangeness\". \"I've got an accent. I wasn't born here. I didn't go to ENA [France's elite graduate school for civil servants], I'm a woman, and not a young woman,\" she said, telling her critics: \"You've got a right to crush me, and insult me, but you've got no right to insult ecology.\" Ecologists fear that without a decent showing in the polls, the environment could drop to the bottom of the agenda for other candidates. French voters' key concerns are jobs, the economy and their own finances. And yet, post-Fukushima, the environmental stakes have never been so high. Around 75% of France's electricity is generated by nuclear power, the world's highest ratio. Power stations, pesticides, nitrates, GM crops and shale gas are all key issues. Joly wants to stop all nuclear energy production in France by 2020 and derive 40% of power from renewable sources. The Socialist François Hollande has said the share of nuclear energy in France's power supply should drop to 50% by 2025 and has promised to close one site - the ageing Fessenheim nuclear plant - by 2017, but he would complete work on the advanced Flamanville nuclear power station. Sarkozy wants to reinforce France's nuclear power industry. The real test for the Greens will come after the presidential vote, in parliamentary elections in June. Europe Ecologie-Les Verts has done a deal with the Socialist party to run candidates in several key constituencies, which could allow the Greens to increase their number of seats in parliament. Meanwhile, Joly is free to hammer home her stance on other issues, such as proposing to legalise cannabis. She was briefly hospitalised on Sunday night after a fall but her team insisted the campaign would continue as normal."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/political-science/2013/mar/01/science-policy-popular-culture","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2013-03-01T13:00:07Z","webTitle":"Why science policy should take popular culture seriously | Alice Bell","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2013/mar/01/science-policy-popular-culture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/political-science/2013/mar/01/science-policy-popular-culture","fields":{"headline":"Why science policy should take popular culture seriously","bodyText":"I'm surrounded by badgers. I've never actually seen one live, though I'm told my university campus is riddled with them. Our student newspaper is called the Badger (I think he's called Ronald). I have several badger badges and a couple of badger toys friends have given me to laugh at my interest in the cull. I'm forever spotting brightly coloured badger-themed street art around my home in Brighton. I have piles of books on the things. Wikipedia's list of fictional badgers is a thing of beauty; from Narnia's Trufflehunter and Bill in Rupert the Bear to the Weebls' Badger Badger Badger song (dubstep version), Bryan Talbot's \"Grandville\" steampunk graphic novels or Hogwarts's Hufflepuffs. They're everywhere. That I've never seen a real badger and yet feel surrounded by them might seem like an example of the divide between urban life and nature. I disagree. It's an example of how suffused with animals our lives are, and that nature doesn't end where industrialisation begins. Just think about how many brands have animals in their logos (seriously, think about it). The trick is to reflect upon such symbols, stay cognisant as to what they represent. Shell's name and logo, for example, isn't some recent attempt at a \"greenwash\" nod to nature, it's because the company started off selling seashells. Really! An antique dealer in 1830s London noticed a fashion for using shells in interior design. They were so popular he had to get more from abroad, laying the foundations for an international import/export business which – via trading of rice, sugar, flour and more – by the 1890s was transporting oil. These things have roots. Images of animals or machines in popular culture reflect public attitudes to science, technology and nature, but they are also part of the process by which we publicly digest policy regulating them too. Jokes about horsemeat – like mad cows before them – might distract us from thinking about the details of how we've industrialised animals, they might be a bit crass and, several weeks on, they might be a bit dull. But they are one of the ways we make sense of the issue. Back to the badgers: Angela Cassidy studies science, scientists, policy and politicians to understand the politics of the cull, but she looks at children's books too. Cultural images are threaded through this debate, just look at SchNEWS's pistol wielding badger at the top of their reports. Joshua Kopstein recently wrote about the ways drones seem to be emerging as a kind of cultural icon. As part of this article, James Bridle (who's behind the fascinating Dronestagram) told him: There's been a huge amount of hard work done by some politicians, NGOs, some journalists, etc. to raise the profile of the use of unmanned weapons in the last few years. But they seem to have snuck into the public consciousness by a number of routes, a fever dream of networked society. Art reflects back these fears, and can perhaps provide a lens through which to understand and focus this disquiet. There's plenty of thoughtless 'drone art' out there, and there's always a danger that they become 'cool', iconic, or fetishistic. But then, these techniques can always be used to analyse and explain too For a precursor to drone art, perhaps, check out the 1983 \"Riders of the Apocalypse\" mural in New Cross (or you can sign a petition to protect its 1981 sister mural in Brixton). In recent years, some effort has gone into science-art collaborations as a way of helping engage the public with science. However, like a lot of \"public engagement\", it's arguable that this is done more to make us feel comfortable with new technologies (or even distract us from them) than argue about them. Similarly, perhaps, I find Greenpeace's invitation to make Arctic themed crafts a bit patronising. It seems like a passive form of interaction, about celebrating their projects, not shaping them. Maybe I'm being too cynical. Maybe I've just read too much Chomsky. Still, that the Tate didn't accept the \"gift\" of a wind turbine blade perhaps showed up some of the differences at play here. It would be interesting to see how the Science Museum or Wellcome Collection react to a similar presentation, especially considering their expressed commitment to public engagement. There is a growing movement of art in response to the oil industry. I find the way artists have playfully re-used advertising materials especially interesting. There was the subversion of Shell's advertising in the Arctic Ready spoof site last summer. Or the oil staining of BP at the Tate by Reverend Billy in the video above. My favourite is the way BP's logo has been turned into an Elizabethan ruff by Reclaim the Bard. Zingy, the EDF logo, has also come in for rather a lot of re-making in the past week, in support of the No Dash for Gas activists (try the Free Zingy Facebook page). That's not to say all re-uses of such logos are done as critiques. People have been knitting their own EDF logos for a while (here's a pattern) simply because they like it. This might seem like a strange thing to do. But people are strange (and creative, playful, angry and silly) and we'll only make strong science and technology policy if we remember that. Those who wish to sell us such new technologies know the role of play and aesthetics as much as those who want to critique them. That's why EDF creates characters like Zingy. It's why BAE systems gave out squishy submarine toys to schoolchildren visiting the Big Bang Fair last year. It's also why both sides of the nuclear power debate have produced games (\"Richie's World Of Adventure\" and \"Duke Anti-Nuke\") and the Wellcome Trust invite researchers to \"Gamify Your PhD\". Science policy happens, at least in part, through popular culture; be it art, advertising, activism, games, jokes, songs, funny-shaped cakes, knitting patterns or something else entirely. It might be easy to forget this in such a seemingly serious business as science policy, but to dismiss it as trivial is, like all snobbishness, ultimately limiting the debate."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2012/nov/29/energy-bill-renewables-industry","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2012-11-29T14:22:42Z","webTitle":"This energy bill will fire up the renewables industry | Gordon Edge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/nov/29/energy-bill-renewables-industry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2012/nov/29/energy-bill-renewables-industry","fields":{"headline":"This energy bill will fire up the renewables industry","bodyText":"The importance of the energy bill, which will frame the investment climate for the next several decades, cannot be exaggerated. Although we are still digesting all the detail in the bill, the provisions announced last week do appear to provide the industry with the kind of assurance we've been calling for, with the government sending a message that the money will be available to ensure that 30% of our electricity will come from renewable sources by 2020. As Maria McCaffery, chief executive of Renewable UK, said: \"The lion's share will come from wind energy, where we now know for certain that we will have at least 31 gigawatts installed onshore and offshore by the end of the decade.\" All this is vital to persuading both British and foreign companies to make decades-long commitments to this country by, for example, setting up turbine assembly plants or port facilities designed to ship turbines to offshore locations in the North Sea and Irish Sea. You don't have to be a whizz at maths to see that the targets will require a steep growth rate in renewables. It would be a remarkable trajectory, taking wind from a 1% share of the nation's electricity to around 25% in under 15 years, overtaking nuclear power in the process. But can this actually happen? Yes it really can, provided the industry (both in the UK and abroad) continues to make the strides it has been making over the past few years. At around 9.30pm on a cold day in mid-September last year, something extremely exciting happened in the UK (albeit completely unnoticeable to all but a few operators in the National Grid's control centre): wind power set a new all-time generation record of 3.98GW. \"System demand\" at the time was 34.9GW which meant that, for the first time in the UK's history, the wind was meeting more than 10% of our total electricity demand, nearly 12% actually. This probably doesn't strike you as a particularly high figure, but bear in mind that it wasn't until 2007 that wind power actually registered in the government's energy statistics at all, coming in at a rather paltry 0.9%. Nevertheless, that was also the year in which the largest windfarms were given the status of \"major power producers\" by the then Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform. Installed capacity (the maximum amount of electricity that can be generated by a technology) is 10 times greater today than eight years ago, in 2004, and that kind of growth isn't too bad over a period in which, for the greater part, the country has been mired in economic difficulties. Last year (2011-12) the industry had a great year; investment in offshore wind grew by 60% to £1.5bn and the rate of approvals for onshore windfarms rose by nearly 50% in terms of capacity. Excitingly, Samsung Heavy Industries was given permission to demonstrate a 7MW turbine off the Fife coast after announcing in January that it would base its first European offshore wind project there, and we will see Siemens' 6MW machines installed at the Gunfleet Sands project early next year. These turbines, the largest in the world, represent the cutting edge of the offshore deep water sector. Of course there will be major industrial challenges to assembling, installing and maintaining them as they are rolled out in their hundreds; for example, Britain needs to upgrade its port facilities, but this would generate thousands of jobs. It's true that Britain does lack a major turbine manufacturer at the moment but certainty on future energy policy greatly enhances the likelihood of a number of manufacturers coming here. Already British companies are manufacturing components domestically – like Mabey Bridge's onshore turbine towers – and becoming significant exporters of components – for example gearbox components from Huddersfield's David Brown. And what do we stand to gain? Well, I think the argument was best put by the prime minister, David Cameron, recently – very simply: \"Growth of the renewable energy sector isn't just good for our environment, it's good for our economy too.\" Bring on 2020."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2012/nov/28/lake-district-radioactive-waste-grave","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-11-28T12:41:17Z","webTitle":"Lake District park authority 'concerned' over radioactive waste burial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/nov/28/lake-district-radioactive-waste-grave","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/nov/28/lake-district-radioactive-waste-grave","fields":{"headline":"Lake District park authority 'concerned' over radioactive waste burial","bodyText":"The Lake District national park has added its huge clout to growing concern that nuclear waste burial in Cumbria is a dangerous and economically damaging non-starter. The park's governing authority has written to the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) minister responsible for nuclear waste, warning for the first time that fears about losing nuclear industry jobs in the region need to be balanced by potentially disastrous effects on tourism. The move follows two public meetings in west Cumbria last week which heard from geological experts that a \"cracked and leaky dish\" was the best that the area's complex rock strata could provide to store material with a radioactive life of hundreds of thousands of year. In the letter, the authority chair, Bill Jefferson, tells Baroness Verma, the junior energy minister: \"There are growing and increasingly widespread concerns that a repository below the national park or indeed a perception of such a proposal would not be in the long-term interests of the Lake District, its farming and resident communities and visitor economy. \"Evidence suggests a potential risk to the Lake District's brand image, and on communities that rely on this brand. The lengthy process, necessary for considering such a facility, could exacerbate this risk. While we do not know what precise impacts a repository under the national park would have on its special qualities, I am concerned such a proposal could adversely affect the Lake District's brand image, its national and international standing, reputation and integrity, prejudicing the delivery of the vision to the detriment of the Cumbrian tourism economy and our statutory responsibilities.\" The letter, copied to Cumbria county council and Copeland districts which are also registering increasing disquiet, significantly ratchets up the park's doubts about the proposal. The authority and the councils are all members of the West Cumbria Managing Radioactive Waste Safely Partnership which is the only local authority body in the country still interested in investigating underground storage for nuclear waste. Jefferson was among several hundred people at a meeting in Maryport, Cumbria, who gasped when two geology professors showed a map of potential facilities scarring Ennerdale, one of the wildest and most beautiful parts of the Lakes. The images, based on French designs which have been approved at Bure in the Meuse department of eastern France, showed a felltop road close to the mountains of Pillar and Steeple and Red Pike and an above-ground plant at Gillerthwaite, between the lake and Wild Ennerdale, one of the flagship projects of the national park authority and partners, who are currently banning all motor traffic from the valley. The park has to tread carefully because it is the planning authority which would eventually consider any application, but Jefferson said that it would have been an abdication of responsibility not to make the strength of local worries clear. Although there is great concern over the 9,231 jobs at the Sellafield uclear complex, the spectre has now been raised of much greater economic damage through the effects of proceeding on tourism, Cumbria's biggest economic sector. Jefferson said: \"Tourism brings in far more than Sellafield ever would, and let's face it, there are going to be more than enough jobs in dealing with the clear-up and improvement of above-ground storage which is happening there. We have 15 million people coming to the park every year, and the prospect of having the world's largest nuclear waste dump could make that considerably less.\" Local opposition, muted in the past because of job concerns, is growing rapidly under the banner \"protest and survive\", a twist on civil defence \"protect and survive\" advice during the nuclear scares of the cold war. The meetings in Maryport and Silloth last week heard devastating critiques of the region's geology by two academics – one a former consultant to the nuclear industry in the 1990s when £400m was spent on testing farmland next to Sellafield for an underground laboratory and potential burial of waste. \"This is among the most studied and best understood geology anywhere in Britain, and there is nowhere safe for a burial site,\" said emeritus professor David Smythe of Glasgow University, showing slide after slide of rock fractures, aquifers and porous strata. His colleague Prof Stuart Haszeldine of Edinburgh University told the meeting: \"You are being asked to buy a mystery object in a brown bag,\" a metaphor for the decision facing Allerdale and Copeland district councils and Cumbria county council over the next 10 weeks. The timetable, already delayed for six months by councillors' hesitations, is for the authorities to agree to proceed with the government's \"host community\" approach to radioactive waste burial: in return for promises of community benefit in other fields, any council in the country can volunteer to take the enormous hole whose specification is safe storage of nuclear waste for 1 million years. Radioactivity is so dangerous for so long that waste disposal has parameters unknown in any other industry. Only West Cumbria and Dungeness in Kent have put their hands up, with the latter backing out in September after a survey showed two-thirds of locals were opposed. To Edmund Potter and his wife Linda, who look after the Ennerdale and Eskdale foxhounds amid the glories of the Western Lakes, the councils' decision to volunteer was just another law of nature. \"Nuclear isn't popular with a lot of people, any more than what we do is,\" says Linda, as the hounds frisk round behind the couple's stone farmhouse. \"But you'll not find anyone talking down Sellafield round here. It's part of the landscape. \" Indeed, the world of tumbling becks, crags and tawny bracken above the kennels frames the towers and chimneys nine miles away. \"She's dead right,\" agrees Mark Todd in the King George IV pub at Eskdale Green. He's a scaffolder on contract at the plant who also runs a guesthouse at St Bees which depends on nuclear industry visitors. \"I'm a Guardian reader, lifelong. We've called the guesthouse Whistling Jack's after a character Harry Griffin wrote about in one of his Country Diaries.\" He is also ex-Socialist Workers' Party, brawled at Wapping and refused to accept payment for scaffolding Michael Foot's house. He discovered the link after asking about a photograph of Foot in the kitchen and being told by Jill Craigie: Oh, that's my husband. \"I know, I know. Of all people, I should be against it,\" he says. \"But the old governments did a clever thing when they brought all the nuclear stuff up here. We're far away and we've precious little else. They feel they can rest easy about West Cumbria getting worked up.\" Two things have now undermined that fatalism, prompting both resurgent protest and greater nervousness by local decision-makers. This month's condemnation by the National Audit Office of the \"intolerable risk\" posed by current radioactive waste storage on site at Sellafield – described as a \"rundown building\" with enough high and intermediate material to fill 27 Olympic swimming pools – shook local people. More significantly, it made national headlines. The public meeting in Maryport was full of demands for more. \"If the national media's interested in that,\" said one questioner to cheers, \"surely we can interest them in the burial issue?\" Secondly, campaigners are sedulously not anti-nuclear, and are gaining ground by arguing: Sellafield and nuclear, yes; burial, no. John Harwood, chair of Solway Plain Against Nuclear Dump and the event's organiser opened the meeting by underlining that it was logical to hold both views. Prof Haszeldine did the same. The response was a litany of acceptance and often praise for the industry's longstanding and crucial role in West Cumbria. For every job lost by rejecting the burial plan, said speakers from both platform and floor, more could be created by proper on-site storage in the short term (which in nuclear terms is 100 years), work on new ways of treating radioactive waste, which is making progress, and other nuclear developments. Smyth's past enthusiasm for nuclear power was so great that he refused to play with his rock band the Rezillos when they did a gig for opponents of the Torness nuclear power station in the 1970s. \"They had to get the sax to play bass instead,\" he said, and though he is no longer a nuclear supporter, he took the meeting through his past involvement in nostalgic detail. Then he put up a slide which had the two hundred-odd audience gasping: a map of a proposed 20 km square French waste storage underground at Ennerdale, whose granite is one of two areas in West Cumbria, along with Silloth on the Solway, which appear to be in the frame for a burial site. The potential hole might be underground, but the structure to dig and maintain it involved a road up Ennerdale fell, neighbour of famous Lakeland giants such as Pillar, Steeple and Red Pike and a plant at Gillerthwaite, between the lake and 'Wild Ennerdale', one of the flagship projects of the Lake District national park authority and partners, who are banning all motor traffic from the valley. Such details are speculative and hypothetical, and the government and the West Cumbria Managing Waste Safety Partnership, which is handling consultations before the councils decide in January whether to continue with the next of a series of stages, emphasise that research remains to be done. But the initial plan to start burial in 2075 has crept closer, with talk of intermediate burial from 2040 and leaked letters this summer suggesting that some in the government would like that moved to 2029. The chair of the national park authority, Bill Jefferson, was at the meeting and arranged afterwards to see Haszeldine and Smythe later in the week. Back at the King George IV in Eskdale, Todd said: \"They may take us for granted, but there's one place they are vulnerable and that's down south. They did a survey about how people down there would feel about visiting the Lake District if it was sat on top of a radioactive dump and they weren't happy at all. That could change minds.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theguardian/2012/dec/18/guardian-weekly-review-2012-economics","type":"article","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webPublicationDate":"2012-12-18T14:03:02Z","webTitle":"African performance a bright spot as eurozone crisis rumbles through 2012","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2012/dec/18/guardian-weekly-review-2012-economics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/2012/dec/18/guardian-weekly-review-2012-economics","fields":{"headline":"African performance a bright spot as eurozone crisis rumbles through 2012","bodyText":"As the Greek national drama entered its third act in the autumn, most eyes had already switched their gaze to Spain. If 2011 was dominated by events unfolding in Athens, the agenda of almost every international gathering in 2012 focused on how Madrid would extricate itself from the debt trap that had already claimed Ireland, Portugal and Greece. Spain's right-of-centre prime minister Mariano Rajoy inherited a policy of denial from his socialist predecessors and, initially at least, adopted the same tactic. But with Spain targeted by international investors as the next domino after Greece to jeopardise the euro currency project, it became the focus of worldwide attention. If only Europe could resolve its debt problems, the global economy would recover its momentum. This was the message from Tokyo, Beijing and Washington, where policymakers felt constrained in the face of Europe's procrastination. An impending recession in the eurozone made reforms all the more urgent. A strongly growing US economy at the end of 2011 entered a presidential election year with Europe on its back. Thankfully for President Barack Obama, the housing crisis, which had seen prices fall by more than 40% in states such as Nevada and Arizona, bottomed out, small companies began hiring and bank lending eased in time for the November vote. Likewise, Japan began the year in recovery mode. It suffered the double hit of a financial crisis and a tsunami, which wrecked much of the country's north-east in the spring of 2011. Regaining export orders was the No 1 priority and all seemed to be going well until the summer, when the balance of payments went into reverse, largely as a result of huge gas imports to replace the lack of nuclear power following the Fukushima tragedy. Worse, major electronics firms Sony, Panasonic and Sharp revealed deep losses. The South Korean manufacturing revolution, led by Samsung, had effectively ended 30 years of Japanese dominance. Car manufacture continued to be one of the bright spots, though a dispute over a group of uninhabited islands in the East China Sea put even that in jeopardy. China, which claims the islands along with Japan, allowed nationalists to riot largely unchecked, burning and looting Japanese shops and factories. A boycott of Japanese goods resulted in a slump in sales of Toyotas and Nissans, again allowing the South Koreans a competitive advantage. Part of the problem followed a year-long slowdown in Chinese manufacturing that was already causing jitters across the west. The Chinese powerhouse economy had survived the global financial crisis after a large injection of government funds, but Beijing had little room to repeat the exercise without stoking inflation and an already rampant property bubble. Tentative moves to increase government spending on health, social security and pensions, alongside liberalising laws designed to allow more private-sector involvement in areas previously dominated by the state, helped the economy move forward. Yet a political stasis, ahead of November's appointment of a successor to premier Wen Jiabao, appeared to hold up progress. Brazil, which saw its income jump above Britain's in late 2011 to make it the world's sixth-largest economy, suffered a sharp slowdown following a surge in the value of its currency. Like the other Bric countries of Russia, India and China, Brazil found it was more dependent on Europe and the west than its public statements of economic independence gave credit. It complained about the volume of money printed by western central banks that was making its own more attractive. With hot money pouring in, Brazil's central bank raised capital controls. Unfortunately the policy had little effect; foreign investment funds continued to pour in and Brazilian exports became more expensive. Only Africa appeared immune to the knock-on effects of the eurozone debt crisis. From Nigeria to Zambia to South Africa, growth rates topped 5% compared with less than 2% in the US and sub-zero in most major European countries by the end of the year. However, a meeting of the World Bank in Tokyo in October revealed widespread disquiet among African trade unions and charities at the distribution of incomes and wealth. World Bank officials were bombarded with stories of poverty among workers while owners, many of them foreign mining companies, made millions of dollars in profits. In Europe, the year ended on a low note. While Spain appeared to get a grip on its bankrupt banking sector and the European Central Bank pencilled in a recovery for 2013 across the continent, Italy appeared to want the limelight. Silvio Berlusconi burst back on to the political scene, potentially stealing the lead role in the debt crisis from Madrid."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2012/dec/16/japanese-conservatives-poll-triumph","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2012-12-16T11:58:08Z","webTitle":"Japanese conservatives stage dramatic electoral comeback","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/16/japanese-conservatives-poll-triumph","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/dec/16/japanese-conservatives-poll-triumph","fields":{"headline":"Japanese conservatives stage dramatic electoral comeback","bodyText":"Japan's main conservative party is on course for a resounding victory in Sunday's election, with exit polls indicating it could take control of two-thirds of the lower house, consigning the centre-left government to a crushing defeat. The Liberal Democratic party (LDP), ousted from office just three years ago, has staged a dramatic comeback under its leader, Shinzo Abe, who as head of the largest party is assured of becoming prime minister. Exit polls showed the LDP would win 296 seats in the 480-seat lower house, while its longtime ally, New Komeito, was on course to win 32 seats. Combined, the tally would give the parties the \"super-majority\" they need to take total control of both houses of parliament and end years of policy deadlock and instability. Abe, who resigned as prime minister in 2007 after a year blighted by scandals involving cabinet ministers, has promised to take a tougher stance towards China over the Senkaku islands, give Japan's armed forces a bigger international role and retain nuclear power, despite growing opposition to atomic energy in the wake of last year's Fukushima Daiichi meltdown. On the economy – the single biggest issue of the campaign – Abe has pledged to return to high spending on public works and ease monetary policy to boost growth. The Japanese economy has been beset by stagnation and deflation for two decades and recently entered its fourth recession since 2000. The governing Democratic party of Japan [DPJ] is expected to suffer a heavy defeat, three years after it ended the LDP's near-monopoly on power with a landslide victory at the last election. Exit polls said the DPJ could be reduced to fewer than 70 seats. Party officials interviewed by TV networks hinted that its leader, Yoshihiko Noda, would have to take responsibility for its disastrous showing and resign immediately. The election also saw the emergence of a third force in the form of the Japan Restoration party, a far-right group led by the outspoken former governor of Tokyo, Shintaro Ishihara. It was predicted to win around 46 seats. At one point polls suggested the Restoration party could overtake the DPJ as the country's second-biggest party and act as powerbroker in a hung parliament. That level of influence now looks unlikely, however. Turnout was sluggish at just over 27% by mid-afternoon, down 7.8 percentage points from 2009, according to government data. Abe, 58, will become Japan's seventh prime minister in just over six years. Noda's 11th-hour plea to reject the LDP's \"old-style politics\" failed to sway voters. The LDP, which governed for all but 11 months between 1955 and 2009, has capitalised on popular anger over the DPJ's failure to deliver on a promise to replace pork-barrel politics with a focus on families, welfare and healthcare. Many voters feel the DPJ has dithered over the reconstruction of the region devastated by last year's earthquake and tsunami. And they associate Noda with an unpopular plan to double the consumption (sales) tax to 10%, a measure that passed only with the support of Abe's party. But there was little enthusiasm outside polling stations for the LDP and Abe, the grandson of a former prime minister who holds revisionist views on Japan's wartime conduct and supports a more active overseas role for Japan's armed forces. Instead, uncertainty over the economy and Japan's response to the rise of China appears to have sent voters reaching for the familiar – big spending on public works to boost growth, and close security ties with the US to counter the perceived threat from China. \"The Democrats are out because they have been unable to implement their policy manifesto and are divided internally. But that doesn't mean I support the LDP,\" said Yosuke Matsumoto, 33. \"Nothing will change under them.\" Koichi Nakano, a political science professor at Sophia University, said the election was about punishing the DPJ, which won by a landslide in 2009. \"It seems to me that people are driven by nostalgia, as they seem to want to bring the LDP back to power because they lack better alternatives,\" he told Reuters. Voters, many of whom said they were undecided going into the election, had no fewer than 12 parties to choose from. Of the 480 seats in Japan's lower house, 300 are elected from single-seat districts and the remaining 180 through proportional representation in 11 regional blocs."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/may/29/turkey-nuclear-hydro-power-development","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-05-29T17:56:46Z","webTitle":"Turkey's Great Leap Forward risks cultural and environmental bankruptcy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/29/turkey-nuclear-hydro-power-development","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/may/29/turkey-nuclear-hydro-power-development","fields":{"headline":"Turkey's Great Leap Forward risks cultural and environmental bankruptcy","bodyText":"Every springtime Pervin Çoban Savran takes her camels and sheep up into the Taurus mountains of southern Turkey, following the same routes along the Goksu river that Yoruk people like her have taken for more than 1,000 years. To many Turks these last nomadic tribes are symbols of the soul of their nation. Their way of life – and that of millions of small farmers – is being threatened by Turkey's Great Leap Forward, one of the most dramatic and potentially devastating rushes for economic development and prosperity Europe has seen in decades. Thousands of dam and hydropower schemes are being built on almost all of the main rivers in a pharaonic push to make Turkey a world economic power by the centenary of the republic in 2023. The ruling AK party, expected to win a record third term in next month's elections, is forcing through a series of gigantic public works projects that include three nuclear power plants – despite Turkey being one of the most seismically active nations on earth. The first plant, a prototype Russian reactor on the Mediterranean coast near the port of Mersin, is close to a highly active faultline. A second, Japanese-built, plant will soon follow on the Black Sea near the city of Sinop. Prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan raised eyebrows across the world last month by promising to cut a 40-mile canal between the Black Sea and Marmara to relieve the dangerously overcrowded Bosphorus strait, an idea even he calls his \"crazy plan\". He has since topped that by revealing a blueprint for two new cities to relieve earthquake-prone Istanbul. Critics say they will only further extend Europe's largest megalopolis, home already to nearly 17 million people. It is Erdogan's declaration that Turkey's rivers must no longer \"run in vain\" and 100% of its hydroelectric potential be harnessed over the next 12 years that has environmentalists most worried. They claim that the rush for hydropower is likely to be even more damaging to Turkey's delicate ecological balance, where desertification and depopulation are already problems. Hundreds of private companies have been given extraordinary latitude to evict villagers, expropriate private land, clear state forests and steamroller normal planning restrictions to meet the target of 4,000 hydroelectric schemes by 2023. Protestors claim licences have been granted on highly favourable terms, guaranteeing investors four decades of clear profit. The Turkish Water Assembly, an umbrella group researching the impact of the push for more power, argued that 2 million people could be displaced by the hydropower schemes alone. They accuse the government of riding roughshod over human rights, and Turkey's commitments to preserving its extraordinary biodiversity and cultural heritage, in the name of energy security. Campaigners fear Ankara is also determined to press ahead with the massive Ilisu dam project on the Tigris river, which was halted three years ago after an international outcry over the flooding of the ancient city of Hasankeyf. The Ilisu dam is dwarfed by the $4bn Beyhan project on the Euphrates, also in the Kurdish south-east, where fears of the forced evacuation of the local population evokes bitter memories of the mass clearances of Kurdish villagers by the Turkish army during the war with the Kurdish separatist PKK in the 1980s. Demonstrators intent on converging on Ankara from five corners of the country are still being prevented from reaching the capital after a week-long standoff with riot police outside Ankara. Many, like the Yoruks, had been walking for two months as a part of the Great March of Anatolia, a movement sparked by anger at the hydro plans but which has come to embody growing anxiety that the country is being despoiled in the rush for growth. While the neo-liberal reforms of the moderately Islamist AK party have been credited with firing the country's runaway growth, the gulf between the rich and poor has widened dramatically, and corruption has increased. The Turkish government insists it must act radically to safeguard the decade-long boom, with growth this year predicted to top 7% despite the worldwide downturn. Energy, however, is the achilles heel of the so-called Anatolian tiger, with industry heavily dependent on imported gas from Russia and Iran. Despite making itself the hub of a network of pipelines serving Europe from Russia, Central Asia and Iran, Turkey is even more at the mercy of Moscow and Tehran – a fact dramaticallydemonstrated four years ago when Iran turned off the tap and sent fuel prices in Istanbul soaring overnight. Erdogan has so far been withering of critics of his Great Leap Forward, accusing them of holding Turkey back. He argued that the hydro projects will bring thousands of jobs to the underdeveloped east, irrigate barren land and reverse the wave of migration to the more prosperous west. \"All investments can have negative outcomes,\" he said. \"But you can't give up just because there can be some negative outcomes. We cannot say that there will be no earthquake, but we will take all the precautions.\" After the Fukushima disaster in Japan, his energy minister Taner Yildiz caused consternation by claiming that nuclear power was no more dangerous than staying single, citing studies showing married people tend to live four years longer. Alcohol and smoking posed more danger than nuclear power, he claimed, prompting comparisons with former president Kenan Evren's claim after Chernobyl that \"radiation is good for the bones\". Tourism minister Ertugrul Gunay appeared to break ranks, warning that \"if the hydroelectric energy projects are carried out in a reckless manner, cutting out each brook, levelling each mountain and destroying forests just to be able to produce a few watts of energy, tourism would be an impossible dream\", particularly in the Black Sea region. His comments came as laws were being drafted to allow nature reserves to be handed over for hydroelectric projects. Still more worrying to campaigners has been the official reaction to the legal morass the plans have created, with almost 100 lawsuits filed in the last two years. Of the 41 cases so far heard, judges have halted 39. Work has often continued in defiance of the courts with the protection of police and gendarmerie. Each hydro scheme is allowed to take 90% of the water out of a section of river, leaving the remaining 10 % as \"lifeline support\". After the water travels through the turbines, it is returned to the river, but farmers say much of the water is either lost, polluted or has had the \"life taken out of it\". For Yoruks such as Pervin Çoban Savran it is their very survival that is in question. \"Nobody in parliament has shown any interest in our cause,\" she said. \"They don't love life, only money. These dams are bringing about our end. Our culture is being destroyed.\" Hydroelectric projects on the tributaries of the Goksu river have already severelydamaged traditional pastures, she said. \"It has affected us very quickly. But in the end, everyone else will suffer too.\" 'They want to turn us into slaves' \"They killed me when they took my land,\" said Sinan Akçal, a tea grower from the spectacular Senoz valley on the Black Sea. He has watched his local court order the cancellation of the hydropower project his land was expropriated for no less than three times. But each time the Turkish environment ministry, which originally rubber-stamped the project without an environmental impact assessment, overrides the court ruling – and work on the dam continues. In the meantime, large swaths of forest above the valley have been felled, triggering landslides and soil erosion. \"They've taken my land and they've offered me 15,000 lira [£5,800]. I didn't take it, and I won't take it,\" said Akçal, 54. \"They just want us to go to the cities and turn us into slaves. But what does 15,000 lira get you in a city? In a year the money will run out. \"Where I come from, people don't have a lot of arable land, but we grow corn, potatoes, tea and vegetables and we have everything we need. I don't need huge amounts more of electricity, it is not going to benefit us. My mother is 84, and she can't live anywhere else.\" He added: \"The talking is going nowhere. Again and again we went to court – again and again the courts sided with us. But they didn't stop, they just kept on working, cutting trees, dirtying the water. In total we have counted 25,000 dead fish in our stream.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theguardian/2012/jul/27/written-wind-starkey-greenwich-belgians","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2012-07-27T20:50:01Z","webTitle":"Letters: Written on the wind","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2012/jul/27/written-wind-starkey-greenwich-belgians","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/2012/jul/27/written-wind-starkey-greenwich-belgians","fields":{"headline":"Written on the wind","bodyText":"I take issue with Zoe Williams (Pro-wind.

The NRA was active on Twitter tonight. Some reaction from Las Vegas -- So that was fun to watch Hillary Clinton do debate prep at The Wynn on Tuesday evening with those four other people. But, seriously … I have watched a lot of debates, and rarely has one person stood out so dominantly as the former secretary of state did against Bernie Sanders (he won’t lose his base but did nothing to expand it), Martin O’Malley (solid close but did little else to break out of obscurity), Jim Webb (he complained about not speaking enough) and Lincoln Chafee (was he lost?). Read the full piece here. Clinton’s opening statement in the debates is already a Clinton campaign video: She convinced at least one voter And now a cool Twitter comparison of mentions of Clinton and Sanders: The Twitter team passes on the “Top debate moments on Twitter”: Sanders says “damn emails” are a distraction, and Clinton does not respond to Chafee on the subject. Chafee says he had “just arrived” in the Senate regarding Glass Steagall vote. Sanders says “Congress does not regulate Wall Street, Wall street regulates Congress” while Trump Tweets “Sorry, There is no STAR on the stage tonight.” A fascinating graphic by Google Trends on minute-by-minute search interest in the candidates. Sanders stays at Number One, Clinton hangs mostly in the Number Two slot. How many people have to Google Hillary Clinton, though... Here’s Google tracking the issues people were searching during the debate: The Democrats have finished their first debate of the 2016 election and here’s a summary of where things stand: The Democratic candidates – former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley, Virginia senator Jim Webb and former Rhode Island governor Lincoln Chafee – galloped across a field of solid policy questions, from gun control to climate change to wealth inequality to immigration to criminal justice reform to recreational marijuana – you name it, they likely touched on it. There were some policy clashes – Clinton was attacked over Syria and her vote in favor of Iraq, Sanders was attacked on guns – but moments of cooperation too, as when Sanders bailed out Clinton on her use of private email as secretary of state: “The American public is sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails,” Sanders said, to big applause in the room. Sanders scored by slamming “casino capitalism” and calling on “millions of Americans” to confront the “business classes” and fix an economy that awards most of the wealth to the 1% while failing on healthcare and education. In the face of Sanders’s populist gusto, Clinton asserted that she could get results, not just take stances: “I’m a progressive who likes to get things done.” Clinton also sold herself as the candidate best suited to take on the GOP. “I think I can take the fight to Republicans, because we cannot afford to have a Republican succeed Barack Obama as president,” she said. Sanders took it on the chin for past votes against gun control. But his attempts to defend himself by saying he was from a rural state and people had to understand the practicalities of actually legislating on the issue were overwhelmed by lines like this from Clinton: “It’s time our country stood up to the NRA.” Clinton pulled off carefully practiced answers to some difficult questions – on her changing positions, on her emails, on Libya and Benghazi, on her personal wealth and on being named Clinton. Did she slip? The former secretary of state wasn’t as exciting or convincing as Sanders on wealth inequality and the sins of Wall Street. Her claim to have marched down to Wall Street as a senator – “I basically said, cut it out” – fell flat. She declined to take a stand on recreational marijuana. Did the other candidates register? Webb and Chafee seemed to sideline themselves, Webb with repeated complaints about not getting enough speaking time and an allusion to killing a man in Vietnam, and Chafee by calling himself a block of granite with no scandals to his name. O’Malley managed to point to his record as a leader on gun control and climate change, but half-hearted attempts to hit Clinton on Syria didn’t really land. Clinton played the “first woman president” card a few times, including in response to a question about how her presidency would not constitute a third term for Obama. Clinton slammed Republicans on reproductive rights. “They [the GOP] don’t mind having big government to interfere with a woman’s right to choose and [attack] Planned Parenthood,” she said. She also mentioned single women and widows as groups in need of extra social security help. Read a full transcript here. That’s it for us tonight. Thank you for reading, watching and commenting, and for inviting us to your party. See you in Boulder, Colorado, on 28 October, for the return of the Republicans ... From National Journal reporter and Guardian US contributor Lucia Graves: Bernie Sanders spokesman Michael Briggs has been blasting out emails all night, fact-checking his opponents. Some subjects include: “Hillary Clinton on the Keystone Pipeline” and “Hillary Clinton Positions on Guns.” Another quotes Hillary Clinton calling the TPP, which she recently came out against, “the gold standard in trade agreements”. It’s a weird move for a guy who’s made positivity (read: not attacking Hillary Clinton for the supposed greater good of the party) central to his brand. But after running on a positive message all election long, Sanders found himself in a precarious position: Bernie had to be the face of positivity, even as defended himself against attacks from his opponents and went after Clinton. Sanders managed to balance staying true to his brand and attacking Clinton, at the same time. When Anderson Cooper raised questions about Clinton’s private email server, for instance, Sanders dismissed them energetically, saying: “Enough of the emails. Let’s talk about the real issues facing America!” But offstage, the emails from his spokesman sang a different note. Stay tuned for more offstage reaction from the spin room via Guardian US political reporter Sabrina Siddiqui live at the Wynn in Las Vegas: From Guardian US contributor Ali Gharib, on that long-ago – but policy-heavy – bit on Putin, Clinton and the incredible disappearing no-fly zone: Hillary Clinton stood by one of the more hawkish foreign policy proposals that sets her apart from many of her Democratic opponents: a no-fly zone in Syria. “I’m trying to figure out what leverage we have to get Russia to the table,” she said. But that stands in contrast to what she said just last week: that the Russians would need to be on board before a no-fly zone was established. Defending her proposal in Iowa, Clinton said, “I think it’s complicated and the Russians would have to be part of it, or it wouldn’t work.” Last week’s tack seems more reasonable than trying to block flights without Russian cooperation at a time when the Russians are flying frequent sorties in Syrian airspace. Jim Webb: killed a guy. From National Journal reporter and Guardian US opinion contributor Lucia Graves: Jim Webb just wouldn’t stop whining. ‘I’ve been standing over here for ten minutes trying,’ the former Virginia senator told Anderson Cooper when the host tried to cut him off earlier in the debate. It’s a strange gripe for a guy who, midway through the night, was the third most mentioned name on Twitter according to Twitter’s own data, and who had the third largest quality of airtime according to PBS NewsHour. It turns out whining may be a winning strategy, especially when you’ve got nothing left to lose. The five Democratic candidates said the words ‘climate change’ exactly 12 times in 2 hours. Here’s the Guardian’s US environment correspondent Suzanne Goldenberg on why CNN didn’t let them say it more: The climate change segment of the debate finally came – but the question didn’t come from CNN moderators but a member of the public: what would you do about climate change if you were president? Martin O’Malley hauled out his plan to move the country to 100% clean energy by the middle of the century – but did not say how he would force industry to shift, or what would fill the energy gap. He made no mention of carbon pollution from transport, or land use. Jim Webb revealed that when it comes to climate change, he is Republican-lite. He did not deny that climate change was occurring, but it is clearly not something he spends a lot of time worrying about – and unlike the other Democrats he will not spend a lot of time defending Barack Obama’s climate change regulations. “Really we are not going to solve climate change simply with the laws here,” he said. “It’s a global problem.” Bernie Sanders reiterated his view of climate change as a moral challenge – and that Republicans are blocking progress on solutions because of their ties to the fossil fuel industry: “Nothing is going to happen unless we are prepared to deal with campaign finance reform because the fossil fuel industry is funding the Republican party which is denying the reality of climate change.” Hillary Clinton used the climate question once again to show up her experience as Secretary of State harkening back to an episode, recounted in her memoir, when she and Barack Obama went looking for the Chinese delegation in the cavernous conference centre at the Copenhagen climate meeting in 2009. Campaigners had been looking to the debate to shed some light on what the Democratic presidential contenders would actually do to fight climate change. But CNN moderators abdicated their responsibility on the climate question, and left it up to a member of the public. The sole climate question – when it came – was too open-ended for that. From a reader on Guardian Witness: Was the below question answered to your satisfaction? In case you weren’t among those channel surfing, the Dodgers have tied their NL playoffs series 2-2 with a 3-1 win over the Mets. Further video highlights! Hillary Clinton: ‘It’s time the entire country stood up to the NRA’ – video Paraphrasing a bit: Chafee: I have had no scandals– look it up. I voted against Iraq. Please go to chafee2016 to learn more about me. Webb: You’ve heard a lot of promises tonight. But I can promise you if you look at my record, I can fix anything. Vietnam. O’Malley: Our debate was better than the Republican debates. We didn’t denigrate women or make racist comments about immigrants or trash another religion. Clean electric grid by 2050. Sanders: We have the highest rate of childhood poverty and more income and wealth inequality than any developed nation. Here’s the truth. Nobody up here can address the problem unless millions of American people stand up to fight the business class. 30 bucks apiece at BernieSanders dot com! Clinton: Who amongst us has the vision for actually making the changes to improve Americans’ lives? Mom always said, it’s not if you get knocked down, it’s whether you get back up. Raise middle class incomes. It’s morning in America. From Guardian US columnist Jessica Valenti, as Martin O’Malley mentions that you didn’t hear any sexists on stage tonight: I’m glad paid family leave finally came up – but very curious why the question was framed as an issue between Clinton and Carly Fiorina (another woman!). This is an issue that all the candidates should care about. I like Bernie, but the line that countries around the world ‘say that when a mother has a baby, she should stay home with that baby’ made me cringe a bit. I understand what Sanders is getting at, but he needs to be a bit more careful on language here. Not all women want to stay at home, but certainly if they want to right after having children, they should be able to. That said, HELL YES on Hillary going all in on the GOP’s war on Planned Parenthood. From radio host Nicole Sandler: Wall Street and the pharmaceutical industry are the enemies Bernie Sanders is most proud of making! I thank him for challenging those two monoliths of evil! I’m Feeling the Bern right now a lot more than I did two hours ago. They’re back. Cooper says something about “final question.” Which enemy are you most proud of? Chafee: “I guess the coal lobby.” O’Malley: “The National Rifle Association. Clinton: Apart from the NRA, “the health insurance companies, the drug companies, the Iranians, probably the Republicans.” It’s as if she sees enemies everywhere? Sanders: Of all my enemies, “at the top of the list, I would love Wall Street and the pharmaceutical industry.” Webb: “The enemy soldier that threw the grenade that wounded me, but he’s not around right now to talk to.” About that ‘yes’ from Sanders on pot and that ‘no’ from Clinton – a quick take first from radio host Nicole Sandler: Bernie would vote to legalize marijuana because too many lives are destroyed by non-violent offenses – and Wall Street CEOs walk away from their crimes, but we send kids smoking pot to jail. Yes! Another reason I love Bernie: weed. Hillary Clinton is not ready to take a position on recreational marijuana legalization … again. Does she take a stance on anything controversial? At least she’s also talking about our prison problem, but it’s not enough. From writer and RaceBaitR editor-in-chief Hari Ziyad: Senator Sanders and Clinton are right to note that the criminal justice system is sending too many nonviolent drug offenders to prison, but what about the disproportionate effects for black communities? We cannot discuss drug reform without an understanding of the racist history of drug laws. One of the boldest statements of the night so far has been Hillary Clinton’s contention that Edward Snowden, the former NSA contractor who leaked details of mass surveillance by the US government to the Guardian and other news organisations, had “stolen a lot of important information that has unfortunately fallen into the wrong hands”, writes Guardian US chief reporter Ed Pilkington. Here’s a Snowden fact-check: The claim that the Snowden documents have been obtained by the ‘wrong hands’ – a euphemism it must be assumed for China and Russia – is not a new one. Clinton was slipping into old conspiracy theories that claim Snowden allowed the Chinese or Russian governments to hack into his NSA data files or even worse that he was acting as a spy on their behalf. But as Ewen MacAskill, the Guardian’s Pulitzer prize-winning journalist, has pointed out, no evidence has ever been put forward suggesting that the Snowden documents were hacked or that Snowden himself handed the material to any person or agency other than reputable news outlets. To suggest otherwise, as Clinton did, was perilously close to teasing the American public with unsubstantiated rumour mongering. Another commercial break. Who’s winning? Let’s hear it! Below the line please. We’ll feature the strongest and finest opinions in our reactions section after the debate has wrapped. More video highlights! Bernie Sanders on why US needs a democratic socialist as president – video At the Culinary Union debate party in Las Vegas, Bethany Khan, a spokesperson for the Culinary Union 226, said the candidates did not go far enough on immigration reform, writes Daniel Hernandez. “As a child of immigrants and someone who has family of mixed immigrant status, I was paying very close attention to what the candidates said about comprehensive immigration reform,” Khan said. “It was very vague. They’re not providing a plan. They talk about bringing people out of the shadows, but how? What’s going to happen to DAPA and DACA? We need action.” More than 60% of Nevada’s Latinos have family, friends or co-workers who are undocumented immigrants. Pot question. Sanders, you said you smoked pot twice. Would you vote for legalization on the state level? “I suspect I would vote yes,” he says. Because “we have a criminal justice system that lets CEOs walk away and yet we are giving prison sentences to young people who smoke marijuana.” Clinton: You didn’t smoke pot when young, and you’ve said you won’t start now. Are you ready to take a position on full recreational legalization tonight? “No.” Well that was blunt. She goes on to say she supports medicinal marijuana and that drug sentences are too heavy. Clinton is asked about GOP presidential candidate Carly Fiorina saying that paid family leave would hurt small business. “I’m surprised she says that because California’s had a paid leave program for a number of years ...” and it hasn’t hurt business, Clinton says. “This is typical Republican scare tactics. We can design a system and pay for it in a way that does not put the burden on small business.” Clinton is the only one talking about the Republicans this way, attacking them, perhaps to show what she would do as a general election candidate. Then she really digs in on the GOP: “They don’t mind having big government to interfere with a woman’s right to choose and [attacking] Planned Parenthood.” Big applause line in the room. “We should not be paralyzed by Republicans and their constant refrain, big government this, big government that.” Climate change question. What would you do to combat the problem? O’Malley says he would expand tax credits for solar and wind power. “We can get there as a nation but it’s going to require presidential leadership,” he says. Webb says he’s a strong proponent of nuclear power and “we are not going to solve climate change simply with the laws here [in the United States]. It’s a global problem.” Sanders: I believe and Pope Francis made this point. This is a moral issue. The scientists are telling us that we need to move extremely boldly... nothing is going to happen unless we are prepared to deal with campaign finance reform because the fossil fuel industry is funding the Republican party. Clinton: When we met in Copenhagen in 2009, President Obama and I were literally hunting for the Chinese, because we knew we had to get them to agree to something ... They supposedly had left for the airport. We found out they were having a secret meeting. We marched up, we broke in, we said we’ve been looking all over for you ... and we did get an agreement. The candidates are talking about climate change, but here’s Guardian US columnist Jessica Valenti on what the four men and Hillary Clinton are not talking about yet: women. The night isn’t over, but it seems a major misstep that more airtime hasn’t been devoted to women’s issues – reproductive rights, in particular. The Republican debates focused so much on Planned Parenthood – lying about the group, even making up videos that don’t exist – that to not address it would be incredibly disappointing. Reproductive rights are part of pay equity, immigration and women’s ability to participate in the public sphere. I also wish we were hearing some questions about the sexual assault epidemic and what the candidates would do about it. O’Malley accuses Clinton of being a dynasty candidate. “I would not ask anyone to vote for me based on my last name,” Clinton replies. “I certainly am not campaigning to be president because my last name is Clinton.” She says she’s running because she’s right for the moment and the country. Plus: I think I can take the fight to Republicans, because we cannot afford to have a Republican succeed Barack Obama as president. Ok peel your eyes off that beefcake O’Malley because they’re back! Cooper asks Clinton about “the year of the outsider in politics.” Why should Democrats embrace an insider like yourself? Clinton says she would be the first woman president which is a break from the usual, innit. But she says she would back it up with policy chops too. “I’m very happy that I have both the commitment of a lifetime and the experience of a lifetime to offer the American people,” she says. From Guardian US staff writer Jessica Valenti: Twice tonight, Lincoln Chafee has defended votes he cast in the senate by citing overwhelmingly lopsided final tallies of 90-some to 5, etc. The “Everybody’s doing it” defense, basically. Anderson Cooper appears just to have accused “everybody in this room” of having tried marijuana. What room? Anyway, commercial break, again. SO tell us who you think is winning the debate so far? (h/t @megancarpentier) From radio host Nicole Sandler: Bernie Sanders keeps showing the courage of his convictions. From voting against the Patriot Act to dismantling the NSA surveillance program to praising Edward Snowden – who ‘played an important role’ in exposing what the intelligence agencies were doing, even while acknowledging that Snowden broke the law. No one else on stage even bothered. With all the talk of Hillary moving to the left, Bernie keeps showing how wide the gulf is between the two of them. NSA, Snowden. And he’s actually answering questions, with honesty and courage. What a concept! Clinton is asked how she would be different from Barack Obama. I think that’s pretty obvious. I think being the first woman president would be quite a change from the presidents we’ve had up to this point, including President Obama. Asked to name policies, she says economic policies, taking on prescription drug companies, and offering free college tuition. Round of questions on Edward Snowden now. Hero, or traitor? Chafee: Bring him home. He did a service. Clinton: “He broke the laws of the United States. He could’ve been a whistleblower ... He could’ve raised all the issues that have been raised ... He stole very important information that has fallen into the wrong hands. I think he should not come up without being made to face the music.” Sanders: “He did break the law, and I think there should be a penalty to that. But I think what he did in educating us should be taken into account. Webb: “I would leave it to the legal system.” O’Malley would imprison Snowden. Clinton is asked whether she regrets her vote in favor of the USA Patriot act. “No, I don’t.” She says it was necessary after 9/11 to put in place security and a “process”, but “the Bush administration began to chip away at that process, and I began to speak out.” Question for Sanders: Would you shut down the NSA surveillance programs? “Absolutely, of course. I would shut down what exists right now.” O’Malley refers to “Donald Trump, that carnival barker in the Republican party.” Burrn ... Sanders takes a question about his 2007 vote against immigration reform. “I voted against that piece of legislation because it had guest worker provisions in it which the SPLC talked about being semi-slavery,” he says. “I was not the only progressive to vote against that legislation for that reason. We need comprehensive immigration reform. We need a path to citizenship. We need to take people out of the shadows. Over to Clinton: She says every child should get health care, including undocumented children, but that a broader framework of comprehensive immigration reform is needed. O’Malley: We need to understand that our country has been made stronger in every generation by new arrivals. Webb: My wife is an immigrant. ... No country is a country without defining its borders. We need to resolve this issues. Back to Clinton: There is such a difference between what you’re hearing on this stage, and what you’re hearing from Republicans, who have demonized hard-working immigrants, who have insulted them. Clinton says she would “go even further” than Obama’s executive orders. From radio host Nicole Sandler, as Bernie gets his bern back: Bernie said that every high school graduate should be able to go to college, tuition-free, through a tax on Wall Street speculation. As the mother of an 11th grader, I don’t know if I’ll be able to send my kid to college, and don’t want her to take on the kind of debt it might require for her to finance it herself. Sanders has led on this issue. Others are following him. Clinton’s proposal won’t provide free college, because middle-class families will still have to pay tuition on a sliding scale. Her plan won’t eliminate ‘student debt’, because families will have to go deeper into debt to pay that tuition. It’s not enough. The Democratic presidential contenders paid more attention to climate change in their opening statements then Republicans did in five hours of debates, writes US environment correspondent Suzanne Goldenberg. But the biggest contrast came when contenders were asked about the gravest national security threat to the US: O’Malley made glancing reference to climate change “making cascading threats even worse” - what the military calls a threat multiplier. But Sanders drove it out of the park, provoking a roar of approval from the crowd by repeating his declaration from the opening moments of the debate that if the international community fails to address climate change, and transform the energy system, the entire planet would be in peril. “That is a major crisis,” Sanders concluded. The strong climate statements are almost word-perfect reiterations of Sanders pronouncements during the debate on the Keystone XL pipeline at the start of the year. On the campaign trail, Sanders has regularly cited climate change as the single greatest national security threat. In the Republican camp, meanwhile, it was business as usual with Mike Huckabee tweeting derisively about Democrats fretting about the threat of “sunburn”. Clinton is talking about her plan to allow anyone to go to public colleges tuition-free. Students would work 10 hours a week and colleges would get their costs down. Update: tuition and college debt is a top concern among readers: Clinton takes a follow-up about social security. Would she expand it? I want to enhance the benefits for the poorest beneficiaries of social security. She says single and widowed women in particular need extra help because they did not make much during their careers and “they are impoverished”. From Guardian US columnist Jeb Lund: Interesting point: Hillary Clinton tried to tell Anderson Cooper and the crowd that she, Martin O’Malley and Bernie Sanders share attitudes on banking regulation, and it was a poor feint. There’s not a lot Clinton can do to paper over the fact that she has more big checks from Wall Street donors than the others – Sanders because he refuses them, O’Malley because he has none, since Clinton’s hoovering up all that money. Potentially troublesome going forward: Clinton promised to intervene in big banks before they go toxic on the basis of what her experts tell her. But given who her experts are, this potentially validates Sanders’ attack that she’s asking banks to self-regulate. You’ve made it half way through the debate, writes Jessica Lee. Congratulations! If you feel like you need a drink, join the crowd ... Talking past each other. Sanders: “Donald Trump and his billionaire friends, under my policies, are going to pay a hell of a lot more in taxes than they’re paying today.” The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) remains a vital point of contention between Sanders and Clinton, although now it’s more a matter of Sanders having been against it before it was cool, writes Sam Thielman. Cooper asked Clinton about the trade deal right off the bat, notably her earlier designation of it as “the gold standard”; she said that she had been “very consistent over the course of my entire life” and that she hadn’t seen the entire deal until it had been negotiated. She told Cooper she’d said in 2012 she “hoped it would be the gold standard” and that “in looking at it, it didn’t meet my standards”. That first part isn’t accurate; here’s the full quote in context from a speech at Techport in Adelaide, Australia – a potential member nation of the treaty: “This TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free, transparent, fair trade, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field. And when negotiated, this agreement will cover 40 percent of the world’s total trade and build in strong protections for workers and the environment.” You can read the full text of that speech here. In fairness, she has become less enthusiastic over the years, sounding a note of caution in her memoir last year and at other times. Unfortunately she’s late to the game – plenty of other organizations, notably the Vatican, aren’t wild about it, either. Sanders has opposed the TPP consistently while Clinton has wavered back and forth over her various tenures as senator and of course secretary of state under Obama (where she would have helped to negotiate the deal), who would mark the TPP as a major legislative accomplishment were it actually to clear Congress, where no one has yet read it and there is opposition and support on both sides of the aisle. Though the treaty is championed by the Democratic president, it does not have unilateral support on the left by any means. Complicating it for liberals are a number of provisions seen as giveaways to private industry (especially to pharmaceutical companies) and the creation of an international tribunal in which corporations could sue member governments. Conservatives, meanwhile, see the treaty either as a way of allowing American businesses to give jobs away to foreigners. Sanders, by contrast, unequivocally hates the deal and is happy to say so, calling it “a disastrous trade agreement designed to protect the interests of the largest multi-national corporations at the expense of workers, consumers, the environment and the foundations of American democracy.” A Wikileaks drop of what appears to be a recent draft of the intellectual property chapter of the deal has raised hackles throughout the activist community, among them those of futurist, novelist and sometime Guardian columnist Cory Doctorow, who wonks out entertainingly about the chapter’s various potential difficulties here. Here is video of a couple lively moments from the debate so far: Democratic Debate: Bernie Sanders clarifies his stance on guns Bernie Sanders explains Democratic Socialism Clinton warns that the risk of a new financial crisis is real: We still have to deal with the problem that banks are too big to fail. AIG an insurance company. Lehman Brothers, an investment bank. There’s this whole area called shadow banking, and that’s where experts tell me the next crisis could come from. Sanders delivers a somewhat more bracing summary of the situation: Let us be clear that the greed and recklessness of Wall sStreet... where fraud is a business model, helped to destroy the economy of this country and the lives of Americans.” Clinton says “I respect the passion and intensity” of Sanders. Then Clinton claims that she tried to confront Wall Street and the Bush administration before the 2008 economic crash. She says as a senator from New York in 2007, she “went down” to Wall Street. “I basically said, cut it out, quick foreclosing on homes, quit engaging in speculative behavior,” she says. Sanders makes fun of the reply, saying that no politician tells Wall Street what to do. In my view, secretary Clinton, Congress does not regulate Wall Street, Wall street regulates the banks. From writer and RaceBaitR editor-in-chief Hari Ziyad: Martin O’Malley and Bernie Sanders seem to have learned from the disruptions to which they fell victim earlier this year. On race, they are saying all the right words now. But Hillary Clinton moved past words and into specifics. And then, activists have been saying over and over again that we cannot continue to talk about income inequality without a racial lens. Sanders had the perfect set-up to address their concerns on race, but he faltered. Jim Webb still doesn’t understand that “black lives matter” needs to be reinforced to point out that, historically, black lives haven’t. A candidate who does not understand the history can not change it. And then there’s this troll, from the other side of the aisle: Washington bureau chief Dan Roberts checks in from a bar in Washington: Unsurprisingly, Bernie Sanders is going down well with his supporters at one of the 4,000 debate parties his campaign has set up around the country. The biggest round of applause so far came when Sanders defended Clinton over the email scandal. Of all the things that are bothering these young voters about America, this is not one. But his grilling on guns has elicited an interesting reaction from some of the young students who form the backbone of his support and seem to value his authenticity most of all. “I am probably a little more liberal on guns than he is,” says Victoria Latus, a law student at American University. “But I like the fact the he is not changing his views on this like Hillary Clinton does on things like trade. ... It’s not as if he doesn’t want any gun reform either.” This sense that Sanders is the ‘real deal’ brings whoops and cheers whenever he speaks, but some debate-watchers here are worried that he is coming across too well. “I like Sanders, but I don’t think he should or can be president,” says student Giles Hinders. “He is coming across well tonight but it could mean he wins the nomination and loses to one of the Republicans.” Cooper asks Clinton how she can work on behalf of the middle class when she is a member of the 1%. “Both Bill and I have been very blessed,” she says. Groan. Neither of us came from wealthy families and we have been working hard our entire lives. Then she talks about opportunity for every child. Sanders gets a question about wage inequality. He tees up. First of all, let’s remember where we were when Bush left office... I know my Republican friends seem to have some amnesia on this issue.” He goes on to call for a minimum wage of $15, pay equity for women, new trade policies, free tuition for public colleges and universities. Webb gets his turn. “I hope I get that kind of time,” he says. Question for the candidates: Do black lives matter, or do all lives matter? Sanders: Black lives matter ... We need to combat institutional racism from top to bottom. And we need major major repairs to a broken criminal justice system. O’Malley: Anderson, the point that the BLM movement is making is a very very legitimate point... He kind of dodges the question. In any case he doesn’t nail it. Clinton gets a slightly different question. What could you do that Obama can’t? Clinton says that Obama has been a great moral leader on the issues despite being blocked “at every turn” by Republicans. “This may be the only bipartisan issue in the Congress this year,” she says, about criminal justice reform. From radio host Nicole Sandler: Bernie, on Hillary’s email, says this may not be great politics but: ‘enough of the emails – let’s talk about the real issues facing America’. And that why we Feel the Bern! Chafee says the emails are fair game, because “there’s an issue of American credibility there” and “I think we need somebody who has the best ethical standards to be our next president”. Cooper: “Secretary Clinton, do you want to respond? Clinton: “No” – with a big smile. More big applause. And that appears to be it about the email? Let me say something that may not be great politics. But I think that the secretary is right. And that is that the American public is sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails. Wild applause. Standing ovation. Clinton takes a question about her email. She says it was a mistake. But she says she has turned over tens of thousands of pages of her emails and agreed to testify before Congress in a public hearing. Then she turns on the committee: “Let’s just take a moment to point out that this committee is basically an arm of the Republican national committee.” She’s applauded. “I’m still standing,” she says. More applause. Lincoln Chafee: “You’re looking at a block of granite” Radio host Nicole Sandler is (still) fired up about Cooper’s moderation: Now Anderson Cooper encouraging attacks on Senator Sanders because he applied for conscientious objector status during the Vietnam War. Kudos to Jim Webb for answering in a classy, non-judgmental way. Shame on Cooper for his bias, again. Heh pretty good. COMMERCIAL BREAK Question for all the candidates: What’s the biggest national security threat? Chafee: missed it (us, not him) O’Malley: nuclear Iran, climate change Clinton: continued threat from spread of nuclear weapons, nuclear material Sanders: the global crisis of climate change Webb: relations with China, cyber warfare and the situation in the Middle East. A lot of people, if Donald Trump’s tweets are to be believed, are only following the debate so they can enjoy Donald Trump’s tweets, Adam Gabbatt writes. Quite what they’re getting out of his Twitter feed is unclear. He’s mostly just retweeting people who say they’re enjoying his tweets. Apart from that Trump’s insights have included: And: It is not clear why Trump would want Putin to feel nervous or scared, given that he seems to be courting his friendship: he told CBS on Sunday that he’d “get along very well” with the president of Russia. The Democrats have revisited Iraq. Now Sanders is talking about why he did not support the war in Vietnam. If they get back to 1812, look out. On to Benghazi. O’Malley offers another gentle critique. Then Webb adds some mucle: It was not a wise thing to do, and if people think it was a wise thing to do, try to get to the Tripoli airport today. You can’t do it,” Webb says. Cooper asks Webb whether Sanders, a conscientious objector standing next to him, could be a commander in chief. Webb replies: Everybody makes their decisions... and long as they go through the legal process that our country requires, I respect that. Clinton is now defending the air war in Libya that preceded the country’s crumbling. She said that Americans must remember that “our closest allies in Europe were burning up the phone lines begging us to stop what” they thought would be a genocide. She said the US air war was “smart power at its best,” adding that the idea was that “the United States will not lead this.” Clinton: We did not put one single American soldier on the ground in Libya. Cooper: American citizens did lose their lives in Benghazi. Clinton: I’ll get to that. Webb is now saying his piece. Cooper says he’s gone over his time. Webb says that Cooper has let a lot of people gone over their time. They waste time arguing about it. Sanders is up. “I think that Mr Putin is going to regret what he is doing,” he says. I think he is already regretting what he did in Crimea and what he’s doing in Ukraine... I think that when Russian people get killed in Syria, I think the Russian people are going to send him a message. From radio host Nicole Sandler: Am I the only one who sees Anderson Cooper going after Bernie Sanders with guns blazing (no pun intended)? From the first question about Sanders being a socialist, to the accusatory tone of the questions about guns, Cooper has also encouraged the other candidates to go on the offense. Bias noted. Webb tries to get in the debate. “I’ve been trying to get in this conversation for about 10 minutes,” he says. Nope. Cooper goes to Clinton. “I have to say I was very pleased when Governor O’Malley endorsed me for president in 2008,” she smiles, turning his gentle criticism. Then she makes some basic distinctions about what’s happening in the Middle East: Let me say, we are already flying in Syria just as we are in Iraq. The president has made a very tough decision. I’m trying to figure out what leverage we have to get Russia to the table. Diplomacy is not about a perfect solution, it’s about balancing risk. She’s bulldozing them on foreign policy, in the eyes of some bloggers. The Democrats are revisiting the Iraq war decision. Clinton is the only one onstage who supported the war. “Leading us into Iraq under false pretenses and telling us as a people that there were WMDs there is one of the worst blunders in modern American history,” O’Malley says. He says he opposes a no-fly zone for Syria. Then he says “Assad’s invasion of Syria will be seen as a blunder,” meaning Putin. Clinton is showing some muscle on foreign policy. Sanders and Chafee sound mealy-mouthed next to her. Bash asks Sanders under what circumstances he would use force. He ignores the question and says Clinton is talking about a no-fly zone in Syria, “which I think is very dangerous, could lead to real problems.” He says when he voted against the Iraq invasion, “I say without any joy in my heart, that much of what I thought would happen about the destabilization in fact did happen.” Sanders is getting bad reviews for that gun control moment across the Twitter machine, which saw an easy leftie win for Clinton: That from a former Scott Walker advisor. Why the, uh, assault? Here’s why Sanders’ defense may not have worked: O’Malley piled in, too. Here’s a quick take from Guardian US columnist Jeb Lund, live in Tampa, Florida: Aside from certain identity politics points, the gun control issue is the one on which Hillary Clinton can really score off Bernie Sanders, and she just pulled into that policy gap with the engine roaring. If she’s going to be boxed out of the left position on every other issue, hammering Sanders for seeming politically opportunistic on guns to pander to rural voters is her best chance to puncture the ‘Bernie the Principled’ image. I don’t know whether she looked amped up, per se, but there was definitely a different gear there for her. You can tell, too, that O’Malley had scoped out this opportunity to, because he immediately leapt into the fray on this point, too, and it was the first time tonight that he actually displayed any energy (putting out a finger, then pulling back, squaring his shoulders). Hillary Clinton took a shot at Bernie Sanders’s self-proclaimed democratic socialism early in the debate Tuesday night, Ben Jacobs writes: After Sanders was asked about whether a socialist could be elected president, Clinton jumped in to go after Sanders. She said: “We are not Denmark” and said that the United States would make a grave mistake if it abandoned capitalism. Sanders then pushed back, noting his support for small and medium sized businesses. Clinton was the second frontrunner to attack Sanders’s ideology in the past days. In an interview with the Guardian on Monday, Donald Trump said the Vermont senator is an “admitted socialist. Some people think he’s even worse than that. He’s the next step.” Sanders calls Syria a quagmire and says he would not support boots on the ground. “Nobody does,” Clinton says. “Nobody does.” On to foreign policy, and a question for Clinton about her “reset with Russia”. Clinton said the reset was appropriate before Putin returned to the presidency, but that the situation had changed with his return. “We got the nuclear arms deal, we got the ability to bring arms to our soldiers in Afghanistan,” she says, on the brief interim period when Dmitry Medvedev was president. Clinton says: “We have to stand up to his bullying ... in Syria, to make it clear that they have to be part of the solution to end that conflict.” Hillary Clinton unveils gun control plan: ‘How many have to die?’ – video O’Malley talks about passing comprehensive guns legislation as governor of Maryland, where he signed some of the country’s most restrictive gun laws. He says that its being hard is no excuse not to do it. Then he too attacks Sanders. O’Malley said the senator’s being from a rural state did not clear him for not supporting tougher gun laws. “We did it by leading with principles, not by pandering to the NRA,” he says of gun control. “You have not been in the US Congress, you ought to check it out,” Sanders replies, of the difficulty of passing gun legislation. Then Webb chimes in. Cooper hits Sanders with a guns question. Sanders did not support the Brady handguns bill and has supported legislation allowing people to carry guns on Amtrak trains. Do you want to shield gun companies from lawsuits, Cooper asks, referring to repeated Sanders votes against the Brady bill. Sanders defends his record. “I told the gun owners of the state of Vermont ... that I supported a ban on assault weapons.” Q for Clinton: Is Bernie Sanders tough enough on guns? Her answer is powerful. She hits him hard. “No, not at all,” she says. “It’s time our country stood up to the NRA.” Sanders’s riposte: As a senator from a rural state, I can tell secretary Clinton that all the shouting in the world ... is not going to keep guns out of the hands of people who should not have guns. Cooper asks Webb about having criticized affirmative action. Webb says he was a defender of African-American communities in his time in the Senate in Virginia and that he had worked on behalf of equality not exclusion. Looks like someone didn’t get in the hall ... Cooper turns to O’Malley. He pushes him on the unrest in Baltimore, where O’Malley was mayor, asserting that the candidate had failed to secure prosperity for the city. O’Malley gives a steady answer about the difficulties the city faced as he came to office. Cooper presses him on his record of tens of thousands arrests in the city, a record rate nationally, during O’Malley’s tenure. O’Malley says Cooper is distorting the facts. Arrests peaked in 2003 Anderson, but they declined every year after that, as we restored peace in our poorer neighborhoods. Cooper challenges Chafee for his protean party identity. “Anderson, you’re looking at a block of granite when it comes to the issues...” he says. “I was a liberal Republican, then I was an independent, and now I’m a Democrat.” A block of granite. Clinton jumps in. “It’s our job to rein in the excesses of capitalism,” she says, “...but we would be making a grave mistake to turn our backs about what built the greatest middle class in the world.” Applause for that line, but even more applause when Sanders replies that capitalism is broken when the vast share of wealth goes to the top 1%. That’s just what he was supposed to say. Question for Sanders: You say you’re a socialist. Can you be elected? Sanders says “we can win” and winds into an answer that ends in Denmark and Sweden. Cooper presses Sanders, saying the attack ads against him write themselves: “You supported the Sandinistas, you honeymooned in the Soviet Union.” “Do I consider myself part of the casino capitalist process? Sanders replies. “No, I don’t.” First question is for Clinton. Will you say anything to get elected? That’s literally the question. She delivers an extremely prepared answer as to how, upon reviewing the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the deal had flaws that meant she could no longer support it despite the dozens of times she had spoken out in its favor. Follow-up question: Just for the record, are you a progressive, or a moderate? Clinton’s answer is self-assured and rhetorically strong, and draws applause: I’m a progressive, but I’m a progressive who likes to get things done. And I’ve stood my ground, and I’ve found common ground. Republican frontrunner Donald Trump has promised to live-tweet the Democratic debate – what fun! – and Adam Gabbatt will be following his commentary. So far he has been unhappy with the commercials, and has promised to “shoot straight”. He’ll also be calling it as he sees it, pulling no punches, shooting from the hip, telling it as it is, etc. Hillary Clinton is up. Also in blue, over white, a filmic negative of O’Malley. She starts out rather generically, talking about how she wants “to find the ways for each child to live up to his or her god-Given potential.” Then she catches some speed: At the center of my campaign is how we’re going to raise wages. Yes raise the minimum wage, but we’re going to have to do so much more, including finding ways for how to help companies share profits. She calls for the “wealthy paying their fair share” of taxes, and hits this first applause line: “I believe in equal pay for equal work for women, but I also think it’s about time we had paid family leave” and caught up with the rest of the world. Also: “climate change”. (That’s three.) Bernie Sanders is up. I think most Americans understand that our country today faces a series of unprecedented crises. He lists the flight of wealth to the 1%, the “unbelievable sums of money” that followed Citizens United, the reality of climate change (that’s two of those tonight) caused by human activity, the number of people in jail, the disproportionate youth unemployment among minorities. Sanders wins applause with this line: Maybe, just maybe, we should be putting more money into education and jobs for our kids. They like him! Martin O’Malley up now. Wins most photogenic hands-down. Blue tie matches set nicely. “After 15 years of executive experience, I have learned how to be a better leader,” he says. “I have learned how to get things done because I am very clear about my principles.” We elected a president, not a magician, and there is urgent work that needs to be done right now... For there is a deep injustice, an economic injustice that threatens to tear our country apart. Also: we’ll be keeping track of how many times we hear the words “climate change” tonight. We’re at one and counting. Jim Webb is next. He sounds like a bad lip reading of himself. But what he’s talking about is no joke. “In government service, I fought and bled for the country, in Vietnam, as a marine,” he says. In the Senate, I spoke about economic fairness and social justice from day one... I brought criminal justice reform out of the shadows and into the discussion. Then Webb goes to introduce his five children and seems almost to forget the name of his second daughter. Oops. The format tonight is one minute to answer questions per candidate and 30 seconds for follow-ups plus a chance at rebuttal if they’re mentioned by name by somebody else. Chafee begins his opening statement. For some reason we typed “opining”. He’s smiling and talking about his record as a Rhode Island mayor, senator and governor. “As governor, I came in in the depths of the recession, and we turned my state around,” he says. Then: I’m very proud that in my almost thirty years of public service, I’ve had no scandals. To which my colleague Ben Jacobs spots this! Last chance to mess around before the extremely serious business of the debate starts. May we suggest this extremely diverting Super Mario Bros.-style video game produced by IJ? The action figure is Clinton and she has to wipe out the other candidates and collect coins. Wait--they’re back! Didn’t sound like she hit every note to us but how many Grammys have you won? And the first question is for -- oh wait. Commercial break. And here they are... Quite the contrast to 2008 ... ... and just the other day: Still blue, though. Up to sing the national anthem: nine-time Grammy award winning singer-songwriter Sheryl Crow! It’s starting now. Tonight’s moderators are Anderson Cooper, Don Lemon, Dana Bash and Juan Carlos Lopez. Cooper is introducing the candidates, who are taking the stage to applause. Put that thing down, Martin, it’s time to do this. Trump’s in place and his promised debate-long Twitter storm has begun. He sounds upbeat: Former Arkansas governor and current Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee, meanwhile, is getting his troll on: Speaking of trolling, here’s a video of Hillary Clinton campaigning earlier today outside one of Trump’s Las Vegas hotels. A potentially significant note for some of our readers who do not live in the USA: That CNN live stream won’t work for you, apparently. Just flip on CNNI, he says. We’re moments away now from the start of the first Democratic presidential debate. We thank you for joining us – there will be jokes – and we encourage you to pitch in please below the line. To review, the Guardian’s Sabrina Siddiqui (@sabrinasiddiqui) and Paul Lewis (@PaulLewis) are in Las Vegas and a whole beautiful archipelago of journalistic talent is spread east from there. The question of the night has to be: Can Bernie Sanders knock Clinton off her perch as the front-runner and still-perceived shoe-in for the Democratic nomination? Her favorables among Democrats are through the roof and, apart from in a few (inconveniently timed) states, her lead in the polls is daunting ... bordering on frightful. Sanders could confront Clinton on the continuity of her commitment to the working class, on her record as a New York senator during the Wall Street bailout or on a different angle of the basic case he has been tirelessly making for 40 years on behalf of lower-income Americans. There could also be a showdown on the Keystone XL pipeline, or the TPP trade deal, or gun control – and certainly that email scandal. Martin O’Malley, Jim Webb or Lincoln Chafee may score an unexpected point or turn in a performance with the kind of surprising charisma that changes enough voters’ minds to change the face of the race. Or Clinton may remind voters and viewers why she is the frontrunner, why she still thrives after three decades of intense scrutiny in the public eye, why the party and big donors are behind her and why she still has the faith of a huge number of average Americans. Hillary Clinton could win this, too, you know. How will it turn out? Watch with us! The gang’s all here. The excitement is mounting, but somehow Adam Gabbatt has still found time to come up with a number of puns about the Democratic candidates, along with situations in which they might come in handy. To use following foreign policy discussion: World wide Webb On the vice-president’s no-show: Biden his time If the former Republican polls higher than 1%: If you’re Chafee and you know it clap your hands If things go poorly for the former Maryland governor: O’Malady Upon the party rallying (more) round Hillary: Clinton of support (Clin-ton - like a ton, get it?) If an arachnid appears: Spider’s Webb Upon discovery that the presidential hopeful is afflicted by syndactyly: Webbed foot Something to do with diagnosing America’s problems: Webb MD Should dishonesty be discovered: Webb of lies If the frontrunner is as still as a sculpture, or something: Hillary Rodin Clinton (Adam is from Britain, where Chafee – a common first name for girls – is pronounced to rhyme with daffy.) Democratic voters think climate change is a bigger threat than Isis – so there is virtually no way candidates will leave the stage in Las Vegas tonight without talking about the global challenge, writes Guardian US environment correspondent Suzanne Goldenberg (@suzyji): Hillary Clinton in particular can expect a question about the Keystone XL pipeline. Unlike the Republican debates which gave very short shrift to climate change – with one token question in the third hour of the CNN debate – the Democratic candidates have been vying with one another to show how far they would go to fight global warming. Campaigners therefore are hoping to use the Democratic debates to push the candidates to do more. On a conference call on Tuesday morning, Tom Steyer, the billionaire climate activist, and Jay Inslee and Jack Markell, respectively the Democratic governors of Washington and Delaware, teamed up to press the candidates to move beyond the usual slogans, and embed climate solutions in their economic policy. “We don’t just want to hear about the threat of climate change but to learn about how candidates plan to solve it ... what those solutions will mean for them,” Inslee said. “Is it part of a compelling long-term vision for our country or is it just a footnote to the rest of the programme?” Steyer had an even sharper message. “It really is a question of being on the front foot, not just avoiding a mistake,” he said. “It’s not just not building the Keystone pipeline.” The other key point for Inslee was the ability of candidates to craft a winning message around climate change for the 2016 elections. Party operatives and campaign groups think climate change could be a winning issue for Democrats in 2016. Climate denial – the default position of the Republican field barring Lindsey Graham – can easily be cast as extreme and anti-science. The governor and others will be looking for conviction on climate change. Clinton in this regard has been playing catch up. She was slow to take a position on the Keystone XL, declaring only last month that she was against the project. Bernie Sanders and Martin O’Malley are longtime opponents. Clinton also moved to catch up on Arctic drilling, coming out against Obama’s decision to allow Shell to hunt for oil in Arctic waters. But Clinton also has John Podesta on her side – the man who helped push Obama’s climate action in the White House, and is widely seen as the guiding hand behind Clinton’s ambitious targets on solar power. OK we’re taking a short break for pizza and we encourage you to do the same. In case you haven’t been following the live blog too closely: The debate hasn’t started yet. In the interest of supplying you with uninterrupted entertainment, as we supply our faces with pizza, here are a couple video specials we’ve produced recently. One explores the evolution of Hillary Clinton’s explanations and apologies for having used private email during her time as secretary of state, and then being slow to characterize what that involved exactly, to the extent where now the FBI and a stack of ambitious Congressmen are involved. Hillary Clinton’s email scandal: the best of the apologies and non-apologies - video If you liked that, you may equally enjoy Hillary Clinton’s flip flops: from same-sex marriage to TPP – video – you can read coverage related to that video here. We started work on a video of how Bernie Sanders has changed his mind but it’s shaping up as less of a montage and more of an SMPTE color bars screen. Here’s Sanders talking with Stephen Colbert about being a socialist though. No debate preview would be complete without a look at how the participants are preparing for the big moment. Let’s go first inside firebrand challenger Bernie Sanders’ playbook: That’s “chill out,” which familiars with the lexicon of American politics will recognize as meaning – huh? ...? Maybe with the moon rock? Meanwhile Hillary Clinton plans “lite” debate prep, CNN’s Dan Merica reports... ... and Chafee is going for a walk... ...while O’Malley is apparently going to noodle around a bit on his guitar... The Democrats are totally going to lose this year? Like McGovern style? Oh wait – sounds like Webb is going to beat something up. Whew UPDATE dayum (h/t @kaylaepstein): We know, because he’s told us, what Donald Trump will be doing during the debate. But what about the rest of the Republican field? The soundtrack at the party we for some reason enjoy imagining that you are at may have slowed a notch from Kool to, say, Atlantic Starr, but Ben Jacobs is still shouting, and this time it’s about what GOP candidates have on tap tonight: “Some candidates have campaign events overlapping,” Ben shouts: Kentucky senator Rand Paul is holding an event at the University of Iowa which starts at 6:30 Central. However, a Paul spokesman told the Guardian that “we have an event overlap but he’ll watch parts and is expected to react on the livestream.” (Paul is livestreaming his entire day on the campaign trail on Periscope). Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson and former senator Rick Santorum also have campaign events tonight but will try to watch what they can. A spokesman for Santorum told the Guardian that he would listen on the radio in the car between events. But not all Republicans are watching. Florida senator Marco Rubio told Greta van Susteren on Fox News Monday that he likely won’t be watching, although he will likely “see the clips and the highlights.” Some people in the universe have noted that one significant figure in national Democratic politics to whom intensive speculation has been attached as to his designs or not on the White House, who is the sitting vice president with a ready-made army of potential supporters and donors – uh, he’s not in Las Vegas. Is Joe Biden running for president? Not so far. But CNN thought there was enough of a chance that he would do so at the last minute that they prepared a “breakout podium” (that’s actually a lectern, to read or speak behind. You stand on podiums (podia?)). But the vice president will not be in the debate hall tonight. Instead he is literally hosting a high school reunion. Then he says he’ll watch from home. No word on whether he’ll follow the baseball. But let’s be honest: probably. The publication of the lectern pic does not sit well with some readers alongside the fact that Lawrence Lessig, the Harvard Professor who says he has reported raising more than $1m in his own Democratic presidential bid to get the dark money out of politics, has not been invited by CNN – because, they say, his poll numbers were too low (and Chafee and Webb and O’Malley on stage, that’s saying something). Here’s a strange piece of news to emerge on the verge of Clinton’s first big debate outing of 2016: the New Yorker has published, in full and for the first time, an Obama campaign memo from 2008 describing how to beat her. The memo describes a plan to attack Clinton’s perceived vulnerability on character issues, after the brushes with indignity and untruth during the Bill Clinton administration and a lingering sense of impropriety and secrecy, if not outright scandal, during her years in the senate. Here’s a grab of part of them memo. Click through for explication and related news coverage. In case you’ve forgotten what Jim Webb, the Emmy-award winning journalist whose Fields of Fire Tom Wolfe called “the finest of the Vietnam novels”, looks like, CNN has a graphic, which handily places the candidates in the order in which they will appear onstage and links to the live stream site: And yes, we’re aware of what we’re competing against. We know you have a choice of live debate coverage, and we want to thank you for choosing us! Now pay us $10 for a beer and no we don’t take cash. Not only are there other live blogs out there competing for your attention tonight – Game 4 of the Dodgers-Mets playoff series starts at 8.07pm, just early enough to be in full swing by the time the Democrats start talking. It’ll be a night of channel surfing in the White House, the press secretary has announced: (Obama’s Cubs are on the verge of wrapping up their series against the Cardinals. It’s 6-4 in the bottom of the seventh.) At that party you’re at, the Guardian’s Ben Jacobs is there too, and in case you can’t hear him shouting over Kool &amp; The Gang, here’s a transcription of what he’s saying. “Much of the media attention around tonight’s Democratic debate has focused on the long-awaited showdown between frontrunner Hillary Clinton and insurgent Bernie Sanders,” Ben shouts. “However, there are three other candidates on the stage who will try to make their mark and take advantage of their first major moment in the sun”: Martin O’Malley: The former governor of Maryland and mayor of Baltimore has been, in a way, the most disappointing of all the Democratic candidates. O’Malley once appeared to be best positioned of any candidate to challenge Clinton from the left. He has repeatedly visited Iowa and New Hampshire and courted elected officials and activists in those states. However, the unrest in his hometown of Baltimore shortly before his campaign launch altered the political narrative around him, and the rise of Bernie Sanders has made it difficult for a more traditional politician to stand out. With Joe Biden’s potential candidacy looming, this may be the former Maryland governor’s one shot to catapult himself out of the tier of also ran candidates. Like Eminem in the movie 8 Mile, “You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow / This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo.” Jim Webb: A former one-term senator from Virginia with three tattoos, Webb is perhaps the most idiosyncratic candidate on stage, and running one of the most idiosyncratic campaigns. He has rarely been in Iowa, New Hampshire, on television or really any place else. Mother Jones even launched an investigation to see if he was really running for president. Webb’s last public appearance seems to have been on a radio show in late September. Despite all of this, Webb, who gave the Democratic response to the State of the Union in 2007 and was once considered a rising star in politics, still brings enough gravitas to be taken at least somewhat seriously. The question is whether he can use the debate to finally start a conventional campaign or if Webb, a combat veteran who served secretary of the navy under Ronald Reagan, just keeps on doing his own thing. Lincoln Chafee: For Lincoln Chafee, if he is to walk the long road to the White House, he has to make up more than a few kilometers tonight. The former Rhode Island governor and senator, best known for his advocacy for the metric system and party switch to become a Democrat in 2013, has been the darkest of dark horses in the race. So far, the highlight of Chafee’s campaign has been a music video aired by late night talk show host Conan O’Brien rooting for the former Rhode Island governor to somehow crack one percent in the polls. Chafee has to find a way to change that tonight and maybe even work his way up to 2%. We have a lot of informational and entertaining preview content coming your way before the debate begins, in about two hours now. But we want to start the night out by giving pride of place to you, our readers, many of whom have replied to our online callout for questions you’d like to see asked: On Facebook, Miriam Colman asks: What are their proposals for coming to a peaceful resolution to the Syrian conflict? What common ground do they see with republicans and how do they plan on building on them? On our Guardian Witness tool, user carbird76 asks: We hope some of you are getting together to talk about these questions tonight. And, just in case you’re calling that couch and TV and cocktails outnumbering invitees a debate “party”... Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the first Democratic presidential debate of the 2016 race for the White House. The Guardian’s Sabrina Siddiqui (@sabrinasiddiqui) and Paul Lewis (@PaulLewis) are in Las Vegas, where CNN is scheduled to start broadcasting the action at 8.30pm ET (you can watch it for free online right here, though the network’s countdown clock has only begun on TV). The last time around, Hillary Clinton was flanked by candidates called Barack Obama and John Edwards and under pressure to defend her Iraq war vote and years on the Walmart board. She took part in 21 televised debates over an entire year from 2007 to 2008 – and lost. Tonight, Clinton will be flanked by candidates called Bernie Sanders and Martin O’Malley, and a couple of other guys, and under pressure to prove, after all her years in the public eye, she is finally the answer for Democratic voters – and for the country, including the 70% who tell Gallup they are “dissatisfied with the way things are going in the United States”. But it’s not all about Hillary Clinton. For about a quarter of Democrats, Sanders (CV here) has been right everywhere where Clinton (CV) has been sort of wrong – Bernie Sanders, they say, is right on the war on poverty, right on the climate, right on calling out discrimination. The contrast between Clinton and Sanders, side-by-side, will be one of the night’s main attractions at the Wynn on the Vegas Strip. But any of the three other candidates onstage – former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley (CV), former Virginia senator Jim Webb (CV) and former Rhode Island governor and senator Lincoln Chafee (CV) – has the potential to seize the conversation and define the evening. Is Clinton in trouble? Can Sanders expand his appeal? Will O’Malley or Webb have a breakout moment? Will Chafee repeat his calls to pardon Edward Snowden and encourage the US to adopt the metric system? We’ll be answering all those questions and some even more outlandish ones throughout the evening right here, with a cast of characters from Washington and way, way beyond: Political reporter Ben Jacobs at Guardian US headquarters in New York. Reporter Lauren Gambino at a watch party in Harlem. Daniel Hernandez at a union watch party in Las Vegas. Washington bureau chief Dan Roberts at a Bernie Sanders party. US environment correspondent Suzanne Goldenberg. Plus opinion from Megan Carpentier, Jessica Valenti, Jeb Lund, Lucia Graves, Ali Gharib, Nicole Sandler and more. We promise not to take anything TOO seriously. But we also would not send you into this evening’s two-hour debate without screening this short film of interviews with voters on the streets of Las Vegas, from Sabrina Siddiqui and videographer Laurence Mathieu-Léger over the weekend."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/video/2011/jun/15/tepco-plan-seal-fukushima-reactors-video","type":"video","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-06-15T08:11:00Z","webTitle":"Tepco unveils plan to seal Fukushima reactors - video","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2011/jun/15/tepco-plan-seal-fukushima-reactors-video","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/video/2011/jun/15/tepco-plan-seal-fukushima-reactors-video","fields":{"headline":"Tepco unveils plan to seal Fukushima reactors - video","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2013/apr/12/taiwan-howard-marks-returns-taipei","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2013-04-12T20:00:00Z","webTitle":"Taiwan: Howard Marks' return to an old haunt","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2013/apr/12/taiwan-howard-marks-returns-taipei","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2013/apr/12/taiwan-howard-marks-returns-taipei","fields":{"headline":"Taiwan: Howard Marks' return to an old haunt","bodyText":"The seaside road was throttled by traffic heading towards Dog Temple, and cars were parked for several kilometres along the coastal highway. Unlike most shrines, where deities are worshipped during the day, worshipping ghosts is best done after midnight, when they are more likely to respond positively. At midnight, tough guys who had rolled up in their Mercedes and BMWs, sauntered to the altar to pray on their knees. Young women in miniskirts and low-cut blouses, accompanied by bodyguards in leather jackets, placed incense in sacrificial urns and mumbled prayers, perhaps against the risks of their profession. The old prayed for the return of lovers long gone over the seas. It was 1988, and I'd learned that a federal grand jury indictment had been issued against me, and the US was seeking my extradition on the grounds of my being the ringleader of the biggest cannabis smuggling organisation in the world. I'd never been to Taiwan, but I headed straight there. No one had ever been extradited from there to anywhere. I'd be safe. My first few days confirmed my optimism. I loved the place – there was no evidence of any law or regulation. Scooters and motorbikes carrying several passengers with no crash helmets careered through streets with no traffic signals and parked wherever they wished. Forgery was a respected profession. But I missed my kids desperately and kept thinking I should go home and wriggle out of the problem. I heard tell of a Buddhist shrine – the Temple of the 18 Kings – patronised by lawbreakers seeking advice on criminal matters. I took a taxi there to resolve my quandary, and the driver explained that during the late 1800s, a boat carrying 17 fishermen and their communal dog capsized in the Taiwan Strait. The fishermen drowned, but the dog survived. In accordance with tradition, the locals prepared a collective grave and ghost temple on a cliff overlooking the shore. The dog jumped into the grave with the bodies, refused to leave, was buried alive, and became the 18th of the kings of the temple. Eighteen is the number of hells in Chinese folk religion. The temple was shrouded in safety, mystery, and danger. Thick clouds of eye-stinging incense swirled around the temple's red columns. Altar candles burned in honour of a dog that signified luck and good fortune as well as loyalty and friendship. Worshippers lit cigarettes instead of incense sticks, symbolising the friendship between dog-spirit and man. They stroked and rubbed images of the dog. I made an offering of cash, cigars, and a Cartier lighter, bought a charm necklace, and asked the dog should I stay or should I go. The monk in charge gave me one of 64 possible answer slips. The taxi driver translated: I had to go home. A few days later, I was in Madrid's terrorist prison trying to avoid extradition. I failed and spent the first few years of my possible 40-year incarceration vowing that should I ever get released, I would go back to Taiwan and kick that dog up its arse. Now, more than 24 years later, my daughter, Amber, was accompanying me there. During the journey, I had scoured travel guides and brochures offering bungee jumping, trekking, shopping, fishing, cookery lessons, health spas and monasteries. But I know, through my decades of travelling, that the benefits of any action vacation become distant memories once you're back at work. Even worse are anti-vacations, with lean vegetarian diets, meditation, chanting and 5am alarm calls, where drinking alcohol is discouraged. I find such holidays vexing, mind-draining, and expensive. I would settle my score with the dog, eat and drink. We checked-in to Hotel Quote in the centre of the capital, Taipei, an extremely efficiently run boutique hotel that was a finalist last year in the coveted Taipei's Best Hotel Bar after Dark award. Dawn broke after what seemed like a few minutes, and I caught a fleeting glance of Amber tip-toeing out of the room. She was off to Sun Moon Lake, about 250km away in the centre of the country, for some peace and tranquillity. I fell back asleep and missed breakfast by at least eight hours. Amber had left a note asking me not to go to the Dog Temple until she returned. As night fell, I took a taxi to the nearby Combat Zone, the only night-life area I remembered from my first visit. Almost identical to Bangkok's Patpong, the zone was a neon-lit concentration camp of more than 50 girlie bars and strip joints in a grid of small streets behind the Imperial Hotel. The zone got its start during the Vietnam war, when American soldiers partied there on their way to and from the killing fields. Its boozy legacy survived, but it had aged considerably, and the tired no‑smoking bars and clientele lacked their previous libidinous lustre. I had a few interesting chats with some veterans who had never had any reason to go back home, while the wind picked up, howling like a flock of owls, and the pitch-black sky emptied. It was typhoon season, and one was hovering off the coast, threatening to visit. I, too, was feeling my age, and went back to the hotel to carry on sleeping off my jetlag. At breakfast the next morning, I met an American, David Frazier, who wrote for the Taipei Times. He was an endless source of information on all Taiwanese matters, knew of the Dog Temple, but had never visited it. He offered to drive us there. Daytime is never the most appropriate period to communicate with ghosts anywhere, so Amber and I were not surprised to find the Dog Temple, which I instantly recognised, almost deserted. But I was astonished to see that the temple lay next to Taiwan's first nuclear power station. David explained that the power station enclosure had been designed originally to encompass the area of the sacred tomb, but the heavy machinery broke down whenever it neared the shrine. The engineers had to abandon their original plan and the nuclear station's outer wall simply borders the tomb. This helped transform the hitherto local cult into an island-wide craze. The shrine became a focal point for successful anti-nuclear demonstrations, eventually becoming one of Taiwan's most popular temples. The cult of the dog in the 18 Kings temple is paradigmatic of the coexistence of tradition and modernity in Taiwan. The power generated by a nuclear reactor could not diminish that of a dog worshipped in a nearby temple. On the contrary, the reactor itself was incorporated into the legends celebrating the dog-spirit, and the modern media spread the legends throughout the island. There were simply too many visitors to cast them all as underworld types: many were simply ordinary people unconcerned about issues of morality. Bus and taxi drivers suspend temple amulets from their rear-view mirrors and place small statues of the robed dog-spirit on their dashboards. But the carnival atmosphere for which this seaside temple was so famous had inexplicably faded. It looked a bit shabby, with just two food vendors in front selling unappetising bamboo-leaf-wrapped rice and meat dumplings, braised stuffed snails, and some worryingly unrecognisable roasted animal parts. However, a pack of stray dogs loitered knowingly. Shaking with the trepidation of uncertainty, we walked slowly into the shrine. The six-foot high grey stone dog that had haunted me during my years of solitary confinement was no longer there. It had been replaced by two smaller bronze dogs, each baring their teeth savagely. I had already more or less decided not to give the big dog a hefty kick and fool around with a humbling power I did not understand, and in any event, the smaller dogs' arses were inaccessible. Their ferocious mouths turned into loving smiles. I put my right hand into one of their mouths. I was here, alive, healthy, and with my wonderful daughter. I could not imagine being happier. Behind the altar, David and I climbed a hidden stairwell to a small, dark room above the temple, where we discovered a cabinet with 64 small draws, each containing a pile of small pink paper slips bearing a fortune. David, fluent in Mandarin, searched through the 64 different possible answers the dog spirit could give. One stated: \"Travellers will find benefit in returning home. If burdened by legal affairs, settle them peaceably.\" Clearly, that was the one I had received in 1988. We looked at the pink slip again. Printed in smaller type next to the larger fortune was the following: \"This sacred word will bring luck to one of noble heart. But for a scoundrel it will bode ill fortune. Many contradictions are apparent. The return of good fortune cannot be determined.\" David burst out laughing: \"You obviously didn't read the fine print, Howard.\"Later, at the end of our trip, he phoned me minutes before we boarded the plane to London: \"I've found out that a second temple has just been built the other side of the nuclear power station.\" \"Don't tell me that's where the six-foot grey dog statue is,\" I said. \"No. This one is two storeys high. I don't know how we missed it.\" The hotel concierge had suggested I eat at a typically Taiwanese restaurant with the unlikely name of 21 Goose &amp; Seafood, on Jinzou Street, a road that was full of bars and restaurants heaving with rowdy clients. Every table was occupied, but a table for two had a vacant chair to which I was directed. The lone diner stood up, shook my hand, and in stuttering English introduced himself as Li. No smoking signs blazed from every wall, but everyone without exception, including the chefs, was smoking. A betel-nut vendor passed from table to table offering his wares. The set menu was the same each night, first course: goose, second course: seafood. Li and I small-talked for a while as more people crowded into the restaurant and somehow found space. He suggested we go to the bar next door for a drink. The street activity had increased even further when we went outside. Wasn't Taiwan supposed to be suffering in recession like the rest of us? Over the past few years, I had read several uninviting headlines about unemployment being at an all-time high, economic growth at an all-time low, a severely battered stock market, Sars viruses replacing visiting businessmen, and more bad news. Yet here they were spending money all night, eating jovially, exchanging phone numbers, and drinking with ebullient enthusiasm in crammed bars and restaurants filled with an atmosphere of revelry, intoxication, and fun. \"Taipei busier than ever,\" said Li, noting my looks of astonishment at the dynamic chaos. \"When Taipei people worry, they drink. But rest of Taiwan, bars and restaurants struggling. Sales no good. Places closing, pushing each other out of business with bargain price and happy hour. Even here in Taipei, must sell entertainment, too. Not just booze.\" I looked at the four Chinese women dancing on the bar, caught his drift, and nodded over to them. \"Like paying that lot to do their thing?\" \"No. They just office girls having good time. Bar pay for music, lights, smoke vapour, and beautiful girls for customer. Technique simple. Girls surround customer. He buys them drink. They come closer. He buys more. Chinese have special name for feeling of being surrounded by seduction, to be lost in company of beautiful women – mi huen zhen. Room next door, karaoke. Upstairs different entertainment.\" Upstairs housed an open-air smoking area. Several satellite dishes fed enormous plasma screens, showing a steady stream of football games, Formula One races, and tap dances to a crowd of foreigners playing table football, pool, and darts. There was no dartboard, just punctured pictures of Karl Marx, and Fidel Castro. The male foreigners were outnumbered by Chinese of both genders looking on in noisy amazement and occasionally throwing a dart and drinking a yard of beer. Peanut shells, dog ends, and sawdust covered the floor. \"This new in Taipei,\" said Li. \"Taiwanese like new.\" Another evening, pulling up alongside a heavily populated pavement, we were greeted by immaculately dressed waiters bringing us menu cards to fill in. They would find us when our table was ready. Din Tai Fung is the most famous restaurant in Taipei. There are dozens of cooks looking like surgeons, heaps of bamboo steamers, and great piles of pork and dough rolled and wrapped into its signature dish – the dumpling – thin and fresh, never soggy or doughy, and served immediately after it is steamed. The most popular is also the most basic, made with green onion, ginger, pork, soy sauce and sesame oil. The floors and furniture were cleaner than any I have ever experienced, including those of top-end private hospitals and clinics. After taking our seats, we were politely but thoroughly instructed which dumpling went with which sauce and the order in which to eat them. The bright lights helped ensure a quick turnover. One comes here to eat, not for romance. Taipei has an advanced 24-hour snacking culture enabled by street vendors, who will show up wherever people gather, whether at temples or cinemas. Simplicity and freshness are the hallmarks of Taiwanese street food. It's fresh because the turnover is high, and simple because each stand concentrates on a single dish.Most of the stalls are basic set-ups with a few stools, a generator, a tank of cooking gas, and a grill, pot, or steamer. Although grilled sausages and squid, with their smoke and flame, are the most visible street food, a Taipei night market will also have stands selling fried rice, congee, grilled beef, oyster omelettes, wheat gluten, onion pancake, barbecued pork, roast chestnuts, fresh juice, and dumplings. Some of the street food comes from extreme ends of the food chain and looks more like a biology field trip than dinner: entrails, innards, wings, knuckles, feet, tongues and congealed blood are common. Wafting down every alley and byway in Taipei is the unmistakable and often appalling odour of stinky tofu, best eaten when smothered in soy, vinegar, garlic and chilli sauce. Most Taipei restaurants, however, no matter how good, are featureless, except for those that concentrate on one feature: Tai G, in the Shipai night market, serves just medicinal chicken soup, tailored to the customer's particular ailment. Jail (37 Dunhua South Road) is decorated like a prison and the waiters dress like inmates. Visitors can put on manacles and have their photo taken in a cell. I gave both of those a miss, but did try Snake Alley – which is a narrow covered passageway where writhing snakes are skinned alive so that people can drink their warm blood while scoffing snake stew – and Modern Toilet (Lane 50, Xining S Road), which has seats and serving dishes shaped like toilets. The food in each was disgusting. I found the Taiwanese very friendly and relaxed. One can occasionally think Taipei has been far too busy making things to offer anything at all to visitors. But what it does have is genuine, and everything you do see is for the daily lives of the Taiwanese. There is nothing fake for tourists, mainly because there are so few of them. • The trip was provided by Cox &amp; Kings (0845 154 8941, coxandkings.co.uk).

Gérard Mestrallet, chairman and chief executive of GDF, said he wanted talks with the government about the right fixed or minimum price for producing nuclear energy: \"We are, with our partners, going to take a decision in 2015 [on building a new plant at Sellafield]. Today it is very difficult to invest in a nuclear power plant without clear visibility.\" The government has promised to provide a fixed carbon price to make nuclear investment more attractive, and has proposed a \"contract for difference\" which some say will act as a price guarantee. But Mestrallet said what was on offer was \"not enough and something is missing\". The comments will send a shockwave through Whitehall because they come just weeks after the German utilities RWE and E.ON said they would not proceed with plans to build new nuclear plants at Wylfa in Wales and Oldbury in Gloucestershire. The German firms run the Horizon joint venture in Britain. They cited concerns about financing the projects as well as costs associated with Germany's abandonment of nuclear power in the aftermath of the Fukushima accident in Japan. This would leave only GDF and the major French electricity producer EDF in the race to build new atomic plants in the UK. GDF has its own joint venture with Iberdrola of Spain called NuGen which insisted after the E.ON and RWE announcement that it remained \"committed\" to its planned 3.6 gigawatt plant at Sellafield. But Mestrallet's words make clear that GDF will only proceed if the British government makes further concessions to nuclear, something industry critics feared would happen. The GDF warning came as the French grip on Britain's energy infrastructure tightened with a plan to take full control of International Power (IP) for about £6.5bn. IP operates key power stations around the country including the gas-fired plant at Satend near Hull and a coal-fired facility at Rugely, in Staffordshire, as well as many others abroad. The move could exacerbate concerns about the undue influence of companies partly owned by the French state such as EDF, Areva and GDF – which have already big stakes in the British energy market. The French government is the biggest shareholder in GDF with 36%. GDF, the world's largest independent power producer, bought 70% of IP in 2010, but has now agreed to buy the remaining stake for 418p a share. Mestrallet said the acquisition of the minority stake in IP constituted a major step that would \"allow the group to fully capture growth in fast growing markets\". He denied further control by GDF of the UK business could be anything but good and said EDF was a \"competitor\" not a French state collaborator. An earlier offer from GDF at 390p a share had been resisted by the British company's board but Sir Neville Sims, chairman of the committee of independent directors at IP, said he had no difficulty recommending the new offer. It represented a price that \"fairly reflects the company's position in international power generation markets and its inherent growth potential,\" he said. The independent directors will recommend that shareholders vote in favour of the deal at the annual meeting on 15 May. The deal would be the second biggest this year after Glencore International's offer for mining group Xstrata. Angelos Anastasiou, a utility analyst with Investec Securities, said this was the right price for a business of this sort, adding: \"We see the offer progressing smoothly to its conclusion.\" But the acquisition by GDF follows the purchase by EDF of nuclear operator British Energy and the growing influence of French nuclear engineering firm, Areva. Jonathon Porritt, director of sustainability group Forum for the Future, recently expressed deep misgivings about the situation. He said in the Guardian last month: \"UK energy policy is being manipulated and subverted to make it possible for French nuclear power companies (EDF and Areva) to start building four new reactors in the UK – two at Hinkley Point in Somerset and two at Sizewell in Suffolk.\" IP runs six UK power stations including some wind farms. It has recently reduced the power output from a Teesside gas plant from 1,875 megawatts to 45MW, describing the commercial environment in Britain as \"challenging\". But of particular interest to GDF is IP's 6,600-MW building programme abroad, mostly in developing countries. Almost three-quarters of recent operating income has come from nations like Brazil, Indonesia and Saudi Arabia."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/nov/01/nuclear-reactors-subsidies-minister","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-11-01T13:19:02Z","webTitle":"New nuclear reactors could be eligible for subsidies, says minister","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/nov/01/nuclear-reactors-subsidies-minister","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/nov/01/nuclear-reactors-subsidies-minister","fields":{"headline":"New nuclear reactors could be eligible for subsidies, says minister","bodyText":"The nuclear industry could get subsidies from the taxpayer to build new reactors, the new energy minister has said, despite opposition in the coalition agreement and repeated assurances to the contrary. John Hayes told MPs on Thursday that new nuclear power would not receive specific government subsidy but could be eligible if other forms of electricity generation also benefited from the scheme. The Conservative minister's admission during energy questions in the House of Commons appears to back up a long-held suspicion that the government's proposed scheme to offer a guaranteed minimum price for new low-carbon energy to encourage companies to build new capacity – known as Contracts for Difference – would become a backdoor subsidy for the expensive nuclear industry. In reply to a question from the Liberal Democrat deputy leader, Simon Hughes, Hayes said: \"Let me be crystal clear … there will be no direct payment, no market support for electricity supplied or capacity provided by a private-sector nuclear operator, unless similar support is also made available more widely to other types of generation.\" His reply was seized on by the Green party MP, Caroline Lucas, who said: \"A subsidy is still a subsidy, even if it is given to others.\" The one-hour session for all three ministers at the Department for Energy and Climate Change was the first appearance in his new job for Hayes. This week in an interview with the Daily Mail he appeared to signal his opposition to building more onshore wind turbines, declaring \"enough is enough\". That view, popular with many of his party but in contradiction to coalition energy policy, prompted warnings from private renewable companies and a put-down from Ed Davey, the Lib Dem climate secretary. On Thursday the two men were at pains to put the incident behind them. Hayes joked more than once about his reference to \"bourgeois leftwing intellectuals\" whom he supposed to be behind onshore wind power. But he also delivered a strong statement in support of renewable energy, though notably there was no direct mention of wind power. \"The commitment to renewable technology is an essential part of delivering the energy mix: that builds sustainability, it helps us meet our targets [to cut emissions and increase renewables], and it's also good for consumers because that mix guarantees our energy security,\" he said. Davey faced several questions over perceived splits in the department. \"My honourable friend the minister for energy [Hayes] and I might on occasion disagree on issues of substance, and I certainly didn't agree with his comments the other day, but I certainly admire his style,\" joked Davey. Greg Barker, the other Tory climate minister, revealed that the department was considering a new subsidy paid through electricity bills – known as a feed-in-tariff – for households that install energy efficiency measures. Currently such tariffs are only available for homes and businesses that fit small-scale renewable technology such as a wind turbines or solar panels. \"This is one of a number of measures under active consideration at the moment,\" Barker said. It could be added to the upcoming energy bill through a government amendment, he said. Labour asked Hayes about doubts over the coalition agreement's pledge to support four projects to showcase carbon capture and storage at coal and gas-fired power stations. The government is running a competition for one such scheme, and there have been reports that money earmarked for the other three has been spent by the Treasury on other projects. \"Britain is the world leader. It's critically important in dealing with emissions we recognise that carbon capture and storage can be a vital part of those ambitions,\" Hayes said. The shadow energy minister Tom Greatrex said the delays were putting at risk up to €600m of European funding."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/jul/13/fukushima-nuclear-workers-inexperienced","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-07-13T18:20:58Z","webTitle":"Fukushima workers brave radiation and heat for £80 a day","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/13/fukushima-nuclear-workers-inexperienced","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/jul/13/fukushima-nuclear-workers-inexperienced","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima workers brave radiation and heat for £80 a day","bodyText":"Hundreds of inexperienced contractors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant are working in searing heat and high radiation levels for as little as 10,000 yen (£80) a day. As Japan succumbs to a heatwave, the plant's operator, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), has moved to address rising concerns over the health of almost 3,000 workers battling to bring its stricken reactors under control. So far, about 9,000 workers have been involved in the four-month operation to stabilise the Fukushima nuclear plant, where three of six reactors suffered meltdown after it was struck by a 15-metre (49ft) tsunami on 11 March. Nine people, all employees of Tepco, have been exposed to radiation levels exceeding the maximum annual limit of 250 millisieverts. But the longer the crisis drags on, the more the firm will have to depend on hundreds of small subcontractors who hire inexperienced labourers to perform the dirtiest jobs on one of the most hazardous industrial sites on earth. The Guardian spoke to several construction workers, who said they were paid about 12,000 yen a day to clear radioactive debris left in the tsunami's wake. By contrast, Tepco employees earn an average of 7.6m yen a year. Testimony from workers suggests that already hazardous conditions inside the plant have worsened by the arrival of a hot spell that shows no sign of relenting. The first few months of the Fukushima operation exposed several lapses in health and safety. Some men who were on site in the early days of the crisis were not screened for internal radiation exposure until June, while others had to share dosimeters, which measure radiation levels. In May, a 60-year-old man who had been working at the No 4 reactor died. The official cause of death was heart failure, possibly brought on by working successive 12-hour shifts. Dressed in protective boiler suits, gloves and masks fitted with filters, more than 2,500 contract workers endure searing heat during shifts that last no more than 90 minutes at a time. \"We are very concerned about the health of all the workers on site and have taken appropriate measures to protect them against the heat,\" said Yoshikazu Nagai, a Tepco spokesman. Of the 2,902 people working at the site, only 373 are Tepco employees. The remainder perform myriad tasks, from removing rubble and debris to monitoring radiation levels and decontaminating uniforms and equipment. In response to mounting criticism of conditions at Fukushima, the utility says it has increased the number of rest areas, installed more water coolers and distributed hundreds of coolant vests and refrigerant packs that workers wear around their necks to prevent heatstroke. Moves to improve conditions came after Takeshi Tanigawa, a medical advisor to Tepco, had warned that nuclear power plant workers faced an increased risk of accidents due to sleep deprivation and fatigue. \"Their level of stress is unimaginable,\" Tanigawa, a professor of public health at Ehime University, said, adding that, without counseling, some were at risk of developing post-traumatic stress syndrome. Goshi Hosono, an adviser to the prime minister, acknowledged that the government had failed to adequately protect the workers. \"In our early response, we did not have a system in place to manage radiation risks,\" he said. Last week, Tepco acknowledged that the risk of radiation exposure and concern among relatives had added created \"multiple\" sources of stress for workers. The firm said it had introduced regular health checks and that medical staff would be sent to the site to offer counselling for between two and four days a month. The Fukushima operation's dependence on hundreds of contract workers was highlighted in May when Japanese media reported that two men who replied to a wanted add for truck drivers in northern Japan - with a daily wage of 12,000 yen - were sent to work at the nuclear plant at short notice. The notice had been posted in Kamagasaki, a slum area of Osaka where day labourers and the unemployed have been hired out to small construction firms, often with the help of yakuza go-betweens, since the 1960s. Japanese media reported that the daily rate for labourers is three times higher than usual for people willing to work inside the plant's grounds, and 1.5 times higher for jobs in the wider nuclear exclusion zone. But, according to one report, some ads for plant workers offer 10,000 yen a day for truck drivers, with jobs as security guards paying as little as half that."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/blog/live/2015/mar/04/nigel-farage-announces-ukips-immigration-policy-politics-live-blog","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2015-03-04T17:15:31Z","webTitle":"Cameron and Miliband at PMQs: Politics Live blog","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2015/mar/04/nigel-farage-announces-ukips-immigration-policy-politics-live-blog","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/live/2015/mar/04/nigel-farage-announces-ukips-immigration-policy-politics-live-blog","fields":{"headline":"Cameron and Miliband at PMQs: Politics Live blog","bodyText":"Sky and Channel 4 have offered to move the date of the proposed TV debate between David Cameron and Ed Miliband following Cameron telling MPs at PMQs that he objected to it being held on 30 April. A Downing Street source said a few minutes ago that they could not comment because they had not yet received the offer. (I told them they should read this blog!) Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, has condemned Ukip’s immigration policy as “chaotic and confused”. (See 3.43pm.) And a fresh split has apparently oppened up between Nigel Farage and his immigration spokesman, Steven Woolfe, after Woolfe used an interview to disown, or clarify, Farage’s claim that people with life-threatening illnesses would be prevented from coming to Britain. (See 3.18pm.) Nick Clegg’s constituency office in Sheffield has been occupied by student protesters. That’s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, has put out her response to Nigel Farage’s immigration plans. Here it is in full. Last week, Ukip set a net migration target of 50,000. Today, Nigel Farage says targets are unworkable and Ukip will have no caps at all. Then on the same day he says net migration will be 27,000. The Tories and Ukip have got themselves in a ridiculous tangle on their immigration promises. The Tories’ net migration target is in tatters and they are arguing over whether to keep it. Now it seems Ukip are just as chaotic and confused. Nigel Farage’s slippery approach is just designed to exploit concerns about immigration and increase division rather than ever setting out practical policies to control and manage immigration in a sensible way to make the system fair. Ukip’s rightwing plans to cut employment rights will lead to more undercutting by agencies and employers who exploit cheap migrant labour and illegal workers. And their plans to pull out of Europe will make it harder to tackle illegal immigration and criminals entering the UK - as they oppose the European arrest warrant which deports 1000 suspected foreign criminals a year, and border controls could have to move back to Dover from Calais, with all the problems of tackling illegal immigration that brings. At the same time their net migration plans appear to mean no overseas students at all - despite the fact that they bring billions into Britain. Nigel Farage isn’t serious about solving problems, or getting the best deal for Britain, he can’t even work out what his policy is. (Actually, Cooper is wrong about the Ukip plans involving no overseas students. Ukip has said that it would take them out of the main immigration figures, so that universities could still take students from abroad.) Sky and Channel 4, which are to host the debate between David Cameron and Ed Miliband on 30 April (the week before the election) have put out a statement in response to David Cameron’s comments at PMQs. (See 2.22pm.) They are offering to change the date. This morning Nigel Farage ditched a plan proposed by Ukip’s immigration spokesman, Steven Woolfe, for a cap on immigration. As Asa Bennett at Huffington Post reports, Woolfe subsequently used an interview to disown, or clarify, Farage’s claim that people with life-threatening illnesses would be prevented from coming to Britain. Woolfe told Radio 2: If someone came to our borders and was on there, you know at the border control and they announce that they’ve got a cancer or tumour we are not going to turn them away Jeremy. What sort of nation are we to do that? That isn’t going to happen. This chart is interesting (if you can read it). It helps to explain why immigration is so important to Ukip. Its supporters are much more likely to see immigration and multiculturalism as a bad thing than the supporters of other parties. You can read the original research here. Here’s a Guardian video of Nigel Farage talking about his immigration policy. Here are some other verdicts on PMQs. George Eaton at the Staggers says Cameron looked like someone expecting to win the election. David Cameron had the confidence of a man scenting victory at today’s PMQs. The latest polls, showing the Tories ahead, meant he was in boisterous, remorseless form. Ed Miliband sought to pin him down on his failure to meet his promise to reduce net migration to “tens of thousands” a year (of which he once declared: “If we don’t deliver our side of the bargain, kick us out in five years”) and his refusal to commit to the TV debates. But Cameron simply blustered through it at all. Miliband’s arguments were by far the stronger but at no point did the PM appear truly uncomfortable. Andrew Gimson at ConservativeHome says Westminster sounded ‘as in touch with wider opinion as the Palace of Versailles in early 1789”. Mark Ferguson at LabourList says PMQs was terrible. The reality of today’s PMQs was that it was as much about what Cameron refused to say as it was about the bluster of what he deigned to say. He also failed to rule out a rise in tuition fees, which remind us that after five years of slash and burn, we still don’t really know what a future Tory government might look like. What other nasties do they have hidden? Will the media poke around Tory plans with the same vigour they (rightly) apply to Labour’s. I shan’t hold my breathe, but it’s worth asking regardless. He also quotes this tweet from Conor Pope, which is rather good. Sally Gimson at Progress says Cameron sounded “a little desperate” at PMQs. David Cameron has come close to ruling out taking part in the TV leaders’ debates proposed by broadcasters. He has always expressed reservations about the debates taking place during the election period, but at PMQs today he implied that he would not attend the debate scheduled with just him and Ed Miliband for 30 April. Asked if he would attend, he replied: I have been very clear. I have said get on with the debates before the election campaign. I think we should start now. Miliband said he would be at the debate on 30 April, and he asked if Cameron would be there. Cameron refused to give that assurance. Later Labour sources said that, since Cameron said he was committed to debates five weeks ago, there has not been a single meeting of the Labour and Conservative negotiating teams. A Labour source said: Behind the scenes Cameron’s team are doing everything they can to scupper the negotiations and sink the debates. Miliband has said that Cameron’s record on immigration shows that voters cannot trust him on anything. Challenging Cameron at PMQs to admit that he had failed to meet his promise to cut net migration below 100,000, Miliband said: Your promise on immigration makes the deputy prime minister’s promise on tuition fees look like the model of integrity. If you can break so spectacularly a solemn promise on a fundamentally important issue, why on earth should anyone believe any of your election promises this time? Cameron said the strength of the economy was to blame. There are two reasons for high migration: one is the growth of our economy and the other is that our benefit system allows people to access that benefit system straight away. I say let’s keep the strong economy, let’s change the benefit system. You want to keep the benefit system and trash the economy. Cameron has challenged Labour to commit itself to renewing Trident. The Tories would do this if they won the election, he said. But it is concerning that almost three quarters of Labour candidates oppose the renewal of Trident and I think now is the time for Labour to rule out any agreement with the SNP. Because no one wants to see some grubby deal between the people who want to break up the United Kingdom and the people who want to bankrupt the United Kingdom. The SNP has said that it would insist on Trident being abandoned as a condition for supporting a minority Labour government. Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader, has claimed that the party’s decision to abandon its policy of having a firm 50,000 cap on annual net migration amounts to a U-turn. Instead, Ukip would create a migration control commission to keep it down, he said. He said: There is no U-turn, there is a change of emphasis. The police officer at the centre of the “plebgate” row has accepted £80,000 in damages from Conservative MP Andrew Mitchell. The TUC has criticised the Treasury’s decision to sell the government’s stake in Eurostar. Frances O’Grady, the TUC general secretary, said this was “short-sighted”. The French and Belgian governments understand its value, which is why they have held on to their shares. And once again passengers’ interests have been put last, and private shareholders first. The more we keep selling off the family silver, the less control British people have over essential services we all rely on. Slicing up our services between shareholders all over the world means that the profits are likely to get sucked out of the UK economy instead of being re-invested to make sure British people are getting a gold standard. Complaints have been sent to the Solicitors Regulation Authority by Twitter users who have received £6,000 libel demands from solicitors working for the MP George Galloway. Britain’s defence chiefs should be prepared to resign en masse if the next government tries to impose any further cuts on the armed forces, a former head of the RAF has said. As the Press Association reports, Air Chief Marshal Sir Michael Graydon said the current service chiefs could face a “very, very difficult decision” if they are confronted with the prospect of further cutbacks after the general election in May. Speaking at a meeting of the UK National Defence Association (UKNDA) campaign group, he warned that they could not carry on pretending they had the resources they needed. Asked directly if they should tender their resignations if they were ordered to make further cuts, he said: “Yes”. This is what political journalists and commentators are saying about PMQs on Twitter. Those suggesting Miliband won Those suggesting Cameron won Those calling it a draw Other comments PMQs - Verdict: Paul Flynn may not be entirely right when he said David Cameron was worse than ever at dodging the question today, because at the start of the exchanges Cameron did give an answer to the question about whether he had met his migration target that was semi-reasonable. But then Cameron abandoned all attempts to engage with Miliband and resorted to listing his achievements like Soviet commissar, and citing tabloid trivia. I suppose he will head off for lunch thinking it could have gone worse, but it was demeaning. Ed Miliband exposed Cameron’s failure on immigration pretty effectively, using the “did he mean it?” line that he he used before to make this an issue of trust too. It was a comfortable Miliband win. The interesting question, though, is what else could Cameron have said? Perhaps the best strategy would have been to apologise. Something along the lines of: Look, I’m sorry I made that pledge. It was made in a good faith, but it turned out to be a mistake, and it raised unrealistic expectations. For once I should have listened to Nick Clegg. But no government gets everything right, and it’s silly to pretend that they do. I’m still committed to cutting net migration, and I’ve got a plan for that, but we’re going to produce a more realistic target. But, of course, he couldn’t say that, partly because of the “kick us out if we fail” line in the Contract with Britain (election rhetoric never seems wise five years on) and partly because Theresa May has committed the party to keeping its net migration target. It would have been easier for Cameron today if the party had dropped it (he could have said the target was a mistake, which was why was writing it), but I suppose that’s the last thing the Tories wanted to do in a week where Ukip are launching their immigration target. One final point. Cameron has always said that he is not keen on holding debates during the election campaign, but today he seemed to go further. I’ve been very clear. I say get on with the debates before the election campaign. I think we should start now. That sounds like an explicit refusal to take part in the debates proposed by the broadcasters. PMQS is over. On a point of order, Labour’s Paul Flynn suggests Cameron should be sent on a course to learn the meaning of the words question and answer, and the link between the two. Today Cameron was worse than ever at not answering, he says. His comments were completely irrelevant, he says. John Bercow says Flynn has made his point. I’ll post a verdict soon. John Woodcock, the Labour MP, asks Cameron if he will accept the recommendations in the report into deaths at Furness hospital. Cameron says the government will accept many of those recommendations. It is important not to sweep these matters under the carpet, he says. Sir Gerald Howarth, a Conservative, says Cameron should abandon his natural reticence and tell voters that Labour ruined the economy. Cameron says he has not felt reticent today. The economy is turning round, things are getting better, and we should not let Labour wreck it. Cameron says he is happy to support a campaign to improve the Cotswolds railway because it would help him. Ed Balls is heckling, and Cameron says Balls told us he was a long, slow burn. (This is a reference to Balls talking about his love life on LBC.) But the only thing in ashes is Labour’s economic credibility, he says. Cameron says Labour promised a price freeze on energy even when prices are coming down. That shows the damage Labour are doing. Mark Hunter, a Lib Dem, asks if Cameron supports a campaign for nursery staff to have training to prevent deaths from choking. Cameron says he will talk to colleagues to see if more can be done to help with this. Labour’s Meg Munn says schools with outstanding academic results can go for years without their child protection procedures being inspected. Shouldn’t child protection be made a more central part of the inspection process. Cameron says he will consider this. Inspections used to take place too often, he says. Boards of governors can always trigger an inspection. Cameron says Labour’s tuition fees policy hits universities, helps richer students rather than poorer ones and will not improve access. It will also be paid for by a tax hitting people like senior nurses, he says. It is an example of the chaos Labour would bring. Oliver Colvile, a Conservative, asks about a development opportunity in Plymouth. A decision needs to be made before the government goes into election purdah. Cameron says he thinks a decision should be able to be taken before the end of the month. If the decision is approved, funding is available. He is committed to it, he says. Guy Opperman, a Conservative, asks about Cameron’s plan for the north east. Cameron says youth employment has risen more in the UK in the last 12 months than in the whole of the rest of the EU combined. Labour’s Julie Elliott asks Cameron if he agrees with a business minister who said prosecuting people who do not pay the minimum wage is the right thing to do. Cameron says people who do not pay the minimum wage should be prosecuted. Labour’s Barbara Keeley asks Cameron if he will debate with Miliband. Cameron says he wants to get on and hold the debates now, not in the election campaign. Liam Fox, the Conservative former defence secretary, says Cameron is a statesman, unlike Miliband. Will he confirm that he will never get involved in a “shabby deal” to get rid of the nuclear deterrent. Cameron says he is committed to renewing Trident, and will do so in the next parliament. But three quarters of Labour candidates are not committed to Trident. Labour should now rule out a “grubby deal” with the SNP over Trident. Labour’s Diana Johnson asks how the police can tackle sex abuse when their budgets are being cut. Cameron says making child sex abuse an issue of national importance will mean that more resources get allocated to this David Ward, a Lib Dem, asks Cameron if he thinks his behaviour at PMQs increase the standing of parliament in the eyes of the public. Cameron says the exchanges are robust, but at least it provides accountability. Labour’s Katy Clark asks why the government is closing a tax office in north Ayrshire. Cameron says Labour were the friends of the tax avoiders. It took a Conservative government to sort it out. Simon Wright, a Lib Dem, asks about a school issue in his constituency. Cameron says he will look at this. Labour’s David Winnick says the Tories are the party of the rich. Cameron says 1,000 people are getting a job every day under this government. Labour should welcome that, he says. Snap PMQs Verdict: Cameron’s bluster machine was on overdrive, and it probably saved him from a total drubbing, but his hyperactive question-dodging could not disguise the fact that Miliband had him bang to rights. Miliband says the broadcasters propose a debate on 30 April between him and Cameron. He will be there. Will Cameron? Cameron says they are debating now, but Miliband cannot talk about living standards. Let’s have the debate now. Miliband says, if Cameron wants an extra debate, he will have one. Will Cameron be there? Cameron says Miliband has given up on the seven-party debates. He probably watched the Green press conference. We all thought it was a car crash. Miliband probably thought it was a masterclass. Miliband says Cameron stance makes Nick Clegg look good. Cameron says he has a copy of his document with him. He starts quoting from his pledges, saying they have been achieved. The Tories cheer every time he does this. Eventually John Bercow shuts him up. Miliband says you cannot believe the promises you get from Cameron on immigration. It is not worth the paper it is written on. The jeering gets louder. Bercow asks MPs to remember what people think. Miliband says Cameron promised net migration in the tens of thousands. Will he admite he broke that promise. Cameron says he cut net migration from outside the EU, but not from within it. And he has a plan to deal with that. He lists more kept promises. And he says he promised 400,000 apprentices. He has broken that promise. He has created 1m. On the subject of leaflet, Miliband has to stand on a box to be pictured for Labour leaflets. How many Labour MPs want Miliband on their leaflets? Ed Miliband says Cameron made a no ifs, no buts promise before the election. Can he remind us what it was. Cameron says net migration has fallen from outside the EU, but increased from within the EU, because of growth. Miliband quotes what Cameron said about immigration in his Contract with Britain. Cameron said if we don’t deliver, kick us out. Did he mean it? Cameron says there are two reasons for high immigration: a strong economy, and the benefits system. He wants to keep the economy, but change welfare. Miliband wants to keep welfare, but trash the economy. Andrew Turner, a Conservative, asks about a business investment on the Isle of Wight. Cameron says it’s an excellent development. It will provide 550 students with workshops and learning opportunities, and more than 200 apprenticeships. Labour’s Kalid Mahmood says George Osborne was asked six times on the Today programme if he had discussed tax avoidance with Lord Green. Will Cameron confirm if he or Osborne discussed this? David Cameron says he dealt with this two weeks ago. It is the same Lord Green that Labour gave a job to. PMQs is about to start. Q: You say there won’t be a cap. But you also expect net migration to be below 50,000. Aren’t you trying to have it both ways? Farage says there is an obsession with floors, ceilings etc. He thinks, if you talk about caps, the public will not believe you. Ukip has not abolished the cap. But it has a plan to deal with immigration. It wants to turn an issue that is divisive and make it positive. Nigel Farage and Steven Woolfe are now taking questions. Paul Nuttall, the Ukip deputy leader, is chairing. He calls Gary Gibbon from Channel 4 first. There is some jeering, because of the Channel 4 drama about Ukip’s first 100 days in power. Q: You seem to have watered down your policy. Are you worried your immigration stance looked toxic? (This provokes more jeering.) Farage says he is concerned about the way Ukip is portrayed. He is concerned about it being portrayed as anything other than an open, inclusive party. (Sadly, the BBC has now dropped its live feed. But we’ve got PMQs coming up.) Ukip would not deport EU citizens who are here already, he says. We work with them, and welcome them. Some are even standing as Ukip candidates. They can definitely stay. Ukip’s policy is ethical and fair, he says. (It was Mark Reckless, the Ukip MP, who suggested during the Rochester byelection that Ukip would repatriate EU citizens.) Woolfe says “if”, and then he correct himself, “when Ukip comes to power, when Ukip wins this election” ... Ukip would offer citizenship to immigrants here for five years. Woolfe says, when you see migrants queuing up at Calais, it is hard not to want to help them. But, if you do help them, you would be helping the traffickers who are provding funds to groups like Islamic State. That is why there must be no amnesty for illegal immigrants, he says. And there would be an extra 500 enforcement staff, he says. Ukip has shown how this would be funded. Woolfe says Ukip would maintain the UN principles governing asylum. At the moment it takes far too long to process asylum seekers, he says. Ukip would speed this up, to allow people to start working more quickly. People who were not true asylum seekers would be repatriated. Woolfe says Ukip would abolish any rules giving EU citizens preference. EU and non-EU citizens would be treated the same. Immigrants would have to have health insurance for themselves and their families for the five years they are here before they can apply for citizenship. Woolfe says Ukip would introduce one single passport queue at customs for British citizens, and one queue for the rest of the world. That would enable a proper count to be made of people coming in and out. And Ukip would hire an extra 2,500 border staff - not just 1,000 more, as Labour are promising. Woolfe says Ukip has thought long and hard about its policy. It would set up a migration control commission to decide how much migration is needed. And for five years there would be a ban on unskilled net migration. Woolfe says many people in the UK share that tolerant attitude. But other parties do not share that tolerant attitude, he says. He says a Labour adviser said there was a political purpose behind mass migration. Perhaps Labour wanted more votes, or perhaps they wanted to anger the right. But when people like Gillian Duffy complained, Labour called her a racist, because she did not share their dogma. Woolfe says Cameron said he should be kicked out if he did not meet his net migration target. But he didn’t, Woolfe says. Steven Woolfe, Ukip’s immigration spokesman, is speaking now. (Sky and BBC News are not covering the Ukip launch anymore, but there is a feed on the BBC website.) Woolfe says his grandmother was an Irish immigrant. And he says, when his mother brought a black boyfriend home, his grandmother gave him a warm welcome. He is glad they did, because that man became his father. Farage says his family were migrants. In modern parlance, they were refugees. They were protestants from France. But they came over a period of 100 years, he says. He writes about this in his Telegraph piece. I feel so passionately about this because my ancestors were migrants – technically, asylum seekers. One side of my family were French Huguenot refugees. The “wave” of immigration behind my ending up here numbered around 50,000 people. This was the largest immigrant group in Britain between 1066 and 1945. Farage says immigrants should have to have health insurance. And they should not claim benefits until they have contributed for five years. This is a common sense solution, he says. Ukip is the only party talking honestly about this issue, the number one concern for most people, he says. He says this policy would be more ethical. Currently we are discriminating against skilled people from countries like New Zealand and India. Nigel Farage is delivering his immigration speech in London now. He says Ukip wants an Australian-style points system. We have to build a home every seven minutes to cope with immigration, he says. Immigration has depressed wages, he says. The minimum wage has become the maximum wage. It has been a boon for the rich, who can have cheaper nannies and gardeners. But for most people immigration has not brought those benefits, he says. In an interview for BBC News Nigel Farage said his party’s decision to drop the 50,000 net migration target was not a U-turn. It isn’t a U-turn. We’ve looked at the figures very closely - 27,000 people would have qualified under the Australian-style points system to come into this country. I can’t see us getting anywhere near 50,000. Asked whether people should listen to him or Steven Woolfe, the immigration spokesman who was promoting the 50,000 target only last week, Farage said: I sat with him yesterday. Policies evolve, they develop, they move on. I don’t want the emphasis from today to be what our cap is. The police officer in the Andrew Mitchell “plebgate” affair has accepted damages of £80,000, the Press Association reports. The conclusion of Pc Toby Rowland’s defamation case against the MP was announced at the High Court in London today. Last November Andrew Mitchell, who vehemently denied using the word “pleb”, lost a high-profile action against News Group Newspapers, publishers of the Sun. A judge then declared he had reached the “firm conclusion” that Mitchell had used the “politically-toxic” word in September 2012 when he was not allowed to cycle through the main Downing Street vehicle gates. Pc Rowland’s lawyer, Jeremy Clarke-Williams, told Mr Justice Warby that since that judgment Mitchell “has abandoned the other defences he had raised to my client’s claim and consequently terms of settlement have been agreed”. The solicitor added: “The payment of £80,000 damages by Mitchell sets the seal on Pc Rowland’s vindication, as well as providing compensation for the injury to his reputation and the distress caused to him and his family over many months.” Neither Mitchell nor Pc Rowland was in court. Here’s today’s Guardian seat projection. Conservatives: 277 Labour: 271 SNP: 51 Lib Dems: 25 Ukip: 4 Greens: 1 Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, has just put out this statement about George Osborne’s Today interview. George Osborne was asked six times whether he discussed allegations of tax evasion at HSBC with Lord Green, the bank’s former chairman, and six times he refused to answer. What has George Osborne got to hide? People will draw their own conclusions from his total failure to answer. The chancellor also struggled to explain why, since the government received these files in May 2010, only one person has been prosecuted out of 1100 names. David Cameron and George Osborne must now come clean about their discussions with Lord Green - both while he was a Tory minister and before they appointed him. Huffington Post’s Asa Bennett says this is not the first time Nigel Farage has dumped existing Ukip policy unceremoniously. You can listen to Nigel Farage’s Today interview here. Nigel Farage claims Ukip’s immigration policy would lead to higher wages in the UK. Here are the main points from George Osborne’s Today interview. Osborne claimed he could not have discussed HSBC’s involvement in tax dodging in Switzerland with the former HSBC boss Lord Green when he was a Tory trade minister because Osborne did not know then about the evidence suggesting the bank colluded with this. This only came to light recently, he said. The information that has been published recently has only recently come to light. Until that point, the allegations had been that individuals with bank accounts at HSBC had been evading tax and HMRC was, rightly, investigating it. The new information is that, potentially, the allegation is that HSBC Swiss colluded in this – this is new information. He said he was aware, when Green was appointed, that some of HSBC’s Swiss customers were being investigated for tax evasion. But those were individual matters, not corporate matters, and it would not have been right for him to ask about tax investigations affecting individuals. But Osborne at times sounded evasive when asked about what he discussed with Green, and Labour’s Margaret Hodge has accused him of not telling the full truth about his knowledge of affairs at HSBC. See 8.52am. Osborne said that HSBC was “a very important bank” for the UK, employing 50,000 people, and that he wanted it to succeed. He confirmed that he was considering toughening the law on tax dodging. He said he supported Tory plans to retain cutting net migration below 100,000 a year as an “ambition”. He claimed Ukip’s immigration policy was “chaotic”. What you’ve heard from our political opponents today, those who are contesting in this general election, is a completely chaotic alternative and they are making it up as they go along ... Nigel Farage seems to be making it up as he goes along inasmuch as you follow his policies, one moment he’s talking about a cap and then he ditches it live on air, which is a novel approach to policy-making. He said the IFS report today on living standards marked “a major milestone today in the British recovery, with incomes back to where they were before the crisis”. He said the IFS had debunked false Labour claims about the coalition’s record. They say, first of all, that incomes have recovered to their pre-crisis levels so the country is not poorer than it was. They actually confirm in this independent report that the richest paid the most towards dealing with our economic problems, not the least, as you often hear. And they also say that, rather than inequality increase which, again, is often said, in fact, inequality has fallen in our country. He said the sale of the government’s stake in Eurostar for £750m was “good value for money for the taxpayer”. I’ve taken some of the quotes from PoliticsHome. Here’s some Twitter comment on Nigel Farage’s morning interviews. From the Sun’s Tom Newton Dunn From Matthew Goodwin, the academic and Ukip expert From ConservativeHome’s Mark Wallace From the Times’s Ann Trenaman From Sunder Katawal from the British Futures thinktank Labour figures were unimpressed by George Osborne’s response to the questions about why he did not discuss HSBC tax dodging Swiss customers with Lord Green, the former HSBC boss who served as a Conservative trade minister. The most significant is probably the one from Margaret Hodge, who is accusing Osborne of concealing the truth about his knowledge of HSBC and its involvement in tax dodging. From Alex Belardinelli, Ed Balls’ head of communications From Barry Sheerman MP From Margaret Hodge, chair of the public accounts committee From Jon Ashworth MP From Chris Williamson MP Here’s the Spectator’s Isabel Hardman on George Osborne’s Today interview. Osborne claimed that he backed the Tory plan to set a target for getting net migration below 100,000 in his Today interview, but in private his views are said to be rather different. (See 8.25am.) The Times has been running a good series on immigration this week, and this is what Rachel Sylvester and Alice Thomson reported in a story on Monday (paywall). For the government, the question of inflows and outflows of people has also been the rock in the road of good coalition relations. Immigration has caused more tension within Cabinet than almost any other policy since 2010 — among Conservative ministers as much as, if not more than, between Tories and Liberal Democrats. This is one of the few areas on which George Osborne — a liberal free marketeer who believes immigration is good for the economy — has very different views to Mr Cameron, who is in favour of tougher controls. “George does not want the Treasury briefing against the Home Office but his instincts are very different to David’s,” a friend says. Q: Theresa May wants to keep the target of getting net migration below 100,000. Is that a good idea. Of course, says Osborne. David Cameron supports that too. He says his opponents (ie, Ukip) have a chaotic policy. They are making it up as they go along. And that’s it. I’ll post a summary soon. Q: Lord Green, the trade minister, was aware of what was going on at the Swiss branch of HSBC. Did you know about that? Osborne says he only knew what the public knew: that information had been handed over to HMRC. Green was a business adviser to Labour. And his appointment was vetted. Q: Did you ask him about it? Osborne says ministers should not be able to look into individuals’ tax affairs. Q: That’s a red herring. It is not about his tax affairs. It is about what he knew about HSBC. Osborne says the information recently published has only just come to late. Previously the allegations were just about individual customers evading tax. The idea that the bank colluded in this is something that only came to light recently, he says. Britain needs successful companies. HSBC needs to deal with this problem. Q: Only one person has been prosecuted for tax evasion in relation to the HSBC Swiss accounts. Doesn’t the law need to be better enforced? Osborne says it is an important constitutional principle that ministers do not see people’s tax affairs, or tell the prosecuting authorities what to do. The authorities have gone through this data. He says he trusts their judgment. Q: You must be the only person in the country who does. Osborne says the prosecuting authorities say they have the resources they need. But he is looking at changing the law to toughen it up. Q: You are flogging off the family silver (Eurostar). Is there no end to selling stuff to foreigners? Osborne says this is a good deal. The government had a minority stake anyway. It is getting much more for it than people expected. The government is extending high-speed rail, he says. You can only afford that if you are getting your priorities right. Q: But is there no bit of strategic infrastructure you won’t sell? Osborne says Britain benefits from being an open economy, open to investment. For example, it is good that Chinese investors are building nuclear power stations here. Q: But living standards are below their all-time peak in 2009-10. Osborne says the financial crash did enormous damage to the economy. But, compared to most other Western countries, we have grown faster, and created more jobs. Incomes have reached their pre-crisis level, he says. They should be higher in 2015-16 than they were in 2010-11. But, he says, he is the first to admit there is more to be done. John Humphrys is interviewing George Osborne. Humphrys says Osborne was smiling as he summarised the IFS living standards report. Osborne says we have reached a milestone today. But we must not put the progress achieved at risk. Q: If you are in a lower-income household, you are still feeling poor. Most of us are buying less food and other things than before the recession. Osborne says it is true that the poor suffer most when the economy turns down. But the IFS today has laid to rest a number of myths. First, they say income has recovered to pre-recession levels. Second, they say the rich have paid the most. And, third, they say inequality has fallen. Britain is fundamentally in a better position than it was five years ago, he says. Here’s Nigel Farage’s article in today’s Telegraph setting out his party’s immigration plans, including its proposal for a migration control commission to control immigration. And here are the key points Farage has been making in his morning interviews. (He did not just do Today.) I’ve taken some of the quotes from PoliticsHome. Farage said Ukip was dropping the idea of setting a firm annual target for migration. This seemed a fairly blunt slap-down to Ukip’s immigration spokesman, Steven Woolfe, who was promoting the target only last week. There would have to be flexibility in the new system, Farage said. And the public did not believe politicians when they set targets for immigration. We’ve had years and years of political parties setting targets. I think the public are bored with targets, they don’t believe targets. What’s really important is: are we going to get a grip on mass immigration into Britain, or not? He said he wanted to get net migration back to “normality” which he described as anywhere between 20,000 and 50,000 a year, the figure that applied for most of the second half of the 20th century. What I want to do, I want to bring immigration to Britain back to normality – and normality from 1950 until nearly the year 2000, from Windrush onwards, normality was net migration into Britain which varied between about 20,000 and 50,000 a year. The effect of Ukip policies would be to bring us back to those kinds of numbers. Each year will be slightly different for obvious reasons, but what we’re pushing here represents a drastic cut. He said current policy was unfair because it discriminated against skilled migrants from outside the EU who could benefit Britain. Ukip would change this, he said. He described his party’s policy as an “ethical” immigration policy. And understand this: Ukip’s immigration policy would give more opportunities to people from the rest of the world, especially from Commonwealth countries, because at the moment we have a massive bias in our immigration policy in favour of white people that come from southern and eastern Europe. So we are putting an ethical immigration forward, we are putting a fair policy forward – one that is fairer to people from the Commonwealth and fairer to British workers, too.” He claimed Ukip would have a “big voice” in parliament after the election. We’re not going to win the election, but what we are going to do is win enough MPs to have a big voice in the next Parliament. So I’m not going to be driving a ministerial car, but I might get the chance to drive the political agenda. He said Ukip would publish its manifesto in April, probably after the main parties. Voters would not pay any attention to the campaign until after Easter, he claimed. He also claimed the party never said it would publish its manifesto at the spring conference (even though it did). Nigel Farage is wrong to say Ukip never said it would publish its manifesto at the spring conference. (See 7.44am.) This is what Suzanne Evans, the deputy chairman, said in January when she was put in charge of compiling the manifesto. I relish the task of putting together the final details and presenting a sensible, radical and fully costed manifesto at our spring conference in Margate. Q: When will your manifesto come out? In April, probably later than the other parties produce theirs, says Farage. He says the campaign has been running since the new year. Parties are making new claims every day, and the public are bored. Q: But it was supposed to come out at the spring conference at the weekend. Good lord, no, says Farage. That was never the plan. He says he does not think voters will start focusing on the election until after Easter. And that’s it. The interview is over. Q: Do you agree with the director general of the IoD, who said last week the non-EU cap was harming business. In a way, yes, says Farage. He says the current system discriminates against people outside the EU who could benefit the country. Q: What if your proposed immigration commission said 100,000 a year was the right number? Farage says he thinks that would be very unlikely. But this is not just about economics. It is about community cohesion too, he says. He says if net migration continued at current levels the population would reach unmanageable levels. Mishal Husain is interviewing Nigel Farage now. Q: To what level would you reduce immigration? To normality, says Farage. That was what applied from Windrush (in the late 1940s) to around 2000. It was around 20,000 to 50,000 a year. At that time we had the best system of integration Q: So you are putting caps on it. No, says Farage. The level might vary from year to year. The public are fed up of politicians putting figures on it. Q: But Steven Woolfe said last week there would be a cap. (She plays a clip.) Is that Ukip policy? Farage says it is very unlikely that Ukip would reach 50,000. Last year 27,000 people skilled workers came under the Australian-style points system. We are not having caps, he says. He says, again, he does not believe Britain would need 50,000 migrants a year. He thinks the number would be lower. Nigel Farage has been trying to address the charge that Ukip are dropping the target it was proposing only last week to get net migration below 50,000. That is certainly not the way it sounded when Steven Woolfe, Ukip’s immigration figure, mentioned the 50,000 figure in his speech to the Ukip spring conference on Friday. Here are today’s YouGov GB polling figures. The Tories are still ahead, but by 2 points, not 3 points as they were yesterday. Here’s the BBC’s overnight summary of what’s in today’s paper, including a picture gallery of the front pages. Two stories are leading the political news this morning. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has published a report saying that average incomes in 2014–15 are around the same level as they were in 2007–08 – before the banking crisis precipitated a deep recession. Nigel Farage is giving a speech setting out Ukip’s immigration policy. As Rowena Mason reports, he will says Ukip would ban unskilled immigrants from working in Britain for five years and set up a new migration control watchdog to bring down overall numbers. But he is also due to reject “arbitrary” immigration targets, even though Ukip’s immigration spokesman was saying only last week that the party would cap annual net migration at 50,000 a year. George Osborne and Nigel Farage are both giving interviews to the Today programme. Here’s the agenda for the day. 8.10am: George Osborne, the chancellor, gives an interview to the Today programme. 9.30am: Nick Gibb, the school reform minister, gives evidence to the Commons education committeee. 10.15am: Ed Davey, the energy secretary, announces plans to reform the energy market. 11am: Nigel Farge, the Ukip leader, unveils his party’s immigration policy. 12pm: David Cameron faces Ed Miliband at PMQs. 12.45pm: Nick Clegg and Sir Richard Branson discuss drugs policy at the Royal Institute of International Affairs. As Patrick Wintour reports, they will argue that the UK should begin decriminalising the use and possession of almost all drugs. 1pm: Cameron has a working lunch with the Mexican President, Enrique Pena Nieto. 3.05pm: Former leaders of the Commons Andrew Lansley, Jack Straw and Sir George Young give evidence to the Commons procedure committee. As usual, I will be also covering all the breaking political news from Westminster, as well as bringing you the most interesting political comment and analysis from the web and from Twitter. I will post a summary at lunchtime and another in the afternoon.

Calling on the prime minister to \"take control\" of the chancellor, George Osborne; energy minister, John Hayes, and other Conservatives known to be sceptical of renewable energy and climate change targets, David Nussbaum, the chief executive of WWF-UK, said: \"On becoming prime minister, Cameron suggested he would be the fourth minister at the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) and that his would be the 'greenest government ever'. \"But he seems to have lost his voice. There is currently a complete breakdown in government energy and climate change policy, sending mixed signals to investors and undermining job creation. [His] continued silence would be a betrayal not just of election promises, but of the UK national interest.\" Nussbaum's call came as the cabinet remains split over energy policy. The Liberal Democrat energy and climate change secretary, Ed Davey, has insisted the government backs a shift to a low-carbon economy through the development of renewable energy and new nuclear power, while the Osborne has shown support for a generation of new gas-powered plants. The much-delayed energy bill is now expected by the end of November. Davey and climate change minister Greg Barker are due to attend the global climate talks in Doha, which begin on 26 November. Cameron positioned himself as an environmental enthusiast after he visited Norway in 2006, in a visit organised in part by WWF to witness climate change firsthand and famously hugged a husky dog. But although he pledged to lead the \"greenest government ever\" shortly after taking office and was key in delivering the Climate Change Act that legally committed Britain to making deep emission cuts, he has since appeared to row back his enthusiasm for low-carbon policies. \"It's time for Cameron to be the prime minister he told us all he would be and deliver on his earlier promises,\" said Nussbaum. \"His lack of vocal leadership on climate change and energy is jeopardising some of the most promising green shoots of recovery. The UK needs significant investment in green infrastructure, yet he is letting a rogue pack within his party play politics with such an important issue.\" According to WWF, Osborne and Hayes have \"significantly\" undermined investment confidence in the renewable energy sector. \"Several major companies have already shelved their planned investment in the UK's renewable energy supply chain whilst others are reconsidering their future investment due to the political risk and lack of certainty created. Yet ironically, the CBI has repeatedly said that the green economy and the renewable energy sector are among the few bright spots for economic recovery in the UK, offering substantial potential for jobs, exports and investment.\" WWF called on Cameron to resolve the deadlock and bring his government together behind a strong energy bill. \"Much of the UK's ageing power infrastructure needs replacing. As well as a challenge, WWF and other organisations like the CBI see this as an opportunity for the UK economy. If the prime minister acts decisively he could move the UK towards a carbon-free, resilient energy future, with a growing number of highly skilled UK jobs and growing investment. This is the time for the government to speak with one voice in favour of green infrastructure, and the prime minister should provide it,\" said Nussbaum. In a separate move, MPs on the powerful environmental audit committee called on Osborne to reassure investors that the Treasury is committed to the move towards a greener economy. The chairwoman of the cross-party committee, Joan Walley, said: \"The Treasury must end the uncertainty on energy policy and give investors and businesses the confidence to seize the enormous opportunities presented by new clean technologies. A second 'dash for gas' could lock the UK into a high-carbon energy system that leaves us vulnerable to rising gas prices. \"The government needs to reassure investors by setting a clear target in the energy bill to clean up the power sector by 2030.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/blog/2011/jul/26/george-monbiot-renewable-nuclear","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-07-26T12:39:35Z","webTitle":"Why the UK must choose renewables over nuclear: an answer to Monbiot | Jonathon Porritt","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2011/jul/26/george-monbiot-renewable-nuclear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/blog/2011/jul/26/george-monbiot-renewable-nuclear","fields":{"headline":"Why the UK must choose renewables over nuclear: an answer to Monbiot","bodyText":"Why must the UK choose between nuclear and renewable energy? That was the question George Monbiot asked recently in a blog that challenged me to answer four questions. Here is a concise version of my answers: the full version of my answers will be posted on my website. What has the Committee on Climate Change got wrong? A lot. The principal source for the committee's estimates would appear to be Decc's own figures prepared for them by Mott MacDonald in June 2010. The assumptions on which this analysis is based are heroic, to put it mildly. As pointed out by Andrew Broadbent (of CES Social and Economic Research), these figures have been challenged by a wide range of very different cost projections. Broadbent quotes the authoritative World Nuclear Status report which suggests that nuclear costs would be much higher, and that it is certainly not \"the most cost-effective\" low-carbon technology. \"Because of implicit and explicit guarantees, the private cost element of nuclear is uncertain and continues to escalate ... and the public subsidy portion is generally missing entirely, so that nuclear cannot be properly compared to alternatives, nor can the potentially enormous cost to taxpayers be properly vetted.\" MacDonald produced a new report in May 2011 which pretty much contradicts its own 2010 report. As Broadbent points out: \"Its most important conclusion is that the relative costs of different energy-generating technologies actually depend on which technology is given priority by policy makers. The report says: 'It is possible to find cases where offshore wind, CCS and nuclear are each lower cost than the other two.'\" \"This means that if renewables are deployed extensively, they may well be cheaper than nuclear. Why the committee came to airbrush this vital conclusion, and choose not to point out that government itself has the responsibility for deciding whether to make renewable energy the most cost-effective option, can only be guessed at.\" This is not the place to go into the voluminous literature on hidden subsidies on nuclear power, but the committee makes only passing reference to perhaps the most egregious distortion: the indirect subsidy in the form of insurance liability. In view of this, it is highly ironic that Vincent de Rivaz, CEO of EDF can regularly be heard calling for a \"level playing field\" for different energy sources, knowing full well that every other electricity supplier carries its own third-party liability costs. Does Monbiot – or anyone, for that matter, on the Committee on Climate Change – actually understand the scale of this subsidy? Recent research by Versicherungsforen Leipzig GmbH (summary in English), a company that specialises in actuarial calculations, shows that full insurance against nuclear disasters would increase the price of nuclear electricity by a range of values - €0.14 per kilowatt hours (kWh) up to €2.36 per kWh – depending on assumptions made. By the time you factor in all the hidden subsidies, the Committee on Climate Change's figure of £96 per megawatt hours has no more validity than any other competing estimate, and it is entirely disingenuous of the committee to put it in the public domain without making clear just how spurious the figure really is. The Committee on Climate Change should really know better – as should Monbiot. Predictably, investors know better. Which is why no reactor ever has been, or ever will be, built without massive public subsidy – a point readily conceded by most industry representatives. Finally, the committee's estimate also makes no allowance for additional, post-Fukushima cost increases. Every energy economist I know acknowledges unreservedly that the cost of nuclear will continue to go up even as the cost of solar PV continues to come down. The World Nuclear Status report from Schneider, Froggatt &amp; Thomas concludes: \"Despite the disproportionately lower support historically, some analysts consider solar photovoltaic energy to be competitive with nuclear new-build projects under current real-term prices. \". Monbiot has been unsighted on the costs of PV for a long time, . I hope he has now had a chance to read the Ernst &amp; Young Outlook on the UK solar PV industry which points to grid parity for PV here in the UK without any subsidy by 2020? It will happen well before that in Germany as a direct consequence of the far-sighted decisions they took many years ago. Germany plans to generate 50% of its daytime electricity from solar by 2020 – with installed capacity of 52 gigawatts (GW). Despite the fact that solar PV has the potential to meet more than 30% of the UK's day-time electricity by 2040, our target for 2020 is just 2.7GW – not much more than the 2GW that Germany installed in June 2010 alone. It's still not too late for the UK. But Monbiot has become a big part of the problem. His inability (or unwillingness) to track solar cost trends has fixed him in a weird contrarian crusade to undermine the solar industry. Can nuclear and renewables not co-exist? For me, there are four main reasons why co-existence has become a foolish pipedream. 1) The lobbying position of the nuclear industry itself Until the middle of 2009, the nuclear industry's public position was a \"both/and\" position – with room for both renewables and nuclear. Since then, however, nuclear industry leaders have become increasingly vocal in arguing that if the UK government persists with its target of generating 15% of energy from renewables by 2020 (which means at least 35% of our electricity from renewables), then the nuclear industry will suffer very severely. Both EDF and E-ON are on the record in making this case with growing stridency. And I'm sure Monbiot's sources inside Decc will have told him in no uncertain terms that what these companies say in public is a pale shadow of the virulently anti-renewables lobbying that they're doing behind the scenes. How else could EDF hope to recoup the £12bn it's already laid out to purchase nuclear sites here in the UK? 2) Financial opportunity costs Nuclear power is the most capital-intensive of all supply options. With estimates ranging from £4bn to £5.5bn for a new nuclear reactor, there is a clear risk that other options will be frozen out by this level of capital commitment. There will also be significant opportunity costs regarding energy efficiency – as well as renewables. Every billion that goes back to the nuclear industry is a billion that isn't going into retro-fitting our hopelessly inefficient housing stock – and simultaneously sorting out the continuing scandal of extraordinarily high levels of fuel poverty here in the UK. Sometimes Monbiot is naive. Does he really think a \"both/and\" world is available when the Treasury is imposing a ruthless cap both on direct payments from tax revenues and on levies taken from consumer bills? 3) Political opportunity costs The Sustainable Development Commission's 2006 report commented specifically on this: \"Were it to be decided to proceed with a new reactor programme, there is no doubt that this decision would command a substantial slice of political leadership. Political attention would shift, and in all likelihood undermine efforts to pursue a strategy based on energy efficiency, renewables and more CHP.\" The electricity market reforms announced recently provide ample evidence to that effect. Our entire electricity market system is now being rigged to provide a wholly unjustifiable continuing subsidy to the nuclear industry, while doing a lot less than is required to promote renewables and absolutely nothing to put efficiency at the heart of that reform process. 4) Constraints in upgrading the grid More and more industry specialists are concerned about what is sometimes called a \"system clash\" between a generation system based predominantly on a small number of nuclear reactors and large-scale gas or coal-fired power stations, and a system based on multiple renewable generators and more distributed local area networks. Greenpeace's report (The Battle of the Grids) eloquently highlights just how problematic this already is in Europe, where it has become commonplace in a number of countries to switch off wind turbines during periods of plentiful electricity supply in order to give priority to nuclear and coal-fired plant. The high-capital costs and the nature of nuclear reactors means you need to run them all the time for both economic and engineering reasons. If there are 16 GW of new nuclear, as the government proposes, preference will clearly be given to purchasing from this source. In conclusion, Monbiot should know better than to take the nuclear industry's \"both/and\" rhetoric at face value. Indeed, I sometimes wonder if he reads his own words as carefully as others do: \"Power corrupts; nuclear power corrupts absolutely … nuclear operators worldwide have been repeatedly exposed as a bunch of arm-twisting, corner-cutting scumbags.\" That's powerful posturing. It's as if he's trying to cover up his own embarrassment at ending up as a pawn of the nuclear industry by being ruder about them (on a personal basis) than any anti-nuclear activist would think of being. I hope that strategy works for him; it certainly doesn't for me. Are renewables always better? I believe the answer to that question, today, is a clear \"yes\". I cannot guess what the situation might be in the future, and I've always supported the continuation of research into new nuclear technologies. It is indeed conceivable that at some stage in the future new reactor designs could prove to be so superior that we would be mad not to take advantage of such breakthroughs in the supply mix. We should continue to keep that door open. However, I've heard so many promises of \"better things to come\" from the nuclear industry over the past 40 years that I attach very little significance to the current wave of similar promises. Right now (and for at least the next decade I would argue) proven renewable technologies offer a much more secure supply-side strategy. Monbiot knows as well as I do that 100% renewables (and geothermal) is where we need to get to eventually – so why not seek to get there just as soon as possible without yet another disastrous foray into today's nuclear cul-de-sac? There are two other reasons for always favouring renewables over nuclear. It seems to me to be all-but-inevitable that there will be attempts at a terrorist attack on some nuclear facility somewhere in the world at some stage over the next decade. Secondly, and very briefly, we have to address the issue of proliferation. As Tom Burke has put it: \"Atoms cannot be made to work for peace without making them available for war\". If you are to exclude nuclear entirely, what should the mix of electricity generation in this country be? As Monbiot is aware, there are a growing number of voices arguing that we can indeed provide almost all the energy we need from renewable resources. The report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (adopted by 194 governments on 9th May 2011) shows how we could get up to 80% of the energy we need from renewable energy sources. So my \"vision\" of a sustainable energy future for the UK is relatively simple. I believe a 100% renewable supply strategy for the UK is feasible by 2050 at the latest, assuming only that we succeed in reducing total energy consumption in the UK by at least 40% by 2030 through a wholly different approach to energy efficiency than any government has ever demonstrated before. Andrew Warren, chief executive of the Association for Conservation of Energy, continues to highlight the contrast between the UK, which is anticipating a doubling in electricity demand, and Germany, which has a target to reduce total consumption by at least 30% – in an economy that is already much more energy efficient than ours. But I readily acknowledge that this combination of renewables and efficiency will take some time to deliver. There will need to be some \"generating bridge\" to get us to that 2050 point. For me, this comes down to a straight choice between his \"least worst option\", namely nuclear, and my \"least worst option\", gas plus carbon capture and storage (CCS). Both nuclear and CCS are hugely expensive, and CCS is still unproven at scale. But we're almost certainly going to need CCS anyway (installed even on biomass plants) given the speed at which greenhouse gases continue to build up in the atmosphere. And at least gas is relatively cheap, relatively easily available, and relatively easy to build. Gas-powered stations built over the next five to 10 years could be economically retired from 2035 onwards. In conclusion, I've answered Monbiot's four questions, even though they're not necessarily the most important questions. I've not even touched on those issues that matter most to the many people that remain hostile to or sceptical about nuclear power: radiation risk, radioactive waste management, fuel supply and manufacture, decommissioning, coastal siting, water availability, flooding and so on. And nor have I raised any of the ethical issues associated with our generation opting for another round of nuclear. A proportion both of the risks and of the costs associated with this industry will fall on citizens who were not party to these decisions. For me, there is no way that this can possibly pass the \"intergenerational justice\" test. I've come to the conclusion that Monbiot's controversialist instincts have blinded him, in this instance, to the inadequacy of his research, the untrustworthiness of his sources and the potentially damaging consequences of his bizarre pro-nuclear advocacy. Monbiot has caused many in the nuclear industry (and in government) to delight in his \"Damascene conversion\", an unexpected turn of events that they are already ruthlessly exploiting. All this might be seen as an acceptable price to pay if he had a solid case to make – which he transparently does not."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/damian-carrington-blog/2011/may/05/uk-coast-flood-tsunami-nuclear","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-05-05T10:33:00Z","webTitle":"Shrinking Britain will force land to be abandoned to the sea | Damian Carrington","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2011/may/05/uk-coast-flood-tsunami-nuclear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2011/may/05/uk-coast-flood-tsunami-nuclear","fields":{"headline":"'Shrinking Britain' will force land to be abandoned to the sea","bodyText":"Geologists take the long view, which can lead to some striking thoughts, and here is one: Britain is shrinking. As the waves crash onto the shores of this island, the rock is worn away or falls off in chunks, and, as the adage goes, they are not making land any more in Britain. I spoke to Prof Rob Duck, at Dundee University, whose new book is called This Shrinking Land: Climate Change and Britain's Coasts. He reeled off some of the places most at risk from erosion: the coast near Hull, north Norfolk and parts of Suffolk and the Wirral. In places, up to seven metres of coast is being lost each year. Landslides also dump land into the sea, with places at risk including the Isle of Wight and Devon, he said. Duck has a sobering message: \"The defend-at-all-costs mentality can't be maintained. I think economics will mean that less populated areas will have to be abandoned in the next two decades. My book attempts to explain the underlying processes, the inevitability of erosion.\" \"I'm not underestimating the emotional impact – people will lose generations of memories, as well as houses,\" he said. \"There is a price you pay for living on an island and there will be winners and losers.\" We also spoke about tsunamis and the UK, two things usually assumed not to coincide. But Duck said that 5,500 years ago, the Storegga landslide on the Norwegian coast triggered a giant wave that engulfed Orkney and Shetland, as well as hitting the eastern coasts of both Scotland and England. The tsunami has been estimated at 20m high at Orkney and probably inundated Dogger land, now permanently below the ocean. More recently, said Duck, there was a major surge in the Bristol Channel in 1607, which caused extensive flooding and killed 3,000 people. It may have been triggered by an earthquake off southern Ireland. Lastly, and better known is the location of a tsunami yet to happen: the giant volcano that form the island of La Palma in the Canaries. \"If the western flank comes off it would send a tsunami straight at south west England,\" said Duck. The fact that tsunamis can happen in the UK, and the idea that Britain's coast is shrinking, is certainly relevant to the debate over nuclear power and the disposal of long-lasting nuclear waste, in my opinion. Take a look at the map of British nuclear power sites: they are all on the coast. \"It is a cause for concern, some nuclear power stations are in vulnerable positions,\" said Duck. He also highlighted the Easington gas terminal – one of the biggest in Europe – as being in a very vulnerable position. It's always interesting, taking the long view."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/nov/16/decarbonisation-target-postponed-parliament","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-11-16T16:58:00Z","webTitle":"Decarbonisation target 'could be postponed until next parliament'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/nov/16/decarbonisation-target-postponed-parliament","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/nov/16/decarbonisation-target-postponed-parliament","fields":{"headline":"Decarbonisation target 'could be postponed until next parliament'","bodyText":"Plans to limit the carbon emissions of future power stations are on the brink of being delayed until next parliament, in what would be a blow to the climate and energy secretary, green campaigners and business chiefs. Ministers have been wrangling over whether to include a 2030 \"decarbonisation target\" for the power sector in the energy bill, which is expected to be published in parliament within the next fortnight. The Guardian understands a decision on such a target now risks being delayed until after the next general election. A senior source close to the talks said: \"It's been a very difficult negotiation, there has been talk of postponing the setting of a target until next parliament. But if we are to address investor concerns, it has to be addressed this parliament.\" However, the source added that the talks were still ongoing and \"it is still possible that there could be agreement on a target to be set this parliament, and that will come down to how hard they want to negotiate on the Liberal Democrat side.\" A spokeswoman for the climate and energy secretary, Ed Davey, denied the target had been dropped or delayed. \"We've not actually reached an agreement in government on the various energy negotiations we've been having,\" she told the Guardian. The splits between the coalition on energy are reportedly so unresolved they were left off the agenda at the \"quad\" meeting on Thursday of the four most senior figures - David Cameron, George Osborne, Nick Clegg and Danny Alexander. Dropping or delaying the target would clear the way for the \"dash for gas\" backed by the chancellor, and mark a defeat for Davey and the Liberal Democrats, who backed a motion in favour of a decarbonisation target at their conference. Business leaders have also warned over the past few weeks that failure to include the target would harm low carbon investment in the UK. Last week, the heads of Unilever, Doosan Power Systems, Anglian Water, Philips Electronics UK, B&amp;Q owner Kingfisher, EDF Energy, Johnson Matthey and Heathrow airport wrote to the prime minister saying the target would be a \"useful step to help deliver the required certainty\" for investment. It followed a similar earlier letter signed by an unusual coalition of the trade bodies representing the renewable energy, nuclear power and carbon capture industries. The decarbonisation target was recommended by the government's climate advisers, the Committee on Climate Change, who said electricity in 2030 be produced at no more than 50g of CO2/kW by 2030. Gas power stations emit around 350g of CO2/kW, and would therefore only be allowed if their emissions were captured and stored, or they were only used as backup power for renewable energy sources. Others in favour of the target include the energy and climate change committee of MPs chaired by Tory MP Tim Yeo, and the Labour leader, Ed Miliband, who backed the idea in September. Greenpeace UK executive director, John Sauven, said: \"If the coalition government kicks this decision into the long grass it will throw into doubt investment in Britain's energy future for years to come. International businesses are itching to invest in a UK clean energy sector that could be leading the world, but they need certainty. New factories and thousands of jobs are at stake here. We know the chancellor is the big roadblock to green growth, but unless the Liberal Democrats stand up to him they'll also be responsible for years of lost investment.\" Friends of the Earth's executive director, Andy Atkins, said: \"It would be scandalous if Ed Davey threw in the towel over energy decarbonisation – he mustn't do George Osborne's dirty work. Delaying decarbonisation targets until after the next election is like an alcoholic pledging to give up drinking - but not today. We need urgent action now to end our economy's addiction to dirty and increasingly expensive fossil fuels. If the Liberal Democrats fail to keep their promise to include power sector decarbonisation in the energy bill their credibility will be in tatters. MPs from all parties must fight hard to ensure the energy bill has a clear plan for meeting UK climate targets.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theguardian/2012/oct/30/inside-guardian-weekly","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2012-10-30T17:34:52Z","webTitle":"Inside the 2 November edition","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2012/oct/30/inside-guardian-weekly","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/2012/oct/30/inside-guardian-weekly","fields":{"headline":"Inside the 2 November edition","bodyText":"As we put this edition of the Weekly to bed, Americans were only just beginning to survey the destruction wrought by Hurricane Sandy.

For spinning, indeed. Last autumn, Angela Merkel's mistake-prone coalition government decided that Germany's nuclear power stations should continue to operate until 2035, which overrode a decision to quit nuclear energy by 2022 made by the government of Social Democrats and Greens in 2001. Seven months, a nuclear catastrophe in Japan and several regional losses by Merkel's Christian Democrats later, she's changed her mind again. On Monday night a historic decision was made, the government declared: Germany will be the first industrial country in the world that renounces nuclear power for good. All power plants will by switched off by 2022. Sounds familiar? Germany is not only quitting nuclear power, but it's quitting for the second time. This shows you how much we Germans fear radiation. It's a fear that has become deeply embedded in the psyche of the country. Since Fukushima, one can see on walls, doors, backpacks, bikes and everywhere else the logo of the anti-nuclear movement from the 1970s. A smiling sun saying \"Atomkraft? Nein danke\" has returned. People have put up the logo on their Facebook profiles, thousands have marched on the streets and the Greens, who grew out of the original anti-nuclear movement, have become stronger than ever. They could even provide the next chancellor. Suddenly everybody is against nuclear power, and Merkel is leading the movement. She's no Iron Lady, but rather a chameleon. No wonder the Greens are angry she stole their clothes. The decision to quit nuclear energy is politically correct, but is it economically sustainable and environmentally brave? Nobody is celebrating yet, because many questions remain. Eight power plants were switched off immediately after Fukushima – without causing problems. (It makes you wonder why they were built in the first place.) Those old ones won't come back. The remaining nine plants can still go another 10 years on full power, until 2021. The last one, the newest, has to be switched off by the end of 2022. For many critics this is still much too long, too many years with possible dangers, terrorist attacks for example, ahead. Will Germany face blackouts because of the closures? The earlier compromise of 2001 provided a less radical, gradual switch-off over several years. How to avoid such problems, especially in the winter time, is one of the open questions. One solution being debated is to keep one nuclear power station on stand-by. But the technology is so complicated, and you can't just switch a nuclear power plant on and off like a TV set. It would cost ¤50m per year to operate. In order to bridge the gap, the government will support the building of new fossil-fuel plants, mainly gas and coal. It seems that Germans prefer honest, pure coal smoke than clean but invisible and eternally poisonous radiation. That emissions may go up seems a lesser concern. Let's just plant a few more trees and support fair-trade coffee growers in Brazil. The hope is also that eventually the gap may be filled by wind energy or other eco-friendly energy sources. The government is set to spend more in order to raise the proportion of Ökostrom (green energy) by 2020 to 35%. It would be a massive incentive for the German wind and solar power industries. That is a very ambitious project: at the moment Germany has 17%, already one of the highest percentages in Europe. It's not clear if it's feasible to increase further, because already there are Bürgerinitiativen, or \"not in my backyard\" groups, protesting against anything that is more intrusive than a candle: coal energy plants, windparks or overhead electricity cables."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2014/jan/31/super-bowl-seahawks-broncos-guide-game","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2014-01-31T18:08:01Z","webTitle":"Super Bowl XLVIII: a quick and mostly true guide to ... the game","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jan/31/super-bowl-seahawks-broncos-guide-game","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2014/jan/31/super-bowl-seahawks-broncos-guide-game","fields":{"headline":"Super Bowl XLVIII: a quick and mostly true guide to ... the game","bodyText":"It's almost time for the Super Bowl, or The Big Game as commercials from advertisers that aren't official sponsors are legally obligated to call it. The Seattle Seahawks and Denver Broncos will face off on Sunday at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, home of the geographically confused New York Giants and Jets. For those who need to catch up, the Guardian presents this (mostly factual) cheat sheet that you can peruse all the way up to the opening coin toss. Denver Broncos Who they are The Denver Broncos were formed in 1960 as part of the American Football League, before the AFC/NFC merger. Since their formation they have won two Super Bowls, back-to-back in 1997 and 1998, both of them with Hall of Fame quarterback John Elway (who now works with them in a general manager-type capacity). Elway's departure left a hole in the quarterback situation that the likes of Brian Griese and Jake Plummer could not fill. (Some would argue that the lowest point in their franchise's history was when super-villain Hank Scorpio handed the team over to middle-class nuclear power plant operator Homer Simpson.) Until just a few years ago the Denver organization was haunted by the specter of John Elway, as every quarterback they've had since has not just been competing with the other team but also with Broncos fans' memories. That goes a long way in explaining the restlessness of some of their decisions, most notably trading away the talented but disliked Jay Cutler to the Chicago Bears with the naive hope that somehow likeable second-stringer Kyle Orton could be The Guy. Looking to make a big move, then-general manager Josh McDaniels drafted University of Florida quarterback Tim Tebow for the job. Halfway through his first NFL season the team gave in to fan demand and handed Tim Tebow the keys to the offense. What happened next was one of the more inexplicable runs in NFL history as the Broncos went on a run to the postseason with Tebow as the starting quarterback. Beating the Pittsburgh Steelers in the playoffs thanks to a ridiculous game-winning touchdown from Tebow in overtime. It was all looking good but then the New England Patriots knocked them out and apparently knocked over Tim's bottle of fairy dust. Events in the offseason would mark a permanent end to Tebow-mania in Colorado. Indianapolis Colts veteran quarterback Peyton Manning had missed that entire season with a neck injury. As he recovered from several surgeries, the Colts, who had made the playoffs the year before, had one of their worst seasons in franchise history which gave them the number one pick in the NFL draft and the chance to choose Andrew Luck, one of the most celebrated college quarterback prospects since, well, Peyton Manning. With their future quarterback ready to start immediately, and the still rehabbing Manning's future in the league uncertain, the Colts just released the Hall of Famer. That gave the Broncos a chance to pull off what has to be the greatest quarterback upgrade in NFL history. A free agent for the first time in his life, Manning signed with the Denver Broncos, and Tim Tebow was thrown to the wolves. (Okay, the New York Jets organization but, really, what's the difference?) Despite whispers that his latest surgery could have ended his career (blame Rob Lowe for that rumor) Manning's first season with the Broncos was a huge success, they went 13-3 in the regular season, but once again Manning's team came to an unexpectedly quick end in the playoff, this time losing to the Baltimore Ravens who were making their own Super Bowl run. How they got here It seems like this should be more common, but the 2014 Super Bowl will be one of only a handful featuring the teams with the best records in the regular season. In fact, the Broncos took a very similar path to the Super Bowl, compiling a 13-3 record in the regular season, winning the AFC West and earning a first-week bye and home-field advantage. Their first playoff action had them facing off against the San Diego Chargers, for the first three quarters the Broncos blanked the Chargers. It wasn't going to be quite that easy, as the Chargers went on to mount a furious near-comeback in the fourth, scoring 17 points before the game ended with Denver holding on to a 24-17 lead. From there, the Broncos advanced to the AFC Championship Game where Manning once again faced his biggest rival, Tom Brady and the New England Patriots. This one was less of a contest, an in-command Broncos offense carved up the Patriots' patchwork defense, eventually winning 26-16. Who's the quarterback? You're kidding right? Peyton Manning is one of the best quarterbacks of all time, some would argue the best, period. Despite being 37, his 2013-14 campaign was one of the best seasons he's ever had. Beyond leading his team to a 13-3 regular season and a Super Bowl appearance, Manning set a new all-time touchdowns record and will almost certainly win the NFL's MVP award. That of course, won't be quite enough for Manning. Despite his credentials, Manning is still criticized for being something of an underachiever. In today's sports landscape, success is measured in one thing and one thing only: championships. The danger that Manning would end up being the 21st century Dan Marino (all stats, no titles) finally ended when his Indianapolis Colts team defeated the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XLI in 2007, finally giving him his first ring. Then, of course, the narrative changed from \"Manning's legacy will be tarnished if he never wins a ring\" to \"Manning's legacy will be hurt if he only has one ring\". (This is called the \"Even Trent Dilfer Has A Ring\" Argument and it's mainly deployed by idiots who are hired to yell on television.) There's no pleasing some people. His next shot at a ring came in the 2009-10 season where the Colts lost to Drew Brees and the New Orleans Saints in Super Bowl XLIV. Manning has another shot to silence these voices on Sunday. Someone as motivated as he is doesn't need anything extra, but you can't help but think he wants to shut them up. How they play Peyton Manning throws lots of touchdowns, so they win a whole bunch. Broncos not named Peyton Manning you should know Even though a talent like Peyton Manning can make do with just about any receiver, that doesn't mean that he isn't more dangerous when he's surrounded by better weapons. Over the off-season, the Broncos signed Wes Welker, who has had some mild success working with another first-ballot Hall of Fame quarterback in New England. During the Playoffs, Manning has relied on the two Thomases, tight end Julius and wide receiver Demaryius, and the Broncos ground-game has primarily gone through running backs Montee Ball and Knowshon Moreno. Although the Broncos were known as a top flight defensive team when Manning joined, there's been some drop-off this regular season, much of it due to injuries to their biggest talents, most notably linebacker Von Miller. Cornerback Champ Bailey is the biggest name still active on defense, filling in the apparently legally required \"on-his-last-legs defensive Hall of Famer looking to end his career with a Super Bowl\". None of Denver's defense made the Pro Bowl, which might just be because the Denver Broncos offense aren't ever off the field long enough to give them much work to do. Oh, and just to touch on special teams, they do have a really good kicker in Matt Prater, who this season was responsible for a 64-yard field goal, the longest in NFL history. Before anyone laughs at the idea of kicker being a crucial part of a team's victory, a Mr Vinateiri would respectfully disagree with you. Biggest celebrity fan Trey Parker and Matt Stone maybe? Why you should root for them You hate Tom Brady and Ben Roethilsberger and can't stand them both having more rings than Peyton. You have a soft spot for Joe Walsh's \"Rocky Mountain Way\". You relish in the possibility of seeing the Broncos celebrate right in front of a broken Richard Sherman. Because Denver Broncos head coach John Fox had heart surgery just three months ago and now he's coaching in the Super Bowl and how badass is that? You're Eli Manning (publicly). Why you shouldn't root for them Because maybe you hope and pray that the non-stop Peyton Manning coverage will come to an end. Was SI Sportsman of the Year not enough? You still haven't gotten over how annoying that whole Tim Tebow thing was. It would make a good topic for another South Park episode. You're Aaron Rodgers' agent, and you refuse to sign your client to another one of those Discount Double Check ads, and you're already running out of commercial opportunities that Manning hasn't seized yet. You're Eli Manning (secretly). Halftime! Breaking for general Super Bowl questions Wait Met Life Stadium is in New Jersey, but the New York Giants play there? It could be worse. If they were an MLB team they would be the New York Giants of New Jersey of Anaheim. Why do NFL fans think football is better played in the cold? Because NFL fans enjoy watching NFL players suffer, probably because they imagine that it's the people who used to bully them at school down there, hurting and freezing. At this point in their decline should the Red Hot Chili Peppers be ashamed at playing with Bruno Mars during the Halftime Show? Or should Mars be embarrassed to be playing with the RHCP? The FCC thought Janet Jackson's nipple was offensive, but have no plans to shut this down? Seattle Seahawks Who they are The Seattle Seahawks franchise began in 1976 as an expansion team, at the same time as the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and are the only team that has existed in both the AFC and the NFC (it made the switch to the NFC in 2002 after divisional realignment). This year marks their second Super Bowl appearance in franchise history, having previously lost to the Pittsburgh Steelers 21-10 in Super Bowl XL in 2006. (Rumor has it that Super Bowls were initially created by the NFL and promoted by the media in an attempt to appease the secret cabal of Roman Numeral Fetishists that run America, this is also the reason most movie sequels exist). Believe it or not, this Seahawks team built around \"The View\" co-host Elisabeth Hasselbeck's brother-in-law and running back \"Sweet\" Shaun Alexander (and his instantly regrettable theme song) never made it back to the Super Bowl. After missing the playoffs entirely in back-to-back seasons, the Seahawks hired Pete Carroll of the University of South California as head coach in 2010. The hire seemed to provoke a cultural shift as his leadership propelled the Seahawks to a 7-9 record. Okay that sounded sarcastic, but 7-9 was good for first place in the NFC West and home-field advantage in their first playoff game thanks to the Carroll's brilliant strategy of \"being in a division so bad that we can make the playoffs with a losing record\". The Seahawks beat the New Orleans Saints that NFL post-season but went on to lose to the Chicago Bears; but that year's success ended up being the foundation for the next great Seahawks team. The turning point came when Seattle found its franchise quarterback. No, not Tarvaris Jackson. No, the Seattle Seahawks fortunes changed in the 2012 Draft where they discovered Russell Wilson. Although not one of the most highly regarded quarterback prospects of his class, the Seahawks liked Wilson enough to tag him as their starting quarterback despite the fact that they handed a lot of money to the once-and-future Green Bay Packer backup Matt Flynn. It was the right decision as with Wilson the Seahawks actually won the NFC West by actually winning games and not just by sucking the least, ending the season with a respectable 11-5 record. In the playoffs they defeated Washington 24-14 before losing to the Atlanta Falcons 30-28 in maybe the best, certainly the most frantic, game of last year's NFL Playoffs. How did they get here? They were really good at football this year. Wait, that's probably not the most helpful of explanations is it? Following last year's memorable regular season but disappointing playoff run, the Seattle Seahawks improved during Wilson's sophomore campaign. The best team in the NFC, the Seahawks clinched the NFC West by going 13-3, earning themselves a first round bye as well as home field advantage in every game until Sunday, which will be played on the theoretically neutral and almost certainly cold MetLife Stadium in New Jersey. The Seattle Seahawks started their post-season run by beating Drew Brees and the New Orleans Saints 23-15. In the NFC Championship Game, Seattle pulled off a 23-17 defeat over the San Francisco 49ers, denying them a return trip to the Super Bowl. In what was one of the most exciting games of the season, Richard Sherman helped intercept a would-be Colin Kaepernick touchdown pass to seal the victory for Seattle. Richard Sherman, why does that name sounds familiar? If would probably be because of this. Who's the quarterback? That would be Russell Wilson who is just in his second season in pro football. In the 2012 draft, where Indianapolis took Andrew Luck with the first overall pick and Washington traded all the draft picks in the universe to get Robert Griffin III as the second over-all pick, the Seahawks took the University of Wisconsin quarterback in the draft's third round with the 75th pick. While the future for all three of these quarterbacks looks bright, Wilson has had the best career so far, one more win on Sunday wouldn't hurt his reputation. How they play The Seahawks essentially do everything really well, which annoys writers because it's much easier to write about Peyton Manning throwing touchdowns or Adrian Peterson destroying run defenses than a team that just executes everything well. While Denver have the best offense in the league, many measurements show that Seattle could very well lay claim to the league's top defense. Would you argue with a bunch of guys who call themselves the Legion of Boom? One quirk they do have is they have the loudest fans in football. No, really they tested for it. Twice. Bringing back the Guinness Book of World Records people after the Kansas City Chiefs attempted to steal away the record. That, however, won't be much of a factor since the Super Bowl will be taking place in New Jersey and, since it is the Super Bowl, the people who can afford to attend aren't really the loud, boisterous types. Seahawks that aren't Russell Wilson you should know We've mentioned Richard Sherman yes? Just making sure, because you're gonna hear a lot about the cornerback's post-NFC Championship Game interview with sideline reporter Erin Andrews. In what must be one of the most ridiculously overblown \"controversies\" over the last few years, it's apparently now shocking that an athlete coming off the field in the biggest win of his life engaged in, gasp, trash talk. He's one of three defensive players on the 2013-14 Seattle Seahawks named to the Pro Bowl along with strong safety Kam Chancellor and free safety Earl Thomas. Sherman, Chancellor and Thomas also make up the Legion of Boom with suspended cornerback Brandon Browner, which proves at least that they've already won the \"best nickname\" battle against the Broncos. On offense, the Seahawks' best player might be Skittles-loving running back Marshawn Lynch, who may or may not leave earthquakes in his wake. Their biggest name in their wide receiving core most likely would be Percy Harvin, who has mostly been absent and injured for Seattle (along with Sidney Rice, who won't be suiting up on Sunday). No matter, less-celebrated players like Golden Tate, Douglas Baldwin and Jermaine Kearse have all had their moments in the playoffs. Biggest celebrity fan Oh god, it's probably Macklemore isn't it? (If you happen to really, really hate your ears: here's the Seahawks version of \"Thrift Store\". This is somehow worse than the Macklemore original, which feels like it should be impossible, like recording a temperature lower than absolute zero.) Why should you root for them Because Seattle needs this. The Seattle Mariners have never won a World Series despite having two of the game's all-time greatest hitters at one point or another (Ken Griffey Jr and Alex Rodriguez, although nobody there is missing the latter these days). Forget winning a World Series, right now they're just hoping to be consistently mediocre. At least they still exist, something which can't be said about their former NBA franchise the Seattle SuperSonics which was moved by its owners to Oklahoma City shortly after they landed Kevin \"The Best Basketball Player Who Isn't Named LeBron\" Durant in the draft. Why you should not root for them You're not a fan of Richard Sherman's antics. You remember when Pete Carroll coached your pro team. Their obsession with having the loudest outdoor stadium in sports has led them to feud with the Kansas City Chiefs in what might be the most stupid reason for a rivalry in American sports history. You have heard \"Loud Love\", by Seattle's own Soundgarden and thus rightfully wish nothing but misery upon the city that spawned it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk/2012/dec/05/osborne-autumn-statement-same-labour","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2012-12-05T18:50:35Z","webTitle":"Osborne's autumn statement: more of the same, but little new from Labour","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/dec/05/osborne-autumn-statement-same-labour","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2012/dec/05/osborne-autumn-statement-same-labour","fields":{"headline":"Osborne's autumn statement: more of the same, but little new from Labour","bodyText":"Tory MPs have a bounce in their step this afternoon. Like most people they will take days to absorb the small print of George Osborne's 2012 autumn statement on the economy. But they know that the markets responded calmly and are telling each other that Britain's cherished triple AAA credit rating is safe for now. But the subdued Labour MPs' response was more telling. \"He's got away with it again,\" muttered one. That impression must have been reinforced by Ed Balls's weak performance in responding to the chancellor's statement, choosing to rage unconvincingly against Osborne's \"unfair, incompetent and totally out of touch\" performance when thoughtful subtlety might have served better to prise open the coalition's simmering divisions. \"Britain on the right track,\" is stretching things a bit. Osborne's public persona is confident – public optimism the only effective option for a finance minister – bordering on smug. Many of his numbers, most obviously those massaged debt and deficit figures, will not all survive robust scrutiny, they rarely do. Those 4G phone sale receipts are under heavy scrutiny. But he has left his critics with few new targets other than to say – yet again – that the poor are being hurt hardest, which is hardly news. Instead the dominant Tory press will be able to focus on the cancelled increase in fuel duty, the tweak on unpopular foreign aid, the modest gestures on basic rate income tax thresholds (which this time the better-off will share) and corporation tax, the attack – if that is what it proves to be – on the tax-avoiding classes. Capital allowances, regional growth grants, a boost for shale gas exploitation, but also for nuclear power, there's a bit for all sorts of interests, carved out of a tax-neutral (increases offset by cuts) package in grim economic times. Osborne's \"three-year benefit squeeze\" – a below inflation 1% increase for all but pensions – is already generating headlines. Test a statement by the reaction. The rightwing lobbies, the Institute of Directors, the Taxpayers' Alliance, are broadly welcoming of the statement, though Iain Duncan Smith's Centre for Social Justice complains that better off pensioners have again been protected from the squeeze – as they have and, says the CSJ, should not be when others are suffering: Ed Miliband's \"squeezed middle\" and what one Westminster colleague calls \"the pinched bottom\". The poverty lobby and left-leaning analysts are more critical, as we would all expect. But Osborne's latest verdict, a further retreat from his austerity-to-rapid-recovery promises of 2012, represents the \"new normal\". Not much here for the \"strivers\", whose good will and ambitions the chancellor seeks to harness. But strivers may have a more grimly realistic view of Britain's plight than ministers dare admit. A return to growth is still promised but it is as far away as ever. Osborne blames externalities – the flagging eurozone, the cost of food, fuel and raw materials from abroad, the Labour legacy (still) and bigger-than-realised bankers' crash – while Ed Balls blames the coalition's excessive squeeze since 2010. Both are right up to a point, but the reality of Britain's situation is that in 2012, neither has as much freedom of manoeuvre to change the economic weather as they would have us believe. Balls's intervention-and-borrowing led remedies would marginally improve recovery in the short term, albeit at the price of creating problems elsewhere – not least in the money markets, which might take fright. If Osborne's austerity squeezes all hope of resumed growth, the dizzy markets will panic and desert him anyway. It may happen in 2013. The chancellor talked a big game – again – about extra infrastructure spending to boost demand, but we have heard it before and the private sector is still sitting on its cheque book. The public sector – in the shape of Whitehall departments and town halls – is being further squeezed. Where do they think demand will come from? Meanwhile Labour is trapped as the German social democrats are trapped ahead of their coming election, critical of the government but unable to say much that is both different and persuasive. It is all very well to wish that a bold Rooseveltian figure – \"nothing to fear, but fear itself\" – were on hand with Keynesian remedies, confidently applied, to bind up our ills. But none is visible in Britain, Germany, France or the US for that matter. And the world has changed to our disadvantage. The new normal is grimmer, greyer, but the great smog of 1962 – 60 years ago – enveloped parts of a Britain that was much poorer than it in 2012, even after four years of retreat. What is missing is hope."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theguardian/2013/may/31/guardian-profile-deborah-turness-itv-nbc-news","type":"article","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webPublicationDate":"2013-05-31T15:27:53Z","webTitle":"The Guardian profile: Deborah Turness","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/may/31/guardian-profile-deborah-turness-itv-nbc-news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/2013/may/31/guardian-profile-deborah-turness-itv-nbc-news","fields":{"headline":"Deborah Turness: Maverick television news executive takes on New York","bodyText":"Not many television executives get their kicks away from the glare of the studio lights by going rally driving. But Deborah Turness, who once competed in the 33-day Paris to Peking off-road rally, is no ordinary industry suit. The first female editor of a network TV news operation in the UK when she was put in charge of ITV News nearly a decade ago, Turness has just repeated the feat in the US where she was confirmed last month as the new president of NBC News. \"She has such energy and passion that you knew Deborah was in the room even if you couldn't see her. Her presence was so overwhelming,\" remembers former ITV News editor-in-chief David Mannion, who hired her to rejuvenate the channel's news bulletins. The only journalist invited to the Buckingham Palace state banquet for President Barack Obama, Turness earned the nickname \"Mad Dog\", a reflection of her capacity for ideas (\"Out of every 10, nine will be crazy and one will be genius,\" says a colleague) and prodigious work rate – she only sleeps five hours a night. It is a maverick streak that can perhaps be traced back to her convent school days where, legend has it, she was expelled aged 13 after nuns caught her kissing boys in the grounds. \"She doesn't give up until she gets what she wants,\" says Mannion. \"If someone made 99 phone calls to get something, she would make 100. That's how she works. We put the wind up the BBC and others because she is such a terrific asset.\" After taking charge of ITN-produced ITV News in 2004, Turness put News at Ten back on the map following years in the wilderness with a string of award-winning scoops – the video of the arrest of the failed London bombers in 2005, the leaked report on the shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes, and the first engagement interview with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. \"You could plug Deborah into the national grid and shut down a couple of nuclear power plants, she is easily the most energetic and enthusiastic producer I've ever worked with,\" says ITN Productions editorial director Chris Shaw, who worked closely with her on Channel 5 News. The mother of two young children – she is married to John Toker, the former ITN producer and government communications directorwho handled the PR for last year's Leveson inquiry – the family will relocate to New York in the summer. Turness, 46, is the latest in a succession of British media executives to swap London for New York, including former BBC director general Mark Thompson, now chief executive of the New York Times company, and Jon Williams, the former BBC world news editor who is now foreign editor of ABC News. She will also go head to head with another ITV export, James Goldston, who has been credited with rejuvenating ABC's Good Morning America, which has eclipsed NBC's Today from its longstanding position at number one in the breakfast ratings war. Chris Cramer, a former senior BBC executive who left in the 1990s to run CNN's international operations, remembers the advice he was given at the time by the news network's founder, Ted Turner: \"He said that an English accent gave you a very large IQ mark-up. But it didn't last very long.\" The challenge at NBC will be a rather different one to ITV, with ratings under pressure and the network still suffering the fallout from a $30bn takeover by media and technology giant Comcast two years ago. \"It's a much more febrile world [than the UK]: ratings are everything,\" warns Stephen Claypole, a former BBC news executive who went on to senior roles at news agencies Reuters and Associated Press. \"It is much more driven by the bottom line than anything in the UK and is intensely political. American network [news] presidents come under enormous pressure from the Republican right, with quite a bit of sniping from the general direction of Fox News. \"It's a remarkable appointment,\" adds Claypole. \"The American networks have been rather more backward in advancing and promoting women, so it's also a very welcome one.\" Turness's TV career began in unlikely surroundings – the kitchen of ITN's Paris-based producer, Barbara Gray. After spending a year in France for her degree, she took a postgraduate radio and journalism course at Bordeaux university in 1988 and telephoned Gray asking for work experience. \"I explained that the Paris bureau had been closed down and she would have to work in my kitchen, but she was pretty cool about that,\" says Gray. \"It was obvious to me after two stories that she was definitely a news person. She had the gift of the gab and was able to convince prospective interviewees that they were on to a good thing.\" In Paris, Turness also produced reports for Jon Snow, now anchor of Channel 4 News, but failed to make the shortlist for the ITN training scheme despite landing an exclusive interview with then French prime minister Jacques Chirac, which made the lead story on the News at Ten. Turness has described herself as \"broken-hearted\". Snow recalls her as \"truly exceptional from the very outset. Original, imaginative, inexhaustible and right on top of the story. Could I have imagined she would ever become president of NBC News? Not exactly, but I'm absolutely not surprised. She's a star, and ITV News is as good as it is because of her.\" Turness went on to freelance for ITN, ending up as Washington producer, where she covered the Oklahoma bombing, the Atlanta Olympics and the invasion of Haiti. She also covered Bill Clinton's first term in office and later, when she returned to London to help launch Channel 5 News, would sign up Monica Lewinsky as a reporter. She was a key member of the ITN team responsible for dispensing with the newsreader's chair, presenter Kirsty Young famously \"perching\" on the desk. But Turness also spent six months as editor of Channel 4's short-lived and largely disastrous Big Breakfast replacement, RI:SE. Turness has pointed out that she was \"second editor… not the one who devised the initial plan\" for the show. She left after six months. \"I missed news horribly … I had to make myself read Heat magazine every week.\" Her return to ITN, with a brief to relaunch ITV's bulletins, proved more fruitful. \"They had become very turgid, very predictable, very formulaic,\" she said in 2004. Under Turness, they regained their confidence and sense of purpose and a string of Bafta and Royal Television Society awards – despite working on a fraction of the BBC's budget – although News at Ten is still beaten in the ratings by BBC1's flagship 10pm bulletin. \"She ripped up the rule book,\" says ITV News presenter Mark Austin. \"She has a real knack for connecting with viewers and a great one for taking an idea and expanding it and stretching it until she has made absolutely the most of it.\" Austin was once sent to anchor the programme from the Antarctic, from where he interviewed then prime minister Tony Blair via satellite in Downing Street about global warming. \"It was unusual and bold and typical Turness,\" he says. \"If NBC is looking for someone to shake the place up, she will do that. They won't know what's hit them, but they will probably like it when it does.\" One colleague describes her as a \"bit of an unguided missile. Her enthusiasm could get the better of her\", while another says: \"She's not everybody's cup of tea. She's very radical and out there and questions stuff and sometimes you will bring in an exclusive and she'll ask where are we taking it next.\" Nigel Baker, news editor at ITN when Turness did her first shift in London, recalls: \"It was clear from the beginning that she had the determination and energy to succeed. I learned many years later she had actually been ill but never mentioned it and never let it show.\" At ITV Turness had a staff of fewer than 300; at NBC it will be 800. \"It's really a transition from driving a powerful speedboat to being the captain of a supertanker,\" says Baker, who went on to become a vice president at Associated Press. \"There will be a cultural change as well. American journalists are very different to their British counterparts. British journalists take the job seriously but tend not to take themselves too seriously. American journalists do both.\" Turness, who takes up her new role on 5 August, generates admiration and affection in equal measure. \"She's a force of nature,\" says Adrian Monck, who was part of the launch team of 5 News. Anyone who saw her performance as Lady Gaga at the Guardian Edinburgh International Television Festival in 2010 will attest to that. And there are no shortage of good wishes. \"Deborah epitomises everything that is best about ITN,\" says ITN chief executive John Hardie. \"She's inspired our newsrooms for the past 24 years with her ideas, energy and enthusiasm. She leaves to make history yet again in one of the biggest jobs in TV news. New York had better be ready for her.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/jun/14/green-news-roundup","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-06-14T11:06:57Z","webTitle":"Green news roundup: Rio+20, summer rain and fishing discards","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jun/14/green-news-roundup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/jun/14/green-news-roundup","fields":{"headline":"Green news roundup: Rio+20, summer rain and fishing discards","bodyText":"Environment news • Rio+20 Earth summit: scientists call for action on population • GM crops good for environment, study finds • Fishing discards practice thrown overboard by EU • Japanese mayor approves plan to restart nuclear power plant • End of hosepipe ban to benefit 15 million people • Australia creates world's largest marine reserve network On the blogs • Why climate change needs higher energy bills • MPs to investigate the economics of wind power • America's love affair with the motor car is running on empty • The upsides of cycling in summer rain Multimedia • Rio+20 Earth summit: Amazon deforestation – in pictures • Treasured green spaces - your Green shoots photographs • Species and habitats found in recommended marine conservation zones – in pictures • Satellite eye on Earth: May 2012 Features and comment • Coal's resurgence undermines fight against global warming • Climate change protest website reported to police • John Gummer: Why Rio failed in the past and how it can succeed this time • Brazil's blueprint for reforestation Best of the web • Sharp relocating solar HQ from Germany to UK • 'The problem for coal right now is entirely economic' – EPA's Lisa Jackson • Green Party leader hopefuls launch bids For more of the best environment comment and news from around the web, visit the Guardian Environment Network. ...And finally • Alfredo Sirkis – the former bank robber with his sights set on Rio+20 His criminal past may be gone, but the revolutionary spirit of Sirkis lives on to attack complacency at the Rio Earth summit"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2012/oct/07/risk-intelligence-dylan-evans-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2012-10-06T23:03:02Z","webTitle":"Risk Intelligence by Dylan Evans – review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/oct/07/risk-intelligence-dylan-evans-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2012/oct/07/risk-intelligence-dylan-evans-review","fields":{"headline":"Risk Intelligence by Dylan Evans – review","bodyText":"\"I wish I could be half as sure of anything as some people are of everything,\" said the American humorist Gerald Barzan, which neatly summarises the motivation for this uneven but stimulating book. Dylan Evans thinks – rightly – that most of us are bad at thinking about, let alone managing, risk. The way he puts it is that different people display different degrees of \"risk intelligence\", defined as \"the ability to estimate probabilities accurately\". At the heart of risk intelligence is the ability to gauge the limits of one's own knowledge – \"to be cautious when you don't know much, and to be confident when, by contrast, you know a lot\". And to have a rational strategy for obtaining relevant knowledge when you don't know much. Most of us aren't good at this. Consider an everyday scenario: you're buying a big flat-screen TV. The salesperson asks if you are interested in purchasing a three-year extended warranty. Most of us hum and haw and wonder what commission the salesperson is getting, whereas in fact we should be considering the price of the TV, the cost of the warranty and the probability that the TV will fail within four years – all data available to anyone prepared to do a spot of Googling. It's possible that the extended warranty is actually a good deal but most of those who buy it will do so mainly on the basis of a vague hunch that it makes sense. And it's not just lay people who are bad at assessing probabilities. Medical students aren't too hot at it either. Evans cites a question he's posed to hundreds of them. Suppose you are tested for HIV and the test comes back positive. What is the chance that you have the condition? Most people think they must be pretty high. Only a few reply, correctly, that you need more information to work out a sensible answer. You need to know how good the test is, and how many people like you have the condition in question. And you need to know about Bayes's theorem, which calculates how much stronger (or weaker) beliefs should become when new information is taken into account. (Evans's answer to the question is 4%, by the way.) Many years ago the psychologist Howard Gardner attacked the absurdity of measuring human intelligence on a single dimension. He identified eight different kinds of intelligence. Later, another psychologist, Daniel Goleman, added a ninth: emotional intelligence. Evans argues that we should now add a 10th: risk intelligence. Low risk intelligence is an endemic problem in most societies. Signs of it are everywhere: in the \"paranoid parenting\" that prevents us from allowing our children to live normal lives; in the irrational fear of crime that blights the lives of Daily Mail readers; in the inability of our media to communicate accurately about uncertainty, which they interpret as \"increased certainty that things are going to get worse\"; in the worst-case scenarios that lead to the security theatre on display at airports; and in the general need for \"closure\" about troubling events that leads us to think any answer is preferable to none. What's worse is that our society is irredeemably favourable to low risk intelligence. People who are confident and articulate tend to be admired while those who are more probabilistically informed are devalued. And this matters because our inability to handle risk leads to hysterical debates and makes rational policy-making on nuclear power, policing, immigration, terrorism or GM crops impossible. In relation to risk, stupidity seems to be humanity's default option."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2012/nov/16/osborne-industrial-olympics","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2012-11-16T00:05:01Z","webTitle":"Osborne must fire starting gun for 'industrial Olympics' – CBI chief","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/nov/16/osborne-industrial-olympics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2012/nov/16/osborne-industrial-olympics","fields":{"headline":"Osborne must fire starting gun for 'industrial Olympics' – CBI chief","bodyText":"The head of Britain's leading employers' organisation is urging George Osborne to turn a handful of beacon infrastructure projects into \"industrial Olympics\" as part of a strategy to speed up growth. Admitting frustration at the slow pace of progress on big public investment programmes, John Cridland, the director-general of the CBI, said the chancellor should fast-track three or four \"symbolic\" schemes in next month's autumn statement and use the construction of venues for the 2012 London Games as a template. Big cuts in capital spending were announced when the coalition came to power in 2010 but the CBI is pressing the government to rethink its infrastructure plan. Cridland said Britain needed a twin-track growth and deficit reduction approach, adding: \"We need a blueprint for delivery. There has been a lack of momentum. What is needed is for the government to fast-track three or four industrial Olympics and ensure that they are on time, on spec and fit for purpose.\" The CBI director-general said the A14 toll road, the Northern hub rail network, the Thames Tideway sewage tunnel and a new nuclear power station would all be suitable projects, and said the chancellor should conjure up the spirit of US president John F Kennedy. \"Kennedy said at the start of the 60s that America would put a man on the moon by the end of the decade and it did, even though sadly Kennedy was not around to see it. We need the sense that we are just going to do these projects.\" Cridland said Whitehall's failure to organise the new franchise for the West Coast mainline had been a blow to business confidence but said the Olympics had been an example of a successful public-private partnership and \"British project planning at its best\". He contrasted the single-minded approach to completing the work on the venues for the Games with the \"drift\" on the A14 toll road in eastern England, which was mothballed in 2010. Deadlines were too often \"flexible or elastic\". Speaking ahead of the CBI's annual conference next week, Cridland said Osborne should spend £1.5bn on a range of pro-business measures, and warned the chancellor against increasing the severity of the coalition's austerity programme. \"The autumn statement is not about writing cheques to members of the CBI but there is room for a targeted, modest and prudent intervention.\" The CBI director-general said Whitehall departments had underspent their budgets by £7bn-£8bn and urged the chancellor to use some of the money to help the economy recover from its double-dip recession. He said the chancellor should use the £1.5bn on repairing potholes this winter, providing incentives for households to take up the Green Deal energy efficiency programme, handing small companies more generous investment allowances, abolishing stamp duty for shares in small and developing firms trading on the Alternative Investment Market, direct payments to exporters, a smaller rise than planned in uniform business rate and capital allowances for infrastructure projects. Cridland said the chancellor should resist pressure to make deeper cuts, even if the independent Office for Budget Responsibility says next month that the government will miss its 2015-16 target for reducing the national debt as a share of GDP. \"My core message is that we have already got an extra two years of austerity beyond this parliament that is pre-cooked,\" he said. \"We are not looking for more austerity than has been planned. The markets expect the government to stick to the plan and so do I.\" He added: \"Business is saying: deliver the plan. Do not take your foot off the pedal but don't let arbitrary targets make you do more than you are committed to.\" CBI members, Cridland said, were worried about growing anti-European sentiment in the UK. \"The debate is worrying. Business is clear what it wants. It needs access to a single market of 500 million citizens and the ability to trade without borders.\" He added that there was a danger the UK could end up like Norway, forced to accept decisions made in Brussels but without any say in how they were made. \"It is hard to contemplate a successful rebalancing of the economy if we are marginalised inside the single market.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2012/oct/05/the-plane-crash-tv-od","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2012-10-05T12:00:00Z","webTitle":"TV OD with Sam Richards: The Plane Crash","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/oct/05/the-plane-crash-tv-od","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2012/oct/05/the-plane-crash-tv-od","fields":{"headline":"TV OD with Sam Richards: The Plane Crash","bodyText":"When Andrew 'Freddie' Flintoff, dishevelled star of England's 2005 Ashes victory celebrations, recently announced his intention to become a heavyweight boxer for Sky1's The Gloves Are Off, the stunt was branded \"car-crash television\" by promoter Frank Warren. He was calling on a phrase that's come to mean any kind of compellingly awful TV spectacle – Freddie Flintoff Goes Wild, for instance, or those Morrisons adverts starring Freddie Flintoff – although Warren probably meant it more straightforwardly: watching Flintoff get pummelled in the face by a vastly superior opponent will be like rubbernecking a grisly automobile wreck. Literal car-crash TV already exists in the form of Pick TV's Road Wars, although personally I prefer the bits between the crashes, where two laconic traffic cops pootle around Slough handing out fixed penalty notices to surly boyracers and telling them to \"get those tinted windows sorted.\" Now Channel 4 has gone one better by inventing plane-crash TV. For the purposes of The Plane Crash (Thursday, 9pm, Channel 4), it's bought an old Boeing 727 passenger jet and crashed it into the Mexican desert to see what happens. When the focus is on the \"how\" rather than the \"why\", Plane Crash is giddily thrilling. Any fool can total a car, but it takes four years of meticulous planning by a team of aeronautical experts and elite former test pilots to crash a passenger plane without so much as a mini pretzel getting lodged in someone's eye. Enter a team of twinkly-eyed Top Gun archetypes called things like Chip and Jimbob, who are remarkably unfazed by the idea of parachuting out of a remote-controlled jumbo jet as it hurtles towards its doom at 150mph. It's like an edition of Brainiac: Science Abuse produced by Jerry Bruckheimer. But when the moment of impact arrives, with images of last month's Nepal air disaster fresh in the mind, it's an eerie rather than spectacular sight. This is not Richard Hammond blowing up a shed; mercifully, there are no high fives. As the air crash investigators move in, the whole tenor of the programme changes. Obviously, you can't write off 95 tonnes of liveried aluminium, putting the entire fire service of Baja California on standby, just for kicks. Plane Crash is also a serious experiment in airline safety, purporting to answer once and for all the question of whether to brace or not to brace. In lieu of passengers, the plane has been filled with state-of-the-art crash test dummies, whose death-plunge is captured by on-board cameras and then replayed over and over from multiple angles in slo-mo, to the point where it's not difficult to infer what would happen to them were they made of flesh and bone. These images are evidently useful to aeroplane designers, but throw in a few awkward interviews with traumatised crash survivors and it begins to to veer uncomfortably close to disaster porn. What next? The deliberate sinking of a cross-channel ferry in order to ascertain if anyone really understands what a \"muster point\" is? The destruction of a nuclear power plant and subsequent cordoning off of an entire former Soviet state for the next 50 years, just to see how much radiation an ecosystem can take? I'd probably watch it. But only if punctuated, as on Road Wars, by amusingly drawn-out footage of a confused van driver repeatedly failing to provide an adequate breath sample."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2010/sep/21/chris-huhne-nuclear-power-stations","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2010-09-21T14:27:30Z","webTitle":"Chris Huhne urges Liberal Democrats to back new nuclear power stations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/sep/21/chris-huhne-nuclear-power-stations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2010/sep/21/chris-huhne-nuclear-power-stations","fields":{"headline":"Chris Huhne urges Liberal Democrats to back new nuclear power stations","bodyText":"Chris Huhne, the Liberal Democrat energy and climate secretary, today urged his party to back new nuclear power stations as part of the \"give and take\" of being in government with the Conservatives. Huhne used a keynote speech to tell delegates that almost 250,000 jobs in green industries would be created as part of the government's \"green deal\" which would help offset the economic \"drag anchor\" of budget cuts. Huhne highlighted the proposals as he became the latest senior figure to urge the party to accept less palatable policies in the coalition agreement. Yesterday, Nick Clegg, the Lib Dem leader and deputy prime minister, urged party members to \"hold their nerve\" and stick with the coalition deal during the difficult period ahead. A key policy area in the partnership deal likely to arouse strong feeling involves plans to allow the building of nuclear power stations – a policy to which the Lib Dems, and Huhne himself, have long been opposed. In recognition of the party's stance, the coalition deal stipulates that Lib Dem ministers would be free to maintain their opposition to nuclear plant construction as one of several opt-outs agreed by the parties on policy areas that are seen as red-line issues within their own camps. But Huhne told delegates at their party conference in Liverpool that \"a deal is a deal\". \"I expect George Osborne [the chancellor] to take more millions of the low-paid out of income tax even though he is a Conservative minister implementing a Liberal Democrat pledge. \"And George Osborne expects me to deliver our agreement on nuclear power, which is that there is an important place for new nuclear stations in our energy mix as long as there is no public subsidy. A deal is a deal, and I will deliver.\" Three years ago Huhne, then shadow energy spokesmen, urged ministers to stop the \"side-show\" of new nuclear power stations. \"Nuclear is a tried, tested and failed technology and the government must stop putting time, effort and subsidies into reviving this outdated industry. The nuclear industry's key skill over the past half-century has not been generating electricity, but extracting lashings of taxpayers' money.\" Aides to Huhne insist his opposition was based on the subsidies to the nuclear industry. Today, the energy secretary said nuclear was now a \"mature technology, not an infant needing nurture\" as he emphasised that government plans to wave through construction would be done without subsidies from the state. \"I'm fed up with the stand-off between renewable and nuclear which means we have neither – we will have both. We will have low-carbon energy and security of supply.\" He told delegates the government's \"green deal\", which is due to be presented in legislation in late autumn, would present a \"green revolution\" for the country. He said his department was pioneering ways of turning this government into the \"greenest ever\" with thousands of green jobs being created as part of the drive to improve insulation in homes across the country. Under the policy, companies will pay upfront to insulate homes, with householders paying back from the energy savings that will result. Huhne promised it would mean a \"revolution\" and was \"the most ambitious energy-saving plan ever put forward\". He expected the energy efficiency sector to employ 246,000 people in installation and supply-chain roles by 2030, he told delegates. \"Under the green deal consumers will save energy and save money. But the green deal could also create a whole new industry that will help offset the drag anchor of the budget squeeze. Not just the 26,000 people working in insulation now, but up to 250,000 jobs in every part of the country, working on 26 million homes. And going into commercial premises too, so that small businesses also save money.\" As part of the switch to low-carbon energy, Huhne backed the construction of giant wind farms around the coast of Britain. A new wind farm at Gwynt y Mor off the north Wales coast will have the potential to power a third of Welsh homes, he said. \"I want to see this again and again round Britain's coasts.\" Huhne also announced a new \"government-wide carbon plan\" setting out policies and deadlines for each department to \"ensure real action on climate change\"."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theobserver/2011/mar/27/big-issue-nuclear-power-fukushima","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-27T00:04:14Z","webTitle":"Our green energy potential is huge, but gets little support | The big issue","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2011/mar/27/big-issue-nuclear-power-fukushima","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/2011/mar/27/big-issue-nuclear-power-fukushima","fields":{"headline":"Our green energy potential is huge, but gets little support","bodyText":"The crisis surrounding the nuclear power plant in Japan has rightly raised questions about UK plans to invest in new reactors (\"Fukushima shows the danger of relying on nuclear\", Leader). Nuclear power is a gamble we don't need to take. Studies show that the UK can meet its energy needs and tackle climate change without resorting to nuclear power or burning fossil fuels – all that is lacking is the political will. Over the years, the nuclear industry has survived on massive subsidies from UK taxpayers while cleaner forms of energy have been starved of cash. If the government goes ahead with its plans to build new reactors this pattern will be repeated again. No nuclear power plant has ever been built without state funding and ministers are already planning ways to pump more money into the industry, despite promising not to. The UK's green energy potential is enormous but the investment and political support it receives is minute. It's a similar picture with energy efficiency. People waste millions of pounds every year on heat that escapes through their walls and roofs. Our recent opinion poll revealed that more people support investment in energy efficiency and renewable energy than nuclear. It's time to abandon the nuclear and fossil fuel dinosaurs and build a clean, safe future for us all. Mike Childs Head of energy Friends of the Earth London N1 Fukushima is a very serious nuclear incident. It was caused by an earthquake and subsequent tsunami of unprecedented scale and ferocity. The seismic conditions in Japan and the UK are very different and the circumstances that caused this incident would not occur here. But the UK government's approach, to establish the facts, learn the lessons, and apply them to the UK's situation and conditions, is the correct course of action. We will not be complacent. But it must be remembered too that the UK government's approach is aimed at securing our future supplies of low-carbon energy. Both the UK government and the industry are clear that new nuclear build will go ahead in the UK to secure our long-term environmental and security of supply needs into the future. Keith Parker Chief executive at the Nuclear Industry Association, London SW1 The government is right to initiate an independent and comprehensive report by Dr Mike Weightman, the UK chief nuclear inspector, to assess the implications of events at Fukushima for existing and new nuclear plants in the UK. The report will be put in the public domain, helping to ensure that lessons to be learned are implemented appropriately. This should be put in the context that the greatest threat to the planet is climate change. The energy white paper committed the UK to a safe and secure energy supply alongside an ambitious but necessary 80% reduction in carbon emissions by 2050. Nuclear power is identified as part of the solution, alongside energy efficiencies, renewable energy and carbon capture and storage. The modern nuclear reactors are designed with \"passive\" safety and multiple design features that do not require manual intervention in the event of extreme events. It would be wrong to formulate a knee-jerk opinion that everything labelled nuclear is inappropriate. Professor Andrew H Sherry Director, Dalton Nuclear Institute University of Manchester There is no credible alternative to an expansion of nuclear power to heat our homes, offices and factories and to keep us moving as the oil runs out. Renewables such as wind power and biofuels will not solve the problem of low-carbon power. Germany has virtually run out of space to add to the more than 17,000 wind turbines already in service while Britain and Denmark are experiencing the same problem.

Internal emails seen by the Guardian reveal that the NDA regards the reactor technology as immature and commercially unproven. It would also create large amounts of plutonium-contaminated waste and increase the risk of terrorists acquiring nuclear weapons, the NDA says. The reactor plan was announced by General Electric (GE) Hitachi in November as a way of converting the UK's 82-tonne stockpile of plutonium at Sellafield into power. Known as \"Prism\" (Power Reactor Innovative Small Modular), it is a new design of sodium-cooled fast reactor that is fuelled by plutonium. In an email to GE on 29 November 2011, the NDA's strategy and technology director, Adrian Simper, said that the two organisations \"have struggled to reach a clear agreement on the work necessary to demonstrate credibility, without which neither NDA nor government can consider Prism further in the development of our strategy.\" In a draft response to GE prepared for the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc), the NDA said it had carried out a \"high-level assessment\" of Prism. The technology was \"still to be demonstrated commercially\", it concluded, and \"the technology maturity for the fuel, reactor and recycling plant are considered to all be low\". One drawback with Prism, according to the NDA, was that it would be fuelled by plutonium metal, rather than the oxide form in which UK plutonium is currently stored. Converting the oxide to metal would result in \"a likely large amount of plutonium contaminated salt waste requiring management\". Plutonium metal is also thought to be easier to make into bombs. \"This would introduce more security/proliferation risk,\" warned the NDA. \"In summary the Prism concept is unlikely to start before 2050 and as such does not appear to meet the requirement for deployment within 25 years.\" Jean McSorley, a Cumbria-based nuclear critic, obtained the emails under freedom of information law. GE said that there had been \"miscommunication\" about Prism, which had been under development in the US for 30 years. \"We haven't had a chance to explain it yet,\" the company's chief nuclear engineer, Eric Loewen, told the Guardian. \"We're working on a framework with the NDA.\" But Decc said that the alternative of turning plutonium into mixed oxide (Mox) fuel was \"the most credible and technologically mature option\" so it was prioritising work on that. \"We are not closing off alternatives,\" added a Decc spokesman. \"We remain open to any technically mature proposals that offer better value to the taxpayer and can be delivered in within a comparable timeframe as our preferred option.\" • Get the Guardian's environment news on your iPhone with our new app. You can also join us on Twitter, Facebook and Google+"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/oct/19/saudi-arabia-renewable-energy-oil","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-10-19T10:14:26Z","webTitle":"Saudi Arabia reveals plans to be powered entirely by renewable energy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/19/saudi-arabia-renewable-energy-oil","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/oct/19/saudi-arabia-renewable-energy-oil","fields":{"headline":"Saudi Arabia reveals plans to be powered entirely by renewable energy","bodyText":"Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil producer, has plans to become 100% powered by renewable and low-carbon forms of energy, according to an influential member of the royal family. But the process is likely to take decades, and some observers are sceptical as to whether it is any more than window-dressing. Prince Turki Al Faisal Al Saud, founder of the King Faisal Foundation and one of the state's top spokesmen, told the Global Economic Symposium in Brazil that he hoped the kingdom might be powered entirely by low-carbon energy within his lifetime – he is 67 – but that he thought it was likely to take longer. However, he insisted Saudi was moving ahead with investment in renewable energy, nuclear power and other alternatives to fossil fuels and that it could use its vast oil reserves for other goods, such as plastics and polymers. \"Oil is more precious for us underground than as a fuel source,\" he said. \"If we can get to the point where we can replace fossil fuels and use oil to produce other products that are useful, that would be very good for the world. I wish that may be in my lifetime, but I don't think it will be.\" Joss Garman, political director of Greenpeace, said: \"It speaks volumes that a Saudi prince can see the benefits of switching to clean energy sources when [UK chancellor] George Osborne seemingly cannot, but Saudi Arabia will only truly be a green economy when it leaves its fossil fuels in the ground.\" Saudi Arabia's energy use is almost entirely from fossil fuels at present, with about two-thirds coming from oil and the remainder from gas. The state produces close to 12m barrels of oil a day, representing more than 12% of world crude production, and has about one-fifth of the world's oil reserves, according to the US government's Energy Information Administration. Energy use per person within the kingdom is also high by world standards, because energy prices are kept so low. As Prince Turki noted, however, the kingdom has vast potential for using solar power. \"The cost of solar energy is now 15% of what it was 20 years ago,\" he noted. Saudi Arabia has also signed memoranda of understanding – though no final deal as yet – with Argentina over nuclear energy. But despite his commitment to advancing renewable energy in the Middle East, Prince Turki – who served as director of Saudi Arabia's intelligence services for more than 20 years and has also been an ambassador to the UK and the US – was also clear that the rest of the world was likely to continue to rely on fossil fuels for many years to come. \"No country can ban itself from any one form of energy,\" he said. One of the other potentially important technologies for Saudi Arabia is carbon capture and storage, as depleted oil fields could be used as storage for compressed carbon dioxide, but it has so far made little progress. The prince said the development of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology should be seen as an international effort rather than the responsibility of single countries. Nebjsa Nakicenovic, deputy chief of the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, said CCS was likely to be a vital technology around the world. Though he acknowledged there could be problems, as the technology is still unproven, he warned: \"Do not discount CCS.\" On renewables, Nakicenovic said the world should aim to generate 30% of energy from sustainable renewable sources by 2030. That would represent more than a doubling of current renewable energy usage, because although on paper about 15% of energy now comes from renewable sources, this includes a large amount of biomass – mostly wood, dung and other waste – burned in developing countries. Much of this is unsustainable, and requires a significant use of resources in foraging for firewood. \"So [the target] is very ambitious, but doable,\" he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/poverty-matters/2013/jan/04/uk-government-enthusiasm-gm","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2013-01-04T07:00:02Z","webTitle":"UK government's enthusiasm for GM not matched in developing nations | John Vidal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2013/jan/04/uk-government-enthusiasm-gm","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2013/jan/04/uk-government-enthusiasm-gm","fields":{"headline":"UK government's enthusiasm for GM not matched in developing nations","bodyText":"Britain wants GM food to be grown commercially. After years of encouraging developing countries in Africa and elsewhere to grow them, but unable to allow its own farmers to do so, the environment secretary Owen Paterson has told a major conference that GM can secure countries' food supplies, is good for the public and can help limit climate change. This is part of a massive PR drive by government, industry and free marketeers to shake off GM's \"Frankenfood\" image in Britain. But it will resonate deeply in sub-Saharan Africa, where the US and UK governments, industry bodies and seed companies have all been lobbying strongly for GM crops to be grown widely. Britain is spending around £100m on support for GM crops, supposedly for the world's poor people, while organisations including the Gates foundation, USAid, and the Cgiar network of agricultural research stations are backed by other rich countries to develop the technology. But despite billions of dollars spent on research by rich countries on feeding hungry people, most developing countries remain suspicious of the claims, or convinced that the benefits will go mainly to the corporations that control the seeds and chemicals needed to grow the crops. What is remarkable is not that GM crops have, after 20 years and so much money spent, now reached 19 out of more than 150 developing countries, but that most nations have managed to keep out a rapacious industry, and that only a handful of GM food commodity crops like oilseed rape, soya and maize are still grown, mainly for animals and biofuels. GM cotton is widely grown in India and China, but GM foods are pretty well limited to the US and Latin America. Here's a rundown of the scant progress made in around 20 years by companies to introduce GM food to developing countries: • South Africa, which grows some GM maize and soyabean, is one of only three African countries, along with Burkina Faso and Egypt, planting commercialised GM crops (pdf). In Egypt, 70 tonnes of maize seeds were imported in 2008, but a second shipment was barred entry last year. Burkina Faso grows mostly GM cotton and not food. • The GM industry in Kenya, one of the biotech industry's prime targets in Africa, suffered a major setback last month after the government banned the import and sale of all GM food. • In neighbouring Tanzania, the government has said it is \"not ready\" for the crops. • The International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-biotech Applications (ISAAA), talks of \"overwhelming trust and confidence\" in GM crops and says it expects Mali, Togo, Nigeria, Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania and Malawi to start growing GM in the next few years. But ISAAA is an industry-backed body accused of hyping the take-up of the crops. The reality is that progress in introducing GM food crops to Africa has slowed almost to a halt, with no country altogether happy with the prospect of their introduction. • India has placed a moratorium on planting its first GM food crop, and there are signs that farmers are increasingly unhappy with Bt cotton, which is widely grown but meeting resistance. A leaked agriculture ministry advisory letter to cotton-growing states admitted last year: \"Cotton farmers are in a deep crisis since shifting to Bt cotton. The spate of farmer suicides in 2011-12 has been particularly severe among Bt cotton farmers.\" • After the US, Latin America has been the most enthusiastic. Brazil grows 29m hectares (71.6m acres) of GM soy and maize, and Argentina slightly less, but Mexico has delayed the introduction of GM maize until this year, Peru has approved a 10-year moratorium on the import and cultivation of GM seeds, and Bolivia has committed to giving up growing all GM crops by 2015. In Central America Costa Rica is expected to reject an application from a Monsanto subsidiary to grow GM corn. • China is deeply cautious when it comes to growing GM food crops and has been shocked by reports of children being allegedly used for a GM food trial. GM advocates in Europe and the US accuse developing countries of being swayed by Greenpeace or other western environmental groups, but that is to malign their own scientists and farm experts who have done their own assessments of GM foods and advised caution. In countries such as Britain, where few people have any link with the land, it is perhaps understandable to be scientifically gung-ho about GM. But in many developing countries, where life depends on seeds and where 90% of families may grow their own food, GM is not a rarified debate about science or health, but about survival, culture and how nature itself is best protected. GM food has so far not delivered on its early promises of higher yields and reduced pesticide use. Instead, like nuclear power, it has been racked by controversy, corruption, and debates about regulation, patents and ownership. The British government and its GM advocates appeal to people with assertions that the technology wil make food cheaper and more plentiful, and think the public needs only to be educated into seeing the crops differently.

Tests were conducted in May on 10 children, aged between 6 and 16, by a Japanese civic group and Acro, a French body that measures radioactivity. All 10 tested positive for tiny amounts of caesium-134 and caesium-137. The chief cabinet secretary, Yukio Edano, said he was concerned by the findings and the government would thoroughly examine the results. The Fukushima network to save children from radiation said it was certain the readings were due to radiation leaks from the power plant, where workers are still struggling to stabilise reactors that suffered core meltdowns after the 11 March earthquake and tsunami. Acro's president, David Boilley, said the results suggested a strong likelihood that children living in or near Fukushima city had been exposed to radiation internally. According to the survey, 1.13 becquerels of caesium-134 per litre of urine were found in an eight-year-old girl – the highest reading for that isotope. The highest reading for caesium-137 – 1.30 becquerels – came from a seven-year-old boy, Kyodo news agency said. Richard Wakeford, an expert in radiation exposure at the Dalton Institute in Manchester, said he was not surprised that caesium had been found in Fukushima city residents, given the distance and direction the radiation plume had travelled. \"What we're seeing here is residual caesium that will be around for quite a while,\" he said. \"But, given the circumstances, the levels quoted in the survey are not particularly alarming.\" Wakeford said ingestion could be prevented by avoiding contaminated food and milk, but added that produce contaminated at levels acceptable to the government would inevitably go on sale. The discovery came days after health authorities in Fukushima began checking internal radiation doses among all 2 million of the prefecture's residents, a 30-year project that will cost an estimated 100bn yen (£777m). In separate tests, radioactive caesium and iodine were found in the urine of 15 residents from two towns located 19 to 25 miles from the Fukushima Daiichi plant. While none had exceeded the maximum allowable dose of 20 millisieverts a year, experts voiced concern over the presence of caesium-137, a byproduct of nuclear fission with a half-life of 30 years. \"This won't be a problem if they don't eat vegetables or other contaminated products,\" Nanao Kamada, professor emeritus of radiation biology at Hiroshima University, told reporters. \"But it will be difficult for people to continue living in these areas.\" From September tens of thousands of children living in Fukushima city are to be given dosimeters to measure their exposure to atmospheric radiation. Environmental groups have called for pregnant women and children to be evacuated from the city. Children are thought to be at greatest risk because they have more time to develop thyroid and other cancers. \"At least parts of the population that are sensitive need to be evacuated, and the remaining people who decide to stay for various reasons need to be given proper support and information,\" said Jan Beranek, head of Greenpeace's energy campaign. Wakeford said: \"I wouldn't say immediate evacuation is required because this is not a sudden burst of radiation. It's long-term, protracted exposure. The Japanese government's biggest problem is deciding on what kind of external levels of exposure are acceptable once the crisis has moved out of the emergency phase.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2013/apr/28/pakistan-nawaz-sharif-daughter-maryam","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2013-04-27T23:06:00Z","webTitle":"Election favourite's daughter takes to the streets to win the heart of Punjab","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/28/pakistan-nawaz-sharif-daughter-maryam","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/apr/28/pakistan-nawaz-sharif-daughter-maryam","fields":{"headline":"Election favourite's daughter takes to the streets to win the heart of Punjab","bodyText":"The convoy slows. In front of the candidate's vehicle, men dance. Rose petals are hurled from the rooftops. Motorbikes swarm. \"Look, look who is coming,\" supporters shout. A white tiger on top of a van yawns and stretches a paw. A small child and a 90-year-old party worker are hauled through the crowd to offer garlands. \"It's a beautiful feeling to be loved,\" says Maryam Sharif, leaning back in the seat of her luxury SUV three days into her first election campaign. \"My shoulders hurt from waving six hours a day. I need to learn to wave wisely.\" Sharif's constituency is in the heart of Lahore, the second biggest city of Pakistan. In two weeks, the nuclear power, so crucial to western strategy in the region and the fight against Islamist extremism worldwide, will hold a general election. It will be the first time in the 66 years since independence that one democratically elected civilian government will serve out its full term and be replaced by another. Every day bombs kill three, four, a dozen. The last election, held in 2008, had been postponed after Benazir Bhutto, the two-time former prime minister, was assassinated by extremists at a rally. Despite continuing violence, authorities say these polls will be held on time. Maryam Sharif is not actually standing herself. She is canvassing on behalf of the candidate in National Assembly Constituency 120. This is Nawaz Sharif, president of the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz), or PML-N, and the man who polls predict is likely to become prime minister for the third time when the votes are finally counted. He was first elected from this constituency in 1985 at the start of his political career. Maryam is his daughter. \"I didn't know what to expect but the response is massive. Every household is showering us with petals, throwing garlands. It's so invigorating. I didn't know the love for Nawaz Sharif until I went into the field campaigning,\" she says. In Lahore, capital of Punjab province, the Sharifs are on home turf. The family live on a sprawling estate south of the city. At elections in 2008 they swept the city itself and won control, too, of Punjab province, the richest and most influential part of Pakistan. Maryam's uncle, Shahbaz, was chief minister of Lahore until elections were called last month. \"It's in the genes but it's not a family affair,\" Maryam, 39, says quickly. Pakistan is not short of political dynasties. The most famous is the Bhuttos. Benazir's father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, founded the Pakistan People's party (PPP) and won power in the 1970s before being deposed and hanged by military dictator Zia ul-Haq. Her 24-year-old son Bilawal, a recent Oxford graduate, is joint chairman of the party. Bhutto's widower, Asif Ali Zardari, is president and the effective leader of the outgoing PPP government. The threat to Bilawal from extremists is so high he can barely campaign, addressing small crowds under heavy security. Maryam, a mother of three, met Benazir Bhutto once, during the Sharifs' eight-year exile that followed the military coup that ended her own father's most recent spell as prime minister in 1999. Despite their ideological differences, the older woman left an \"indelible impression\", Maryam said. The charismatic Benazir Bhutto, educated at Oxford and Harvard, instinctively pro-western, culturally Muslim rather than personally devout, enjoyed deep support in western capitals. But Nawaz Sharif has long inspired suspicion overseas and the 63-year-old business magnate's continued popularity has perplexed many. But, analysts say, the very factors that jar with western diplomats are those that guarantee support among a large number of Pakistanis. Most recent polls say that Sharif's PML-N will win 41% of the votes in the forthcoming election. The party's own predictions are more conservative but still point to a significant victory. At the party's newly refurbished campaign headquarters in Lahore's plush suburb of Model Town, rows of young workers sit at screens monitoring live TV broadcasts and social media. They are focused not on the national news channels followed largely by the elite, still less the English-language press or Twitter, but on the hugely popular local channels and Urdu-language publications. Campaign workers say they believe 20% of the 85 million who can vote in two weeks are undecided. Of the core PML-N vote, only a sixth are in the big cities, they say. Most are in medium-sized towns unknown in the west. And Nawaz Sharif's fortune is seen as something to aspire to, not criticise. The family also have a reputation for religious and social conservatism and being close to Jamaat-e-Islami, an Islamist organisation ideologically close to the Muslim Brotherhood. Early support came from Zia ul-Haq, who launched a broad-ranging Islamisation campaign in Pakistan. When in power in the 1990s, Sharif pushed legislation strengthening traditional Islamic law in Pakistan, though supporters said the aim was to outflank the right. When forced into exile, by a military coup, the Sharifs were offered a haven by Saudi Arabia. Equally disconcerting for Washington, Nawaz Sharif opposed Pakistan's support for the US-led \"war on terror\" and has called for an end to the drone strikes in the restive west of the country that have killed scores of top al-Qaida militants in recent years. But if this worries the west, it strikes a chord with many Pakistani voters, particularly outside the urban elite. The core constituency, say party strategists, is \"small town small traders\". \"We get called provincial and narrow-minded. But that's fine. We aren't. Our message is, 'Let's continue to build a better Pakistan'. It's about their hopes,\" one said. The main opposition in the Punjab is no longer the Bhuttos and their PPP but Imran Khan, the cricketer-turned-politician. His Pakistan Movement for Justice party has attracted many, especially among the young, who want change. \"They are sick of the same old faces. Sharif has done nothing to help the people in this constituency. Their basic needs of health, education, security are not being met,\" said Dr Yasmin Rasheed, a 63-year-old former gynaecologist campaigning for Khan against Maryam and her father. Rasheed's supporters repeat well-known allegations of graft and incompetence during Sharif's earlier times in power when, it is claimed, cronies were loaned huge sums from state banks and tariffs manipulated to favour the family's business interests. PML-N officials deny the charges and point to the party's history of \"competent management\" which they say brought the country motorways, better relations with neighbouring India and successful, if controversial, nuclear tests in 1998. They point, too, to more recent development in Lahore, such as the ambitious new Metro Bus public transport system. The massive power cuts are blamed on the federal government. Maryam Sharif's entry into politics – and talk of her as a potential future leader – also counters another image problem: that the party is too male. \"When you see the leader's daughter come forward then that shows the open mindset of the leadership allowing space for women in senior positions,\" said Anusha Rehman, a former PML parliamentarian and key official. However, few claim that the leaders of the party share the suffering of the common people in Pakistan. Nor perhaps would voters expect or want them to. Though the NA-120 constituency includes the newly widened streets of central Lahore, there are many neighbourhoods where families live in dark one-room apartments with intermittent electricity and minimal sanitation. Food prices are soaring. Pockets of malnutrition and disease remain. \"It's not your financial status, it's the will to do something for others that matters. On the street, I am part of their ordeal. It's not about the class you belong to … it's the compassion you hold in your heart,\" Maryam said. Outside the crowd is thicker than before. Meat shops line this street and the petals falling from rooftops land amid bones and blood. \"Look who's coming,\" the party activists shout. Grinning butchers wave gory hands. The candidate's smiling daughter waves back. • This article was amended on 1 May 2013. The original, because of an editing error, wrongly said that Jamaat-e-Islami is the local branch of the Muslim Brotherhood.

The rebirth of Japan","bodyText":"It is a small thing, but it says a lot about the country. At Tokyo's Narita airport, when you take off your shoes at the security screening check, the guard hands you a pair of leather slippers. The message is obvious: this airport cares for your wellbeing and recognises your need. In Japan, taxi doors swing open automatically; toilet seats are electronically warmed and cleaned; and the extraordinary variety of food is presented exquisitely. There is a passion for satiating every imaginable human want and a joy in embracing the science, technology and innovation that might help deliver just that. For 40 years, between 1950 and 1990, this passion was a key ingredient driving one of the most remarkable periods of growth in economic history. But for the past 20 years, Japan has been stricken by stagnation. In the late 1980s-90s, it suffered a financial crisis nearly as severe as our own. The economic model – the Ministry of International Trade and Industry guiding Japanese companies; the keiretsu networks of loosely conglomerated firms and associated banks; the great global brands – suffered an implosion. Yet this remains a $5trn economy, the third largest on the planet. The Japanese themselves are desperate to recover the elixir of growth, and understand that economic conservatism – in Japan just as in Britain – leads to disappointment and heartbreak. In 2009, the Democratic party of Japan was elected by a landslide, pledging a root and branch reform of every bureaucratic, corporatist and anti-democratic element in Japan's broken system. It also pledged to recast economic policy to serve the people. Despite some epic mistakes, notably its handling of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, it still holds an opinion poll lead over its rival, the Liberal Democratic party (LDP). However, forces within the government are very much open to pondering where it should go next. Ten days ago, I was invited by the DPJ government to go to Tokyo to contribute to this ongoing conversation. Cabinet members wanted to discuss what a 21st-century social contract might look like, respecting both necessary labour market flexibility and security. They wanted to understand the contribution that open innovation ecosystems and an entrepreneurial state can play in driving forward innovation and investment. Above all, they asked: how could Japan reinvent its stakeholder capitalism of the second half of the 20th century so that it was more democratic? And they thought there might be something in my ideas rehearsed in the books The State We're In and Them and Us. In short, how could Japan do good capitalism? It is the question – not only in Japan but, I would argue, in Britain. In Japan the devastating earthquake in Tohoku 12 months ago has made it even more acute. Three hundred and forty thousand people are still without homes. At least 19,000 died. And the nuclear power station at Fukushima very nearly suffered a meltdown [see footnote]. At the time of the crisis, Japan hoped that, with the DPJ in power, there would be a decisive change from the way such matters had been handled in the past – obfuscation, delay, inactivity and anxiety to protect corporate interests. Yet the new government bounced off the secrecy of Tokyo Electric Power Company, the bureaucratic ministries, a muzzled media and the enveloping tentacles of the employers' organisation, the Keidanren, as if nothing had changed. Prime Minster Kan became party to delivering inadequate and late information via the impenetrable state and corporate networks; many Japanese became devotees of BBC World News as the only purveyor of truth. Kan was forced to resign last summer. But the Japanese electorate is not ready to return to the status quo. They know they need nuclear power which just 12 months ago provided more than a third of their electricity needs; but as power stations are being closed down for safety inspections local communities are vetoing their reopening. In May, the last nuclear power station operating will also be mothballed. The terms for their restarting are tough. Local communities, fired up by a new citizen activism, want effective oversight, transparency of information and commitments to meet international safety standards. It is Japanese good capitalism, driven by citizen demands from below. Faced with this new phenomenon, the LDP is at a loss, while the DPJ itself seems to be re-gathering its conviction that its reform agenda is the only way forward. At an open meeting in the Japanese parliament, I was struck by the interest DPJ MPs showed in discussing innovative ways of kickstarting credit flows – as anathema to the Bank of Japan and Ministry of Finance as they are to the Bank of England and Treasury. The Bank of Japan has just expanded a version of the Bank of England's quantitative easing programme; but abstains from the activism it used to show in the great days of Japan's growth. The conclusions are obvious. Japan's financial system is broken; an activist state has to restart bank lending by assuming some of the risk – just as it must in Britain. If Japan could reset its macroeconomic policy, there is an enormous pool of dynamic hi-tech medium-sized firms that could immediately grow very fast. Consultant Gerhard Fasol argues that in areas like LED lighting or mobile phone payment systems, Japan is 10 years ahead of the rest of the world. The Fujitsus and Toshibas of tomorrow are in the wings. What Japan needs is for the increasingly sclerotic giants to be challenged by these many insurgents, who need new institutions to support their ambitions to go global. A new entrepreneurial, accountable state could drive a second phase of powerful Japanese growth. These debates are foreign to our primitive business culture, which undervalues service and innovation and scarcely thinks about a more productive capitalism. There is a long list of British companies that have tried to break into Japan's market and failed. Observers say the common theme is wholesale insensitivity to the need for service and innovation, the precondition for any success in Japan. Britain and Japan are two island economies, both mired in private debt with stricken financial systems. Although Japan has a long way to go, it is becoming obvious, confirmed by last week's British budget, which of the two countries is most likely to create the 21st-century framework for growth and prosperity. The Asian story of the next decade will be Japan's renaissance and China's relapse. • The following correction was published on 8 April 2012: Discussing the devastating earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan last year a Comment piece maintained that \"the nuclear power station at Fukushima very nearly suffered a meltdown\", yet as early as May last year the Tokyo Electric Power Co admitted that fuel rods in three reactors had melted down within hours of the quake.

Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow for the latest Bank of England and European Central Bank meetings. Over to Greece where leaders have emerged from talks saying tomorrow’s eurogroup meeting of euro area finance ministers will be “decisive” for the country’s bid to exit its bailout programme. Helena Smith reports from Athens: Greece will come one step closer to ending the international scrutiny that has marked its relationship with foreign lenders when euro area finance ministers meet tomorrow. That was the message Evangelos Venizelos, the country’s deputy premier and the finance minister Gikas Hardouvelis were determined to convey as both men talked up the prospect of an imminent agreement with creditors following talks with prime minister Antonis Samaras. “In January we are going [into a new phase],” insisted Hardouvelis reminding reporters that as of December 31 EU bailout disbursements will stop. “So everyone has an incentive to go into a situation where everyone wins… the will is there, incentives are there and because incentives always work in life … a solution will be found.” Tomorrow’s eurogroup meeting will be crucial in determining negotiations that will mark the beginning of the end, Venizelos said. “Our goal is to reach [a deal with foreign lenders] before the last eurogroup of the year which is 8 December. Thursday’s meeting will be of decisive importance for the hard and delicate negotiations that the government is waging, “ he said adding that it was vital Greece exited the programme with the support needed to ensure that market volatility was kept at bay. The EU’s new monetary affairs chief Pierre Moscovici has given the Greeks cause for optimism. Earlier this week he said the EU commission would study their “evolving demand” for an exit positively, provided that Greece also kept up with reforms. “We will have a first discussion on the euro group on Thursday, while decisions will be taken on December 8,” he said announcing that his first foreign visit would be to Greece before then. Back in the US and Dallas Federal Reserve president Richard Fisher has been commenting on interest rates, and the mid-term elections. He has told Bloomberg TV that the Fed can’t wait for inflation to reach its target before beginning to tighten monetary policy. He added that the Fed does not want to raise interest rates and then have to reverse course. He said: I would be very careful about waiting until we’ve already achieved our targets and then trying to rein in by raising interest rates, because every time this has been done in the history of the Fed, to my knowledge, then we’ve forced a recession. On the elections, dominated by the Republicans, he said he hoped the new Congress would limit any laws which might endanger the Fed’s independence: I think it’s very dangerous to tamper with the institution. Yes, we could be updated and tweaked but on balance we have lasted 100 years and on balance we have done a very good job. (Quotes from Reuters.) Reforms in Portugal have lost momentum, according to the latest review by teams from the European Commission and ECB which visited the country over the past few days. Its report said: Economic and financial conditions in Portugal have generally improved since the end of the EU/IMF-supported programme in June. Sovereign yields remain low, in line with developments elsewhere in the euro area and normal market-financing is being gradually restored. Nevertheless, economic recovery is constrained by high levels of debt in the public and private sector and by an increasingly weak external environment which highlights the need for further competitiveness gains. The pace of budgetary consolidation has been adversely affected by a series of one-off factors, despite strong revenue performance. Moreover, efforts to reduce the underlying structural budget deficit have clearly slackened. Progress in structural reforms has lost momentum, with an uneven pace of implementation across policy areas. The Portuguese banking sector continues to deleverage amid improving liquidity conditions. The results of the ECB’s comprehensive assessment have generally confirmed the solvency of the sector, notwithstanding the recent resolution of BES. Yet, looking ahead it is important that the opportunity provided by the comprehensive assessment to strengthen further the resilience of the banking system as a whole is seized. While most banks still project losses in 2014, cost-saving measures are now beginning to yield positive results. However, future profitability remains challenging, not least in light of the domestic macroeconomic environment. The mission expressed concern that the pace of structural reform appears to have diminished considerably since the end of the programme, in some cases reversing past achievements. Notably, while it remains to be seen whether recent policy measures relating to collective wage bargaining could on balance contribute to a better alignment of wages to productivity developments, the decision to increase the minimum wage could make the transition into employment for the most vulnerable even more difficult. Moreover, efforts to reduce excessive rents in network industries, in particular in energy, need to be stepped up. The mission recalled the importance of increasing the flexibility and competitiveness of the Portuguese economy to underpin the still nascent economic recovery. It therefore urged the Government to maintain an ambitious reform agenda for the future. There is also a need to more systematically monitor and evaluate the impact of reforms. The ISM service sector survey may have fallen but it was still a strong outcome, said James Knightley of ING Bank, and could point to a stronger than expected non-farm number on Friday : The ISM non-manufacturing index was unable to replicate the surprise jump seen in the manufacturing index earlier this week. Instead it fell to 57.1 from 58.6 versus market expectations of 58.0. Nonetheless, this is still a very strong reading and the series continues to run well above its 12 month average and substantially above the 50 break-even level. Indeed, new orders remain close to 60, suggesting that business activity will remain robust through the quarter while the employment component rose to 59.6 from 58.5. This leaves that series at its highest level since August 2005 and is very positive news ahead of Friday’s payrolls number. The current consensus for the change in non-farm payrolls is 235,000, but given the strength in the ISM employment indices, the ADP report and the consistently low readings for initial jobless claims then the odds favour a stronger outcome. And here’s the ISM survey, also showing a slowdown in the pace of growth in October. The ISM services index fell from 58.6 in September to 57.1, lower than the expected 58 and falling to its lowest level since June. But the employment index rose to 59.6, the highest since August 2005, from 58.5. Here’s the Markit composite PMI, showing the slowdown: And here’s Markit. The final services sector purchasing managers index for October came in at 57.1, down from 58.9 in the previous month. This was its lowest level since April, and was slightly down on the preliminary reading of 57.3. And Markit’s composite index, a weighted average of its manufacturing and services indices, fell to 57.2 in October from 59 in September. Markit said this suggested the brisk economic growth seen in the previous two quarters of the year would not be repeated in the final three months. Markit chief economist Chris Williamson said: The manufacturing and services surveys collectively indicated the slowest pace of expansion for six months in October and, with inflows of new business also hitting a six-month low, there’s good reason to believe that the pace of growth could slacken further in coming months. The October survey data running at a level consistent with GDP rising at an annualised rate of 2.5% at the start of the fourth quarter, but any further drop in the PMI numbers raises the risk of an even sharper slowdown. However, although cooling, the pace of expansion clearly remains sufficiently strong to generate an impressive rate of job creation. The surveys are signalling another month of non-farm payroll growth in excess of 200,000 in October. The concern is that, with growth slowing and business confidence sliding to one of the lowest levels seen over the past two years, employers could soon start to show greater hesitancy in recruiting new staff. Coming up we have the latest from the US services sector, with two different measures from, first, Markit, then the Institute of Supply Management. If it is anything like Monday’s two manufacturing surveys, they are not likely to agree, although they may at least head in the same direction this time. Meanwhile the Dow Jones Industrial Average hit yet another record high at the open, although it is currently off its best levels, up around 50 points. Time for a late lunchtime summary, before this afternoon’s US data arrives (service PMIs from Markit and ISM). Economists have warned that Britain’s economy is slowing, after the service sector recorded its weakest growth in 17 months. The services PMI fell to just 56.2, down from 58.7 in September. That is the lowest level since May 2013. Details start here. The pound hit a one-year low, with traders concluding that interest rates will remain at record lows for longer. Ranko Berich, Head of Market Analysis at Monex Europe, says the data shows the engine of UK economy has “dropped down a gear” Today’s Service PMI is another nail in the coffin for the Bank of England’s plan for early rate hikes, as the engine of the UK economy dropped down a gear in October. Services represented almost all of the third quarter growth in the UK and, should this crucial sector slow further, the economy as a whole could be heading for a fall. “There are some causes for optimism in the report, particularly the continued expansion of employment in the services sector, but the actual level of activity grew at the slowest pace in 17 months. There was also a notable fall in optimism, as businesses became increasingly concerned about future prospects for growth. With manufacturing looking sluggish and construction growth cooling, the signs look ominous for the wider economy. The eurozone’s service sector has also recorded another tough month, with private sector activity only rising narrowly. Markit, which compiles the report, says it made for ‘grim reading’. France was, again, a weak performer, with service sector activity contracting at a faster pace. Italy returned to growth, but firms continued to cut jobs. MPs have warned that Rolls-Royce’s plan to cut 2,600 jobs could have a serious negative impact on the UK economy, at an Urgent Question in parliament. Marks &amp; Spencer’s shares have soared, up 8.5% at pixel time after it reported better than expected results and hiked its dividend. However the high street retailer also reported another quarter of falling clothing sales, which it partly blamed on the unusually warm UK weather this autumn. Ireland’s unemployment rate has fallen to 11%.... ...while US firms created 230,000 new jobs last month. Today’s drop in Ireland’s unemployment rate to 11% (see 11.56am) has been hailed by Irish politicians as a sign of economic recovery. Henry McDonald, our Ireland correspondent, explains: Irish Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Social Protection Joan Burton said the latest figures indicated that progress was being made to reduce unemployment. “These are once again hugely encouraging figures, showing that the Pathways to Work strategy to reduce unemployment is making significant progress. In the first 9 months of this year, over 100,000 people have left the Live Register to take up employment. Unemployment is down from a crisis peak of 15.1 per cent to 11 per cent now, and, critically, the pace of the reduction is accelerating,” she said. There was more good jobs news in Ireland today with the announcement of 200 extra posts at a U.S medical devices company in Co.Wexford, Henry adds: Clearstream Technologies based at Enniscorthy is expanding its operation in its southeast Ireland plant. It manufactures devices such as catheters and stents for uses in cancer treatments and major surgery. Over to America...and the latest ADP jobs report shows that US companies created 230,000 new jobs last month. That’s up from 213,000 in September, suggesting that America’s labour market improved again last month. However, there are signs that weaker conditions overseas hit job creation. Paul Dales of Capital Economics explains: The fact that, according to the ADP, large firms added just 4,000 jobs while small firms added 102,000 and medium firms added 122,000 could be a sign that the easing in global demand is hindering US employment. After all, large firms are more likely to be exposed to overseas developments. That said, the encouraging performance of small and medium firms supports our view that any weakening in demand from overseas is being offset by stronger demand at home. On Friday we get the eagerly awaited Non-Farm Payroll, showing how many new jobs were created across the whole economy (and whether earnings went up). Last question: Conservative MP Stephen Metcalfe asks the government to ensure that young people aren’t deterred from entering engineering by the sight of Rolls-Royce cutting 2,600 jobs. Absolutely, BIS minister Matt Hancock replies. Engineering is an exciting profession, and a well-paid one too. Britain is a world career in engineering, and I’d encourage anyone considering joining it to give serious consideration, he adds. And that’s that. What impact will the Rolls-Royce job cuts have on the wider East Midlands economy? Matthew Hancock, minister for Business, Enterprise and Energy, agrees that “We need to take the impact on the supply chain into account”. Hancock also says that the UK has a shortage of trained engineers -- the government will “work night and day” to ensure that the people who leave Rolls-Royce can be redeployed. Another MP (sorry, missed his name) suggests that another UK engineering firm, Babcock, needs more engineering talent to handle future nuclear power work. Labour MP Jack Dromey says the government shouldn’t simply accept Rolls-Royce’s job cuts -- the consultation should consider whether the plan is right. Matt Hancock replies that RR faces a tough international market, and needs to make changes. The government will continue to engage with it. Conservative MP David Mowat asks whether the sanctions imposed on Russia have contributed to Rolls-Royce’s jobs cuts. That hasn’t come up in our talks, minister Hancock replies. Kerry McCarthy, Labour MP for Bristol East, is worried that new apprentices joining Rolls-Royce today will suffer as the company implements its job cuts plan. Adrian Bailey MP, who chairs the business, innovation and skills committee, is also concerned about the impact of Rolls-Royce’s job cuts on Britain. We are desperately short of skilled engineers nationally...and short of young people entering the profession. And here we have a blue chip company actually laying people off, he says. Minister Matt Hancock replies that Rolls-Royce is still committed to taking on graduates and apprentices. Margaret Beckett, Labour MP for Derby South, warns parliament that Rolls-Royce’s job cuts could hurt the wider UK economy by reducing the country’s engineering talent base. Matt Hancock is telling MPs that we still don’t know exactly where Rolls-Royce’s 2,600 job cuts will fall. Heads-up. MPs in parliament are holding an urgent question on the 2,600 job cuts announced by Rolls-Royce yesterday. Minister Matthew Hancock is saying the government will do everything it can to help those affected, and will help set up a taskforce to help those affected. Many of the people hit by the layoffs will be engineers, he warns, adding: We are determined to help Rolls-Royce as they make the changes they need. Europe’s stock markets are all up today, helped by better than expected results from Marks &amp; Spencer (see opening post) and German chemicals firm Brenntag (details). Traders also seem to be less fearful about yesterday’s report of divisions at the top of the European Central Bank. Marks &amp; Spencer is the biggest gainer in London, up 9% today. But gold producer Randgold is the biggest faller, down 2.8%. Gold has fallen to a new four-year low, as my colleague Nick Fletcher reports: FTSE moves higher as Marks soars, but miner Randgold fails to shine Ireland’s unemployment rate has dropped again, to 11% in October from 11.1% in September. The Irish central statistics body reports that that number of people receiving jobless benefits fell by 3,500 to 371,400 (seasonally adjusted). Ireland’s labour market has strengthened since it exited its bailout last December. A year ago, its unemployment rate was 12.4%. But as this chart shows, most of the new jobs created have gone to men: Over in Athens, the race is on to get the troika back in town so that a deal can be cut on Greece’s exit from its bailout programme. It is the main issue at talks between prime minister Antonis Samaras and his deputy Evangelos Venizelos taking place in Athens right now. From the Greek capital, Helena Smith reports: The two men hope by this evening to have wrapped up a plan that will entice international auditors back to Greece so that it can be presented by the Greek finance minister Gikas Hardouvelis at tomorrow’s Eurogroup meeting. Officials here are saying they hope mission heads representing the EU, ECB and IMF will return next week “in order for negotiations to finally begin.” Greek government sources, who I spoke to this morning, have been emboldened by an array of encouraging noises made by top EU officials, including the German chancellor Angela Merkel, that suggest Athens’ bailout programme is coming to an end - even if a precautionary credit line will still be needed. In his first TV interview since assuming the post, Hardouvelis announced that Greece was on the way to forming a “new kind of relationship” with lenders. “This new relationship will be an issue of negotiation,” he told Mega TV. As of 2015, the troika would not have such an active role in the day-to-day running of affairs even if “the relationship with lenders will last many years until we pay back 75 percent of the loan.” Yet more gloomy news -- eurozone retail spending has taken quite a tumble, highlighting the weakness of the Europe economy. Retail sales volumes across the eurozone slid by 1.3% month-on-month in September, a rather bigger decline than expected. It’s the biggest monthly decline since April 2012. Non-food spending shrank by 2.2%, while food spending was 0.1% lower. Eurostat adds that: The highest increases in total retail trade were registered in Malta (+1.0%), Luxembourg (+0.9%), Hungary and Slovakia (both +0.7%), and the largest decreases in Germany (-3.2%), Portugal (-2.5%) and Poland (-2.4%). Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, agrees that the UK growth rate appears to be dipping, given today’s drop in service sector growth. “It appears that some of the clouds that have been lingering over the manufacturing sector in recent months have now started to cast a shadow over services as well. A weaker new business pipeline and softer confidence is likely to reflect heightened concerns about global economic and geopolitical risk. “These results are consistent with our long-held view that the pace of growth will cool a little around the turn of the year. Update, the pound actually hit a one-year low against the US dollar this morning. Sterling fell as low as $1.5867 after October’s service sector PMI came in weaker than expected, below the previous 11-month low set in mid-October. Britain’s service sector firms probably suffered a knock-on effect from the stock market volatility in October, says Rob Wood, economist at Berenberg bank. Wood points out that a service sector PMI of 56.2 is still quite strong (50 is the cut-off point between expansion and contraction). But... That being said, for now we have to get used to more average rather than spectacular PMI readings. Firm’s expectations for growth over the next twelve months, a decent leading indicator, are a little below their historical average. Wood also reckons that domestic politics could be the biggest threat to the economy next year: With UKIP’s surge prompting the Conservative’s to consider more extreme immigration policies and Labour seemingly suffering an implosion of support in Scotland, the chances of an unstable government after the May-2015 election seem to be rising, as is the chance of Brexit. We do not expect doomsday scenarios to come to pass – we expect the UK to remain in the EU and a stable coalition government to emerge after the 2015 election – but those political risks are worth watching very carefully. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight is also unimpressed by today’s UK service sector PMI: This is a relatively disappointing survey adding to the recent evidence that both the dominant services sector and the economy overall has come off the boil. The UK services sector is entering the winter lacking the self-belief that it exhibited earlier in this year, says Jeremy Cook of World First, the currency exchange firm. “Although new business measures increased, this rate has fallen. Combined with slower demand growth from respondents, there is a new unease in the services sector as to where the industry moves from here.” The pound has fallen to a two-week low, following the weaker-than-expected service sector report. It has lost a cent against the US dollar this morning, to $1.5887 Traders are calculating that there’s even less chance of the Bank of England rushing to raise interest rates at this month’s two-day meeting, which began this morning. City economists aren’t panicking about the UK service sector slowdown. Here’s some instant reaction: More disappointing data! Growth in the UK’s service sector dropped sharply in October, according to Markit’s survey of the sector. That suggesting Britain’s economic growth is slowing as 2014 comes to a close. The UK service sector PMI fell to 56.2 in October, down from 58.7 in September. That indicates the slowest monthly growth in 17 months. Markit reports that UK business confidence weakened slightly last month - although firms did also keep hiring staff. It’s not a reason to panic -- any reading over 50 shows growth. But Chris Williamson, Markit’s chief economist, says that “ a cloud of uncertainty” has gathered over the UK economy in recent weeks. Although manufacturing growth picked up (details), construction growth slowed (details) He reckons that UK GDP may only rise by 0.5% in the final three months of this year, down from 0.7% in the July-September quarter. Here’s why: “A sharp easing of service sector growth to the weakest since May of last year comes on the heels of data showing construction growth sliding to a five-month low and the goods-producing sector shifting down a gear since earlier in the year. “After GDP growth slowed to 0.7% in the third quarter, a 0.5% expansion is currently being signalled by the surveys for the fourth quarter. However, with inflows of work rising across all three sectors at the slowest rate for 16 months, there is a risk that economic growth could weaken further. And David Noble, CEO of the Chartered Institute of Purchasing &amp; Supply, says UK firms are “tiptoeing through a time of uncertainty”. “This month appears to be a slowdown month as the services sector comes off the boil, challenged by capacity constraints, increased backlogs and a slight reduction in new business growth. Credit Agricole economist Frederik Ducrozet remains hopeful that the eurozone economy will pick up next year, despite struggling last month. It’s official: Eurozone economy remains weak, dragged back by weak demand and renewed job losses among companies. That’s the conclusion of this morning’s service sector data (details start here), and Monday manufacturing PMIs. Markit, which conducts the polls of eurozone firms, says: The rate of economic expansion in October was little-changed from September’s ten-month low, with modest output growth registered at manufacturers and service providers alike. Job losses were reported for the first time since November 2013, while price pressures remained muted. Markit’s composite PMI, measuring activity across the eurozone private sector, inched up to 52.1, up from 52.0 in September. That shows modest growth, but not enough to drag the economy out of its rut. Firms reported that they cut jobs because new work rose at a slower pace, meaning backlogs of work fell for the fifth month running. And France is a big worry - as covered earlier, the contraction in its service sector accelerated to a four-month low. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, says the PMIs suggest the fragile eurozone economy could worsen in the months ahead. That raises the threat of a recession -- the third since the financial crisis began. Williamson explains: “The eurozone PMI makes for grim reading, painting a picture of an economy that is limping along and more likely to take a turn for the worse than spring back into life. While output grew at a slightly faster rate than in September, consistent with quarterly GDP growth of 0.2%, a near- stagnation of new orders, with the worst reading for 15 months, suggests that the pace of growth may deteriorate in coming months. “A fall in employment for the first time since November casts a further cloud over the outlook. Firms are often being forced to cut employment due to squeezed profits margins. Input costs are rising but prices charged for goods and services have fallen almost continually over the past three years, with the rate of decline accelerating to the fastest seen over this period in October as companies increasingly turn to discounting to help boost sales.” Germany’s service sector grew at its slowest pace in six months, Markit says. Its service sector PMI dropped to 54.4 in October, down from 55.7 -- showing that growth slowed last month. Markit also found that sentiment among German service sector firms hit a 22-month low. Oliver Kolodseike, economist at Markit, says that: Companies are worried about the introduction of a national minimum wage in January 2015, a general economic slowdown and sluggish new order growth. Bad news from France -- its service sector has shrunk again, with activity shrinking at the fastest pace in four months. New business declined at the sharpest rate since August 2013. And staffing levels in the French private sector fell again, for the twelfth month running This meant that Markit’s Services PMI fell to 48.3, down from 48.4 in September, showing activity shrank at a slightly faster rate. Markit paints a grim picture: The performance of France’s service sector worsened further in October. Activity contracted for a second successive month, reflecting a steeper reduction in new business. Backlogs of work declined, while firms continued to cut staffing levels. Output prices decreased at the steepest rate in five years, in contrast to a further rise in input costs. Business expectations remained historically muted. Full report here. Back to the eurozone.... and Italy’s service sector has returned to growth, but firms are still laying off staff. The monthly Italian services PMI, calculated by data firm Markit, rose to 50.8 in October, up from 48.8 in September. Any reading over 50 shows growth. Markit found that business activity at Italian service providers rose slightly in October, but: employment in the sector returned to contraction after having held steady during September. Business confidence also fell. Although still positive, sentiment was the weakest in almost a year, having eased for the third time in four months Back to M&amp;S briefly.... chief executive Marc Bolland has told reporters that sales in October weren’t as badly hit by the weather. He’s also upbeat about Christmas trading: MARKS &amp; SPENCER CEO SAYS “SIGNS ARE POSITIVE” TURNAROUND PLAN IS WORKING MARKS &amp; SPENCER CEO SAYS “BETTER SET UP FOR XMAS THAN EVER BEFORE” Over to the eurozone, and Spain’s service sector has posted its 12th month of consecutive growth, as it continues to recover (slowly) from the eurozone crisis. The Spanish PMI, which measures activity across the sector, rose to 55.9 in October from 55.8 in September. Firms reported that output and new business rose a little, and hired more workers. Andrew Harker, senior economist at Markit, says: “The twelfth successive rise in activity during October means that the Spanish service sector has been able to sustain growth for a year for the first time since 2007, and with the expansion in new business picking up the recovery looks set to continue in the near-term at least. The rate of job creation was weak, but the return to hiring after employment stabilised in September provides some reassurance.” The full report was here. Richard Hunter, Head of Equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers, reckons that Marks &amp; Spencer is still a “work in progress”. He’s impressed, though, that the company managed to grow profits and gross margins despite the warm autumn (apparently) hitting clothing sales. “The profit beat and improvement to gross margins have taken investors by surprise, with the share price strongly ahead in early trade. Even so, with General Merchandising sales down, food sales up and online yet to gain traction, the summary is a familiar one, even if the initial share price reaction may suggest some optimism on prospects.” ZING. Marks &amp; Spencer shares have jumped by over 7% at the start of trading in London, to 432p. Investors are cheered that the company has raised its interim dividend by 3.2% (details), after increasing its underlying profits by 2.3%. Veteran City commentator David Buik says that M&amp;S’s results (details start here) were “not quite as bad as expected”. It’s not all bad news from Marks &amp; Spencer this morning -- the company is handing more cash than back to shareholders. M&amp;S has raised its interim dividend for the first time in several years, by 0.2p to 6.4p per share. This reflects the fact that underlying pre-tax profits rose by 2.3% in the six months to end-September, despite the latest fall in clothing and general merchandise sales. Retail analyst Nick Bubb reckons M&amp;S shares should rally when the stock market opens. Boom boom Some instant reaction: M&amp;S is planning to build on its success in food, by opening 200 more Simply Food stores over the next three years -- up from 150 previously. M&amp;S also warns that geopolitical issues, and foreign exchange movements, have hurt trading overseas: In our International business, we have delivered sales and profit growth in our Owned business, despite currency headwinds and unseasonal conditions across Europe. However, our Franchise business has been impacted by currency and political issues in our Middle East region and lower shipments, which we expect to continue into the second half of this year. On a happier note, its standalone Food stores in Paris and Hong Kong have performed “strongly”. Marks &amp; Spencer has become the latest UK retailer to warn that the unseasonably warm UK weather has hit trading. The high street chain just reported that clothing and general merchandise sales fell again in the last six months. Clothing sales have now fallen, on a like-for-like basis, for the last 13 quarters in a row! M&amp;S’s like-for-like general merchandise (GM) sales fell by 2.9% in the six months to the end of September. The decline accelerated as warm weather deterred customers from splashing out on autumn clothing. Those “unseasonal conditions in September” knocked 2.5% off its GM sales during the month. Fellow retailers SuperGroup and Next have already warned that the hot weather has hurt trading. Overall like-for-like sales in the UK are down by 0.7% during the last six months, with food sales outperforming as usual, up 1%. Marc Bolland, chief executive, is still upbeat: “M&amp;S delivered sales growth and increased profit in the first half despite a tough market, particularly in September. We are pleased with the progress we have made against our key priorities for the year: GM gross margin, improving Womenswear, driving Food growth and Cash generation.” Here’s the details: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, business and the eurozone. Coming up today.... Financial results from Marks &amp; Spencer -- city investors, and the army of M&amp;S small shareholders, will be taking a close look to see how the high street veteran performed. After several years of declining profits, the pressure is building on CEO Marc Bolland: In the economic sphere, we get new surveys of Europe’s service sector. These purchasing managers indexes (PMI) are likely to show contractions in Italy and France, but growth in Germany and Spain, and the UK. We’ll also be digesting yesterday’s news that a bunch of eurozone central bankers are losing patience with ECB president Mario Draghi. In case you missed it, Reuters reported that.... National central bankers in the euro area plan to challenge European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi on Wednesday over what they see as his secretive management style and erratic communication and will urge him to act more collegially, ECB sources said. They’re also unhappy that Draghi (apparently) faffs around with his phone rather than listening to their pearls of wisdom: “He sits there with these three mobile phones in front of him and sometimes he’s sending text messages or going out to make or take phone calls,” one source usually in the room said. On at least one occasion, a national governor has skipped his turn to speak because Draghi was not present. “This has got a bit better. He’s paying a bit more attention now,” the source said.

But the business, which has former BP boss Lord Browne on the board, has triggered much larger political tremors in London. These culminated in Ed Davey, the energy and climate change secretary, giving the go-ahead in parliament last Thursday to what optimists believe will be a shale \"revolution\" similar to the one that has sent gas prices spiralling downwards in America. But it has also unleashed a war of words with environmentalists, who not only believe that the chemicals used in fracking are dangerous but, more widely, argue it will trigger a new \"dash for gas\" that will tie the UK into fossil fuels and break climate change targets by creating higher CO2 emissions. There is no doubt that the enormous financial benefits of shale, as experienced in the US, are real enough. The price of gas has fallen 85% from a high in 2005 to just above $2 per million British thermal units earlier this year. Economists see cheap power as one of the keys to an American economic recovery, with Lakshmi Mittal, Britain's richest man and the chief executive of leading steelmaker ArcelorMittal, saying recently that cheap shale gas made him \"much more optimistic\" about investing in the US. In fact, gas prices across the Atlantic have risen slightly this year to nearly $3.50 per million BTU; but that is still less than half the amount paid in Britain and continental Europe. At a time when the UK's North Sea gas is running down fast, nuclear power stations are being taken offline due to age and coal is being phased out for pollution reasons, it is little surprise that British manufacturers have seized upon the idea of a domestic shale industry as a saviour from the problems of rising power prices and a looming \"energy crunch\". Typical of the responses is one from Corin Taylor, senior economic adviser at the Institute of Directors, who said it was \"excellent news\" that shale exploration could go ahead: \"Shale gas has great potential to create new engineering jobs, reduce our reliance on dirty fuels like coal and cut down on costly foreign imports.\" Natural gas from conventional sources plays a key role in the UK energy network: it currently accounts for almost half of all fuel used for electricity generation. Meanwhile Cuadrilla, the only firm to have drilled exploratory wells in this country, believes there could be 5.6 trillion cubic metres of shale reserves beneath the surface – although the British Geological Survey says a more likely figure is 4.2tn cubic metres. Most industry experts believe that it is impossible to give any realistic assessment on the basis of the four wells drilled by Cuadrilla so far. Yet many energy experts with no political axe to grind argue that there are key differences that make it impossible for Britain to repeat the American shale revolution. Firstly, the geology is different from the key Marcellus and Barnett shale areas of the US; secondly, land rights that encourage homeowners to cash in on shale in America are not present here; and thirdly, the sheer population density of Britain tends to discourage the drilling of wells. And that is not taking into account the opposition of the highly organised environmental lobby, led by Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace and others. So while George Osborne, a green-energy sceptic, has made clear his support for shale and a wider \"dash for gas\", his coalition partner Davey has been more circumspect. The energy secretary has downplayed hopes of a revolution, saying: \"Until more exploration work has been done, a significant number of wells fracked and production patterns established over time, it will not be possible to make any meaningful estimate of likely economically recoverable resources of shale gas in the United Kingdom.\" He has attached health and safety provisions to future fracking operations, promising that the exact nature of any chemicals used to break up rock will be made public. Davey has also commissioned a study into the possible impacts of shale gas extraction on the UK's future greenhouse gas emissions: \"This will consider the available evidence on the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions from shale gas exploitation, and the need for further research.\" Critics say this will be too little, too late. Organisations such as the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research argue the circle cannot be squared: \"Emissions from a fully developed UK shale gas industry would likely be very substantial in their own right. If the UK government is to respect its obligations under both the Copenhagen accord and low-carbon transition plan, shale gas offers no meaningful potential as even a transition fuel.\" As Cuadrilla prepares to reopen drilling operations in Lancashire, the row over shale can be expected to resume in earnest across the country."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/dec/05/fukushima-leak-radioactive-water","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-12-05T08:52:49Z","webTitle":"Fukushima plant leaks radioactive water","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/05/fukushima-leak-radioactive-water","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/dec/05/fukushima-leak-radioactive-water","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima plant leaks radioactive water","bodyText":"Large quantities of highly radioactive water have leaked through a crack in the wall of a treatment facility at the Fukushima power plant, and some may have founds its way into the sea, the plant's operator, Tokyo Electric Power [Tepco], said. The firm said as much as 45 tonnes of water had leaked through the concrete wall of a building being used to purify contaminated water that is then used to cool molten fuel in the plant's three damaged reactors. The firm has piled up sandbags to prevent further leaks but fears some water may have already found its way into a gutter that connects to the Pacific ocean about 600 metres away. Experts believe the water could contain high levels of strontium-90, a beta-emitting radioactive substance that, if ingested, can cause bone cancer. Public broadcaster NHK reported that although caesium levels in the leaked water were low, it could contain up to 130,000 becquerels per cubic centimetre of strontium, which has a half-life of 29 years. Workers temporarily halted the purification apparatus after spotting a puddle of water on Sunday. They later recorded 1.8 millisieverts [mSv] per hour of gamma radiation and 110mSv per hour of beta radiation on the surface of the puddle, the company said in a statement. It said the leak appeared to have been stemmed, adding it already had enough purified water to continue cooling the reactors as scheduled. The discovery underlines the difficulties facing Fukushima Daiichi workers as they struggle to contain and reuse large volumes of contaminated water. In October, the Institute for Radiological Protection and Nuclear Safety, a French government body, said the plant had been responsible for the biggest-ever discharge of radioactive material into the sea. More details have emerged, meanwhile, of the workers' desperate struggle to save the power plant in the moments after it was struck by a tsunami of up to 14 metres in height on the afternoon of 11 March. One of the unnamed employees, who was in charge of the main control room at the time of the disaster, recalled how, at one point, he had begged colleagues not to abandon the plant. He realised that the tsunami had caused a disaster when the lights on the plant's control panels flickered, and then went out. \"I came to realise that a tsunami had hit the site when one of the workers came rushing into the control room, shouting 'Sea water is gushing in!'\" he said. \"I felt at a complete loss after the power went down.\" He said the plant's \"anxious\" employees argued over how to contain the crisis, with one suggesting they had no choice but to flee. \"He said: 'Is there any point in staying when there is nothing we can do?' \"I bowed my head and begged them to stay.\" Workers at the site in the aftermath of the accident – quickly nicknamed the Fukushima 50 because they initially worked in groups of around that number – have been hailed as heroes for remaining at their posts and preventing an even greater catastrophe. One recalled how he had volunteered to enter a reactor building to manually open a ventilation valve in an attempt to ease the pressure building inside. \"We put on full protective gear, but we couldn't possibly let younger workers do that job as we were entering an area with high levels of radiation,\" he said. \"When I got there, I heard a strange, loud popping sound from below, and when I tried to start work, my black rubber boots melted [due to the heat].\" The workers echoed fears voiced recently by the plant's chief, Masao Yoshida, who has taken early retirement due to an unspecified illness, that there were moments when they believed they would die. \"We experienced big aftershocks and had to keep fleeing [from possible tsunami] up the hill still wearing our protective masks,\" said one worker. Another recalled how he and his colleagues constantly worried about being electrocuted as they worked while standing in puddles of water."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/marketforceslive/2013/feb/04/ftse-100-fall-spain-italy-broker-notes","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2013-02-04T16:57:01Z","webTitle":"FTSE sees biggest daily fall since last July as Spain and Italy unsettle investors","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2013/feb/04/ftse-100-fall-spain-italy-broker-notes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/marketforceslive/2013/feb/04/ftse-100-fall-spain-italy-broker-notes","fields":{"headline":"FTSE sees biggest daily fall since last July as Spain and Italy unsettle investors","bodyText":"Leading shares suffered their biggest one day fall since July last year as the new year rally stumbled badly. Renewed worries about the eurozone were behind much of the slump, with growing political concerns adding to the region's economic woes. Spanish bond yields were on the rise again as corruption allegations prompted fears of government instability, while the uncertain outcome of the forthcoming Italian election also began to trouble investors. So with European markets also under pressure, the FTSE 100 finished 100.40 points lower at 6246.84. Angus Campbell, head of market analysis at Capital Spreads, said: A large bucket of cold water was poured onto the equity market rally today as we saw the first sign of nerves from investors so far this year. As is often the case, a sharp sell off can catch people off guard, making the move lower more pronounced than anticipated as people frantically reduce their exposure to stocks. The other slightly worrisome signal about today's move lower is that volumes were higher than average, indicating that this is a concerted move to the downside with investors running for cover and could possibly be followed by further weakness in the days ahead. With little in the way of corporate news, a number of broker recommendations also made an impact. Vodafone fell 2.95p to 170.5p after Citigroup cut from buy to neutral, and suggested the mobile phone group could go on an acquisition spree at a time when growth in its European markets was showing signs of weakness. Citi said: Addressing shortcomings in Vodafone's convergence offering may require M&amp;A in both consumer and business, in our view. In B2B this is unlikely to require a huge deployment of capital but the numbers get larger to achieve a sizeable consumer footprint. Assets are scarce with cable and, in places, unbundled local loop operators, still short of national reach. That said, acquisition could be both lower-risk and higher-return than own build, and could provide immediate scale in entertainment, crucial for driving broadband market share. At the same time Societe Generale repeated its sell recommendation on the mobile phone group. Meggitt lost 11.4p to 430p, following a downgrade from UBS, which moved from buy to neutral on the engineering group. Antofagasta fell 29.5p to 1924.5p as Nomura cut its price target from £14 to £12.50 and repeated its neutral rating: We struggle to see Antofagasta outperforming given its declining earnings profile over the medium term and arguably no near-term organic growth following the suspension of the Antucoya project. However, we caution against the notion that Antofagasta is set to significantly de-rate versus the mining sector given its high-quality asset base and potential for a dividend surprise over the near term.

The figures, obtained by the Guardian, come as the new energy secretary, Ed Davey, dedicated his first speech in the job on Wednesday to announcing new measures to step up home energy efficiency amid concern about public opposition to the cost of government policies. Annual forecasts published by the Department for Energy and Climate Change (Decc) calculate by 2020 household heating and electricity bills will be driven higher by wholesale gas and oil prices, but will be on average £94 lower as a result of measures to increase renewable energy in lieu of fossil fuels, and cut overall energy use through efficiency. But a deeper analysis requested by the Guardian shows that only one in three homes, or about 10.3m households, will see the predicted reductions in their combined bills as a result of installing one or more of the renewable energy or efficiency measures, or receiving the Warm Home Discount for low-income and vulnerable households. Meanwhile the majority of bill payers, 19.1m, will see an average increase in their bills, over and above the extra costs of rising fossil fuel prices and huge investment in the electricity grid. These figures follow months of criticism about the cost to home owners of government policies, with critics questioning official forecasts of how much money will be saved by putting smart meters into all homes so bill payers and energy firms can manage the amount used more carefully. The analysis seen by the Guardian also shows the government has based its forecasts for money saved on an oil price up to US$20 a barrel higher than those used by organisations such as the International Energy Agency – with the effect of increasing the estimated savings and flattering the effect on their policies. Davey, in his first speech since becoming energy secretary following Chris Huhne's resignation last week, claimed that a big uptake of loans to lag lofts and walls could save Britain the equivalent energy of two nuclear power stations. Announcing a new Energy Efficiency Deployment Office (EEDO) in London, the Liberal Democrat minister said: \"I'm hugely enthusiastic about energy efficiency. It's the cheapest way of cutting carbon – and cutting bills for consumers. It has to be right at the heart of what we do. \"EEDO will be a centre of expertise, challenging our work and making energy efficiency real and relevant to people's everyday lives. Two out of three consumers think their home is wasting energy, but only one in three is going to do anything about it. That has to change. We need to get out there and show people what energy efficiency can really do for them.\" The speech at the Peter Jones store in London was the second time since his appointment that Davey has talked about energy efficiency, which officials say is key to making sure household bills are not driven too high by government policies. On Wednesday a Decc spokesman defended those policies, saying that overall average bills would be lower than with no government action, and that even homes that paid higher bills as a result would benefit. \"The point of a low-carbon Britain is keeping the lights on, not being increasingly dependent on imports from sometimes volatile parts of the world, and also make sure Britain gets its share of the green industrial revolution,\" he said. Responding to the use of a higher \"central\" oil price forecast, the spokesman added: \"You have to make some extreme assumptions about oil and gas prices getting a lot cheaper in the future for this set of policies not to be very sensible for the British consumer.\" Green MP Caroline Lucas said all householders should benefit from green energy policies, but warned that the government needed to do more to encourage the take-up of renewable technology, such as wind turbines and solar panels, as well energy efficiency make-overs. \"There's no doubt it will cost money to transform our ageing energy infrastructure to deliver the green, secure power we need for the future, but failing to wean ourselves off oil and gas will cost us much more,\" said Lucas. \"Unfortunately, the government's plan to make these measures happen falls far short of what's needed. Ed Davey must now make it a personal priority to strengthen this weak and underfunded programme to maximise take up and deliver a good deal for households.\" Decc's figures show that in both cost and as a percentage of income, all income groups and almost all household types will pay more for energy bills in 2020 if they do not implement any green energy measures or receive the Warm Home Discount. More worryingly, the increase in energy costs as a proportion of household income is greatest for the 10% lowest earners and pensioners."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"global/2011/mar/29/guardian-weekly-letters-1-april","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-29T12:59:02Z","webTitle":"Guardian Weekly Letters, 1 April 2011","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2011/mar/29/guardian-weekly-letters-1-april","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global/2011/mar/29/guardian-weekly-letters-1-april","fields":{"headline":"Guardian Weekly Letters, 1 April 2011","bodyText":"The eyes of the world are focused on the nuclear disaster unfolding in Fukushima (Japanese face their darkest fears, 18 March). I am reminded of the commercials that used to be on TV here, where the local power companies would hire attractive actresses and fit them out with helmets to be filmed visiting nuclear power plants and assuring the gullible public that everything looked so clean and safe, and how lucky we all were to have this endless source of \"clean\" energy. Those commercials disappeared after there was a series of accidents at these same \"safe\" plants. The Japanese government has always tried to convince the public that nuclear power plants are safe, and built to withstand strong earthquakes. Even allowing that the recent Japanese earthquake was unusually powerful, I have never believed the propaganda for a moment, but it would appear that most people did – or perhaps wanted to. Watching the scenes on the TV news of French citizens protesting against nuclear power, it seems that we needed a disaster like the one we have had here to remind the world of the very real dangers. Sadly, people's memories are short, and as soon as the news of the Fukushima accident is no longer \"news\", then I suppose it will be life as usual until the next major earthquake strikes. John Ryder Kyoto, Japan • The new 1,600MW Oikiluoto nuclear power plant in Finland is reported to cost $5.5bn. That's $3.40 per watt of installed capacity. By contrast a 120-watt solar panel can be purchased today in Dili, East Timor, for $300 ($2.50 per watt). Admittedly, solar panels cost about twice as much here in Australia, but this is simply a function of retailers charging what the market will bear. Of course, neither solar panels nor nuclear plants produce electricity all the time. Typically, nuclear plants are in operation about 80% of the time, while panels obviously only produce during the day. Building in these factors, we get $4.25 for nuclear, $10 for solar. It would seem so far that nuclear is still more than twice as cheap. But nuclear needs a distribution system that may cost more than the plant itself. It also needs fuel and operators. There are system losses when solar-produced power is stored in batteries, but these would usually be matched by losses in a grid. Nuclear is far from carbon-neutral, and somewhat dangerous, so why would anyone bother? Richard Staples Byron Bay, NSW, Australia Multicultural Britain Allow me to comment on Gary Younge's article, We have always had a range of cultures (18 March). I've always felt that Britain is much more relaxed about being a multicultural society than my home country of Germany, where the majority of ethnic Germans still distinguish between Ausländer (foreigners) or, more politically correct nowadays, Migranten, and the rest of the population. So Mekonnen Mesghena of the Heinrich Böll Foundation is absolutely right in his assessment of Germany denying immigration and diversity. Whereas most people oppose racist violence and extreme rightwing parties, xenophobia is very much alive in mainstream society. There is still a striking lack of diversity in all areas of life. Young Muslims of Turkish descent are particularly discriminated against, as a number of academic surveys have shown. Fatih will be much less likely to get a well-paid job than Matthias, even though the two may have the same qualifications. But worse than this is the fact that many ethnic Germans are at most indifferent to racially motivated inequality. At worst they claim that Muslims in particular will never be part of our society – another example of how people are denying reality. Germany lags far behind Britain, where a great number of cities and communities pride themselves on the diversity of their population. Unfortunately, in Germany this is not the norm but still an exception. Jan Schwab Freiburg, Germany The power of coincidence Hats off and a huge hurrah for Richard Wiseman's piece on precognitive dreams and the law of large numbers (Our nightly forebodings, 18 March). A population of 68 million will produce on average 272 million dreams in a single night. As Wiseman points out, it would be truly surprising then if, in the course of a year, some of those dreams did not resemble events that occur in the wide-awake world. Dreams with high emotional impact, whether of peace, beauty, anxiety or fear, like similar waking events, will inevitably be the most memorable. Of course, frightening dreams are those most likely to awaken us mid-dream, and thus to be most readily and frequently remembered. I dreamt that my younger brother and I were in a freight wagon. Through the open door we could see that the train had begun to move. It was time to get off or be taken somewhere we did not want to go. My brother went first, but, in the instant that he leapt through the door, the venue of the dream changed from a slow-moving freight wagon to the top of an immensely tall tower. I watched in horror as he hurtled to an inevitable end far below. Needless to say I awoke from the fright. My brother, 40 years on, is healthy. Think, however, of the dream related to me by a young makeup artist on a film shoot in Nova Scotia. She dreamt that her parents had appeared at her second-floor bedroom window. \"David is dead\", they told her. Three days later, her cousin, David, died of asphyxiation when an Air Canada plane caught fire on the runway. It is hardly remarkable that the young lady held the unshakable belief that she had dreamt of her cousin's fate – which, of course, she had, but, as Wiseman points out, only coincidentally. The power of extreme coincidence is immense. After working late into the morning, many years ago, I took a taxi back to my flat. Later that morning, I found my wallet was missing. During the ensuing day, I hailed a taxi – the second of three available cabs cruising toward me down the street. It was the taxi I had taken many hours before and my wallet lay wedged between the seat and the door. It was three days before the impact of that coincidence began to fade and decades on that event is etched on my memory. If a coincidence concerning the loss of a wallet can be so powerful, what of a coincidence concerning the loss of a loved one? It is no wonder we remember the dreams that coincide with waking reality. Michael J Reynolds Milverton, Somerset, UK • I wonder what Richard Wiseman, writing on our nightly forebodings, would make of my dreams that were certainly not in that category. Friends who had been married for a long time without children had returned to their home country to start the process of adoption. I dreamt that she was pregnant, and reported my dream to friends. The couple returned weeks later with the happy news of her totally unexpected pregnancy, whereupon our friends looked at me amazed. On another occasion I told my husband of my dream that a friend of ours who had returned to UK for good at the end of his contract was back in Tanzania. Highly unlikely, but he turned up out of the blue the very next day. Both very happy dreams, so what's the explanation – just wishful thinking? I'd like to know. Frances Wilson Dar es Salaam, Tanzania Uganda's bananamania What has happened in Uganda is the collapse of a monoculture (Africa's banana republic turns to GM strains to save staple crop of farmers, 18 March). People in Uganda just love bananas. The number of plants have risen hugely and then the clone has collapsed. Scientists have inserted a gene from the sweet pepper that makes a protein that is toxic to these bacteria but as we all know – like TB, resistant bacteria will arise. One resistant bacterium will then cause the collapse once more. To contain this problem, scientists will have to educate Ugandans to eat foods other than bananas. Are there potatoes that can be grown there? What about taro? We eat pumpkin and buttercup in New Zealand: do these plants grow and fruit there? If everyone goes back to eating these new GM bananas for breakfast, lunch and dinner, it will all fall over once more. Theo Wilms New Plymouth, New Zealand Briefly • In Sierra Leone 50 years ago, our house guard's excuse for being supine was \"Ah no slip, pa. Ah just rest me eyes\" (18 March). Ted Webber Buderim, Queensland, Australia • Perhaps most of us agree with the feeling of \"cool\" when wearing sunglasses (18 March). But many do not: many of my clients who have schizophrenia appear to wear sunglasses indoors as a way to feel protected/apart from others and themselves in a psychotic state. I offer this to add to Lucy Tobin's \"the things people do 'without thinking'\".

Europe is in deep crisis, the pace of activity in the global economy is easing, and the dollar is strong. Under these conditions, oil prices would normally be falling, yet the cost of crude has risen strongly in the first few days of 2012 and Brent crude was changing hands at just over $113 a barrel on Thursday, having been above $114 at one point. It's not hard to see why prices are hardening. The US and the European Union are threatening oil sanctions against Iran that may be triggered by the end of the month. Washington and Brussels believe tough action is needed in the dispute over Iran's nuclear programme, but there is a risk of collateral damage to the already shaky economies of the developed world. Iran is an important oil producer and exports around 2.3m barrels a day. The west has an assurance from Saudi Arabia that it will make up any shortfall from Iran, but as analysts from Commerzbank have noted, this would use up virtually all of the spare capacity from the world's biggest producer. The last time that happened, back in 2008, oil prices climbed to almost $150 a barrel. The expectation in western capitals is that the threat of sanctions will bring Tehran to heel, although there is not much sign yet of this happening. On the contrary, Iran is negotiating with China in the hope of finding a market for its crude (the Chinese, predictably enough, are driving a hard bargain) and is hinting at retaliatory action by threatening to block the strait of Hormuz, the strategically vital waterway at the tip of the Gulf, through which 70% of Opec's exports are transported. Although this appears to be merely sabre-rattling at this stage, even the hint of a supply problem from the Middle East has been enough to ensure that no oil trader wants to be short of crude. Strikes in Nigeria over the removal of gasoline subsidies have not helped the mood. What does all this mean? In the very short term, there is little prospect of crude prices coming down to the sort of levels that would be expected given the current state of global demand – $75 a barrel or thereabouts. On the contrary, there is a higher chance of Brent climbing above $120 a barrel than there is of it falling below $100. In the slightly longer term, much depends on who wins the game of chicken. If the Iranians tough it out and are prepared to risk military action with the west by closing the strait of Hormuz, the cost of crude could easily rocket above $150 a barrel. That would, without question, lead to a deep global recession in 2012. Policymakers in the west are banking on weaker inflationary pressure this year boosting real incomes, and have certainly not factored a serious oil shock into the equation. And, as every finance minister and central banker knows, each and every recession since 1973 has been associated with a sharp increase in the cost of crude."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/oct/31/john-hayes-wind-power-spin","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-10-31T10:22:00Z","webTitle":"John Hayes's wind power warning is clever spin or national betrayal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/oct/31/john-hayes-wind-power-spin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/oct/31/john-hayes-wind-power-spin","fields":{"headline":"John Hayes's wind power warning is clever spin or national betrayal","bodyText":"It is either a clever but cynical piece of spin or an abandoning of the national interest to placate a noisy minority. It could in fact be both. The loquacious new energy minister John Hayes's pledge to \"protect our green and pleasant land\" by fighting against new onshore wind farms could turn out to be hot air, given that thousands of new turbines are already in the planning system. Intervening in that would be a gale-force political move generating fierce blow-back, already underway from Hayes's boss, LibDem energy secretary Ed Davey. But that is what Hayes darkly hints at and what many Conservatives want, perhaps by chopping further at the subsidies wind farms receive. If, backed by David Cameron and George Osborne, Hayes prevails then the energy minister who also claimed to be \"the peoples' minister\" will have betrayed them. Opinion polls have shown time after time that the public overwhelmingly supports wind power, even when close to their homes. They understand that the real threat to our green and pleasant land comes from climate change and the ever weirder weather it brings: the floods that devastated middle England in 2000 were made three times more likely by global warming. Hayes has also betrayed energy bill payers at a time when bills are soaring so high that the Prime minister felt forced to invent new policy on the hoof. Here are the facts. Clean energy is not optional, either because of legally binding carbon targets or practical energy security concerns, and onshore wind is the cheapest form of low-carbon energy. It costs about the same as gas – without the greenhouse gases. Rejecting onshore wind farms means pushing up homeowners' energy bills because that lost energy must be replaced by more expensive alternatives, such as offshore wind farms that cost not far off double. This is not, as Hayes stupidly describes it, \"a bourgeois left article of faith based on some academic perspective.\" However Hayes does raise one important and real problem: \"We can no longer have wind turbines imposed on communities.\" The one genuine objection to wind farms is that you don't like the look of them. But people faced with turbines built by vast, faceless energy companies who import the hardware to their backyard and then export all the benefits understandably feel invaded. When the turbines are community owned, or local people at least benefit, that sense of violation vanishes. The wind farm at Fintry in Scotland demonstrates this, as does Germany, where over 60% of renewable energy is community owned and opposition to wind farms barely exists. In the UK, community ownership is well under 10%. A consultation on wind power now under way gives Hayes two edges to the sword he is waving at the turbines. First, it will examine how to correct two decades of failure to promote community ownership. This is where the real solution to the wind war lies. But second, it will examine – yet again – whether the subsidies all new technologies need to break the grip of incumbents could be cut further for wind power. Subsidies do indeed taper down over time – unless they are for nuclear power – but there is clear evidence that further cuts now would be needlessly damaging. That evidence already forced Cameron and Osborne to back down from a earlier attempt to slash wind subsidies this summer. So Hayes appears to have been tasked with finding different evidence. He certainly appears to be able to hold two conflicting thoughts in his head at the same time. Yesterday, as he threw the future of wind farms into doubt, he was also telling a renewables industry conference that he recognised the \"need for sufficient certainty to invest in the future.\" In the end it will come down to a battle within the coalition to choose between two polls. Will it act on the wishes of the whole British people, repeatedly expressed in opinion polls. Or will the poll that is prioritised be the general election ballot box in those Conservative marginal seats where an ill wind blows?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"local-government-network/2012/nov/23/eric-pickles-council-finance-cuts","type":"article","sectionId":"public-leaders-network","sectionName":"Public Leaders Network","webPublicationDate":"2012-11-23T09:00:03Z","webTitle":"Second year itch sets in as Pickles' halo finally starts to slip","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/local-government-network/2012/nov/23/eric-pickles-council-finance-cuts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/local-government-network/2012/nov/23/eric-pickles-council-finance-cuts","fields":{"headline":"Second year itch sets in as Pickles' halo finally starts to slip","bodyText":"Significant cracks are opening up in local government's finances. The sector's optimism and can-do attitude cannot disguise the fact that some councils are beginning to sink – and it is putting pressure on Eric Pickles, the secretary of state for communities and local government. The implosion of West Somerset district council coincides with an Audit Commission study that reveals more than a third of councils are showing \"financial stress\". Meanwhile, research by Local Government Chronicle indicates that up to a half of councils could reject the government's council tax freeze. West Somerset is holding crisis talks with the Department for Communities and Local Government after revealing that it is heading for a finance gap of 26% of net expenditure by 2019–20. A Local Government Association report has highlighted the option of the Boundary Commission reviewing the size and shape of the districts in the area, but neighbouring authorities have been decidedly lukewarm on the proposal. Those close to the talks hope the prospect of a new nuclear power station being built at Hinkley Point will start to make a takeover look more attractive. But West Somerset is unlikely to be the last council to go to the wall. The LGA believes two or three other councils are close to the same predicament. And it seems inevitable that the next round of cuts after the 2015 general election will push more authorities – probably from among the districts and small unitaries – into the abyss. There is a handful of districts that are heading in the opposite direction. Not for them the graph of doom. With little or no debt and strong local growth prospects, they have what one finance director dubbed a \"graph of joy\", with the expectation of a significant and growing surplus in coming years. But this cannot distract from the severity of the national picture. The Audit Commission's analysis Tough Times, published earlier this week, is in many ways a tribute to the skill with which local government is managing the cuts. It reveals that this year, according to auditors, 9% of councils have experienced \"high financial stress\", with another 30% showing \"medium\" financial stress. The problems are largely driven by a toxic mix of high cuts and low reserves, sometimes exacerbated by weak management. The commission warns that one in eight councils are already at financial risk, while a further one in four are heading for problems. Yet the government is still in denial. At the communities and local government select committee last week, DCLG officials claimed the LGA's report Funding Outlook for Councils from 2010-11 to 2019-20, published in the summer, used the \"most pessimistic interpretation\" of available data. This simply isn't true. On the contrary, as this column noted, the LGA underpinned its work with optimistic assumptions about efficiency and income. By trying to rubbish the LGA report, the department only undermines its own credibility. The growing number of councils having the courage to ignore the government's attempts to impose a council tax freeze is another setback for Pickles in his attempts to dictate to local government. Having had his totemic support for weekly bin collections rejected (his latest fulminating on this issue merely emphasising his impotence) and failed to introduce more city mayors, Pickles is losing his grip on another policy area. The criticism of Pickles voiced at this week's County Councils Network conference is indicative of the diminishing respect for him. At the Conservative councillors' group meeting there was palpable anger at the minister's failure to acknowledge the great strides in efficiency that local government is making, and the fact that he has not reflected local government's concerns in policy discussions with other parts of government. Neither did they welcome being lectured on whether they need a chief executive. One person close to the meeting said that in the past few months there had been \"a massive change\" in the attitude of Tory councillors to Pickles. However bellicose the secretary of state becomes, councils know that they will almost certainly be shot of him by 2015, whereas the financial problems they face will outlast him by many years. That is why councils of all parties are making decisions on issues such as council tax and bin collections on the basis of their strategic priorities, rather than any short-term benefit to be gained from ingratiating themselves with the minister.

It also presents a major challenge to the military-dominated regime in Algiers – still in the shadow of a decade of bloody civil war – which had been accused of having an ambiguous stance towards the Mali crisis. Algeria will now firmly be dragged into resolving the Mali conflict, while also dealing with the return of major action by Islamist groups on its home turf. The hostage-taking has spelled out the complexities of the unrest in the Sahel: a tangled mix of communal tensions, economic struggle, desertification, poverty, criminality, kidnapping and smuggling, which shifts seamlessly across borders. With six days of French airstrikes failing to erode the Islamist gains in Mali, French special forces prepared to launch a land assault on Wednesday around Diabaly, 250 miles (450 km) from the capital. France's aim is to secure the vast desert area seized last year by an Islamist alliance, which combines al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) – the terrorist network's north African wing – with Mali's homegrown Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa (Mojwa) and Ansar Dine rebel groups. But the Algerian hostage drama at the BP oilfield far away to the north at the Algerian-Libyan border marks a turning point and a widening of the game. Attacks on oil-rich Algeria's hydrocarbon facilities are very rare, despite the country's decades of fighting an Islamist insurgency, mostly in the north. Jon Marks, associate fellow at Chatham House, London's leading foreign affairs thinktank, said: \"The attack is remarkable for a number of reasons. \"If you look at Algeria's conflict of the 1990s, out of which AQIM sprang, the major oil and gas fields of the deep south, a strategic interest to Europe, were not attacked. Even in Algeria's bloody history, this is the first time there has been major attack on a hydrocarbon facility. \"It shows the degree to which the events in Mali are an international Sahel and Sahara-wide issue. These groups are international: including Malians, people who came from the Libya conflict, but also from Algeria and Mauritania.\" He said the attack showed how deep-rooted those groups were. \"The groups we are now calling AQIM, that the French military are targeting, have roots going back decades in the region. They have been involved in cigarette smuggling, electronic goods smuggling, guns, drugs, a lot of criminality.\" He described it as a potent \"interface\" where criminality meets politics in an area that is \"more and more desperate\". Algeria, the region's economic and military powerhouse where the regime of generals holds firm despite the Arab spring elsewhere, had been a major opponent of foreign armed intervention in Mali, preferring negotiations. Until now, it fiercely clung to its policy of non-intervention in its neighbours. But has now opened its airspace to the French air force, a historic event, and vowed to secure its vast desert border with Mali, an undertaking commentators say is almost impossible in the poorly patrolled desert wastes. Although an ally of the US and France in fighting terrorism for years, Algeria has been accused by some of playing a double game in the Sahel where Islamist groups have flourished since the country's bloody war of independence. The regime's involvement in Mali and the Sahel will now become more of a focus, as the conflict looks likely to be drawn out. A poll on Wednesday found 64% of French people felt the Mali intervention would increase the risk of a terrorist attack on French soil, and armed patrols were in force at potential targets such as the Eiffel Tower. France had been acutely aware that hostage-taking in the Sahel would be the key immediate risk of its sudden Mali intervention. Unlike Algerian terrorist operations in the 1990s, AQIM has never struck on French soil. But the militant groups that seized control of northern Mali last year had targeted foreigners for years on their own turf. They already hold seven French hostages as well as four Algerian diplomats, seized several years ago. AQIM has made tens of millions of dollars from kidnapping Algerian businessmen or political figures for ransom, as well as foreigners. On the same day that France launched its sudden Mali intervention last week, it staged a rescue attempt of a French intelligence agent held for more than three years by rebels in Somalia, and referred by the fake name of Denis Allex. If the French rescue mission to save Allex was destined to deliver a warning against hostage-taking and head off reprisals against French hostages, the operation went spectacularly wrong. Two French soldiers died and the hostage was presumed to have been killed by his jailers during the failed assault. The French president, François Hollande, was at pains once again on Wednesday to say France had \"no interest\" in Mali and was just \"serving peace\". Hollande emphasised his promise to break with murky post-colonial relations of the past. Mali is small beer within the wider context of French economic interests in west Africa, but Mali's neighbours are a different matter. Niger's uranium services one third of the French nuclear power stations which produce most of the country's electricity. It was in Niger that workers for French nuclear firm Areva were kidnapped in 2010, four are still held in the Sahel. Algeria – Africa's biggest country and France's biggest African economic partner – is a major exporter of oil and gas to Europe. The oil field hostage-taking shows the wider global interests that could now come into play."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/jul/14/george-osborne-green-energy-standoff","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-07-14T17:44:38Z","webTitle":"George Osborne in standoff over coalition's green energy plans","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/14/george-osborne-green-energy-standoff","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/jul/14/george-osborne-green-energy-standoff","fields":{"headline":"George Osborne in standoff over coalition's green energy plans","bodyText":"George Osborne's Treasury has refused to co-operate with a powerful committee of MPs preparing the coalition's flagship plans for low-carbon, affordable energy in what is being seen as further evidence of the chancellor's hostility to the green agenda, the Observer can reveal. In an extraordinary standoff, the Treasury has refused to send a minister to answer the concerns of the cross-party energy and climate change select committee – prompting a furious response from the committee's Tory chair, Tim Yeo. Further riling the body, which has been asked by ministers to scrutinise the draft energy bill for parliament, the junior Treasury minister, Chloe Smith, has subsequently even refused to answer a series of written questions, which MPs believe must be addressed if the plans to reform the electricity market are to become workable. The dispute is expected to become public next week, when the committee publishes a report on the bill. The Treasury is likely to face strong criticism for standing in the way of the legislative process and failing to address the concerns of potential investors in clean energy, who say that flaws in the legislation, as currently drafted, will endanger the quest for cleaner energy at affordable prices. Earlier this year, the chancellor was in a furious dispute with the solar energy sector over subsidy levels. At the time, the Observer revealed that he was planning to cut subsidies for wind farms by 25% following pressure from more than 100 Tory MPs. Ministers now say that, with a quarter of the UK's generating capacity shutting down over the next 10 years as old coal and nuclear power stations are closed, more than £110bn in new investment will be needed to build the equivalent of 20 large power stations and upgrade the grid. They say that in the longer term, by 2050, electricity demand is expected to double, \"as we shift more transport and heating onto the electricity grid\". The resulting challenge is to provide enough clean energy at low prices. In the Queen's speech in May it was announced that the energy bill would \"propose reform of the electricity market to deliver secure, clean and affordable electricity and ensure prices are fair\"."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/feb/21/rocky-flats-fukushima-nuclear-folly","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-02-21T23:51:00Z","webTitle":"From Rocky Flats to Fukushima: this nuclear folly | Naomi Wolf","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/feb/21/rocky-flats-fukushima-nuclear-folly","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/feb/21/rocky-flats-fukushima-nuclear-folly","fields":{"headline":"From Rocky Flats to Fukushima: this nuclear folly","bodyText":"In March 2011, novelist Kristen Iversen's memoir, Full Body Burden: Growing Up in the Nuclear Shadow of Rocky Flats, was waiting sedately among piles of other manuscripts at various publishing houses. Then, Japan was hit by a tsunami, and the cooling systems of the Fukushima nuclear reactor were overwhelmed, giving the world apocalyptic images of toxic floods and floating cars, of whole provinces made uninhabitable. Immediately, Iversen's book was auctioned, and the timing of its publication, in June, could not be better – since, incredibly, in the shadow of the Fukushima disaster, and even as Japan and other nations see movements against the use of nuclear power ever again – President Obama is planning more investment in nuclear energy. The US is soon to start construction on several new reactors for the first time in three decades. Iversen, a softspoken woman with a laid-back western vibe, wearing jeans and lavender scarf, seems an unlikely prophet of nuclear catastrophe. But her message is searing. She grew up in a small town near Rocky Flats, Colorado, where a secret nuclear weapons plant built over 70,000 plutonium \"triggers\" for nuclear bombs. Iversen spoke with me this week about her research in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico, where we were at a writer's conference. She explained that \"triggers\" was a euphemism: the plant, which, throughout her childhood, was so secret that her mother believed they made cleaning supplies, was actually producing plutonium \"buttons\". In other words, these were the nuclear bombs themselves; they needed only a casing of explosives to be activated. \"They made Nagasaki bombs in my backyard,\" she explains. Unknown to the families living in the shadow of the classified facility, deadly plutonium particles were seeded among the stunning beauty of the mountain landscape. As Iversen grew up, she became aware of the growing incidence of bizarre cancers being diagnosed in local children. Iversen's reporting, extensive interviews, and review of FBI and EPA documents, shows how classifying a toxic nuclear site led to the ruin of hundreds of lives – and continues to pose ever-escalating threats as the legacy of what we know about such nuclear contamination is being swept under the rug by developers, energy lobbyists and government agencies colluding with them, at the risk of exposing more of us, more severely. The nature of the cover-up is incredible: in 1989, the FBI joined forces with the EPA to raid on the plant. The plant, in turn, was owned by the Department of Energy. \"It's the only time in the history of our country that, to my knowledge, two government agencies have raided another,\" notes Iversen. A grand jury investigation followed the raid, and jurors called for indictments against Rockwell, the manufacturer, and Department of Energy officials. In spite of this, not one indictment was ever issued. The jurors, furious, actually wrote their own report on the contamination and the suppression of the facts – which, astoundingly, still remains under seal. But cancer rates are telling the tale: they remain elevated in neighborhoods around Rocky Flats 30 years on (plutonium has a half-life of 24,000 years). Recent tests confirm earlier findings: there is still contamination in the soil. Although there is a scientific consensus that no exposure is safe, no matter how brief, Iversen reports: \"There's a big push in Denver right now to build a highway, the Jefferson Parkway, on the contaminated area. This is all prime real estate and many developers and city politicians are pushing to develop the area and pretend that Rocky Flats never existed.\" So, profit motives are driving the push to develop lands that, according to scientists, can never be inhabited safely again. And profit motives are driving an even more demented plan on a state-by-state level, astoundingly, to ship American schoolchildren into these no-go areas. Clean-up of nuclear contamination is expensive, and laws allow an area to remain as is, with high levels of contaminants in the soil, so long as they are designated \"wildlife refuges\". To save money and effort, the US government, as well as individual state governments around the country, are now pushing to turn former nuclear weapons sites around the nation into wildlife refuges, which schoolchildren would be taken to visit on class trips. Nuclear scientists Iversen interviewed are horrified by these plans, arguing that these areas should be permanently closed off to the public and declared \"National Sacrifice Zones\". And as if enough damage had not been done, a new nuclear pit production facility is planned for Los Alamos, New Mexico, with the capability of producing up to 450 plutonium triggers per year. Although the accident at Fukushima raised global awareness about the lasting, overwhelming dangers to human beings of radioactive contamination, the money that the energy lobby sees in building more nuclear facilities is just too good to rein in, catastrophe or no catastrophe. US energy policy, driven by industry lobbyists, remains committed to developing nuclear power, even as nations around the world are canceling their own nuclear plans: last month alone, Germany spent $2.15tn to abandon nuclear power, a decision taken after witnessing Japan's 2011 nuclear disaster. \"At a time when the world is supposed to be decreasing the nuclear arsenal, our government is talking about producing nuclear triggers again. We need to pay attention,\" warns Iversen. While the rest of the world, especially countries whose legislatures are less dominated by special interests, do the sane thing regarding nuclear power and the threat of catastrophe, the US scampers merrily in the direction of madness. President Obama recently announced – as if this were a good thing – that the Department of Energy has given the green light to an $8bn loan guarantee program to build two, brand new nuclear power plants in Georgia. This, in spite of scientific warnings about dangers posed by those plants' risk to local residents by nuclear waste disposal issues. There have been numerous nuclear disasters or near-disasters, besides Fukushima, in recent decades: they include the Mayak facility in Russia, as well as spills and contamination at other former nuclear weapons sites around the United States such as Hanford and Fernald. Iversen, who has family members who've experienced tumors and other cancer scares, worries about her own health. For her, the time to sound the alarm about America's plans for a new generation of nuclear facilities is now. \"One fact is for sure: there is no safe level of exposure to plutonium. One millionth of a gram, particularly if it is inhaled into the lungs, can cause cancer. \"Rocky Flats happened in my backyard. [This will be] happening in everyone's backyard.\" • Editor's note: This article originally missplaced Los Alamos in Texas; this was amended to New Mexico on 24 February 2012"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/apr/28/unregulated-unsafe-pakistan-nuclear-reactors","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-28T07:00:00Z","webTitle":"Underpowered and unsafe, Pakistan's nuclear reactors are just big boys' toys | Rina Saeed Khan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/apr/28/unregulated-unsafe-pakistan-nuclear-reactors","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/apr/28/unregulated-unsafe-pakistan-nuclear-reactors","fields":{"headline":"Underpowered and unsafe, Pakistan's nuclear reactors are just big boys' toys","bodyText":"Shrouded in secrecy and jealously guarded by the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, there is little public debate about Pakistan's nuclear safety record in the wake of what is happening at Fukushima. There are two main reactors used for energy production in Pakistan: the ageing plant on the coast near Karachi (Kanupp) and the nuclear plant near Chashma Barrage on the Indus River (Chasnupp I). Between them, they provide only about 350 MW of energy, just 2% of Pakistan's energy demand. A second nuclear reactor at Chashma (Chasnupp II) is being tested and should start operations soon. They are extremely costly, at about US $1bn for each of the Chasma reactors, plus they are very unsafe, according to two of the country's top physicists who teach at the Lahore University of Management Sciences. \"Kanupp only produces 50MW while Chasnupp I produces 300MW. Chasnupp II only came on line in March this year and will produce another 300MW as well,\" says nuclear physicist Dr Pervez Hoodhboy. \"The PAEC would become irrelevant without them – it is a matter of ego for them to keep the reactors going … they are nothing more than toys.\" Kanupp, which is under repairs, is currently being run at only 30% of its capacity. \"It generates enough electricity to power just 3% of the city [Karachi]\", says physics professor A H Nayyar. To make matters worse, the safety aspect of the plant is alarming. Kanupp came into commercial operation in 1972 and has outlived its 30-year lifespan, but the PAEC – which is part of Pakistan's Ministry of Defence – has given it a 10-year extension and now intends to keep it going even longer with some repairs and replacements. \"The operators working there privately say that this reactor has gone beyond its life and they are afraid that something could go wrong,\" says Dr Pervez, who has visited Kanupp. \"The structure has been weakened by decades of radiation.\" He says that the plant is only superficially monitored by the International Atomic Energy Agency, who \"do not have the capacity to look at everything important in a reactor\". Kanupp is located next to the Arabian Sea and in the 1990s radioactive cooling water accidentally leaked from the plant, but officials played down the incident. The spent fuel is stored onsite and should an accident occur, the devastation would be very great. There are also several major faults around Karachi and the southern coast of the Makran, so earthquakes and tsunamis cannot be ruled out. In November 1945 there was a tsunami that hit the coast triggered by a magnitude 8.1 earthquake. Should an accident occur, the coastal winds could blow the radioactive plume over Karachi, which has grown to a population of nearly 15 million in the past 30 years and there are homes close to the reactor now. \"There is the absence of a safety culture. Then there is the incapability of the authorities to deal with anything of this magnitude,\" says Dr Pervez. The reactors in Chashma, though newer, are not any safer due to their location in a seismic zone. In fact, Prof Nayyar pointed out the dangers in a report he co-authored in 1999 for Princeton University's Centre for Energy and Environmental Studies (pdf). Chasnupp I and II are located on the banks of the Indus river, Pakistan's lifeline and a major source of fresh water for irrigation and domestic use. There are several safety concerns here about the design: Chasma I was built by the Chinese on their indigenous model which proved to be quite faulty as the original, Qinshan I, developed problems with its water flows. The reactor's nuclear vessel had to be fixed by engineers from US nuclear technology company Westinghouse after being contacted by the Chinese authorities. Pakistan buys its nuclear reactors from the Chinese, because no one else is willing to sell to them. As for the Chinese, they have no other market to sell their nuclear products to, as there are far more experienced producers around such as France. More importantly, according to Prof Nayyar: \"The region is earthquake-prone and in case of seismic activity, the soil can liquify and cause a landslide. What would happen to the reactor then?\" The Chasma reactors are built on sandy river shores and not on a solid rock base, as was the case with Fukushima. The PAEC claims that underneath the reactors are a five-metre reinforced concrete and cement base, which would protect reactors in case of an earthquake. But what about the water and electricity connections? They would be cut off if the base moves during seismic activity. \"We shared our concerns with the PAEC and in return they did some more seismological studies, and that's it,\" says Prof Nayyar. There is a regulating authority called the Pakistan Nuclear Regulatory Authority set up in 2005 by the government, but this is staffed by former PAEC officials. When contacted, the head of their information services directorate, Mohd Ali Awan, said: \"Although the plants are safe as per the regulatory requirements and international standards set by the IAEA, in the wake of the Fukushima accident, the PNRA has asked the PAEC to review safety and emergency plans.\" However, no deadline has been given to the PAEC. In the meantime, there is a plan by the Pakistani government to build even more nuclear reactors. According to Dr Pervez: \"It is hard to understand their continued enthusiasm to acquire more reactors. By 2030 they want 8000MW of power from nuclear energy, which is an absurd goal\". The government has neither the money nor the technical know-how to build two more reactors, but they are hoping once again the Chinese will help them out with credit and expertise. Pakistan's expensive nuclear toys might prove to be lethal but it seems they are to be bought at any cost."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/jul/06/japan-power-shortages-nuclear-shutdowns","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-07-06T08:48:31Z","webTitle":"Japan faces power shortages due to nuclear shutdowns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/06/japan-power-shortages-nuclear-shutdowns","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/jul/06/japan-power-shortages-nuclear-shutdowns","fields":{"headline":"Japan faces power shortages due to nuclear shutdowns","bodyText":"Japan is planning to conduct \"stress tests\" on all of its nuclear power plants to address safety fears and avoid possible power shortages when demand reaches peak levels later this summer. The shutdown of reactors following the 11 March accident at Fukushima Daiichi power plant, and delays in restarting others already undergoing regular maintenance checks mean that only 19 of Japan's 54 reactors are currently operating. The government has warned that unless more rectors are restarted the country could experience power shortages, but acknowledged it needs to demonstrate their ability to withstand earthquakes and tsunamis of the force that sparked the Fukushima crisis. Although safety checks are already being carried out on all of Japan's nuclear reactors, the government said the new round of testing would focus on their resilience to extreme and multiple disasters. The chief cabinet secretary, Yukio Edano, said the tests would be modelled on those under way at 143 reactors in the European Union, where member states have voiced concern over safety in light of the Fukushima accident. Edano said he hoped the tests would \"further boost assurances about [the safety of] nuclear power plants\". The economy, trade and industry minister, Banri Kaieda, said: \"There is no change in our view that [nuclear power] is safe. \"We are planning the stress tests to gain the understanding of local residents. We will get further confidence from the people and will restart operations at some plants.\" The tests would examine reactors' ability to withstand an unusually severe event similar to the magnitude-9 earthquake and 15-metre-high tsunami that knocked out back-up generators at Fukushima Daiichi, leading to core meltdowns in three reactors. Almost four months after the crisis began, teams of workers are still attempting to stabilise reactors and dispose of thousands of tonnes of radioactive water. Major users of power have been told they must cut peak power use by 15% from this month to avoid blackouts during the sweltering summer months – the first time such a measure has been introduced since the 1974 oil crisis. The prime minister, Naoto Kan, has ordered the closure of one particularly vulnerable power plant in central Japan and is hoping to push through legislation to promote renewable energy sources by the end of next month. But Japan is also the world's third biggest generator of nuclear power after the US and France, relying on it for 30% of its energy supply. A crucial test of whether public confidence in nuclear power has been even partly restored will come when Kyushu Electric Power seeks local approval to restart two reactors at its 36-year-old plant in Genkai in Saga prefecture, south-western Japan. The prefecture's governor, Yasushi Furukawa, said on Wednesday he would wait for the results of the tests before deciding whether or not to approve Kyushu Electric's request."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/may/17/green-news-roundup","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-05-17T11:25:09Z","webTitle":"Green news roundup: Aviation tax, Hinkley delay and green deal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/may/17/green-news-roundup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/may/17/green-news-roundup","fields":{"headline":"Green news roundup: Aviation tax, Hinkley delay and green deal","bodyText":"Environment news • Earth's environment getting worse, not better, says WWF ahead of Rio+20 • David Cameron briefed on concerns over green deal for homeowners • Geoengineering experiment cancelled due to perceived conflict of interest • UK carbon targets 'at risk over local authority funding cuts' • William Hague tells ministers to help green industries boost economy • EU hails airline emissions tax success • Hinkley nuclear power station delay deals blow to government hopes On the blogs • Eco Audit: Should a tidal barrage be built across the Severn estuary? • Luxembourg by e-bike: a natural high • Charles Rothschild's incredible legacy on the Wildlife Trust's 100th birthday • Lies, damn lies, and statistics about red light jumping Multimedia • The week in wildlife – in pictures • Birdwatching at Wormwood Scrubs - audio slideshow • American rivers under threat - interactive • WWF Living Planet Report: Monitoring Global Biodiversity Features and comment • UK families waste £270 a year on discarded food • Test your knowledge of urban wildlife – quiz • Ben Caldecott: Only biofuels will cut plane emissions • Caroline Spelman: Britain is rising to the challenge of greening our economy • North Dakota: riding the oil rush • North Dakota oil boom: thousands pin their dreams on striking it rich • The Figueres family led Costa Rica's revolution, and now its green revolution ...And finally • Australian project simulates effects of runaway climate change Multimillion-dollar study subjects bushland to heightened CO2 levels and altered rainfall patterns"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
